on august 26th, 2015,
        steve spatucci released breach point, a young adult book inspired
        by brigantine castle.  the book follows high school sophomore clara
        tuffney as she spends her summer with her aunt in breach point, new
        jersey to pursue an internship.  while there, she becomes
        interested in breach point castle, a haunted attraction that
        mysteriously burned down in the 1980s.  by chance, she meets a boy
        whos uncle used to work in the castle.  this encounter will lead
        her through a whirlwind of events that exposes the supernatural secrets of the
        defunct castle.  
although the book is
        geared toward young adults, people of all ages will enjoy its easy to
        read story filled with suspense and mystery.  fans of brigantine
        castle will also enjoy the similarities of the two haunts. 
        example: brigantine castle's owner was carmen ricci.  breach point
        castle's owner was carlo rizzieri.  the book also includes a ton of
        bonus material which describes the origins of the book, the writing
        process, and the inspirations for the places and characters.  
steve spatucci lives in
        cherry hill, new jersey and was intrigued by brigantine castle as a kid
        but never had the opportunity to go through the haunt before it
        closed.  he is now a writer,  designer, illustrator, animator,
        developer and musician.  he plans on releasing two sequels to breach
        point in the near future.
if you would like to
        purchase a print or electronic copy of breach point, search amazon
        or visit the book's official website: www.breachpointbook.com
 
      













relive the sights and sounds
        of west point park, a small defunct amusement park that was located in
        lansdale, pennsylvania.  the park was opened in 1868 by hezekiah
        zeiber, a civil war veteran.  the park remained in operation until
        1988, when it was sold to a developer and houses were built in its
        place.  this video was taken by me, bill cherkasky, and my father
        joseph during a work picnic on june 25, 1988.  although my family
        usually visited dorney park, i had the opportunity to visit west point
        park on several occasions before it closed.  my most vivid memories
        of the park were of the rickety jumper roller coaster.  it
        always looked and felt as if it were on the verge of falling
        apart.  during this visit to west point, i decided to walk around
        and document the park with the family camcorder.  little did i
        know, the park would close for good a few months after this footage was
        taken.  all that remains of the park today is the lake
        where the swing ride was located.

this is a
        current picture of the old west point park lake.  the house to the
        left owns the lake, the little island, and the bridge that connects to
        their back yard.  18 houses were built on the land that occupied
        the former amusement park.

seph cherkasky provides reviews
        of some well-known halloween attractions of the northeast.












december 15, 2013
david bone, a huge fan of
        horror attractions, recently released his first novel, styrofoam
        throne.  the book takes place in coastal california during the
        summer of 1984.  a 16-year-old boy named donovan, against his
        mother's wishes, manages to land his dream job working in a seaside
        haunted attraction called castle dunes.   at the castle,
        donovan finds love, mischief, and a sense of belonging that he had never
        before experienced.  the summer of '84 becomes one that donovan
        will never forget.
david bone was born in
        new jersey, but grew up in california.  he based his fictional
        castle dunes on brigantine castle,  but combined it with bits of
        other horror attractions across the country that he found interesting
        such as santa cruz boardwalk, skull kingdom in florida, knotts scary
        farm, and universal horror nights.  as you read the book, you will
        notice the many similarities to brigantine castle such as the fortune
        telling oracle, the creepy television commercials, and the dracula
        jumping onto the fireplace mantel scare.  
if you like horror,
        haunted attractions, or a good coming-of-age novel, then styrofoam
        throne is for you.  you can check out david
        bone's website for links on purchasing your own copy.
