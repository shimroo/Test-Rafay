raivaaja foundation, inc.

raivaaja is a
        not-for-profit publication owned by the finnish american
        community.   it strives to keep its
        readership informed in finnish and in english about happenings
        in finland and in finnish communities all over the world.  
        this kind of information is not usually found in the mainstream
        american press.  our raivaaja staff believes publishing to
        be the most important way to transmit knowledge
        of our ethnic history and culture from one generation to the
        next.  publishing is also the vital way to communicate
        current events and issues concerning the future of our finnish-
        american  cultural activities. raivaaja provides a forum
        for this dialog.
