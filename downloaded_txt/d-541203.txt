nomad is without doubt the best surf resort i have ever stayed at. the waves and food were insane and crowds not an issue.matt hoy (australian pro surfer)the nomad tropical hotel is one of the best resorts i’ve been to. it’s mellow fun and you can surf all day.. you have the left out front, yoyos down the road and super sucks close by… if you want to have a fun uncrowded surf trip with a variety of waves this is the place to go!john john florence (3x world champion)the place is rad, air sections and tacos!!!

dane reynolds (californian pro-surfer)since working together with nomad in this way, our business has increased dramatically and because we are now dealing with a higher level of the surf clientele, our revenue has  increased even more.trevor white - owner nomad tropical resortnomad is truly a pleasure to work with.  they are caring and considerate and always ready with advice and encouragement.  we would strongly recommend anyone working in the “surf” market place to consider working under this franchise arrangement with nomad.yuni white - owner nomad tropical resort
