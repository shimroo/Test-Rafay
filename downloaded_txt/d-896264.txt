question that isn't covered in this section please contact us.how can i get a  discount on airport parking?we love getting a good deal, so why would your parking at the airport be any different? the simple answer is to use a price comparison site like ours. we only compare prices of car parks and hotels that have been vetted by our team so you can rest assured that your car will be well looked after. we enable you to book with these car parks securely, in the knowledge that we are looking after your payment and personal details.are you allowed to park for free near an airport?the short answer is yes. we offer many car parks near to airports. these are called on airport car parks because they are located usually within an airport’s perimeter e.g. the land immediately around an airport and owned by the airport. however, you may be looking for free on street parking near an airport. this is very difficult to achieve as any land is used for paid car parking and also not recommended as local people react badly to motorists parking in their streets.what does non flexible parking mean?non-flexible parking means you can’t change your booking after making it. some car parks offer a lower price for these types of booking as they won’t incur extra costs dealing with amendments.can i arrive early at the car park?you can arrive early at the car park except when pre-booked with valet or meet and greet parking. if you plan to arrive one hour or more early then charges may apply.can i park with a roof box on my car?there are no restrictions on roof boxes. only height restrictions. check details when booking.what is meant by long term parking?long term parking is usually 24 hours plus but some airports differ in their definition. typically, a long stay will be for a week or two weeks but can be for as little as 24-48 hours.what do you mean by availability?parking spaces and rooms are limited in certain circumstances. try searching for another product or date. sometimes we aren’t able to load availability for future dates so please check again at a later date.do you have advice for travellers with a disability?we have information for blue badge holders on each of our car parks but to give advice on the wider area we’ve created - the full guide to flying with a disability.is it cheaper to book parking in advance?it is nearly always cheaper to book in advance. in some cases you can save up to 60% on the published gate price or turn up rate.how long can you park for at a short stay car park?short stay parking is best for people dropping off or collecting people at the airport. the hourly cost can be quite high, so often it works out cheaper to pay for long-stay parking. however, short-stay parking is more convenient as the car parks are situated close to the airport terminals and usually only walking distance away.where do you park when booking an airport hotel with parking?it depends on where the hotel has arranged the parking. sometimes they have plenty of spaces on site but the closed the hotel is to the terminal they are more likely to provide parking in one of the airport car parks. find out more about our airport hotels with parking.are airport car parks safe?most of the car parks we offer have park mark awards. it is a police crime prevention initiative to promote safety in car parks from both crime and fear of crime in car parks. operators are assessed to ensure they are properly maintained and managed.although our car parks make every effort to be safe places to leave your car, you should also make sure you don’t leave valuables visible to avoid temptation for criminals. take any personal possessions with you or if you can’t and your car has a boot then lock valuables away there.for your personal safety, the meet and greet option is best as you’ll be met by a driver and then have a very short walk to the terminal.what is valet parking?you might have seen this type of parking in films when a customer's car is driven off by the hotel staff. it is the same principle with parking and is often called meet and greet parking. a driver from the valet parking company meets you at the airport, fills out some paperwork and then parks your car for you usually at an off airport secure compound.can i cancel my booking due to covid?you cancel or amend any of our products up to the time you have booked to arrive and get a full refund. you can get a cash refund if you choose a flextras free cancellation product or a voucher with a flextras saver product. when you get a quote you'll see the
