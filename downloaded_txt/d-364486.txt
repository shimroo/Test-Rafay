celebrate city living 




 



 



 

rochester, nynestled between lake ontario and the finger lakes region in upstate new york, rochester is a well-kept secret. visitors tell us we have the architecture, diversity, education, arts and culture, nightlife, restaurants, recreation and sports of a much larger city, but the easiness, affordability, accessibility, community and hospitality of a small town. we think you’ll be pleasantly surprised by the richness of life in rochester.
