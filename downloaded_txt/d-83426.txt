kmsha/twhbea horses

​we believe in 
								  producing "working family horses." we 
								  carefully select crosses to produce an 
								  intelligent, smooth gaited, athletic, 
								  surefooted mount with a good disposition and 
								  desire to learn. they can excel at a variety 
								  of tasks from the show ring to the trail.





 

pasture 
							  board

horses are naturally active, social 
								  animals. by allowing our horses to live in the 
								  most natural environment possible, we reduce 
								  nervous behaviors (cribbing, weaving), 
								  alleviate excess energy, and improve their 
								  mental, physical and emotional heath.
