  burlington coat factory has tons of customer & employee complaints,  reviews: mostly discrimination against men. overpriced clothing, damaged/worn  out shoes & false accusations against good customers who return or lay away  merchandise! ... (64, 000 complaints & lawsuits) racism in hiring/firing  processes at burlington coat factory...this place is horrible. the coats are no  at great prices, this dept. store is overpriced! the staff and managers, often  mistreat & are rude to their customers, and customers are forced to wait in  line for hours!!!
using profanity and being rude to me as a customer, and  firing black male employees for no reason, they often use racial slurs, and  false accusations against customers returning merchandise. migel & barren  are the worst managers, i have ever known, allowing female employees to steal,  leave work early, and fight at the store, instead of firing these women, they  harrass and wrongfully mistreat their best male employees &  customers!!
