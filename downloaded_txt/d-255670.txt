reviews
our guests are like family! thank you for your kind words!





we needed a place close to miller ferry line so we could get over to put in bay and not too far
                        from cedar point. our room was clean. walked around the grounds (we stayed in the hotel part but
                        there are cottages around the property too). the pools were clean. the kids played on the
                        playground and pirate ship. gorgeous view on the lake. they had a bonfire at night and a few of
                        us resort guests sat around chatting until midnight.

                        definitely be back!!! as for the room we had queen with no view on the 2 floor happy with the
                        room wish we would of booked the room with view of the water but still very happy.





ktregenza - tripadvisor













if you want a little slice of heaven, this is the place you need to go! perfect for a family
                        weekend getaway or a week vacation! the hotel rooms are very clean and well kept, the cottages
                        are super cozy and the lake access is amazing! 2 pools, a kids swimming area, and a nice hot tub
                        by the lake is a neat feature. we absolutely will be staying here every time we come to sandusky
                        from now on.

our trip to south beach resort was so relaxing. the rooms were immaculate. the staff were very
                        nice and assisted us with local area activities. we enjoyed the pools, the whirlpool and the
                        jacuzzi in our room. i look forward to visiting again! carla bohannon
