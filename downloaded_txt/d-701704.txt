“if country music’s original outlaws had made their break with nashville in the post-punk era, it might have sounded a lot like this.” –no depression
“…the sort of music that makes one release the demons, both good and bad, and rejoice in the redemptive powers of maximum (country) rock and roll. rating 10/10. essential.” –nine bullets
“…practically everyone who’s listened to the band’s cheese-free, slightly punkified hillbilly jangle thinks it’s the greatest.” —san francisco weekly
“… one of rock’s best-kept secrets.” -national review
“the famous successfully combine the transcendent roar of punk with the brutal honesty and black wit of traditional country on light, sweet crude” —trouser press
