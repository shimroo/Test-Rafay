about us

 











artistled, an independent recording company established by cellist david finckel and pianist wu han in 1997, is an enterprise which evolved out of the desire of two musicians to produce recordings in an environment free from constraints: artistic, commercial, technical and procedural. artistled is not as much a company as a means for musicians to record what they want the way they want, and to offer their records directly to the public. the musicians are controlling participants in every aspect of the recording process, from selecting the repertoire and recording venue to setting the sound, running the sessions, constructing the edits, and determining the final mix. the result is a performance which combines the excitement and spontaneity of a live concert with the sonic and musical perfection expected of a studio recording. to date, artistled has released twenty three recordings, all to critical acclaim. to learn more about david finckel and wu han, visit davidfinckelandwuhan.com

                     these are superb performances, impeccably recorded and excellently packaged.

“
                     listening to these recordings - and this feeling is reinforced by hearing finckel and wu han in person - one is aware of musical collaboration as a sensual appetite, a triangle of composer and performers in passionate embrace.

“
                     i do know fresh, wonderful, and very well recorded musical performances when i hear them, which is what we invariably get from artistled.
their catalogue... by pianist wu han, cellist david finckel, and recording engineer da-hong seetoo, is an absolute jewel of a music recording enterprise.

“
                    starting artistled on our own was the combination of looking for artistic freedom, and wanting a direct communication with the audience, and the timing of the internet. it felt right for the product, it felt right for the artistic freedom, it felt right for the marketing, it was a way of breaking free from the whole system.
                   ”
