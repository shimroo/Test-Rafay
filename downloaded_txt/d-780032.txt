oops, catch up part 3



there shouldn't really be catch up part 3, because i was going to post more often but clearly that hasn't happened so think a catch up is required.so first off we have tree jackettree jacket is a pattern from zephyr style and is a top down construction so no sewing up, hurray. the yarn is king cole merino blend dk in french navy from texerenext up is baby cables and big ones toobaby cables and big ones too is also a top down jumper, do you see a theme appearing. as you can see it's a bit tight because my tension was a bit off, but that's nothing new, i really should pay more "attension". do you get it, attension instead of attention, i really need to get out more!pattern available as ravelry download. if you are signed into ravelry click the link and it should take you straight to the pattern instead of the front page.then we have official kittyville hati made 2 of these hat's at the request of my sister as xmas presents for her friend's faye & jonathan. she wanted the kitty ears but not the ear flaps. the pattern is from stitch 'n bitch handbook the yarn is texere airedale aran from texere. that will do for now.

catch up - part 2



1. brea bagi wanted to make the bag bigger so i used larger needles than stated in the pattern, it didn't really work out well. it's now too stretchy.2. the gabumade for my sister using rowan cotton glace.3. leyburn socksmade for my sister, i can't find the ball band so i can't tell you what yarn i used.4. green gable made using some ggh scarlett that i had in my stash.that's it, you are now up to date with all the things i've finished over the last 6 month's. if you want a bit more info about the thing's i've made, and you are on ravelry, have a look on my ravelry projects.

not slipping back into old haddits *update*



i received my ravelry invitation on monday so i have been trying to get to grips with that.  unfortunately i miss spelt my username, hitting t instead of y so instead of being knittyknackynoo i'm down as knittyknacktnoo, rubbish! but if you go onto the people page and type in knittyknackynoo you can still find me. so if you are on ravelry come say hello.ignore that last bit. the lovely people at ravelry have corrected my miss spelt username for me.

finished backyard leaves scarf.



pattern backyard leaves, scarf style.yarn sirdar snuggly baby bamboo dk, colour #136 - tulip.needles 4.5mm.finished measurements 12cm wide, 200cm long.with hindsight i should have ether cast on more loosely than i did or used a cast on method that had more stretch to it, because after each half had been pressed, the cast on row was narrower then the rest of the scarf, so i had to improvise slightly when i was sewing the two pieces together.it took a while to get off the ground but after i'd translated the pattern chart into text i found it much easier to understand.

not another bag!



that's what my mum said when i told her of my plan to make brea bag from berroco.i found the pattern ages ago, but never got around to looking for an alternative yarn, berroco yarn isn't available in the uk. the yarn i'm using is some cheap and cheerful acrylic dk from my local market. i've done one side already. it knits up really quickly, because you decrease eight times every other row. here is a picture of the first side of the bag, though i think in this photo it looks a pair of big knickers. i decided to knit the bags gusset next after reading on a forum that someone found it really tedious to knit, because it's just moss stitch. i'm over half way along, she's right it is tedious, but the good thing about it is that you don't have to concentrate very much. i've also finished the first half of backyard leaves scarf from scarf style and am half way down the other side. the colour of the yarn is actually paler than it looks in this photo. perfect timing finishing this post, have just enough time to go to the loo, get a drink and some biscuits and get parked in front of the tv in time for jericho.
