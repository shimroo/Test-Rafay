stephen thee • bethany a/g • agawam, ma

as a pastor, i'm always concerned to partner with ministries that are filled with passion but which don't compromise faithfulness to god's word. greg and robyn are exemplary in this way. their passion for christ and for souls is more than hype, their authenticity in ministry is obvious to everyone they encounter, and their commitment to scripture is unwavering. i recommend their ministry without reservation and believe they will be a blessing to your people. 







eric danner • refuge church • mobile, al

every time we have brought bro greg to minister to our church he has brought an on-time, relevant, and anointed word. his unique style helps blend all generations to hear from the lord. i believe that god has raised up the voice of greg hubbard for such a time as this.







ron squibb • icc • staten island, ny 

i highly recommend the ministry of evangelist greg and robyn hubbard.  i have known them for 40 years, and have them yearly in every church that i have been the pastor.  robyn's anointed singing blesses and encourages people.  greg is a passionate preacher of the word of god, the power of the holy spirit, and bringing people into a relationship with jesus christ.  they are great friends and recommend them to you!







shem misi • mabvuku missions center • zimbabwe 

i am very happy to write this letter of recommendation for evangelist greg hubbard and his wife, robyn. i met evangelist greg hubbard for the first time in 2001 when he visited zimbabwe.evangelist greg hubbard has evidenced great passion to see people saved, revived and filled in the holy spirit. i have worked with him over the years in youth ministry, schools ministry, humanitarian work, crusades and church planting and witnessed his genuine heart for god and people.greg and robyn’s ministry is a blessing to people of all age groups. they have over the years proven to be honorable and to be people of integrity whom i will not hesitate to recommend to anyone.







scott kramer • gt church • west lawn, pa 

greg & robyn hubbard with times of refreshing ministry have been a huge blessing to our church for over two decades.  greg brings incredible passion, authenticity and urgency to his gospel preaching, and we have seen years of consistent fruit in our church as a result of his ministry.  he has also led an evangelism training that was a huge blessing by equipping our people to learn how to share their faith with greater confidence and effectiveness.in addition to their public ministry, greg & robyn are two of the most sincerely kind and encouraging humans you’ll ever meet.  their love for christ is contagious.  i recommend greg & robyn with high confidence and expectation for your church or ministry.







trent morgan • the assembly • sebring, fl 

the only good thing that comes from you not scheduling greg and robyn hubbard is that it’s an extra week we can have them! there aren’t many like evangelist greg and robyn hubbard! they have poured into the life of assembly church many times. we have always found the presence of the lord to be strong, and lives changed. if you’re only looking for a series of meetings, they may not be for you. but if you long for an outpouring of god’s spirit, if your heart is crying for an evangelist with a fresh word and one who understands how to pray with people at an altar, then your church needs the ministry of greg and robyn, now!







rev. paul thangiah • a/g general supt for all of india 

rev. greg hubbard and his wife are highly anointed servants of god. when he visited our church in bangalore, india, the lord used them in a mighty powerful way. he is a full pledged evangelist and carries a mighty anointing over his life. his wife ministered so powerfully through songs which resulted in many coming to the altar with tears. i'm so proud to know them and i wish them all the best in the future of their ministry. 







john james • senior pastor • bethany church

it is my great privilege to recommend greg hubbard for ministry!  greg models the heart of jesus through servant leadership attitude.  he also carries a strong anointing for preaching.  whenever greg preaches many people come to the lord and many are filled with the holy spirit.greg leads with a heart for people, under the power of the holy spirit, and lives with purpose for the kingdom of god.
