welcome home




























we welcome you as our guests at colonial capital bed & breakfast, a prominent colonial revival inn (c. 1926) in the heart of the architectural preservation district. let this be your home in williamsburg while you fill your days experiencing our three outdoor living museums: colonial williamsburg, jamestown and yorktown; and while enjoying the thrills and spills found at busch gardens and water country usa. all are just minutes from your williamsburg accommodations. antique furnishings and oriental rugs throughout the house create a rich blend of warmth, style and comfort. our classic farmhouse parlor offers a perfect setting for relaxing conversations with friends, new and old.  on cold winter evenings the parlor’s wood burning fireplace blazes, while in the heat of the summer our inn is air conditioned for your comfort. the screened side porch, patio and deck provide out-of-doors pleasures. we look forward to your arrival!
