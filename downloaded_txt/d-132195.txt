what are the benefits of ashwagandha ?





ashwagandha, also known as indian ginseng, is an adaptogen herb that has been used in ayurvedic medicine for centuries. in recent years, scientific research has also shown its effectiveness in reducing stress and anxiety, improving cognitive function, and increasing endurance and muscle strength. as an army officer, i have found ashwagandha to be a valuable addition to my supplement routine.one of the biggest benefits of ashwagandha for army officers is its ability to reduce stress and anxiety. the demanding nature of military life can take a toll on mental health, and ashwagandha can help mitigate these effects. it has been found to lower cortisol levels, a hormone associated with stress, and improve overall mood. in a study conducted on 64 people with a history of chronic stress, those who took ashwagandha supplements had a significant reduction in cortisol levels compared to the placebo group.another study conducted on 75 people with moderate to severe anxiety found that those who took ashwagandha had a significant reduction in anxiety symptoms compared to the placebo group. these studies suggest that ashwagandha can be an effective natural remedy for managing stress and anxiety, which is especially important for army officers who are regularly exposed to high-stress environments.in addition to reducing stress, ashwagandha can also improve cognitive function. it has been shown to improve memory and reaction time, which are important for decision-making in high-pressure situations. a study conducted on 50 healthy adults found that those who took ashwagandha had a significant improvement in working memory and reaction time compared to the placebo group. this can be especially beneficial for officers in leadership roles who need to make quick and accurate decisions.ashwagandha can also improve physical performance. it has been found to increase muscle strength and endurance, making it a great supplement for soldiers who need to maintain peak physical condition. a study conducted on 57 healthy adults found that those who took ashwagandha had a significant increase in muscle strength and endurance compared to the placebo group. another study conducted on 57 healthy men found that those who took ashwagandha had a significant increase in muscle mass and a decrease in body fat compared to the placebo group. these studies suggest that ashwagandha can be an effective natural supplement for improving physical performance, which is especially important for army officers who are required to maintain peak physical condition.ashwagandha can also have a positive impact on cardiovascular health. it has been found to lower blood pressure, reduce cholesterol levels and improve overall heart health. a study conducted on 50 patients with hypertension found that those who took ashwagandha had a significant reduction in blood pressure compared to the placebo group. another study conducted on 50 patients with high cholesterol found that those who took ashwagandha had a significant reduction in cholesterol levels compared to the placebo group. this suggests that ashwagandha can be beneficial for army officers who are at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease.in conclusion, ashwagandha is a powerful adaptogen herb that has many benefits for army officers. its ability to reduce stress, improve cognitive function, increase muscle strength and endurance, and improve cardiovascular health make it a valuable addition to any military member's supplement routine. it is important to note that ashwagandha may interact with other medications, and it is always best to consult with a healthcare professional before taking any supplement. here is the number 1 best selling ashwagandha supplement : https://amzn.to/3j6k9al

is intermittent fasting for you?





as an army officer, i understand the importance of maintaining a healthy and fit body to perform my duties effectively. one of the ways i do this is through intermittent fasting, a method of eating that involves alternating periods of eating and fasting. while there are many benefits to intermittent fasting, it is important to also consider the potential dangers and whether it is appropriate for everyone.one of the main benefits of intermittent fasting is weight loss. by limiting the amount of time that you are able to eat, you are naturally reducing the number of calories consumed. this can lead to weight loss, which is important for maintaining a healthy body weight and reducing the risk of obesity-related diseases. additionally, intermittent fasting has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and decrease inflammation, which can lead to a reduction in the risk of diabetes and heart disease.another benefit of intermittent fasting is an increase in mental clarity and focus. when we fast, our bodies are able to enter a state of ketosis, where we start burning stored fat for energy instead of carbohydrates. this can lead to an increase in energy levels and mental clarity, making it easier to focus on important tasks. additionally, intermittent fasting has been shown to increase the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a protein that is essential for the growth and survival of nerve cells in the brain.intermittent fasting also has anti-aging benefits. fasting can lead to an increase in autophagy, a process where cells break down and recycle damaged proteins and organelles. this can help to prevent the accumulation of damaged cells, which can lead to aging and diseases such as cancer. additionally, fasting has been shown to increase the production of sirtuins, a group of enzymes that have been linked to longevity and the prevention of age-related diseases.however, while there are many benefits to intermittent fasting, there are also potential dangers to consider. one of the main dangers is the risk of nutrient deficiencies. when we fast, we are not consuming any food, which means that we are not getting any of the essential nutrients that our body needs to function properly. this can lead to nutrient deficiencies, which can have a negative impact on our overall health.another danger of intermittent fasting is the risk of overeating. when we are in a state of hunger, it can be easy to overeat when we finally do have the opportunity to eat. this can lead to weight gain and an increase in the risk of obesity-related diseases. additionally, overeating can disrupt the natural hunger and fullness cues that our body uses to regulate food intake, which can lead to disordered eating patterns.intermittent fasting may not be appropriate for everyone. individuals who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or underweight should not engage in intermittent fasting as it may not provide enough nutrition for them. additionally, people with certain medical conditions such as diabetes, anemia or eating disorders should consult with their doctor before starting intermittent fasting.in conclusion, as an army officer, i understand the importance of maintaining a healthy and fit body to perform my duties effectively. one of the ways i do this is through intermittent fasting. while there are many benefits to intermittent fasting, such as weight loss, mental clarity, and anti-aging benefits, it is important to also consider the potential dangers and whether it is appropriate for everyone. if you are considering intermittent fasting, it is important to consult with your doctor first to ensure that it is safe for you.if you want to be well read and truly understand the topic of fasting i highly recommend this book: https://amzn.to/3j6jwns

judge orders accused texas base gunman to shave or be shaved - yahoo! news





judge orders accused texas base gunman to shave or be shaved - yahoo! news

this bothers me to no end. i haven't been on here in a while, but this article had me fuming so i decided to get back in to the swing of writing posts again.

first of all, this monster is simply using the beard issue as a delay tactic. the army has a strict grooming standard that can be enforced by the ucmj. use it and don't look back. the beard issue is getting in the way of of bringing this idiot to trial.

second of all, get him in front of a military tribunal swiftly and begin the proceedings now. this man is living on borrowed time and the horror of the act that he committed is tragically relived by 13 families on a daily basis.

the very idea that someone in the medical community, and that too someone that people were supposed to turn to for help, would commit such an atrocity is vile and disgusting.

as a retired us army officer of ethnic background, who is the son of a retired us naval officer, who both served with distinction, we feel that this sorry excuse for a human being be brought to justice, but do so swiftly. i am not of the same faith and religion that this man supposedly belonged to, but if i was, i would be deeply embarrassed for my people and faith, and call upon those who are, to loudly and quite vocally press for justice in this matter.

spectator throws hot dog at tiger woods (actual video)







national hot dog and sausage council calls tiger woods hot dog incident reprehensible and a violation of hot dog etiquette

monday, october 10, 2011


washington, d.c. the national hot dog and sausage council today declared an act of violence against tiger woods that involved a hot dog reprehensible.

the use of an iconic food in an act of violence against an iconic golfer like tiger woods is reprehensible -- and a violation of hot dog etiquette. "some might call the thrower a wiener,but we'd say that's too high a compliment,"said council president janet riley . hot dogs are meant to be enjoyed not weaponized.

7-eleven toasts 84 years of convenience with 5 million free slurpee drinks








dallas, july 8, 2011 /prnewswire-usnewswire/ -- they have become summer traditions -- fireworks on the fourth, baseball games, hot dog-eating contests and free slurpee® drinks at 7-eleven® stores on july 11, 7-eleven day.

7-eleven, inc., the company that invented convenience retailing 84 years ago in dallas, texas, invites customers to celebrate its birthday this coming monday with a free 7.11-ounce frozen slurpee drink. participating 7-eleven stores across the u.s. and canada will serve up 5 million free 7.11-ounce slurpee frozen carbonated beverages this day while supplies last.

in boston, the dorchester 7-eleven store (730 morrissey blvd.) will be hosting a slurpee-bration from 8-10 a.m. featuring music, free slurpees, and one-minute challenges for larger prizes, including a $100 convenience card and a chance to win one national prize: a house party for a slurpee fan and their friends.

"7-eleven day and giving away free slurpee beverages is our way of thanking customers for their patronage throughout the year and showing appreciation for their support," said jesus delgado-jenkins, 7-eleven's senior vice president of merchandising, marketing and logistics. "five million is the most slurpee drinks we've ever given away in a day; just two years ago, we handed out 3 million," he added.

"7-eleven day is synonymous with free slurpee day, because of how popular the slurpee giveaway has become. we've been serving free slurpees on july 11 since our 75th birthday in 2002, and it continues to be a hit with customers. even without the 5 million free slurpee drinks, july is the biggest month of the year for slurpee sales."

july 11 marks the day that the world's no. 1 convenience retailer observes its birthday and other company milestones. 7-eleven, the world's first convenience store, began its run in 1927 when a southland ice company employee started selling bread, milk and eggs on an ice dock in a dallas suburb. since that inauspicious start, "convenience" has become big business. the small ice company has grown into a major international retailing chain with 8,600 7-eleven stores in north america and approximately 41,500 stores worldwide.

about 7-eleven, inc.
7-eleven, inc. is the premier name and largest chain in the convenience retailing industry. based in dallas, texas, 7-eleven operates, franchises or licenses more than 8,600 7-eleven® stores in north america. globally, there are approximately 41,400 7-eleven stores in 16 countries. during 2010, 7-eleven stores worldwide generated total sales close to $63 billion. 7-eleven has been honored by a number of companies and organizations recently. accolades include: #2 on forbes magazine's 2011 list of top franchises for the money; #4 spot on entrepreneur magazine's franchise 500 list for 2009, #3 in forbes magazine's top 20 franchises to start, and #2 in franchise times top 200 franchise companies. hispanic magazine named 7-eleven in its hispanic corporate top 100 companies that provide the most opportunities to hispanics. 7-eleven received the 2010 retailer of the year honor from pl buyer because of the company's private-label brand initiative. 7-eleven is franchising its stores in the u.s. and expanding through organic growth, acquisitions and its business conversion program. find out more online at www.7-eleven.com.

my review of: spiderman turn off the dark











so a couple of days ago i get an email from iava informing me that i was to be the recipient of two tickets to spiderman turn off the dark as part of their partnership with miller brewing.

i was ecstatic that i could go and take my son to go see this broadway play. we had heard the unflattering reviews and jokes about it on the morning radio, but nevertheless i wanted to see what a 70 million dollar production might have to offer.



we got there about an hour beforehand to collect our tickets at will call. we got our tickets and then took a quick walking tour of the area. we returned, only to find out that for some reason our two seats in the orchestra area were not seated together. i checked back with the box office and at first they kinda shrugged their shoulders but then after a quick huddle they reissued two tickets that happened to be balcony box seats. my son was excited because he perceived them to be an upgrade, but in reality these seats are essentially obstructed view seats, however i was, not for a second, going to be ungrateful for seats given to me by iava.

we got to the seats and began to watch the show. i'm not sure if the critics were wrong, or if the critics were initially right and the show adjusted things based on the initial critics hammering the show, but i gotta say the show was absolutely fantastic.

between the spectacle of the sets, the amazing aerial acrobatics, and the awesome musical score by bono and the edge, this show rocked! now at one point the aerial system did shut down to protect the performers but the audience was more than willing to wait while the systems reset themselves, and was even entertained by an ad-libbing spiderman as he broke out into a tap dance routine. it to me, actually validated that the performance was very real and could even be dangerous.

spiderman turn off the dark, is actually a live 3d show. the memories that i have from today's performance will last a lifetime, and now has me feeling guilty that my wife and daughter didn't get to see it (yet). this time we'll return with them and definitely choose orchestra seating.

for those that go expecting a great work of literary art adapted for broadway, please save your money. it's based off a comic book for god's sake! but for a great adaptation of a beloved comic book character in a play that pushes the boundaries of spectacle, then surrender your plastic at the door, i believe you will see something you haven't seen before in theatrical history.

the tweet that tried to cover it all up (so to speak).





since he frantically couldn't find the "unsend" button, he began to claim his account was hacked. ironically if he had just owned up to the pics he might still have had a chance of staying in office. it's the fabricated hacking story that probably did him in.

the return of urban blight?












no, i’m not referring to the term about urban decay, i’m referring to the band.so a couple of weeks ago, i'm scanning my facebook news feed and i see this:

seeing this admittedly evoked an emotional response in me. i was introduced to this band up in college, when a girl who had graduated from bronx science ( my high school rival) mentioned that there was a band coming up from nyc to play, and a lot of the members were from my high school alma mater stuyvesant high. apparently they had graduated about 5 years before me so i wasn’t very familiar with them. so in 1986 we made the trek to a downtown hotspot called hunts in burlington vermont. i was not disappointed.what i heard that night was a combination of the english beat, mixed in with some bob marley, mixed in with a dash of run dmc. their tunes were catchy, the music was phenomenal, and  it was a night i never forgot.through the years, the band got pretty popular amongst the college circuit, and the nyc music scene. they returned to our university several times and i never missed an opportunity to catch them.  i got to hang out with them a few times after they played, and we shared conversation mostly about stuy and the teachers we knew. when i started to dj parties for a little extra cash with a good friend of mine, we always played a bit of their tuneage as well.i caught them a couple of times after college graduation when they played in various nyc hotspots.these guys were good, and i knew they would make it big. sadly, and i’ve never really known why, i was mistaken. ub faded from the music scene, and i believe in 1998 the band went their separate ways.fast forward to the year 2010 and i found a box of cassette tapes in my house. in it, was a bootleg tape that i had recorded from that very first encounter with them in 1986 up in burlington vt. i wondered how it would sound, i went down to the basement dusted off a boombox, and brought it up to the kitchen. i placed the tape in and hit play, and instantly i was transported to a time where i was 24 years younger. the tape sounded great and soon my 13 year old and 7 year old, saw their old man bopping around the kitchen listening to the awesome sounds of urban blight. my kids like their vibe as well.did i mention these guys were good?later that evening,while surfing the net, i found them on youtube. apparently they had a reunion where the played for the night in the canal room in nyc. i was bummed that i had missed it, but real happy to see them jamming like they used to. my son who is a musician (keyboards and bass) and has an old soul when it comes to music immediately said,  “these guy’s are good”. he chuckled at some of their choreography as band, which was always visually catchy.so that was about a year ago... and then i saw the facebook post. wow. i didn’t wait, i called right away bought my ticket (i was going with, or without anyone), and then i rsvp’d on the post itself. i shared the invitation with others.i shared with those that i remember to be big ub fans as well...and then it began to happen again, not sure why but i couldn’t get any traction in trying to get a bunch of fans together for what could be a chance to see a band that we had seen 25 years ago. i didn’t care, i was going. i ended up roping my best friend along (the same guy that dj’d with me back in school).the show was a benefit for a children’s art museum, and was going to be on from 6-9 pm. i had every reason, after camping with my son’s scout troop in rainy and muddy conditions on friday into sat, and then going to see a beatles revival concert on saturday night, to call it quits as i was a wee bit tired, but i wasn’t going to miss this.my buddy and i first shared shared some great ethnic middle eastern food at mamouns, and then headed in .we got to webster hall around 6:45 ish and i thought perhaps we had missed some of their opening songs, but i was happy to be wrong. there were a two other bands that would play before ub would take the stage.i did a quick recon of the surroundings and noticed that there was a balcony level with a much better vantage point of the stage, so we made our way to the top level only to realize that we had some how inadvertently gained entry to the vip level. security just assumed that if we were up there , we should be there and actually ushered us into our primo viewing area. well, who were we to argue with anyone right? we settled in with a couple of corona’s and awaited ub.my buddy and i looked at the program and noticed that the band opening for urban blight would be john oliver. i had never heard of them, but soon came to realize it wasn't the john oliver band, it was john oliver, the british comic from the daily show. well, he came on and delivered his set. the crowd was receptive but a bit small, and still had some kids present from earlier benefit activities , so john couldn't deliver any racy stuff. one joke though stood out in his gig. it was a joke about how nowadays, during live performances , people will stand there and film an event on their camera phones, as opposed to enjoying it in real life, right then and there. i thought about it , chuckled to myself on how true that was...and then realized that was what i was about to do myself. i figured if i could keep urban blight alive for me, in the form of cassette tape, twenty five years later, i could do the same with the high definition camera built into my phone, with perhaps better results...and thus the idea of this article was born. i would film ub on stage and then place it up on the net for others to enjoy with my secret intent that perhaps it might spark a bit of a ub revival.when urban blight took the stage i really just wanted to go downstairs and bounce around a bit, but i noticed no videographers present, so i almost felt compelled to take video of the event. after all, we somehow had stumbled upon the expensive seats, so mine as well put them to good use.i have to admit, i was wondering after 25 years would these guys still have it? could they deliver the same music, could they  bounce around on stage like they used to? and the answer to that question was simply, "yes".urban blight came out and did their thing, and it was like they had never left. in fact they almost seemed better.what follows is the video footage that i took last night. i'm hoping the band doesn't have an issue with me posting them up...but as a true fan, i'm hoping that in some way this helps in the return of urban blight, and this time i'm hoping they do make it big. did i mention these guys are good? -agk

here are videos of the concert. for the best viewing effect go to full screen for each video by clicking on the full screen icon in the bottom right hand corner of each screen.


 i hope you enjoy the videos as much as i enjoyed urban blight's latest concert. please tell your fellow ub fans about this page and perhaps their latest concert won't be their last.

niacin






niacin is used with diet changes (restriction of cholesterol and fat intake) to reduce the amount of cholesterol and certain fatty substances in your blood. niacin is also used to prevent and treat pellagra (niacin deficiency), a disease caused by inadequate diet and other medical problems. niacin is a b-complex vitamin.

i've recently started taking niacin as an over the counter on the advice of a physician who happens to be a family member. your results may vary so make sure you check with your physician.

the medifast plan – does medifast work?
by jenni kerala

if you’ve been thinking about using medifast for your diet, you probably have one very important question: does medifast work?

i can tell you that it does work, but since i’m pretty sure you want to hear more than that, let’s take a look at the medifast diet plan and hopefully i can answer not only the question, “does medifast work?” but also, “why” it works.

what is the medifast plan?

medifast is essentially a very low calorie meal replacement program. the medifast foods come in the form of shakes, bars, soups and other items and they are the mainstay of the program. the meal replacement items are designed to meet all of your nutritional requirements.

in addition to the packaged foods, you’ll also eat one lean & green meal that you prepare for yourself each day, made up for protein and vegetables; for example, roast chicken and big salad.

why does medifast work?

i think one of the big reasons that medifast works is that in addition to the program being quite low calorie (around 1000 calories a day), it also tends to be low carb as well. by eliminating many of the carbs we usually eat, medifast helps reduce the constant cravings for more food. most medifast dieters find that after the first 3-4 days, they no longer feel hungry all the time so the temptation to cheat isn’t always getting in the way.

the other reason that i think the program works is that it eliminates a lot of the mealtime planning. in all likelihood, you could probably loose a similar amount of weight following a plan like atkins or the south beach diet, but both of those diet plans will involve a lot more time dedicated to planning your meals, and thus, thinking about food constantly. but with medifast, you only really have to think about one meal per day.

eventually you’ll have to start thinking about food again someday — when you’ve lost your weight and need to plan how you’re going to keep that weight gone. but i think there’s a lot to be said for not having to worry so much about every meal while you are actively dieting. it can help break that cycle, particularly if you get a bit obsessive about food.

so i think if you’re looking for a solid diet plan, especially if you have a significant amount of weight to lose, then medifast is worthy of your consideration. medifast does work, especially if you follow the plan. and with the variety of foods that they offer, it’s really not a difficult plan to follow either.

if you’d like a rundown of some of my favorite medifast foods, for tips on what to order and what to avoid, then check out my review of all the different medifast foods before placing your first order.

why we love apple tv





why we love apple tv:








the sleek new apple tv is small in size but big on entertainment. rent from the largest selection of hd movies or rent tv shows in hd, commercial free. stream directly from the huge catalog of netflix titles. watch your favorite youtube videos. and enjoy music and photos from your home computer on your home theater system. all you need is a single hdmi cable to set it up.

with the apple tv, you can rent thousands of commercial free, high-definition tv episodes for just 99¢ per episode. once you rent an episode, you have 30 days to press play, then it's yours for the next 48 hours. you can also rent over 7,000 movies with over 3,400 available in hd--and most new releases are available the same day they're released on dvd. the apple tv also connects to your home computer (either mac or windows pc), and you'll be able to stream all your purchased music, tv shows, movies as well as podcasts and photo slideshows from your computer directly to your hdtv via the apple tv.

featuring ultra-fast wireless-n wi-fi networking (as well as a wired ethernet connection) and an internal power supply, and the apple tv offers silent, cool, very low power operation in an enclosure that's less than four inches square--80 percent smaller than the previous generation. control the apple tv using the included seven-button aluminum apple remote, or use your iphone, ipad, or ipod touch and the remote app--a free download from the itunes app store.

workout to get your fat loss engines going





workout to get your fat loss engines going

multiplanar movements are exercises that ensure you are moving in all dimensions (forward and back, side to side, and rotation).  why do you want to do this?  by choosing exercises that move your body in all directions you will be increasing your fat loss results exponentially.

let’s say you wanted to train your legs and butt.  a typical leg press machine would just have you working in the forward and back direction.  but what if you chose to do a squat instead? here’s how you could hit all directions:

1. basic squat – feet shoulder width apart and sit back as if you were going to sit on a bench and then use your legs and butt to come back up to a standing position.  (forward and back)
2. side squat – perform the same squatting movement but now step out to the side, alternating left and right, with each squat. (side to side)
3. sumo walk squat – go down into a squat position and walk forward and back like a sumo wrestler would. (rotation)

as you can see, this will take a lot more muscles than just a plain old leg press and give you much, much better results.

this is exactly what dr. k does for all of his patients and includes these workouts in his incredible double edged fat loss program.

i asked dr. k if he could give my readers a sample workout so you can try this method out for yourself.  you’ll not only see what a kick butt workout this is, but also, how quickly you’ll experience awesome results.

try this muiltiplanar movement workout to get your fat burning engines moving right now:
