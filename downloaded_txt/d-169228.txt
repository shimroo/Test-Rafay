what you will find here: our goal is to provide up to date naruto news and a vast array of naruto information. we hope to provide you with all this information without horribly spoiling you. we know there are viewers and shonen jump readers out there that would like to learn more about naruto but not have their experience horribly ruined by all the big spoilers in the series. we hope to be able to provide you with the content in a safe manner but still provide exhaustive information on the subject if the reader desires. that is why we will provide "quick-spoiler" clickable areas that allow you to see expanded information on the person or topic.
what you won't find here: unlike many naruto sites, we will not be providing you with downloads of the episodes or the manga. the price that is involved in hosting such content is too prohibitive in the long run and the hosting of such content would open us to legal liability. however, we hope to provide summaries and information on all the episodes and manga and also provide you with a great community experience.

anniversary + updating!?
posted by: shikamaru @ 4:56 pm on 4/27/2020 
hey everyone, long time no see. april marks the 16(!?) year anniversary for the site. yes, we were around before several other gigantic naruto fan sites were even a thing. a “wiki” wtf is a “wiki”? yes, had i to do it again, i would have jumped on that bandwagon right as the wiki popularity exploded. what can i say though, i like to have control over everything…
in any case, i haven’t really updated in years because of a lot of things. job changes and general ennui about the series ending. if you don’t know what ennui means, look it up and think over if you ever experienced it before, hahah. my current plans for this summer are to finally finish out the manga chapter summaries (five years too late), as well as to update the site with some more boruto series information.
first on the plate though is a series canon guide. as the series has grown over the years, i’ve seen lot of youtube reactors (wtf, people reacting to naruto on youtube? yes, we predate even youtube…) talk about only following the canon stories. well what is the naruto canon? i’m going to try and sketch it out and build it out. for now, i’ve covered the “true” canon. next up is to try and match up how the different anime series covers that material. as for the anime “manga canon coverage”, i also plan to highlight some of the worthy episodes that are still worth a watch on a full series viewing.
