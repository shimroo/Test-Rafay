get ready to celebrate public schools week (feb. 24-28)!

nspra 2025 national seminar registration now open
join us on july 20-23, 2025, at the washington hilton in the vibrant dupont circle neighborhood of washington, d.c., for the largest communications-focused professional development event for school communication professionals, superintendents and education leaders. 














what federal policy changes could mean for schools
the department of homeland security recently issued a directive rescinding guidelines that had prohibited immigration and customs enforcement and customs and border protection from conducting enforcement actions in "sensitive" areas, such as elementary and secondary schools. nspra members can access resources and guidance to help navigate these developments.

for more than 50 years, nspra has honored the best work in school communication through our national school communication awards program. and this year, we've opened the submission window early to provide you with more time to submit your best school communication work!
