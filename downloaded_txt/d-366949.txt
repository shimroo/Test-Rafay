since its founding in 1972, the needlework guild of minnesota has fostered the highest standard of excellence in the practice of needlework through programs of education and study.
our members enjoy fellowship based on an enthusiasm for stitching by hand that facilitates learning and provides them with a sense of accomplishment.
the guild offers a variety of educational activities through which members develop their skills and gain an in depth understanding of art created with the threaded needle. members and professional teachers provide programs for every level of stitcher.
the guild is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit educational organization with approximately 200 members. in addition to a variety of monthly meetings, we offer an annual retreat, workshops, a bimonthly newsletter, and an exclusive members-only library of more than 400 books focused on needlework in all of its diverse forms.
