                                        read on . . .

dear
                                        friend:
probate
                                        has a bad name.
    
                                        generations ago, the
                                        probate system was conceived as one
                                        orderly way of transferring the property
                                        of a deceased person to his or her
                                        heirs. it was designed to protect the
                                        heirs.
    
                                        today it has become an
                                        ugly, legal nightmare where lawyers,
                                        clerks, guardians, administrators,
                                        estate appraisers and bonding companies
                                        bilk widows and orphans 
                                        out of their inheritance.
    
                                        all across the nation,
                                        greedy lawyers in league with conniving
                                        judges and bureaucrats plunder huge
                                        chunks - and sometimes all - of an
                                        estate.
    
                                        first,
                                        let's see what's wrong with probate, and
                                        then let's see how you can avoid
                                        probate - so that your family can get to
                                        keep the assets that are rightfully
                                        theirs.
three
                                        things wrong with probate.

probate
                                        costs too much!

in
                                          most states, probate fees are set by
                                          law as a percent of the
                                          "gross" estate. say, you
                                          left an estate consisting of your
                                          home, an automobile, stocks and bonds,
                                          savings and a few other personal
                                          possessions worth $200,000. the
                                          executor's commission and 
											high pressue
											attorney's
                                          fees to probate this estate in
                                          california would amount to $10,300. 
                                          average fees in other states
                                          range from 3.8% in utah to 11% in
                                          alaska.
let
                                          me show you how high the stakes are:
                                          maryland legislature has been trying
                                          for the past seven years to ban
                                          percentage fees in probate cases;
                                          every year a lobby organized by
                                          probate lawyers has been able to
                                          defeat the bill.


probate
                                        takes too long!

on
                                          the average, it takes two to five
                                          years to settle an estate. for all
                                          practical purposes, the estate is
                                          frozen during probate while the
                                          judges, court officials and attorneys
                                          have a field day picking it apart. the
                                          beneficiaries, in the meantime, wait,
                                          wait ...and wait. this is why many
                                          lawyers would rather write wills, and then make a bundle when the
                                          will is probated.


probate
                                        creates unwanted publicity.

everything
                                          in probate court is a matter of public
                                          record and, unfortunately, there are
                                          individuals who go from probate court
                                          to probate court compiling lists which
                                          are then sold to unscrupulous people
                                          who prey on widows and try to separate
                                          them from their inheritance 
											using high pressure.

sincerely,

                                        how can you escape from the vagaries of
                                        probate?

now
                                          that you know why you should avoid
                                          probate, let me show you the most
                                          effective way of doing it.
the law has provided
                                          everyone with a magic key to probate
                                          exemption; it's called "inter
                                          vivos trust" or a "living
                                          trust." with a revocable living
                                          trust, you can pass on your assets to
                                          your spouse or children or other heirs
                                          in entirety - without delay, and
                                          without the lawyers, administrators,
                                          courts, or the appraisers skimming off
                                          from the top.
here's
                                          how a living trust works. you
                                          create the trust by preparing a trust
                                          instrument on forms in which you
                                          simply identify:



assets
                                                you're transferring to the trust

beneficiary
                                                of the trust (your spouse,
                                                children or other heirs)

trustee
                                                (i.e., you) who'll manage the
                                                trust .


precisely to help you
                                          avoid or reduce the costs and the
                                          nightmarish problems of probate, we've
                                          put together a revocable
living trust kit. 
                                          the kit
                                          is designed for a lay person to
                                          transfer his principal assets to a
                                          living trust, name himself as trustee,
                                          designate beneficiaries who'll inherit
                                          the estate - without the rigors of
                                          probate -upon his death.


the
                                              kit contains step-by-step
                                              instructions, and all the necessary
                                              forms you'll need to establish
                                              your living trust.


by
                                          creating a simple living trust
                                          document, you'd have freed yourself of
                                          the legalized larceny of probate.
                                          simple as that.


the
                                              essence of a living trust:
                                              simplicity, flexibility and
                                              control.


a living trust is set
                                          up by you while you're alive. you name
                                          yourself as "trustee" and
                                          you maintain full control over your
                                          assets just as before. you can do
                                          whatever you wish to do with them -
                                          manage them, sell them, or give them
                                          away. the trust does not become
                                          effective till you die or become
                                          incapacitated.
the person you would
                                          designate on the forms as beneficiary
                                          of the trust (your husband or wife or
                                          children) is called "successor
                                          trustee." upon your death, the
                                          successor trustee takes over the
                                          estate immediately without going
                                          through probate and terminates the
                                          trust. it's that simple.
your trust would be a revocable
                                          living trust. you can abolish the
                                          trust or alter its terms or change the
                                          beneficiaries at any time you wish.
                                          the document provides you with the
                                          maximum amount of flexibility.



the 
											kit also includes downloadable

                                          me point out two more benefits of a
                                          living trust.  first, disgruntled
                                          heirs find trusts extremely difficult
                                          to contest. when an estate
                                          goes to probate, the court freezes its
                                          assets for several months and asks
                                          anyone to come forward and contest the
                                          will if they please. someone
                                          contesting a will doesn't even need to
                                          hire a lawyer. but to contest a trust,
                                          a disgruntled heir needs to hire a
                                          lawyer and file a civil suit. in the
                                          meantime, the trustee is free to
                                          distribute the assets to the
                                          beneficiaries immediately.
                                          your
                                          estate isn't tied up in lengthy
                                          litigation.
a
                                          living trust offers another important
                                          benefit. a growing number
                                          of older americans are putting their
                                          assets into a living trust because
                                          they want to avoid being placed under
                                          a court-appointed guardian if they
                                          become unable to manage their affairs.
with a living trust you can specify
                                          in advance whom you want to manage
                                          your affairs if you ever become
                                          incompetent.










    
                                        how
                                        effective is the living trust?





      
                                          let's take a simple example of a
                                          savings account. upon your death, the
                                          bank would very likely block the
                                          account while the will is being
                                          probated. it will not allow any
                                          withdrawal from the account without a
                                          court order.
however,
                                          with a living trust, your beneficiary
                                          walks into the bank with the trust
                                          document forms and the death
                                          certificate - and walks out with the
                                          money. no two-to-five year delay. no
                                          ten percent in expenses. and no
                                          publicity.

                                    states. normally, you would set up the trust
                                    in your present state of residence or
                                    domicile. however, if you find it more
                                    advantageous to have the trust interpreted
                                    under the laws of a different state, the kit

people
                                            with high-powered attorneys and
                                            financial advisors have always used
                                            living trust forms to escape
                                            probate. attorneys often charge
                                            hundreds, even thousands, of dollars
                                            to set up a revocable living trust.
                                            legal fees of $950 to $1,800 to set
                                            up a simple trust are not uncommon. 


all too often, an attorney has his
                                            secretary type a few standard forms
                                            from a sample (similar to the ones
                                            you'll find in the kit) and he then
                                            turns around and charges you a
                                            whopping fee for the document. read
                                            this comment i received from
                                            california:  "i have been
                                            a legal secretary and know first
                                            hand how much lawyers charge for the
                                            secretary to do the work."

                                          my wife and i attended a seminar on
                                          avoiding probate. this book covers the
                                          topic more thoroughly than the seminar
                                          and explains all the procedures more
                                          thoroughly. one lawyer who put on an
                                          information seminar charges $895.00 to
                                          make out a living trust. "
