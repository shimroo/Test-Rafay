the tudor rose story

rose tudor had always loved and collected antiques.  in the mid ‘90’s with children growing up, she decided to try out her knowledge gained from collecting and so took a stand at petworth antique market – one of the best known centres in the south of england.
this was a great learning ground and gave her a chance to see what life was like on the other side of the counter!
from that moment she never looked back. in addition to petworth, she took space in two other antique centres in oxfordshire. this was quite a challenge to do the a3, m25 and m40 by 10am two days a week but passion does breed determination and every minute during this period was spent intently learning the trade. many hours attending auctions, just listening and learning added to the experience she was gaining. she describes this period of her life as her degree course in antiques!
following all this activity and just down the road from petworth antique market was a wonderful old tudor building which came up for sale. this was the opportunity rose had been waiting for – to own a beautiful period shop in petworth, a town based on antiques – and open her very own antique shop. so the deed was done in june 2001 and tudor rose antiques & interiors was born a month later.
the shop was pretty well an instant success, being a good size, over two floors and housing a wide range of reasonably priced antiques. so the knowledge that rose accrued over those six intense years was put to good use and she is still very much at the helm today. living nearby there are few days when she is not around, particularly at weekends, to greet her regulars who either have weekend cottages nearby or just like to make petworth a good weekend visit.
