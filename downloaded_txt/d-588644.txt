knowing what qualities to establish in professional boat movers is vital for the success of the operation regardless of the size of your boat. here are six critical factors that can help you in determining an ideal mover that can accomplish the process in a safe and efficient manner.
things to consider when finding a perfect boat mover
–          experience with long-distance moves


if you are planning to transport your boat over a long distance, ensure that the mover you are hiring has experience in moving boats over such great distances. ask for a record of proof and accomplishments that they have had on such a journey. a mover can be excellent in all other aspects but if they have never been on a long ride, they may end up losing focus in the middle of the journey due to exhaustion and cause some unexpected mistakes.
–          experience in moving over-sized boats
moving an oversized boat presents a lot of challenges that require great problem-solving abilities to accomplish the mission. thus, you want to find out if the mover has ever moved a vessel of this magnitude before. it will be appropriate if you ask the mover to give a few references that you can get in touch with and let them share how the entire experience was. moving a large boat requires unique trailers and tools that can help keep the boat in one place as it moves.
–          knowledge of different boat types
a boat move should have an in-depth understanding of the various types of boats, including sailboats, motorboats and yachts. this knowledge allows them to understand how to handle different boats while taking caution on delicate parts. this will help to minimise damage to your boat and ensure that it arrives safely.
–          constant tracking and updates
the mover should have a reliable tracking app like the ones used in online shops to give you updates on how far your boat has reached. this is important as it gives you peace of mind knowing that everything is going well at any point in time. if possible, the tracker should possess real-time map features which you can use to locate the exact location of the trailer transporting your boat.
–          timeliness
find a mover who has excellent time management skills to help get your boat to its required destination in time. this is helpful especially when you have a very short vacation period and need to enjoy using your vessel before you can go back to work. the mover should give reasonable timelines that they can deliver rather than lying about delivery time just to please you.
final thoughts
while moving a boat, ensure that you have thought about its size and the distance it will cover to help you find a mover that has experience in such a task. additionally, the mover should have extensive knowledge of various kinds of boats to understand how to handle every kind of boat when moving. you will get peace of mind from real-time updates on the progress of the process and this may allow you to focus on other things. make sure you hire expert boat movers in gold coast.

long-term vs. short-term storage options in albury


storage units are savvy when you have limited storage space and are not quite done with storing your belongings. in albury, you will find many storage company providers giving two broad storage options; long-term and short-term storage types. so. it is important to understand the differences between these two and know which one will be more appropriate for your project.
it is important to note that both of the options have their unique merits and best uses. let us briefly discuss five major differences between long-term and short-storage options in albury.
five major differences
–          rental period
the first contrast lies in the rental period. in the case of a short-term storage option, you can rent it for a short period of time and is mostly convenient for storing your belongings when shifting houses. also, you can hire a short-term storage option if you want to remodel your home and need extra space to keep your items. in albury, the rental period for short-term storage options usually lasts from a few weeks to some months.
on the other hand, the long-term storage option gives you an extended rental period that can last from many months to several years, depending on your needs. it is ideal for keeping items that require long-term storage solutions.
–          cost
cost is also a factor of interest when contrasting short-term and long-term storage options in albury. this is where the differences between the two options become interesting. as much as many will expect the short-term storage option to be cheaper while the long-term expensive, it is quite the opposite. you will find that the short-term option will cost more per month since the company wants to make the most out of the short period for their rented services. in contrast, long-term storage options are usually cheaper since the provider tends to reduce the storage rates and provide significant discounts for extended contracts.  do not fall into the trap of renting a short-term storage option while intending to use it for a long p[period as it will only mean that you will have to pay more for the services each month.
–          type of belongings stored
when comparing these two storage options, the type of belongings that need storage will also play a crucial role in your decision on the right option to select. for instance, the short-term storage option is ideal for the belongings that you use on a regular basis, such as clothes and furniture when moving. the long-term storage option is suitable for belongings that do not require regular use, like seasonal equipment and archived documents.
–          level of security
albury’s storage solutions have plenty of security features to prevent burglars from breaking and accessing your belongings. they will assign 24/7 security personnel to keep an eye on the facility in addition to alarms, and cctv. for short-term storage, the security is not as detailed as in the long-term since the belongings are usually assessed regularly. therefore, you need to know the level of security that your items will be subjected to, especially if you need to store valuable items.
this article helps you to have a good understanding of the difference between the long-term and short-term storage options in albury by highlighting major factors that can influence the type of storage option to select.

various functions of excavator undercarriage parts


while many people can readily envision an image of an excavator, knowing the functions of excavator undercarriage parts is unknown information.
the traditional form of excavators has not evolved since its first inception despite the many changes in its design. while big and mini excavators may not have the same capabilities and features, the excavator undercarriage parts remain basic for all of them.
giving excavators the ability to move around the work area is the main function of their lowest section known as the undercarriage.
excavators can move quickly around any work area with the help of their undercarriage. the various models of excavators may look different but they all share the same undercarriage parts which are:
blade
the blade is an optional attachment that may not be available for all excavator models. however, an excavator undercarriage attached with a dozer blade quickly clears the ground by removing any loose material.
many excavator owners have seen the importance of having dozer blades attached to the undercarriage. this is the reason for some excavator models showing the inclusion of dozer blades in their undercarriage.
tracks
the metal caterpillar tracks fashioned showing steel pins connecting a series of steel plates were the traditional equipment of excavators. considered as the continuous track, track sprockets were used to drive the two-toothed wheels running on rollers. the extremely durable steel was the initial material used for excavator tracks.
however, paved surfaces of worksites become damaged when steel tracks rolled over them. this has made excavator manufacturers come up with another track design; the rubber tracks.
the creation of rubber tracks also placed excavator owners in a quandary. are the rubber tracks a better option than steel tracks?
rubber tracks vs. steel tracks
advantages of rubber tracks
while steel tracks remain the irreplaceable choice, the rubber tracks have become increasingly popular for the following benefits:
manoeuvrabilityaffordabilitylesser surface impactcomfortspeed
advantages of steel tracks
less repair and maintenanceeasy to clean and upkeeptough and durableprovides balance and counterweightprovides uniform load transfer and distribution
final drives
connecting the engine above to the gearing system and the hydraulic motor is via the drive shaft. this connection provides tracks to be individually powered to allow them to turn to the left or the right. an excavator is allowed the power to turn on the spot by moving one track and stopping the other track.
track frame
the main body of an excavator’s undercarriage is known as the track frame. it is designed as a rectangular-shaped solid steel frame with sides featuring the track bodies. the swing bearing, slew ring, and swing gear are the parts that are found in the track frame. a centre pin connects the track frame to the house of the excavator. an excavator can perform a 360 rotation when a hydraulic swivel is installed at the apex of the track frame. a stationary excavator can still perform left to right movements with the help of the track frame.
understanding the various excavator undercarriage parts allows an owner the right way to maintain its tip-top condition. a well-maintained machine holds the secret to its longer lifespan.

boat painting gold coast


if you want your boat to last a lifetime or look as good as new, consider painting it. although the painting exercise can cost a fortune, it is worth leaping. it adds many years of life ahead, plus it increases its value immediately. boat painting needs specialist skill to undertake, and it’s one point you need to keep in mind while selecting a boat painter for your vessel. before choosing a spray painter for your boat, take time to decide who to entrust with the job. the phrase ‘get what you pay for’ is never true in the boat painting field. for excellent results, look for experience and never trust painters who boast of delivering quality when they don’t have a dedicated painting workshop.
before you hire a boat painter, consult first to know how materials like fibreglasses can be handled, for example, painting fibreglass with black colour can cause permanent damage. from the information given, you may judge their ability to deliver what you want. if possible, choose painters with controlled humidity and temperatures. the reputation of a painter is critical while selecting a painter for your boat.
a step-by-step guide to painting a boat
boat detailing is not easy, especially for amateurs. but with an experienced painter, it’s all a walk in the park. painting is one of the boat maintenance exercises that will help your boat deal with elements. boats spend most of the time skidding over the waters, hence more susceptible to corrosion, but painting it will lease a new life to your boat. if you are trying to improve an older vessel, painting is a sure bet to recondition it and make it appear as good as new.
the processes involved in painting a boat may seem complicated, but you can simplify things by following the following steps:
remove hardware components like rails, vents and cleats out of the boat to begin.fill out any imperfections like dings, chips or gouges to repair the surface.wash the surface and thoroughly sand it.apply the primer before the paint and finally wax the entire boat to protect the paint.
that’s all. please keep it clean always and thoroughly rinse it after use, especially after a ride in saltwater. remember to read all the warning labels in the accessories and supplies before painting, use protective gear while painting.
painting fibre glass
there is no much difference from painting wood vessels except the type of paints and a few details regarding preparation and application. it would be best if you remembered that spraying the paint gives more quality results than applying using a brush. when painting fibreglass, use single-part enamel types because they are easy to apply and less expensive; however, they can be damaged by uv rays and if subjected to heavy hauling without regular waxing. urethane paints don’t cost as much as two-part but can gloss for a long time. two-part polyurethane is the best of both worlds, durability and gloss. some people argue that that two-part polyurethane outshines even the original gel coat.
painting the bottom of a boat is experience compared to the topside and the hull. it’s easier painting the bottom than the upper part. just remove the gel coat if it is still fresh and dewax and sand if necessary. then apply your new gel coat, and your boat is ready to sail away.

advantages of using 3d laser scanning


industries from car manufacturers to shoe designers are reaping the benefits of using 3d laser scanning in their businesses. the work becomes accurate and fast in these industries with their use of the structured scanners.
3d laser scanning often referred to as blue or white light scanners, is capable of scanning multiple times every turn and angle of an object, and turn it, within seconds, from a tangible product to a virtual design.
when it comes to manufacturing, the advantages of using 3d laser scanning include:
 
time-saving during the design phase
a pre-existing designed product that needs an added new part to make it more efficient becomes possible with 3d scanning. this is because of the ability of the scanner to scan an existing product’s lines and angles as well as provide the perfect and accurate angle to put in the new part.
doing it this way saves time for alterations to existing designs like no other. hand-drawn calculations concerning the thickness of an automotive part or ring become a slower and inefficient way of doing it. 3d scanning will make short work of any dimension precisely and accurately in mere seconds.
 
a quicker way of processing a prototype
in times past, multiple attempts have to be executed before an accurate prototype can be created. this process today is much quicker, faster, and accurate with 3d structured light scanning. the time spent in the process of design and production is greatly reduced when the prototype cycle is handled by 3d laser scanning.
other than identifying warped areas and cross-section measuring, the scanner also has the ability to save all the gathered data of the scanned object. saving data makes the process faster the next time the industry needs a new prototype design.
 
quality-control’s quick solution
the accuracy of 3d scanners has made them invaluable not only in manufacturing industries but also in preserving artefacts of major museums around the world. museums have found that the volume and composition of artefacts scanned by 3d scanners help to preserve them.
the scanner also makes it possible to establish a quicker way of checking the quality of the products of a manufacturing plant. the fast way of using the scanner to check the product against the original cad design leaves out the guesswork in maintaining top quality every time and all the time.
 
capable of producing accurate reproductions
some manufactured parts that have been designed before cad can be quickly and accurately reproduced by 3d scanners. all the manufacturing plant needs to do is to have the old part scanned as a way to create a cad reproduction. the scanner will then be able to compare the accuracy between the scan of the old part to the newly created prototype.
 
capable of comparing a designed model to a built model
scanning a designed model to compare to the built model is probably one of the top advantages provided by the 3d scanner. for instance, the accurate scan of a designed model of a jewel will tell the jeweller whether it will perfectly fit a ring or necklace pendant.
the 3d laser scanning is a piece of machinery that has revolutionised multiple industries and companies. it is a machine that is capable of handling almost everything from creating engineering prototypes to restoring works of art or artifacts. surveyors at work offer 3d laser scanning. reach out to them to find out more about the advantages 3d laser scanning can do for you and your business.

gas type
performance
bbq size
material made from
other features

now let’s break down each of the things you should keep in mind.
gas type
if you think gas is gas, you are wrong. there are different types of gases, each with different flammability. it is not worth to assume that all gases have the same flammability. the fact of the matter is that gases have different quantities, qualities, and benefits. gases used with bbq are of two types, but give almost the same amount of heat energy. it is when to use them that matters. one of them, for example, is suited for both winter and summer seasons while the latter is for summertime alone. reasons being; the one for the summer season alone can heed to freezing in winter hence ruled out for a good reason during winter. the bbq itself comes with its recommendations as stipulated in their manuals. you better use the type of gas recommended for awesome results.
caution: gases are flammable, in fact, highly flammable, if you see fire out of the grills, act swiftly and close the lid to limit oxygen if you can do without risking burns on your hands. remember lids get hot fast, so let it cool down first, i would prefer burnt meat pies to burned hands!
size
consider the size of the congregation before placing an order. a picture is worth a thousand words, but this time around, they can be deceiving, often grills appear bigger on the photos than they are. some grills have a foldable feature to save space if it is limited.
performance
while window shopping for bbq, look for the grills that come with performance in terms of btus
material
built in bbq by parkquip are made from cast iron because they are readily available, durable and cheap. the downside is that they rust and hard to clean. aluminium grills can stand the test of rust, lightweight, good for tables and not heating because they can melt. chromed steel and nickel-plated steel are good for racks, expensive and durable than any other. stainless steel is the better option and enjoys all features in aluminium, perfect for grills and bbq in general.

tree lopping the correct way


trees can both be a source of beauty or a serious hazard. falling branches can cause property damage and harm to humans. however, trees causing problems can be challenging to identify without proper training. allowing an inexperienced person attempt to handle these situations create more problems than solutions. between the difficulties of getting good access and managing the work site, dealing with a dangerous tree can be quite a challenge. thanks to the skill of tree lopping services in rockhampton who can help diagnose and address the problem and keep you, your family, and your property safe, through several ways of tree maintenance procedures.

tree topping or decrowning – is another tree management option. as the name suggests, the process involves removing the entire top of the tree, leaving only lateral branches which aren’t big enough to take over as a new dominant branch. the process stunts the vertical growth of a tree, keeping it restrained and the overall tree shorter. this can obviously limit the potential of the tree to cause damage. however, the cuts from a topping can take a long time to heal, leaving the tree possibly vulnerable to a fungal infection which may kill the tree. this is a viable option for tree management.
tree lopping – is the most precise tree management option. it involves the idea of taking care of the most significant and most dangerous lateral branches. this avoids massive cuts to the core of the tree but helps to maintain the tree in a safe and healthy fashion. safe and healthy trees are less likely to fall and cause damage but keep the natural beauty of the tree intact.

environment and economic development: introduction



conciliating economic development and environmental protection is not an easy task. to a certain extent, the two concerns may appear contradictory. on the one hand, many economic activities have a negative environmental impact: they use natural resources in the production process and contribute to reducing natural capital (directly through the use of exhaustible resources, indirectly in the event of over-exploitation of resources renewable). on the other hand, environmental protection objectives can have a negative impact on economic development by constraining business and consumer behavior through regulations or fiscal measures.


how to analyze the interaction between these two terms – and their relation to sustainable development – knowing that they are frequently telescoping? should we favor one over the other? can we afford to get out of the current economic and financial crisis with little concern for environmental constraints? is it better to get out of the ecological crisis (global warming, loss of biodiversity, global growth of the ecological footprint, …) by agreeing to do without economic growth or at least to restrict it? in the long run, is there really a trade-off between economic prosperity and environmental protection?


in the space of one issue of this journal, it is obviously impossible to answer all these (broad) questions. this volume “environment and economic development” is not intended to be exhaustive and inevitably leaves some themes behind.


first of all, the term economic development is understood here in a relatively restrictive sense, that of economic growth. this a priori is certainly reductive and ignores alternative indicators to gdp that are mentioned in many recent works or works such as the report of the stiglitz commission. in the poorest countries, however, economic growth in the strict sense remains essential to improving living conditions. moreover, without growth, and in any country in the world, the improvement of the lot of the most disadvantaged necessarily rests on redistributive policies. potentially conflicting. if growth were not accompanied by environmental problems, its desirability would probably be self-evident; and when these problems are put in brackets, growth remains a priority objective, as illustrated by much of the public debate since the beginning of the recent financial crisis. this does not mean that the following articles defend the possibility of infinite growth; on the contrary, several of the following articles emphasize that the introduction of various strict ecological constraints undermines the idea of ​​some form of perpetual growth.


we have chosen not to explicitly dedicate articles to topics for which books or publications exist elsewhere and are easily accessible. thus, no article in this issue is exclusively devoted to the theme of climate policy. in particular, guesnerie (2010) provides an excellent overview of this issue and the obstacles to its further implementation. similarly, schubert (2009) provides an interesting overview of the carbon tax issue.

in australia, the environment, the poor relation of the economic miracle



whether you’re talking about average salary, health or education, australia is one of the best, if not the best, students in the international rankings. but the country is also at the top of the table for its greenhouse gas emissions. it is one of the biggest polluters in the world per capita and ranks 13 th worldwide among emitters of co 2 .
these emissions come mainly from its electricity, produced mainly from coal, the most polluting source of energy, and of which australia is the world’s largest exporter. they are also caused by mining.
but a new mine should be dug in the state of queensland, in the north-east of the country. it would be one of the largest in the world. it would be managed by the indian conglomerate adani. the latter should give its final agreement in the coming weeks.
pressure from the authorities
but the project is extremely controversial: for conservationists, the exploitation of this coal will exacerbate global warming, while for the government, the mine will create more wealth and thousands of jobs in australia.
after iron, coal is the second largest source of export revenue for the country. despite this pressure from the authorities, australia’s second largest bank, westpac, announced in late april that it would not participate in the financing of the mine. the government was quick to accuse him of giving in to “activists” and ignoring job seekers.
modest commitments
in addition to coal, australia is also a major producer of gas. the country is expected to double qatar by 2019 to become the world’s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas. “coal, oil, gas are all pollutants,” denounced the ngo climate council, which prefers to recall that “renewable energies are now cheaper than these fossil fuels . “
at cop21, in paris at the end of 2015, australia made modest climate commitments: a 26% (up to 28%) reduction in these emissions by 2030 compared to 2005. the arrival at in september 2015, malcolm turnbull’s power had raised hopes, as he had defended an ambitious carbon tax. but since then, this conservative prime minister has disappointed. he is the fourth head of government in five years. he has a very narrow majority and is struggling to vote his reforms. and the environment is not, anyway, more among its priorities.
