“i can’t recommend mike wolf enough. i worked with him on a very difficult, time-intensive netflix show. mike's work was second to none and his attention to color and detail exceeded everyone’s expectations. we couldn’t have navigated netflix’s stringent deliverables without mike's experience and knowledge of online editing.” 
							jay skowronek post production supervisor - 25/7 productions
 


"mike wolf is the best online guy i have ever worked with. a true artist who seamlessly incorporates the big picture down to the smallest detail. he's a brilliant colorist, a gifted graphics whiz, and he won't leave the room until the job is done - be it 8 hours or two and a half days. i've been with him in both situations. mike is our 'go to guy' whenever we have a gig that requires a master's finesse.  which of course is every time." 
							eamon harringtonproducer/director/owner – planet grande pictures
 


"mike is easy and accommodating to work with. my clients enjoy contact with him very much. he takes the initiative to offer creative solutions, but also diligently executes the client’s own vision. one of my favorite things about mike is his excellent sense of aesthetics. i frequently seek and trust mike's opinions on 'the art' of tv." 
							jeffrey noedelcreative director – noedel agency
 


“mike has been a great asset to 25/7 as a whole and to the post process on multiple series for us. his wisdom and work ethic is invaluable. he'd be a great addition to any team.” 
							frank salinasvp of post – 25/7 productions
 


"i found mike to be highly creative, technically excellent, always cooperative and unfailingly good-natured... a difficult combination to find." 
							ralph hainesproducer – haynes media
 


"i can attest not only to his technical proficiency, but to the creativity he brings to my projects. mike’s intuitive sense of what was needed combined with a very comfortable communication style make him one of the best i've ever worked with." 
							drew fitzgeraldcreative director – brighton agency
 


"mike is a multi-talented post-production master, equally adept at offline, finishing or motion graphics. in addition to his fantastic work ethic and deep knowledge of the tools, he's also creative, artistic, calm under pressure and a lot of fun to work with. he's a pro from 'start' to 'finish.' highly recommended." 
							kip brownpost producer – karga 7 pictures
 


"great work is 75% talent, 60% attitude, and 10% luck - wait, that's 145%. anyway, mike gave me the talent and positive attitude. with that going for me, i need less luck." 
							j.c. codycreative director – brighton agency
 


"if you are searching for help in the online editing department, look no further. mike wolf's storytelling and visual effects skills are superb, and he is an excellent collaborator. from concept to delivery, mike has the experience to put that special touch on your show. he will make your next project shine." 
							ron harbin, jr.director – harbor inn pictures
 


"mike has a great eye and can often be a tremendous help to a client who is looking for something fresh and innovative. that kind of collaboration is a quality i appreciate in other creative professionals, and it is one of mike’s strongest assets." 
							tracy collinsproducer – creative producers group
 


"mike wolf is the best i've ever worked with. he's creative, fast, efficient and a master of his toolset. just don't book him when i need him!" 
							matt linnellproducer – traveling circus
 


"mike wolf is tremendously talented and extremely knowledgeable. he is on a very short list of people that i recommend for jobs. i can say first hand that he can handle anything you throw at him. he is an excellent editor, a great guy and a pleasure to work with."
