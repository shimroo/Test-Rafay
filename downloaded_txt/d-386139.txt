​we are a small hobby breeder of english fox red and yellow labrador retrievers.  we have akc registered labrador puppies available to companion homes a few times a year. we take pride in having unique pedigrees without the inbreeding that most fox red labrador kennels have. we concentrate on quality of puppies, never quantity. we compete in conformation showing, pet therapy and obedience with our dogs.  we have placed our labradors with guide dog and service dog trainers many times over the years. we are happy to provide references on request as most of our puppy buyers come back for a second or third puppy and also refer their family and friends. our labs are part of our family and they enjoy our acreage in rural jasper county iowa.  our labradors are gentle, calm and loving.  they are easy to live with retrievers that are great fireside companions and also able to perform as working gun dogs.  they know no strangers in life and we enjoy sharing them with the families who adopt our puppies.  we have made many friends all over the usa and the world thanks to our great dogs.  welcome to our website and please reach out if you have any questions.  we love to talk "dog".
