what members are saying about isrdon’t leave your career to chance
− wish i knew about isr before i came to this school!
− this is the only school review website i know of that lets teachers tell it like it is. 
− recruiters only tell you what they want you hear. that’s why i joined isr.
− i refer potential candidates to isr regularly to find out the ins and outs of specific schools. 
− nothing on the web keeps me safe from unscrupulous schools like isr does.
− i would be bummed if i had not read your reviews & chosen one of the other 2 schools…
− joining isr is probably one of the best things i’ve done for my career.
− isr is like an antivirus program. it helps me keep undesirable stuff out of my life.
