    woven cloth is made for practical and ceremonial events today. people wear cloth for jeans and hats during everyday activities like shopping for practical purposes. people also wear clothes like business suits for work usually during the weekdays. in ceremonies such as burials, we wear all black cloth and it is usually held outside on a saturday. for religious ceremonies and people culture festival which are usually held in churches on any day, people usually wear dresses with no print or special meanings on them. everyone wears different clothing for different occasions.

     dia del santo es formal fiesta porque es celebra en la iglesia y vas a un lugar a comen. tú vestir una vestido o un traje. tú celebres un santo así es deberías es muy especial. es casi como una fiesta de cumpleaños. yo quiero a tengo uno.

     creo que un boda es mucho formal porque la novia tiene en un vestido blanco grande, es celebra en una iglesia, y también se ocupa de dios. supongo que cincuenta años es formal porque es celebrer grande and consiste de comida grande, decoraciones grandes y hablando fuerte. creo que una dia del santo es formal porque tú son celebres una persona importante en una culture o en su vida. supongo que quinceañera es formal porque es un especial momente and ella es mismo una mujer y usualmente tiene un fiesta grande con decoraciones de lujo. creo que un graduación es el menos formal porque es ser celebrea fuera y personas son van a comen barbocoa y consiste de ropa informal. todas las celebraciones consiste de diferentes tipos de ropa.

     easter in latin america is different from easter in the united states. easter in latin america is called semana santa and occurs during the autumn, so the churches are often decorated with fruits of the season, as well as flowers and greenery. in america we celebrate easter in the spring and have our churches decorated with regular things. in columbuia, they hold a religious procession as a celebration. our cultures are very different. we all have the same reason to celebrate easter week.
