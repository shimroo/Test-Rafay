...............i moved my domains to 1plus.net

i moved my domains (see below) to 1plus.net (http://www.1plus.net/), where i use my own adsense code and therefore earn 100% of the income. also, the domains should get higher search engine rankings, since they get indexed sooner at 1plus.net, apparently because they're not typical parking pages, and, i can promote the domains when they're at 1plus.net, whereas, with typical domain parking, due to google's rules, one is supposed to rely on type in traffic and any existing links/search engine traffic for previously used domains. mine are all new, so, i have no links/search engine traffic yet.http://www.chartermegayachts.com/ ...http://www.mortgagextc.com/ ...http://www.ccxtc.com/ ...http://www.forextc.com/ ...http://www.cashyall.com/ ...http://www.richtricks.com/ ...http://www.csenor.com/ ...http://www.solidgoldgifts.com/ ...http://www.acidcausereflux.com/ ...http://www.pokerhay.com/ ...http://www.busibesa.com/ ...ciao.  ....... http://www.joefrocks.com/

"start driving traffic and revenue to your parked domain"

"start driving traffic and revenue to your parked domain," see http://www.articledashboard.com/article/start-driving-traffic-and-revenue-to-your-parked-domain/247803. "whypark" (http://www.whypark.com/) is for 100+ domains and costs $100/year, or, maybe/probably it's a one time fee, while 1plus.net (http://www.1plus.net/sellers_info.php) is for any number of domains, and, is free i think, so, i'll probably try it since i just bought 11 domains. these services are for quickly creating developed sites, that one can promote and will tend to achieve a much higher search engine ranking than traditional new non typo traffic parked pages, hence they'll be monetized much more quickly in the case of new non typo traffic names like mine.with traditional domain parking one isn't supposed to submit the parked page to search engines or add quality links, due to google's rules, therefore, one gets very little traffic with new non typo names and doesn't monetize them with traditional domain parking. ciao ....... http://www.joefrocks.com/ .

big deal for dollars.com tops this week's domain sales chart

"big deal for dollars.com tops this week's domain sales chart," see http://www.dnjournal.com/archive/domainsales/2007/domainsales07-17-07.htm. looking at the weekly sales list helps one to see what types of domains are valuable, and, can help with thinking up good new ones. it gives one a good idea of what the market currently is and provides ideas for new domain names........ http://www.joefrocks.com/ .

............i just optimized my 11 new domains

i just optimized my 11 new domains, so they look much better and focus much better on the desired keywords:http://www.chartermegayachts.com/http://www.mortgagextc.com/http://www.ccxtc.com/http://www.forextc.com/http://www.cashyall.com/http://www.richtricks.com/http://www.csenor.com/http://www.solidgoldgifts.com/http://www.acidcausereflux.com/http://www.pokerhay.com/http://www.busibesa.com/for now the minimum bid to buy one is $100.00, until i determine what it really should be for each domain name.i'm using paid parking at http://www.namedrive.com/. also, a great site for aggregating domain name news/analysis/info is http://www.dnhour.com/. here's an interesting article about recent high priced domain name sales with thoughts/analysis, see http://blog.domaintools.com/2007/06/over-100k-domains-at-auction/.i've gotten interested in "domaining" again, and, feel that there's a lot of room to be creative, and, potentially make a lot of money, with a lot of hard work. ciao. ....... http://www.joefrocks.com/ .
