an education for lifewe are passionate about cultivating children’s love of learning. our curriculum prepares students for life. we nurture intelligence, curiosity, and imagination while supporting and developing each student’s unique talents. our school teaches universal values, helps students gain a global perspective, and encourages responsible citizenship. our goal is to graduate young people who balance their knowledge and character: who are lifelong learners, critical thinkers, and active leaders.

















growth in communitymulti-age classrooms provide dynamic learning communities at each level. engaged teachers, staff, administrators, and families create a welcoming and warm environment for each child to grow. our community is large enough to offer many opportunities,  yet small enough for each child to be known.

















strong foundationsa sense of order, independence, coordination, and concentration. these foundations set the course for academic skills and knowledge. expert teachers engage students with our curriculum in concrete and hands-on ways, tailoring instruction to the development of the child.
