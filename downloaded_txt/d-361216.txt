the new tracks are all done! mastering of the album was graciously performed by scott paris. the official release date is june 26th 2015! only 7 more days! the album is titled “what’s inside the breifcase?” and features 14 brand new tracks. this has been a lot of hard work, and a great learning experience for me. i look forward to feedback.

bench press a dresser

greeting friends! i have been working diligently on new material that i can’t wait to expose. i have received some great feedback and am quite excited to get this stuff out there. i have four songs complete, and am working on another batch of four as we speak. updates are somewhat scarce and i apologize for that. trying to keep the nose to the grind stone and work more on music. less talk, more rock. i figure you don’t want to hear about what i had for dinner or where i went this past saturday night, and would rather i focus on making the best music i can. follow the abc’s… always be creating… and i am. no teasers, no advanced tracks, no sneak previews. it’s gonna just be me, dropping my hot sticky rap load all at once all over your ear holes.

making progress

i have been working hard on the new material. have lot’s of cool stuff going on. 
did a little retooling of the recording space. with the addition of a great river me1-nv preamp paired with an audio technica at4040 microphone and some acoustic treatment, things are sounding better than ever.
on the tracking front, i had the chance to get long time friend scott paris on a track. it is turning out great! i am also workign on a track with harpcity harper, and will be featured on a track on chris lucas’s soon to be released full length. the track is called “been on my grind” and the cd is titled “if words could kill”, so be sure to check that out when it drops in the middle of this coming month.
stay tuned for a teaser of the new tracks.

lyrics for the 10 new tracks in the works are being written as the inspiration hits. have a couple tracks worth so far. only a matter of time until i hit the studio to drop another 3 tracks. feeling cautiously motivated about bringing some new material to light.
in other news, if you have sent your info about getting hold of a free sticker, hold tight. they will be on their way as soon as i get a chance.
