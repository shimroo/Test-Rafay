cbt 

the national association of cognitive-behavioral therapists (nacbt) was established in 1995 and has trained and certified thousands of throughout the united states and abroad.  the nacbt’s focus from its inception has been the promotion of cognitive-behavioral therapy (cbt) within the mental health field as well as to the general public.  cbt is sometimes also called cognitive behavior therapy.

the nacbt is the only eclectic cbt organization in the usa, meaning that we accept and support members with varied cbt preferences.  some members prefer and practice rational emotive behavior therapy (rebt), while others prefer rational behavior therapy (rbt), rational living therapy (rlt), or cognitive therapy (beck).
the nacbt was formed in response to a growing trend of mental health professionals labeling themselves “cognitive-behavioral therapists” when in fact their actual practice of counseling / psychotherapy did not resemble cbt.    for example, those therapists were not teaching that feelings and behaviors are caused by thoughts.  they were not teaching rational self-counseling skills.  they were not providing homework / self-help assignments for the client to complete between sessions.  they were dwelling on the past, rather than focusing on the present.  they were not guided by a system, but rather simply using “tools”.  
as a result, we formed the nacbt to create standards for certification and to provide training to mental health professionals who were interested in performing cbt theapy in its various forms.  we have provided cbt training and supervision to thousands of professionals and paraprofessionals throughout the world.  our cbt trainings are provided via live “in person” trainings, as well as webinars and home study programs.
we offer both professional and student memberships.   we welcome professionals from all countries to join the nacbt.
