learn about the ice age floods, and much more!during the most recent ice age (18,000 to 13,000 years ago), and probably in previous ice ages, the greatest known glacial-outburst floods in the america’s inundated portions of the pacific northwest. huge ice age glacial-outburst floods occurred in other parts of the world as well, and even in our own times much smaller outburst floods have occurred in many places.. could cataclysmic floods on this scale happen again?with global warming now a serious concern, there is also concern that failures of the antarctic or greenland ice sheets may produce cataclysmic sea level changes. in the far distant future long-term climate cycles may cause large ice sheets to return. then similar cataclysmic outburst floods may happen again, possibly even in this region.

				ice age floods national geologic trail				






drive the ice age floods national geologic trail 







the ice age floods national geologic trail is a network of marked touring routes extending across parts of montana, idaho, washington, and oregon, with several special interpretive centers located across the region. the national park service is bringing together many interested partners to develop an interpretive program at remarkably low cost despite the extraordinary size of the region. the trail represents the largest, most systematic, and most cooperative effort yet proposed to bring the dramatic story of the ice age floods to the public’s attention with potential to bring significant economic and cultural benefits to communities throughout the northwest. the role of the national park service is to coordinate and manage the planning of the project and the telling of the story, not to manage any more land than it already is responsible for. the trail is being developed on existing public lands with no changes in jurisdiction and no threats to private property rights. click here to read more.
