 1986 vfr track bike out of parts



captain 80s replied to 
captain 80s's topic in earlier vfrs






			the spacers to properly position the f2 wheel in a vfr are the exact same for an f3 wheel, regardless of year.
 


	 
 


	and the distance collar (inner bearing spacer) is the same part, as is the swingarm from 96-97 (and 98)
 


	 
 


	collar a distance 96 
	 42620-kv3-830 
	collar a distance 97 
	 42620-kv3-830
 


	 
	 
		swingarm 96 
		 52200-mal-305za 
		swingarm 97 
		 52200-mal-305za
	 



	 
 


	the flange, final driven (sprocket hub) and inner collar did change part numbers in 97, but it was to accommodate a different bearing.  dimensions where it matters for mounting are the same.  i have swapped around f2, f3, f4 and vtr1000f hubs.
 


	 
 


	the rear wheel does change in the last section of the part number for 97, but i think maybe the supplier changed.  critical dimensions remain the same, based on all of the associated parts and my experience.
 


	 
 


	cheers keny.

 1986 vfr track bike out of parts



keny replied to 
captain 80s's topic in earlier vfrs






			i recall back in the day when the f3 came whit a 5" wide wheel, as other manufacturers, dunlop had different casting's of the 160/60 for 4,5 as 5,0 wide rims, not so anymore. but yes i like the profile to that the wider rim give 
 


	many say you need different spacers for the f3 rear wheel, but what i have found out is there is 2 different f3, rear wheels, the 95/96 use same spacer between bearings as the f2 but 97/98 has a different spacer, trough don't know what difference between them other than part number.....

 brake feel - can it be improved?



mbrane replied to 
fabio222's topic in sixth generation vfr's






			my 2 girls have different feel despite having identical specs. when i worked for a trucking company we once got 4 identical spec new trucks, and they all drove/shifted a little different. it's the nature of mechanical things i think. just like guitars/amps, tools etc. variances in tolerances.

 bls footpeg block install



ughandi replied to 
veefer800canuck's topic in modifications






			hello from the future! i am trying to get the defibrillators on an old thread! 
	after installing the 954 rearset adapters, my knees have, in fact, not been that breezy! (in a bit of pain, actually) 
	 
 


	i'd like to not shell out the cash for the lux sato rearsets, the mfw "vario" system seems to be too complicated (and parts availability is scarce here in the usa), and the buell xb lower rider footpegs have the other winged creature on it.... and it seems impossible to source now... 
	 
	so are these still in production?😁 other ideas for sourcing drop pegs instead?

 another brake delinking (approach for the front)



jzh replied to 
worfje's topic in fifth generation vfr's






			well, if he's going to sell the brackets, there's probably a (small) market for a simple(r) bolt-on solution.
 


	 
 


	in addition to the sp2 calipers, there are 3-4 visually similar versions of those calipers available with different piston sizes.  929, 954, etc.  i used to have some black ones from an early cbr600rr on my rc36 (or were they from an f4i?)  matched with the correct master cylinder, they are all more than adequate.  (i also had vtr1000f calipers on my first vtr1000f fork conversion, and they worked well--just not as well as the newer design.)

 brake feel - can it be improved?



fabio222 replied to 
fabio222's topic in sixth generation vfr's






			meant to come back to all of your good folks on this...
 


	 
 


	i took the nice milled aftermarket levers off of my vfr 750 and put them on the 800. 
 


	 
 


	man, the levers made all the difference! i'd already cleaned and greased the calipers so i knew they were in good shape and the fluid is fresh in both brake and clutch reservoirs. 
 


	 
 


	the new levers allow me to use the clutch far more effectively and the new front brake lever is more adjustable but, more importantly, allows for far more "feel". i can now feel how much brake pressure i am applying.
 


	 
 


	the brakes, as they always were, are plenty powerful for me, but i now know what they are doing too. 
 


	 
 


	simple as that, new levers! 
 


	 
 


	by the way, these are the levers. cheap and cheerful. i've had them for about 7 years now and they've been very nice to use on my rc36. generic chinese levers, nothing fancy.

juniper pass


	i took a day off from work and also from my bicycle training to take out the veefalo one last time before the weather turns ugly, supposed to snow the rest of the week and possibly start sticking to the ground along the colorado front range. i took a leisurely pace up hwy 105 toward morrison and got reacquainted with the bike since its been over a month since i took any sort of twisties on it at all, hwy 105 is a scenic ride along the front range between denver and colorado springs, its mostly easy fast sweepers and lite traffic so its a favorite road of mine when going north. then i have to negotiate a bit of traffic near highlands ranch and up hwy 470 into the mountains. i decided to take the morrison exit and try either lookout mountain or head up golden gate canyon - this time it was lookout mountain, i was sort of making it up on the fly as i went along. lookout mountain is my old bicycling haunt from my days while i was working at coors, its a killer ride and all uphill - i don't think i could do it today if i had to, not quite there yet! i saw a whole bunch of riders doing it though and wished i was in shape enough to be there doing it as well. 30 more lbs and i will be able to do it! on this day i would do it on the veefalo instead.


	 


	 


	 


	 


	i took a video from the gateway to the top at the lookout mountain state park, getting past riders, the guy in the green jacket actually pretty much astounded me with how far he had gotten in the short time it took me to set up my camera, some 3 miles at least and up to the gateway from the turn off at hwy 6! amazing i thought. i took the first two turns slow then got more comfortable as i went up further, till i was doing well, i made some gearing mistakes and took the tight 15mph marked hairpins in the wrong gear so i lugged it a bit on one or two. still enjoyed it though and then got off at the top and hiked over a rock outcropping for an overview of the road for the pictures below.

	from there i headed up interstate 70 to idaho springs for a beer at the tommy-knockers brewery, i was the only customer in the joint - slow day for them so they treated me like a king! i got a nice tour of the place sort of impromptu, they made me a nice pastrami sandwich on rye and with the brown ale it was fantastic. i must say the beer is much better there than in the bottles - its always good at the brewery. i am glad i stopped

	i finished my lunch and since the road to mount evans is right there i headed up squaw pass hoping to get in some nice pictures i wasn't expecting what i found, ice in all the shady parts




icy patches on squaw pass definitely taking it easy on that road


	there were some section where the ice covered the whole road for 300 yards or so i had to roll through it with my legs out to help keep the bike from sliding and falling over, i took it real slow. a ford pickup was right behind me so i pulled over to let him pass but the guy was going slower then even i was so i pressed on - in places where i could see i just cut over to the oncoming lane and out of the ice where the sun was shining on the road more, but some places there was not alternative so i just had to go slow, good thing it wasn't slick but rather they tossed some gravel over the worst parts so i had some traction!


	i did stop for pictures in all the best spots

										i am back !
									





not that it matters and not that i expect anyone had noticed, but to those who sent me "where are you?" i would like to say i am back. not only that i am officially returning to vfrd after nearly 2 months break but i have also ridden my hawk last weekend and had fun! let me restate that; i had major fun riding! something i have almost given up on. 
most of you have been riding your whole adult lives and riding is not only a hobby to you, it is part of you. but i started riding three years ago and even though i have encounter some setbacks, till this spring i loved riding with whole my heart. however, i have always considered riding as my hobby. as a hobby which suppose to make my life better, more fun and more rich. life is too short to do something which we don't fully love. 
my love of riding received a first major scar this spring: i lost a friend on the racetrack. he was a total stranger who offered me his help after i lowsided at cmp track last year. i still remember hearing his "hi, my name is todd, do you need help?" while i was duct-taping my roadrash from ripped jacket. he helped me straighten up the shifter and we kept in touch. the next time we saw each other was the day he died. 
with 9 months delay, i can say that todd's death shook me more than i have realized. it rooted fear in me which was fueled by seeing and hearing about others getting hurt over and over again. if i was to summarize this year - it would be one big accident report. i became sensitive to every broken bone, every roadrash, every lowside. and even though i did 10 track days this year, i became slower and slower and slower. suddenly, i have acquired this 'grandma' riding style on the road, frozen with fear that behind every corner there is car standing in my lane, or major sand trap or deer staring at me ... i was crippled with fear not only for me about also for my fellow rider. 
so, at the end of this year, i rode more and more by myself. i could not bear the feelings of responsibility for others on the road and my lines were crippled by my own fears. it all culminated this fall at wdgah. in a freaky accident love2rideh82crash was taken down by a truck crossing into our lane. i was done. i finished the weekend, locked the vfr into a garage and took a break. 
until the last weekend, i pretended that motorcycles do not exists. as a last instance after 2 months break from riding, i decided to go to cmp track to see if i can still have fun. i also felt like i should go for the memory of todd. i went and i had fun! i had much more fun than i expected and the most fun on track i can remember. suddenly the whole track connected into an uninterupted line of turns and i felt one with the bike riding around! i was giggling like a little girl in my helmet and keep on giggling ever since 
granted i was not the fastest one and through out the weekend, i have never exceeded about 60% of my riding abilities, but i had no "oh-shit" nor 'blond' moments. i could have maybe go faster, i could have brake later for the turns and i could have lean further, but i am no rossi nor stoner. i decided to ride for fun and i had amazing blast riding well within my comfort zone. 
i was proud of myself when, after bandaging ricks arm, i was able to distance myself and go back to riding without the year-long fear. i did feel bad for him but the feelings were not crippling my lines nor my mind. and when a total stranger came to me and said "hi, my name is todd", my heart stopped for a minute though but i suddenly knew that my life went a full circle. i probably will never win motogp :idea3: , but i am back! :wheel:
