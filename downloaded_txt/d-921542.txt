it all starts with you! choose your magazine.see the world through the eyes of the saints.to our readers:from the housetops is a catholic magazine dedicated to the immaculate heart of mary while promoting her cause in the present conflict with the powers of darkness.the purpose of from the housetops as the name implies, is to proclaim to all, the authentic doctrines in faith and morals of the one true church in a clear and uncompromising manner in the face of ever increasing dissent and confusion among clergy, religious, and laity.our divine saviour commanded that the teachings of his religion were not to be a private and personal matter, kept in the hidden recesses of one’s heart. he said, “that which i tell you in the dark, speak ye in the light: and that which you hear in the ear, preach ye from the housetops.” (matthew 10:27)the catholic faith is rich with the truth and wisdom which alone gives the real peace and happiness everyone seeks. it contains priceless traditions handed down by the apostles, martyrs and saints—all carefully guarded by the popes to be our inheritance. it need only be taught as our lord commanded, to bear fruit.from the housetops presents the inspirational lives of the saints, along with meditations, instructions, and articles on church history. it is the desire of the editors, that a strong love and zeal for the traditions of the faith be stirred up among the american laity, thereby fostering a militant catholicism, worthy of a country which has been dedicated to the immaculate conception.with these goals in mind, from the housetops is published quarterly from saint benedict center by the slaves of the immaculate heart of mary, a religious congregation of two communities: one of brothers and one of sisters.members live according to vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, and are loyal to pope francis in the preservation of the catholic faith.will you join us in attaining our goals by your prayers and by sharing your copy of from the housetops with your friends?the editors

 saint benedictthe importance of catholic readingthe value and importance of spiritual reading in one’s life today cannot be over emphasized. surrounded as we are by constant bad news, immoral advertisements, and noxious entertainment, one has to regularly raise his thoughts heavenwards and realize that he is a pilgrim striving to reach his everlasting home in heaven.as the body cannot remain healthy while constantly eating junk food, so also the soul cannot remain pure while constantly feeding upon the corruption and toxic media that surrounds him.the publishing of from the housetops magazine is an apostolate of the slaves of he immaculate heart of mary to provide good traditional catholic reading.saint alphonsus wrote: “as the reading of bad books fills the mind with worldly and poisonous sentiments; so on the other hand, the reading of pious works fills the soul with holy thoughts and good desires.he continues, “the soul that is imbued with holy thoughts in reading is always prepared to banish internal temptations.”when one starts to think of god and makes him a part of his life, god will deign to direct him in a clear manner.  saint jerome points out, “when we pray we speak to god; but when we read, god speaks to ussaint ignatius turned from his worldly pursuit of glory and fame as a soldier by providentially reading a few books on the lives of the saints.saint augustine, while on the road to conversion prayed, “lord, make me chaste but not yet,” until he heard children at play repeatedly saying, “tolle, lege.” take and read, take and read. taking this as a message from god, he picked up the epistle of saint paul to the romans and read a passage appropriately meant for him. “let us walk honestly, as in the day, not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and impurities, not in contention and envy, but put ye on the spirit of jesus christ and make not provision for the flesh and its concupiscences.”saint bernard concludes, “spiritual reading and prayer are the arms by which hell is conquered and paradise won.”take the wise advice of the saints and read the lives of the saints and pious writings. sign up for a free subscription of the online version of from the housetops and have access to the following issues.  all you need to do is click on the “free subscription” link above and give you first name and email. your information will never be shared and will remain secure.
