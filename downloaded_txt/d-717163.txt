friday, july 28, 2006everytime i get up he follows under my heels, no matter how asleep he is. as i run away from everything i have ever known. just whisper in my ear:"and the tears come streaming down your face when you lose something you can't replace when you love some one but it goes to waste could it be worse? lights will guide you home and ignite your bones and i will try to fix you high up above or down below when you're too in love to let it go but if you never try you'll never know just what you're worth lights will guide you home"so obvious. so much more brilliant than i could ever imagine to be.be bright and shine. its dark. im sorry ive come so off course.tell the pilot to clear us to land in your backyard.posted by xo @ 11:02 pm    seriously, am i the only one getting sick of this motherfucker?if it wasn't for patrick, joe, and andy, i wouldn't listen to fall out boy anymore.  pete's sold out.yeah yeah yeah, i know about the charity shit and appreciate him for it, but there's some things he's doing that's quite annoying to me.

blogspot entry that's longer than his dick...erm...what?
[friday the 28th

wednesday, july 26, 2006and we conspire against ourselves. ("are you lying?" only if her lips are moving). you spend every waking moment and many sleeping ones thinking of one heart, one person. you let it slip, they let it slip. who knows where it all begins or ends. but as it falls to pieces you keep grabbing them and collecting them less like for a museum of things that used to matter and more like you are going to keep putting it back together. except there are always a few pieces missing each time. deep breaths. slow your heart beat. the road winds. there was a time before you always felt like this. try to remember pete. you are being pulled in every direction. everything is bigger under the microscope. you want it to be simple. you make it complicated. "hey, pete- i am middle ground. how come we've never met before". sometimes i wish i could re-engineer the path from my heart to the tip of my tongue and let my head have a shot at it. i dont got big dreams, i just want to be okay. it comes down to my word versus your word versus the worlds word and i dont think i want to anymore. im worn out. my head is full, my eyes are empty. the dog loves the salt in the corners of my eyes and on my cheeks- i am nervous about cutting it from his diet. and i could never take care of him the way you could. i am a mess and have no idea, ever. i am constantly reminded of how much better i could and should be, and jealous of it, from the children on the street walking hand in hand with their mothers to the homeless man content with his world of a bench. and noone knows the way i spend my nights counting the individuals grains in the tiles in the bathroom, the coolness of the floor the only comfort- or if anyone does they dont want to hear it, i cant blame you... i dont even want to hear it anymore. in the mornings the world is blurry. it comes in and out of focus. this is when its the worst. when i awake from a dream to realize that none of it was real, possibly ever.one of the only things stranger than realizing you are along in this world, is realizing that you are not.pupils the size of baby worlds.every bad decision is put on file for later viewing. mapquest your way back to me, take a turn for the worse and then continue for .5 miles. i want to file a restraining order against myself.and i want to be myself again looking at my reflection in your eyes from the first time i failed you. i am nostalgic for disaster. i want it back.he sleeps sound. he has no care for what buzzes and changes in the world around him.because of this i envy him.run away from a city because of one single heartbeat. it doesnt make sense.its not that i dont trust you, actually it is. and i dont trust myself when i think of you. i sell myself out.i wish you were awake right now. i just want to let myself be happy.posted by xo @ 3:53 am

i'm getting sick of pete wentz, but here's an album update
[friday the 28th
]





thursday, july 27, 2006so its been awhile since the promised update.why has it been taking so long?excessive procrastination and indecision-and a love/hate relationship with words,possibly combined with a honeymoon romance with some new songs.we officially went into the studio today. we are going to be recording somewhere between 12 and 15 songs and should end up with about 12 or so on the new record.yes, there are love songs. yes, there are songs about the world around us (more than just stupid boys in bands singing about infamous girls), but there are a bunch of those songs as well. more updates on songs and new record very soon. expect to hear the first single this winter and the new record very early next year.i have had the chance to do some work with a childrens charity called children uniting nations and the dodgers have asked me to throw out the first pitch at their game on huly 29th in celebration of the charity. so tune in and watch me throw like a girl. but really check out the charity- and as well we would like to become more involved in some charitable ventures- so if you have any ideas or any organizations that you particularly love please tell us.new clandestine fall line is looking pretty sick. there is a set of tshirts to be included called "fancy kid"- hilarious. go out and buy the new gym class heros record and give your ears a chance to feel ok.now go outside and play.currently in love with:grapecrush the grapecrush puppyclashing colorsnew songsbutch walkernight swimming, day dreamingstripes on stripesgch record loud with the windows down10 dollars at tiffanysfeeling newthe time has come the walrus said to talk of many things.posted by: peterabbit

blogspot update
[tuesday the 25th
]



sunday, july 23, 2006we used to talk on the phone every single day (nooneknowshowitreallygoes). its strange the way people will window shop on your life or score it for style and grace.my personality and everything about me is just a carefully constructed collage of magazine articles and flashy pictures.i am (not) real.the puppy is purple after spilling a grape soda on himself. he then ate the tropic of cancer by miller. paperback, so i guess it went down easier.sometimes the days spent all by myself in my head are the scariest.its enough to make you want to pack it up and call it a day.all i can do is read and write and wait. ihavecodedmessagesforyou.aretheygettingthrough.posted by xo @ 8:32 pm

pete finally updated something
[sunday the 23rd
]



before i post it, just let me say, i am begining to dislike pete more and more each day.saturday, july 22, 2006my phone cuts out in the same place every single day ("the gospel of gossip"). it feels like there is so much to say.but it can only be said in songs.please dont go so quickly."the city with fires of night seemed an archipelago    women asked the love and for the dulie    but in my eyes of male horror i remember    the busy ones of the evening were never pretty    then the day returned but sometimes without sun    to draw up the houses coast at coast at the edge of the streets    where our lives with the other similar lives are mislaid    lives trailing their shade while passing in the street    intercalated in the year they was widowed days    bloody and slow fridays of burials    white and whole blacks come from the skies which cry    when the woman of the devil beat her lover"guillame appolinairesend me a flashlight. i cant seem to find my faith.iwishicould.posted by xo @ 2:17 pm

saturday, july 08, 2006the fraternal order of the handsome boy. ive been watching you from afarmy breath on the inside window as you walk in from the carcandy caned lies in red and white against clashing patterns bending in and out of understanding."youre the stranger ive been dreaming of", stranger than any ive ever known.love through a telescopic lens. when the air is clear i can see how perfect you are for me.late at night when the city sleeps i cast a spell on youto make you think of me the very same way i think of you.i only love how the words feel in my head when i write them.fireworks over the valley. how can i tell you i gut people for a living.that everything you say is likely to end up as evidence when i rewrite history.over and over again.how everything you do reminds me of something else, someone else.how i get paid to be humble and arrogant at the same time,to be chased and never caught.that i just want to stay up late and wake up early to talk to you.that i want to show you all of my jealousy and insecurity and have you not care.youre like a light switch and i just want to turn you on and watch them all shrink away.the words come out of my fingertips on impulse. it is instinct. my head cant keep up.i envy the comatose. i admire the bedridden.i am addicted to the way i feel when i think of you."im blowing smoke rings around the moon...."i wish i was the exact opposite of how the world knows me.posted by xo @ 3:25 pm
