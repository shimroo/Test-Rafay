the african tortoise site was created to provide a knowledge 

	base for sulcata and leopard tortoises keepers. the focus of this site,  is to create a 

	better understanding of these unique and often misunderstood animals. this 

	information was amassed from experienced breeders and keepers and published 

	references. this site is continuously updated. check back often.
special thanks to:

theresa chirico for all the hours spent discussing care and 
		nutrition...and for being my friend
		
		theresa and i spent considerable time together working on the content of 
		this site. our plan was to publish it in the spring of 2002. 
		unfortunately she passed on before we could create the site. a year 
		after her death i decided to create this site as a memorial to her and 
		her hard work.

		the
