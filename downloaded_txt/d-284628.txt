what i write











from short stories to poetry, newsletters and opinion pieces to my favorite writing, songs, i am always writing something. what i remember from an early age as an interest is music, so if there is anything in my life that i would classify as talent, music would be it. but it was not what i would describe as a “natural” talent and becoming proficient has been hard, hard work for sixty years. what might be a more innate talent or capability is creativity, which i express as writing and as musical composition including lyrics, a desire and drive that i came by naturally as the child of two artists. early on, my creative expression was in poetry. after my grandfather gave me a guitar when i was thirteen, the poetry and storytelling that most called to me was and still is in song.
