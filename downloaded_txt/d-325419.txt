how do our packages work? 











as a full-service lodge, your stay includes accommodation, meals and fishing. 
boats are exclusive use, meaning that just you and your party will be using your chosen boat during theentirety of your stay. because of this, our packages are priced per angler, with different pricing based on how many anglers are on your boat, and how many days you will be fishing, as well as when you choose to travel (by season). 
shoreside guests who are not fishing are charged a single per person rate, depending on the length of stay.
