protecting land in perpetuity.



the georgia-alabama land trust (galt) is the largest regional land trust in the southeast. we protect and steward nearly  1,300 conservation properties totaling over 484,000 acres across georgia, alabama, and adjacent states —and we are working hard to preserve even more critical wildlife habitat, prime soil, and other important lands that make the southeast a special place.



















our mission




enriching life through land protection.the southeastern united states has one of the highest concentrations of biodiversity in the world and contains incredibly productive soils for growing both crops and trees.  these critical resources are threatened by habitat fragmentation, land-use practices, and other factors.  galt’s work protects habitat, land, scenic views, and natural resources thereby enriching life for people and animals both now and into the future.
