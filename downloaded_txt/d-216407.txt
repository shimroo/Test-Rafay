    horse business start-up problems


 by paul carrazzo
•
january 8, 2024

as we enter the 2024 season of major yearling and breeding stock sales, our office again prepares for the inevitable calls from new clients with their “how do i start and structure a new horse business” questions.                                                                                                            getting the start-up on a solid tax foundation is crucial, yet in our troubleshooting we often see a worrying lack of thought put into this phase. undoubtedly, advisers are most commonly tripped up by the fact that “hobby” horse stock has to become “business” stock, a step that often also involves setting up a new business structure (e.g., a company, trust or partnership).                                                                                                                         if you want to get a start-up right, it’s well worth your while to review this article as i will raise the problems and tax-traps i frequently come across.                                                                                                                        1.   ignoring the non-commercial loss (ncl) rules                                                      due to the inherent nature of breeding and racing activities and the time lag before any income is derived, tax losses are often derived in the first few years – sometimes it can take 5 years plus before a profit is derived.                                                      this reality means you ignore the ncl rules at your own peril!                                                      the ncl rules only apply to individuals, alone or in partnership.                                                      the ncl rules prevents an individual’s losses from non-commercial business                                                                   activities being immediately offset against the individual’s other assessable income in the year the loss is incurred.                                                                                                                                     the loss is deferred to be offset against future income from the same business activity (e.g., horse breeding),                                              unless                                               :                                                                                             the individual meets the income requirement (i.e., “adjusted taxable income” (ati) – refer definition below) from other activities is                                                  less than $250,000                                                   and the business activity satisfies                                                  one                                                   of the following                                                  four                                                   tests:                                                                                             assessable income test - the business produces assessable income of at least $20,000 for the income year;                                                           profits test - the business has produced a taxable income in three out of the last five income years (including the current income year);                                                           real property test - the value of real property (i.e. land and buildings) used in the business is at least $500,000; or                                                           other assets test - the value of certain other assets (e.g., trading stock and depreciating assets - excluding cars, motorcycles and similar vehicles) used in the business activity is at least $100,000.                                                                                            the individual has a business activity that is eligible for an exception; or                                                                        the ato exercises its discretion to allow the loss for the business activity for one or more income years. it is these rules that have been modified in this new pcg.                                                                                                                        for reference, adjusted taxable income (ati) noted above includes the sum of:                                                                   taxable income for that year (e.g., wages less work-related deductions);                                                                         reportable employer superannuation contributions (“rescs”) for that year;                                                                        total net investment losses for that year; and                                                           reportable fringe benefits for that year.                                                                                                                        1.1.      the problem?                                                                   where a high income earning client, i.e., they have other income on or beyond $250,000 (e.g., wages), wants to run the business as an individual (alone or in partnership, they must go through the onerous, costly and time consuming task of seeking an ato private ruling  to be able to claim those losses immediately, furthermore a poor application could mean that they must defer those losses immediately.                                                                               individual high-income earners could thus be deprived of tax relief if they are caught up in the ncl rules and unable to claim their tax losses immediately.                                                                  maybe another tax structure could have been considered?                                                                                                            2.0 tax implications on transfer of stock                                                                   this problem arises where valuable stock is transferred to a                                              new tax structure                                               when the business commences.                                                                  what is overlooked is that the stock is converting from “hobby” to “business” stock and this “hobby” stock is considered a “capital” asset under income tax rules.                                                                  capital assets are subject to the capital gains tax (cgt) provisions when they are disposed of. it is irrelevant that no money changes hands as under the cgt rules the disposal of stock to a new entity is a “deemed” disposal at                                               market value                                              .                                                      the only relief from these cgt provisions is if the horse is a “personal use asset” (e.g., a racehorse) and cost the taxpayer $10,000 or less (including gst). these horses are exempt from cgt upon disposal.                                                                                                            2.0.1. the problem/implications?                                                                   the horse is subject to cgt and its market value has increased considerably since acquisition. this horse would be subject to cgt to the extent its market value exceeds its eligible cost base.                                                                  to soften the tax blow, where the horse is subject to cgt on transfer, a 50% cgt discount applies if the horse is transferred at least 12 months after acquisition.                                                                                                            2.1. “hobby” to “business” stock if no new entity                                                      the above discusses where the stock is considered to be part of a “business”, but the taxpayer decides to start the “business” in a different entity, e.g., from a sole trader to a trust.                                                      however, it is most common for a sole trader taxpayer to move from ‘hobby” to “business” without changing the entity. where this occurs the income tax law relating to items “becoming trading stock for the first time” must be considered.                                                                   in this case, the taxpayer is treated as having sold the item at either cost or market value (at the taxpayer's option), and as having reacquired it for the same amount. this has the effect that a deduction is allowed to the taxpayer for the cost or                                              market value                                               of the item at the time of the change, being a deduction for the cost of acquiring trading stock.                                                                                                                        note – for the purposes of the “cost” option, an “in-foal” broodmare can have the cost of the service fee for the foal “in the belly” added to its cost price – our office was advised of this via an ato private ruling we submitted.                                                                                                            2.1.1. the problem/implications?                                                      where these rules are overlooked, there are two major implications:                                                      a)   stock that is subject to cgt which has increased considerably in value, need only be transferred at its “cost” value, thus triggering no tax implications when a horse tax business is set-up; and                                                      b)  stock could be transferred at market value, without triggering tax implications, if that stock is cgt exempt, i.e., it is a personal use asset acquired for $10,000 or less (refer above).                                                                                                            3.0 another business entity does not have “magic” powers for your horse activities                                                      let me explain what i mean.                                                      i often have potential clients approach me and ask whether they can place their horse activities, say a breeding activity, into their existing business entity, say a company, on the basis that “oh..it’s ok…my company runs my other retailing business, which means that the breeding activity will also be considered by the ato as a tax “business”.                                                      no!                                                      the ato looks at each activity individually to ensure that each one has a tax “business” status. for example, merely placing one hobby broodmare into your existing business company does not mean that one mare is considered a “breeding business” activity.                                                                                                            4.0  claiming pre-gst on stock acquired                                                      4.1 companies                                                                   to get around the situation where pre-establishment gst can be “lost” on a new business start-up, the gst act provides an exception to the general operation of the gst rules for all the pre-establishment costs of a                                              company                                               . upon its creation and registration for gst, the company can claim back gst for these pre-establishment costs if the necessary requirements are met.                                                                                                                        4.1.1 eligible pre-establishment costs                                                      to claim gst credits for these pre-establishment costs of a company the following seven criteria must apply:                                                                   the purchase must be for the purpose of bringing the company into existence or carrying on a business after it comes into existence                                                                         the company must come into existence and be registered for gst                                                  no more than six months                                                   after the purchase                                                                        you must become a shareholder, officer or employee of the company                                                                         the company must have                                                  fully reimbursed                                                   you for the cost of the purchase                                                                        the purchase must not be used to make input-taxed sales or for private purposes                                                           to avoid “double dipping” the company must not be entitled to a gst credit for the purchase, if it subsequently acquires the thing from you                                                           you must not be entitled to claim a gst credit for the purchase.                                                                                                                        the gst act does this by treating an acquisition or importation made by a future shareholder, director/secretary or employee of the company as being an acquisition or importation of the company upon (not before) its creation.                                                                                                            of the seven requirements listed above, the most difficult to meet are:                                                                   the “six-months” rule; and                                                           the “fully reimbursed” requirement (see below) for the shareholder, director or employee who incurred the expense.                                                                                                                        4.1.2 what does “fully reimbursed” mean?                                                      in relation to acquisitions only, the acquisition does not qualify as a pre-establishment acquisition unless the member, officer or employee is "fully reimbursed" by the company for the consideration for the acquisition. in other words, before the relevant gst can be claimed back, the company must reimburse the individual not only for the gst-exclusive cost of the thing acquired, but also for any gst on the thing acquired.                                                                                                            4.1.3 what costs are eligible?                                                      the costs eligible include:                                                                   set-up fees (e.g. accounting fees, company cost, business plan);                                                                         business registration;                                                                        plant & trading stock (e.g. broodmares, stallions, pin-hook stock, service fees);                                                           business premises; and                                                           gst on importation.                                                                                                                        example 1 – claiming pre-gst establishment costs for a company                                                      in may 2020, andre engages alex & co, accountants, to prepare a horse industry business plan for his yet to be incorporated company. andre receives the plan in october 2020.                                                      the company is set-up in december 2020 and is registered for gst in january 2020. the company can claim back the gst referable to the services of alex & co. this is because andre "made" the acquisition when the business plan was supplied, which was within 6 months of the company coming into existence and becoming gst-registered.                                                                                                            4.2  all other entities (e.g., sole traders, partnerships and trusts)                                                                   there is a special gst adjustment rule which states that an entity may claim gst relating to                                              opening stock on hand                                               if it becomes registered or required to be registered for gst. simply put, the gst act will deem the acquisition of the stock on hand by the entity prior to its registration as a creditable acquisition and thereby allowing the entity to claim the associated gst.                                                                               the special adjustment rule only applies to stock on hand. that is, any other items (including capital items) acquired by an entity will not be eligible (unlike companies, as noted above).                                                                                                                        4.2.1   eligibility requirements                                                      this special gst rule applies if an existing entity becomes registered or required to be registered for gst. a gst claim on opening stock will arise at the time of the entity registering or meeting the requirements to be registered if:                                                                   the entity that holds stock is carrying on its enterprise; and                                                           the entity had acquired the stock solely or partly for a business/creditable purpose                                                                                                                                                              i reiterate that this special adjustment rule does not apply to any other items (e.g. plant and equipment) acquired by an entity prior to it becoming registered.                                                                                                                        5.0 past “hobby” losses are not deductible in a new business                                                                   you can only treat your horse activity as a “tax business” if it has met the ato criteria. this article does not go into these factors, but this topic is constantly referred to in many of my other articles – see                                              www.carrazzo.com.au                                  .                                                      once the business case is established and the business is “up and running”, it is only expenditure that relates to the period on or after start date that can be deductible to the business – there is no income tax law that allows the prior expenditure to be deductible.                                                                   to avoid confusion, as noted above,                                              pre-gst                                               can be claimed in certain circumstances, depending primarily on when that gst is incurred and the type of entity that is running the new business.                                                                                                                        please do not hesitate to contact the writer if you wish for me to clarify or

    smsf rules for stallions & mares

how wealthy would i be if i received a dollar for every query i have had on these issues!                                                      buying a stallion (whole or in part via a syndication) or worthwhile commercial broodmare is no cheap exercise and cash-flow needs to be very solid to afford these spends when payment time comes. enter the “cashed-up” self-managed super fund (smsf) solution!                                                      this article will focus on some basic ground rules that need to be met to justify that these acquisitions can be “eligible investments” for your smsf.                                                                                                            1. superannuation investments and the “sole purpose test”                                                      the trustee of a regulated superannuation fund must ensure that the ''sole purpose test'' as prescribed in the superannuation industry supervision act (“sis”) act is satisfied at all times. the sole purpose test requires a fund to be maintained solely for one or more of the ''core purposes'', or for one or more of the core purposes and for ''ancillary purposes''. a fund which is not maintained solely for at least one of the core purposes fails the test, as does a fund which has as one of its purposes a purpose other than a core or ancillary purpose.                                                      “core” and “ancillary” purposes are defined as:                                                      core purposes                                                                   retirement benefits                                                           specified age benefits                                                           pre-retirement death benefits                                                                  ancillary purposes                                                                   resignation/retrenchment benefits                                                           disability benefits                                                           post-retirement benefits                                                           financial hardship benefits                                                           welfare benefits                                                           long service leave benefits                                                           compassionate benefits                                                                  the sole purpose test is a civil penalty provision, and trustees may be liable to civil and criminal proceedings if the provision is breached.                                                                                                            1.1 current sis investment standards                                                      superannuation funds should ensure that they carefully evaluate their compliance with the sis investment standards.                                                      as a general rule, a fund must:                                                                   have an investment strategy;

                                                          if the item is transferred to a related party, it must be independently valued;                                                           the item must not be stored in the private residence of a related party;                                                           the item must not be used by a related party;                                                           the decision on the storage of the item must be recorded and kept for at least 10 years after the decision has been made; and                                                           the item must be insured in the fund’s name.                                                                  it’s obvious from the above, that the very fact that an item such as a racehorse in training must not be “used” or “leased” to a related party now makes them ineligible to be a smsf asset and should be immediately removed to either a related party or outsider for an arm’s length value.                                                      against this background, i comment below as the technical feasibility of having the stallions and mares held in a smsf.                                                                                                            3. stallion shares                                                      to respond to these questions, background on the “sole purpose test” is required.                                                      no matter what type of investment a fund makes, whether it is an exotic investment or an investment in equities, the fund needs to carefully evaluate the investment prior to deciding to make, keep or sell the investment. significantly, the expertise of the trustees of a fund may also have a bearing on the types of investments of the fund – if a trustee has considerable expertise in a particular area (e.g. horse breeder), it may well be that the investment portfolio of the fund will reflect that expertise.                                                      the key questions that trustees need to ask themselves when they are making investment decisions, particularly is a smsf are:                                                                   does the investment satisfy the sole purpose test?                                                           is the investment consistent with the investment strategy of the fund?                                                           does the investment breach any of the sis investment standards (see above)?                                                                  when considering the                                               appropriateness                                                           of the investment in terms of the sole purpose test, the fund needs to consider such things as:                                                                               what is the expected income flow from the investment?                                                           is there any capital appreciation likely to arise from the investment?                                                           if there is only an expected capital appreciation, does the amount of this appreciation justify the lack of income flow?                                                                  having regard to the above investment guidelines, i would consider it unlikely that a smsf investment in a stallion share would cause it to fail the sis “sole purpose test”, reasons where:                                                                   the smsf trustee has significant experience and expertise in the horse racing and breeding industry;                                                           an interest in a commercial stallion should be capable of generating a yearly cash-flow consistent with your fund’s investment strategy. their expected yearly nomination fees should be able to generate a significant return on the funds invested;                                                           unlike many public companies, a shareholder “overs” dividend can be reasonably expected on a year to year basis;                                                           you can secure the smsf’s interest in the asset via insurance;                                                           stallion shares commonly generate capital appreciation. even in years where dividends are low or non-existent, the amount of capital appreciation could easily justify the lack of income; and                                                           most fund investment strategy’s require liquidity from its assets – stallion shares have a fertile secondary market and many avenues exist to enable a relatively quick disposal, e.g. bloodstock agents, auction, industry advertising etc.                                                                                                 service right – cannot be used by a related party                                                      read this section below carefully, the use of a stallion right by your commercial breeding entity is not as straightforward as you might think!                                                      from 1 july 2000 “in-house assets” may not amount to more than five percent of the total market value of a fund’s assets.                                                      under the sisa rules, the definition of an “in-house asset” includes:                                                      “an asset of the fund subject to a lease or lease arrangement between the trustee of the fund and a related party”                                                      a “lease arrangement” is defined in the sisa rules, being:                                                      “any agreement, arrangement or understanding in the nature of a lease (other than a lease) between the trustee of a smsf and another person, under which the right to use, or control the use of, property owned by the fund”.                                                      in effect, this closes off the right for a related party (i.e. your breeding entity) to use a stallion right where the horse market value is greater than 5% of the total market value of the fund’s assets. where this is the case, a related party, such as a breeding business in a related entity, could not use the service right, even where you pay the required “arm’s length” market value fee to the super fund.                                                                                     where 5% test is met                                                      where, however, the stallion value is less than 5% of the total market value of the fund’s assets, to secure the “arm’s length” nature of this investment, the related party must pay the fund a commercial fee where you use the service right for your own breeding activities. the “arm’s length rule” rule also applies to external parties that pay the smsf to use the right. if the fund were of a complying nature, the fee would generate 15% tax within the fund (unless the fund is in pension phase where nil tax applies).                                                                   ﻿                                                                  investment strategy                                                      finally, any investment that your fund undertakes must be consistent with its investment strategy. for example, asset allocation percentages should be in line with the investment strategy currently formulated. if a stallion share is contemplated, i suggest that you adjust these percentages accordingly – fund trustees are encouraged to review investment strategies on a regular basis as and when needed.                                                                                                            4. broodmares                                                      in my professional opinion, it could be reasonably argued that a broodmare can be held in a smsf where she avoids the “personal use asset”/“collectable” designation outlined in the above stricter investment standards. this typically will be achieved where:                                                                   the mare acquired is commercial, reflected primarily in original purchase price;                                                           the mare is used for commercial breeding purposes and all foals are ultimately sold on arm’s length basis. the primary purpose to sell foals is crucial;                                                           the mare and her foals are appropriately insured;                                                           the numbers acquired are not to the extent and scale of an income tax “business” (preferably two or less held for this purpose at any one time);                                                           it is not held as trading stock within the smsf accounts;                                                           she is included in the investment strategy; and                                                           the smsf trustee has capability and experience in the breeding industry.                                                                                                                        5. private ruling for definitive ato opinion                                                      if you or your client base need a definitive ato opinion on this issue, i would suggest you seek a private ruling prior to commencement of the activity.                                                      a private ruling is an expression of the commissioner’s opinion of the way in which a relevant provision applies, or would apply, to an entity in relation to a specified scheme. private rulings are usually made on application by an entity, the entity’s agent or legal personal representative.                                                      the ato should issue the private ruling within 60 days. where this does not happen, the applicant may request the commissioner to issue the private ruling. if a further 30 days passes, the applicant has objection rights.                                                                                                            please do not hesitate to contact the writer if you wish for me to clarify or expand on any of the matters raised in this article.

     dear paul,as we enter into 2022, 6 years since the incorporation of the australian chinese jockey club, i write to thank you, on behalf of acjc, for your support since our incorporation.  not only have you supported us by becoming a member and participating in most of our events, you have also generously provided us with professional advice and updates on various compelling topics in horse tax – this has, in turn, helped a lot of our first-time horse owners in having the confidence in investing in the thoroughbred industry.  you have pointed us in the right direction in setting up our first ownership syndicate – the australian chinese jockey club million dollar racing syndicate which we still hold shares in two very promising stayers, 2021 melbourne cup runners in knights order and sir lucan.you are very highly regarded in our community.wishing you continued success with your practice and racehorses in the coming years and looking forward to seeing you at our events soon.
