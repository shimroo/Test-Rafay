            "ed's pleasant personality combined with true expertise and love for   the
            equine partner makes him highly qualified to pass on an important   eques
            trian culture to a new generation of riders by combining   centuries-old
            european tradition with american cowboy culture.  i received 
            my equestrian education for over 13 years at the spanish riding school 
            in vienna, austria and i can only recommend ed dabney as a role model 
            for   many."

dear ed,
          i did enjoy meeting you in sweden.  further to watching your "six keys to harmony" demonstration.  i just wanted to congratulate you for the high quality of your training.  i am considering you as a "classical" trainer in the sense that you eliminate any constraining instrument and do not use force.  your message founded on deep knowledge and respect to the horse would be very useful on the official scene.  competition is too often meaning results at any price. 
          all the best to the "gentleman cowboy" you are!


yours sincerely,
              philippe karl
