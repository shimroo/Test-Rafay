        jboch


the aclu's policy director ed yohnka claims that all these settlements the city of chicago is paying out in police-related lawsuits demands immediate action.  we concur.  in 2024, chicago paid out $107.5million. those payouts should serve as a call for immediate action for the city to stop paying out “settlements”…

if you're a decent driver in chicago, not only do you have to negotiate olympic-level potholes and endless construction, but thanks to no cash bail, you have to deal with road-raging drivers who shoot at the objects of their ire.  take the two fine gents pictured above, maurice jones, left,…

unbelievably mayor "let's go brandon" johnson's legal team "negotiated" a $1.25m settlement with the family of a would-be cop killer.  dexter reed pulled out his gun instead of his license (assuming he had a valid driver's license) and blasted away at chicago cops who pulled him over.  the boys in…
