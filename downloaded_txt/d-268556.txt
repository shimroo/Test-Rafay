we cultivate, connect, and celebrate u.s. presidential scholars – past, present, and future.







each year, 161 of the nation’s top high school graduates are chosen to be u.s. presidential scholars and are honored by the united states department of education. these scholars go on to advance the arts, culture, business, education, and civic life of the nation. u.s. presidential scholars foundation (psf) and its alumni association committee help scholars achieve their career and community service goals by connecting them to each other and supporting them throughout their lives.most importantly, psf fosters an environment that supports and amplifies the diverse social, intellectual, and professional endeavors of u.s. presidential scholars within their communities. through programs, events, and alumni activities, we work toward a robust and shared vision that fosters opportunities for scholars to engage with each other and participate in intergenerational service, work, and partnerships around the globe. we rely on donations, legacy gifts, and the support of organizations such as youngarts to do our work. u.s. presidential scholars foundation is not affiliated with the commission on presidential scholars or the u.s. presidential scholars program that is part of the u.s. department of education. instead, we operate as a separate 501(c)(3) organization that supports u.s. presidential scholars. “i am very proud to welcome you to the white house as the first presidential scholars. i congratulate you, and i congratulate your parents and your teachers for their part in producing your talents for our times. you are not here today because you are typical or because you are a representative of your generation or your graduating class. you are here because of what you have accomplished, in your own right, and what you have the capacity to accomplish in the future in your own right. you have excelled in the scholarship of your class of 1964. you have the potential to excel even more in the citizenship of your country of 1974, 1984 or 1994.”  - remarks to the 1964 presidential scholars, president lyndon johnson, june 10, 1964

jan 14, 2022




douglas a. samuelson (nevada, 1965) describes himself as “one of the scholars who actually tried to do what president johnson urged us to do: improve our society.” he adds, “i’ve been mostly unsuccessful at that, but at least i gave it a good try. there were a few little milestones here and there.”well, yes, here and there. after college at cal – berkeley, he moved to washington, dc in 1975 to become a federal policy analyst. in that role, in 1980, he played a significant analytical role in the us v. exxon price regulation case that depended on determining when “a significant change in producing patterns” had occurred in a large oil field. the resulting verdict, over $2 billion, was the largest in the history of the federal civil courts at the time.

julian cook - 2009 scholar



dec 4, 2018




in 2009 julian cook’s powerful baritone voice won him recognition as a presidential scholar in the arts (il).  today he still sings, but it’s his voice as a scholar, innovator, educator, and community leader that’s earning him center stage.julian grew up on the south side of chicago, a grandson of mississippi sharecroppers who moved to illinois in the 1940s. he always sang, but he didn’t recognize his artistry as anything special because he thought everybody could sing. his mother, grandmother, and sister always sang, and music was a big part of his church life.

catherine dekle and nicole dekle collins - 1985 scholars



nov 6, 2018




catherine and nicole dekle have answered just about every identical twin question there is.  “we get asked a lot whether we have esp,” said nicole dekle collins, an editor at the wall street journal. “we don’t.” a physician based in atlanta, catherine offers a plausible explanation for twin telepathy. “i remember once we were cooking in the kitchen, and i turned to nicole and asked if she remembered this one time we went to the beach. she said she had just been thinking about that, too. but we realized it was because we had both heard fragments of a song and, because we had the same shared experiences, it brought up the same memory.”

michelle wu - 2003 scholar



dec 1, 2016




watching boston city council president michelle wu in action today, most people would guess she'd been a consummate politician all her life. not so. a political career was the farthest thing from her mind in 2003, when she was named a u. s. presidential scholar from illinois. although she planned to attend harvard, she was unsure of a particular career path. “i would never have predicted that i would be in politics," she said. "even if someone had asked me to make a short list of careers i could see myself in, politics wouldn’t have been on that list.”
