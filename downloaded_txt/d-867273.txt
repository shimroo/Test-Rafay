the grass is not always greener





the wall street journal took an interesting look at the current migration and demographic problems the state of vermont is dealing with. the state benefitted from something of a get me out of the city bid during covid but that has started to reverse due some winding down of the wfh movement, high real estate prices and very high property taxes. if you think about those three reasons, you see they have more impact on younger people which contributes to the state skewing older. forgetting every other moving part, the idea of moving to a less crowded area with a slower pace of life near some sort of natural beauty is going to appeal to a lot of people. that sentiment probably captures how my wife and i felt in our 20's as we set out on a path to that sort of outcome. the following comment resonated though in terms of behavior we've seen here in walker as people have come and gone (this still happens, people move here and do not stay very long). this is nothing new. most urbanites who move anywhere out to
the country don't stay there, though they try to initially. only a few will
stay and put down true roots. the dumbest move of all, is those who take over a
rural b&b and think it will be quaint and cool.the idea of making a big change in life, like uprooting to a small town, is a pursuit of what is hopefully a better life or put another way going on the assumption that the grass is greener on the other side of the hill. things will be better if....we get out of the city or i get that promotion or any others you can think of. it takes tremendous self-awareness to discern between running a way from a problem and making a well thought out lifestyle change that truly aligns with what you actually value. unfortunately, i don't have any secret to share about how to get this right. maybe the answer lies in taking more of an intermediate approach. i've told this story before, make fun if you want, but the catalyst for me going from city kid to semi-rural adult was the tv show northern exposure. it gave permission to live a different life than what 24 year old me envisioned. i visited walker on my second date with my future wife in 1991 and realized it was the answer but we didn't land there full time until 2002. it took a while to get here and then a couple of more to find my career groove as an ria but once i did, i knew that was exactly where i wanted to be. the odds of the grass getting greener were pretty low. there's been the occasional job offer along the way but the autonomy of setting your own schedule is worth a lot to me and anything that hinted of giving that up was non-negotiable. i did side gig at advisorshares and there were some schedule constraints related to meetings but i was working from home and while i don't know if they realized, it was very part time for me. the most important the grass isn't greener moment was of course saying no to being a partner at my old firm. the partners got in a lot of trouble later and i am 99% certain they are banned from practicing again. i didn't think they were capable of malfeasance or nonfeasance but it was clear we did not align on simplicity. i wanted a small practice and they were trying to build an empire. i still have my small practice and the "empire" has fallen. put in a different context, saying no to them turned out to be preventing a problem i didn't even know i would have.looking around a corner or two to prevent or solve your own problems is pretty high on my priority list. the idea of waiting around for them to "fix it" is something i cannot do. some of the scare headlines lately have focused on changes to the healthcare system that, as bad as things have been, will make it even worse. will it actually be worse? i have no idea but the risk to us is that it does get worse, that access to healthcare gets more expensive, wait times get longer or any other negative outcome you can think of. the healthcare system has been an absolute mess for a long time, i certainly have no brilliant ideas about what to do and again, i don't now if it will get worse now but the risk is easy to identify. the risk is it does get worse. this is part of why i'm kind of a health nut, i've always exercised vigorously but have been learning more about the importance of diet for a long time too to minimize the odds of needing to rely on the healthcare system from some point of being desperately sick, needing care but not being able to get it. i think this general approach applies to many or maybe even all aspects of life. if you're 50, you should have at least a general sense of when you want to retire how much you might need (rough number is fine) and where you stand in relation to that number. is there any sort of problem with your numbers adding up the way you need them to? if you've looked at your situation in this type of manner then you've looked around one corner, starting to figure out what you might do about it is looking around a second corner toward solving your own problem.

could complexity be better than simplicity?





torsten slok blogged about how ineffective bonds have been in terms of providing any return or diversification benefits lately in the context of a 60/40 portfolio. he talked about the need to replace bond exposure and stock exposure too but the point he was making about stocks wasn't too clear to me. he said that "there are years when treasuries are not the correct hedge against downside risks in the s&p 500" which is a conversation we've been having here for years. we talk about several different structures that can potentially replace 60/40 as slok is referring to it. some version of the permanent portfolio which includes risk parity, lately we've been talking about portable alpha quite a bit and the one that i think is the simplest, and closest to what i do in real life, is getting rid of most or all of the bond exposure and replacing it with shorter dated fixed income that mostly avoids interest rate risk and long bond volatility as well as various types of alternative strategies the might function as bond market substitutes, strategies with some degree of negative correlation to equities or some sort of uncorrelated absolute return ideas. right or wrong, i think of endowment style investing as being a similar to the permanent portfolio, not so much quadrants but more like disparate asset class segments which gets us to a paper about endowment asset allocation from true north institute. based on the following excerpt;i built out the following leveraged allocation, taking some liberty with shortening the duration quite a bit.the third portfolio is just the vanguard balanced index fund (vbaix). qgmix is a client and personal holding. these portfolios don't really look anything like what we usually play around with here but the results are interesting. despite all the leverage, portfolio 1 has a very smooth ride including up a lot in 2022. it's only down year was 2018 with a decline of 7.91%. both true north portfolios also held up relatively well in the 2020 pandemic crash which are the max drawdown numbers in the chart. i'm not a fan of leverage but that doesn't mean it can't be used effectively. this leverage in the true north portfolio appears to be effective for giving an adequate return with a very smooth ride as i mentioned. it would take a lot of things going wrong at the same time for this mix of disparate asset classes to have a horrible year, more things going wrong than in a plain vanilla 60/40 portfolio. maybe this is an exception that proves the rule about simplicity being better than complexity. and a quick closing note. one of the bloomberg pre-market newsletters mentioned the brand new locorr strategic allocation fund (lsaix) that we've mentioned a couple of times. the context of the newsletter like today's blog post, looking for bond alternatives for a diversified portfolio. and a couple of tidbits about lsaix that i picked up. the managed futures sleeve is multi-manager. none of the managers are replicators and the fund can be long and short the same market. for example the fund could be long tin based on one manager's slower signal and it could be short based on another manager's faster signal. the alternative to being long and short the same market would be netting the two out but lsaix doesn't do that. the information, analysis and opinions expressed herein reflect our judgment and opinions as of the date of writing and are subject to change at any time without notice. they are not intended to constitute legal, tax, securities or investment advice or a recommended course of action in any given situation.

a "safe" way to use a 100/100 fund?





yesterday, we mentioned the pimco stocksplus suite of funds. the pimco stocksplus absolute return fund seems to play right into what we do here in terms of theoretical portfolio construction. the fund has a bunch symbols, i'm going to go with psptx. the fund leverages up 100/100, s&p 500 equities and absolute return. absolute return can be a nebulous concept but the big idea is a low volatility strategy that maintains a relatively even growth rate no matter what is going on in the world. ideally it would be a very boring hold. using testfol.io, i stripped the equities out of psptx using profunds bear fund (brpfx) which has been around much longer than inverse etfs and in doing that, i get the absolute return sleeve compounding at 0.48% per year. i have a feeling that understates the actual return but if nothing else it gives an indication of the behavior of that sleeve. psptx benchmarks to the s&p 500, it outperforms its benchmark but interestingly it does so with more volatility. the absolute return doesn't reduce volatility which surprises me but that first backtest probably isn't how the fund is intended to be used. in 2022, the first two portfolios were down slightly less than the s&p 500 while portfolios 3 and 5 were down more than the s&p 500. psptx also fared worse during the financial crisis and the 2020 pandemic crash. now, we're getting closer to what we play around with here. client/personal holding merfx is merger arb, aqmix is managed futures, psrix is a longer standing floating rate fund with very little volatility that i chose just to extend the backtest. client/personal holding btal is a first responder defensive.portfolios 1 doesn't leverage up, it uses psptx to allow a larger allocation to psrix, more like leveraging down. portfolio 3 does leverage up, it has 70% in equities, compared to 60% for the others and the numbers reflect the leveraging up to 70% equities. all three portfolios held up much better in 2022, dropping 7, 6% and 9% respectively versus 16.87% for vbaix. none of them though helped in the 2020 pandemic crash. portfolio 3 fell the most. is the leveraging up in the third portfolio worth the extra volatility and the likelihood of larger drawdowns? the concept of leveraging seems to work in this instance with a couple of tradeoffs, there are always tradeoff, so is it worth it? that is of course up to the end user but i don't think the worst case outcome would be catastrophic versus an unleveraged implementation, if something went wrong. the leverage would be a little worse, clearly, i'm just saying it wouldn't be catastrophic.the information, analysis and opinions expressed herein reflect our judgment and opinions as of the date of writing and are subject to change at any time without notice. they are not intended to constitute legal, tax, securities or investment advice or a recommended course of action in any given situation.

deconstructing portable alpha





yesterday, i referenced a chart comparing the returns of 100% equities versus 50/50 equities/bonds and 50/50 equities/low correlating alternatives. here's another version of that chart from the man institute.the timeframe in today's chart is more useful because it gets into the period where retail accessible funds started to become available. the title of the man article is why alpha matters for retirement savers and in it, they make their case for portable alpha. portable alpha combines plain vanilla exposure with alternatives in such a way that leverages up. the idea is that you get the full beta (stocks and bonds) return with just a portion of the portfolio often with futures or some other form of leverage, leaving dollars left over to add alternatives all in pursuit of better nominal returns or better risk adjusted returns.there are funds that provide the plain vanilla exposures, with leverage, from wisdomtree, returnstacked and pimco, there might be others too. the pimco stocksplus suite of funds are the oldest ones i am aware of. the starting point for the man article is that defined contribution investors need exposure to risk assets for more years and portable alpha to add alternatives, they say, is a better way to do it. psldx is the pimco stocksplus long duration fund. i used aqmix, aqrix and client/personal holding merfx because they've all been around for a while and btal is also a client/personal holding. psldx is 100% stocks and 100% long bonds so the 50% allocation in portfolio 1 plus 50% cash could be thought of as leveraging down to a capital efficient portfolio. the results should equal the third portfolio which is 50% stocks, 50% long bonds and they are pretty close even if not exact. the second portfolio is close to what man has in mind, a full 100% to plain vanilla beta via psldx and then 50% worth of lowly correlated assets on top. the fourth portfolio more closely aligns with what we do here. the "leverage" comes in by using the negative correlation to dial up the equity exposure slightly. i think some of the portfolio stats are distorted. portfolio 4 has middling stats compared to the others but in 2022 it was only down 8.23% versus 20% for portfolio 1, 17% for portfolio 2 and portfolio 3 was down 22%. those three all have long bond exposure of course and as we've looked at countless times, long bonds are very volatile. also psldx is capable of some huge drawdowns, dropping 43% in 2022 and 33% in 2008. it also fell 37% in the 2020 pandemic crash but it took that back in just four months. the point is, holding that fund is likely to be a very wild ride. yeah, yeah line item risk but that is easier to say than it is to live with when a fund comprising half your portfolio is down 40%. yes, psldx has always come back to make new highs but holding a fund like that without have exposure to a couple of very reliable first responder defensives would make those drawdowns very painful. a final note is that we didn't really recreate the results from the first chart in today's post but i think that is because of how few funds existed 15 years ago versus now. there's no way to know if repeating this same study running from 2015 to 2030 after a flurry of funds came out in the mid-2010's might get us closer but we can check back in five years. the information, analysis and opinions expressed herein reflect our judgment and opinions as of the date of writing and are subject to change at any time without notice. they are not intended to constitute legal, tax, securities or investment advice or a recommended course of action in any given situation.

beware model portfolios with unrepeatable results





morningstar did a quick writeup on model portfolios. the article wasn't too insightful but there was an example of a model portfolio and then an example of how to customize that same model. i didn't see where the original model came from or where the customized version came from either but there's something to learn from it.all i tried to do was simplify the portfolio, not do anything to improve it. the original model slightly outperformed my simplified version. the customized version was much better than my simplified version but they all lagged vbaix and all the standard deviations were in the same neighborhood. this sort of modeling is not something i have ever done. should a model portfolio have any sort of differentiation? they really don't but i am not sure what the right answer is but i might know the right question. if you are an advisor and you want to go down this road, i think you need to decide ahead of time whether differentiation is important to you for your clients. it may not be important to you, i'm just saying to figure that out ahead of time. if you are a do-it-yourselfer but are presented some sort of model portfolio, great if you have an opinion about whether you do or don't want differentiation. then ask whoever is presenting the model why they don't do it the other way. so with the above model, i would ask why there is no differentiation. if i were in the model business, there would be differentiation and so i am saying to ask me why i don't look more like plain vanilla 60/40. also, when looking at models i would suggest being on the lookout for any sort of result that might not be repeatable. we talk about that all the time. if you want to replicate private equity with one of the operating companies like blackstone or kkr, that might work but the past results for those two stocks are so good that modeling them makes for what i would say is an unreliable backtest. similarly, any sort or modeling with bitcoin probably gives an unreliable result. according to yahoo, in the last ten years bitcoin is up 39000%. even if it went to $5 million, that wouldn't be anywhere close to 39000%. what i think you can glean from models that include unrepeatable results are attributes related to volatility and correlation. bitcoin is very volatile and the correlation to equities is all over the place being highly correlated at times, negatively correlated at other times as well as uncorrelated too. one of the above started out 2% bitcoin, 98% vbaix ten years ago, no rebalancing and the other is 100% vbaix. guess which is which. that result is not repeatable. bitcoin could be a great hold from here, or not, but the past result is not repeatable. the other day, i mentioned the brand new locorr strategic allocation fund (lsaix) which is 50% equities/50% managed futures. locorr sent over a powerpoint presentation for the fund that included the following. going back to 1980 isn't too helpful because the the strategies they are talking about weren't accessible to retail sized investors via funds but the idea is similar to what we've seen before regarding alternatives. i put no effort into choosing the alts other than diversifying fund providers. portfolio 1 isn't the best performer all the time, it doesn't work that way, but it is hands down superior to plain old 60/40 with the s&p 500 and aggregate bonds.the information, analysis and opinions expressed herein reflect our judgment and opinions as of the date of writing and are subject to change at any time without notice. they are not intended to constitute legal, tax, securities or investment advice or a recommended course of action in any given situation.

what if it blows up?





 like we were saying the other day, bonds should be boring. i used this chart to ask what do you want your fixed income holdings to look like.to the kelly quote, which lines look boring to you?simplify put out a paper that digs into the simplify currency strategy etf (foxy) that we touched on the other day. if you have curiosity about it, the paper is worth reading. i said i was interested enough to start following it, having no idea what to expect. this chart from the paper doesn't paint a rosy picture. two of the three strategies have traded sideways in the 2020's. where foxy is not intended to be a first responder defensive with a high negative correlation to equities, a prospective investor should have some basis to believe the strategy will compound positively and this chart doesn't provide that basis. this next chart from bloomberg compares just the carry component of the foxy fund to the s&p 500 and t-bills.the black line for carry looks like it is somewhat uncorrelated which is different than negatively correlated. simple math, it looks like the carry index has compounded at less than 3%. the red line for t-bills is price only. i'm not bailing on following the fund so quickly, but my expectations are now less than the first impression that the fund made. the returnstacked guys posted a paper titled margin management in return stacking. the tweet i saw promoting the paper said "how does it blow up?" we've looked at it from the perspective of what can go wrong and as the paper said, where stocks plus managed futures are concerned, both of them going down a lot at the same time could cause margin problems. from the paper, "a 15-20% drawdown in managed futures might deplete available cash collateral and trigger a call." if you use the fund in the manner that i think they intend, a blow up for the stocks and managed futures etf would be a setback for a portfolio but not a catastrophe. the odds of a big enough decline in managed futures, not captured in that quote by the way is that it would have to be a very fast 15-20% decline, at the same time as stocks are low. no question, the odds are low but it's not impossible. if you've ever heard the cliche that in a crisis, all correlations go to 1, in the face of some sort of market spasm it is possible that stocks and managed futures get hit in the same manner at the same time. i think the paper is saying this could be problematic for the fund. if you look at the holdings of rsst, you will see 25% in cash, which is a buffer of sorts. if you look at cambria chesapeake pure trend etf (mfut) which is just managed futures, it has 80% cash. the notional value of some of the positions in mfut are huge relative to the size of the fund but those three positions are overnight currency rate futures where a 2% move would be huge meaning those positions triggering a problem is extremely unlikely. the more volatile futures contracts like gold have much smaller weightings. the complexity of combining equities and managed futures adds a risk that isn't there if you build it yourself. the results between the three aren't very different. the first two did slightly better because of the leverage. rsst relies on the relationship between equities and managed futures staying uncorrelated or negatively correlated and that is a good bet the vast majority of the time but one spasm could be problematic. if you gotta have the leverage, using a 2x s&p 500 fund like sso to create the same portfolio has its own risks but relying on equities and managed futures to maintain its normal relationship isn't one of them. and why do you think you need the leverage?white shoe etf provider tidal posted a paper about what might come next for etf innovation. the only point that really jumped out was that "the appetite for complex active etfs is high." i'm sure their assessment is correct but it's very easy to add in too much complexity. some complexity used correctly can improve long term, risk adjusted results but too much complexity just becomes more risks of things that can go wrong. the information, analysis and opinions expressed herein reflect our judgment and opinions as of the date of writing and are subject to change at any time without notice. they are not intended to constitute legal, tax, securities or investment advice or a recommended course of action in any given situation.

halftime reading





 a quick post for halftime reading. check out the following.while the performance wasn't optimal it was in the ballpark. the growth rate, combined with an adequate savings rate would be enough to get the job done, even if it isn't optimal (repeated for emphasis). to be clear though, the mystery fund is not intended to be a single portfolio solution. the year by year tells a slightly different story in case it isn't apparent from the chart.in 2020 and 2023 the fund was unchanged versus up a lot for the other two. if someone bought the mystery fund in late 2019, they wouldn't have been chasing heat even but a year later there probably would have been a ton of regret. in real life, the mystery fund isn't suitable as a one portfolio solution despite being in the ballpark. the result is close but the fund isn't valid for that purpose. the point is to understand that a portfolio that is valid for a long term investment plan will have periods where it lags in a frustrating manner. the important takeaway is to not panic or get otherwise impatient in the periods where your portfolio lags which it will undoubtedly do.the information, analysis and opinions expressed herein reflect our judgment and opinions as of the date of writing and are subject to change at any time without notice. they are not intended to constitute legal, tax, securities or investment advice or a recommended course of action in any given situation.
