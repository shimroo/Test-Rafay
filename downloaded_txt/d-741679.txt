the clips from u.n.c.l.e.!

              click to play a scene from the odd man affair
 - in an 
              iconic moment from the rarely seen color pilot solo, 
              napoleon solo is introduced in a highly dramatic way, first appearing 
              behind bulletproof glass, then emerging to kill a thrush operative 
              who has broken into u.n.c.l.e. headquarters.
 - “what a goodly outside falsehood hath!” illya 
              discovers a deadly insect in the boutonniere that has 
              just been pinned on solo’s lapel by a thrush femme fatale 
              in a scene from the first-season episode “the deadly games 
              affair.” 
 - solo, 
              illya and companion tracey (dorothy provine) appear doomed in 
              this scene – set in a lost egyptian tomb – from part 
              ii of the “alexander the greater affair,” which opened 
              the series’ second season.
