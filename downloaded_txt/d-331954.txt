god, family & country!
listen to the eagle is a caller-driven show about the outdoors that provides the outdoorsman a voice to tell stories, speak with state and local wildlife officials, and discuss conservation of one of godâs greatest gifts. listen to the eagle is the radio home for hunters and fishermen who enjoy the sports as much as preserving the wild things and wild places for future generations to enjoy just as those before them have done.
