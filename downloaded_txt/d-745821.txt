phil kelley


“love truplace floor plans! truplace floor plans get me hired!”
mary chieppa


“truplace does an amazing job of showcasing our properties through their photos and floor plans, so when they came out with 3d tours, we knew we had to implement those into our listings asap. we have so many guests comment of how easy it was to navigate the tour … it’s a win win for everyone involved.”
kate mccullion


“i love truplace and have been a 16+ year customer – only truplace for my listings!”
