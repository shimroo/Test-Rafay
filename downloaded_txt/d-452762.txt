one old building.  three fools. a crazy idea.























once this place was a native american village.  then it was farm.  over a few years in the 1880s it became a densely urban industrial neighborhood.  for over 100 years this building was a slaughterhouse and butcher shop.  for awhile it was a colony of artists.  now it is the home to jones furniture designs and allegheny aikido.
