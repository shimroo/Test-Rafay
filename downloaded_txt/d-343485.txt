	 angel or devil new book from christopher saint booth
	 
    


 spooked tv publications is proud to announce the release of christopher saint booth's latest book, angel or devil. a dark historical adventure into the real journals of america's first documented possessions and exorcisms. unedited and presented as evidence, these emotional case files reveal the truth and prove the supernatural realm does indeed exist in our sacred world. 

case files explore in depth and accuracy the first documented erling, iowa exorcism: a legion of demons inhabit a young girl in 1928. brought to a convent for an exorcism, disturbing and extraordinary events lash out due to the families dark magic that creates a stronger than evil curse

witness the watseka wonder: america's first documented possession of 1877. a chilling story of a 13-year-old girl from the small town of watseka, illinois who became possessed or reincarnated by spirits of the insane dead.

some called them angels, others called them devils, they all were branded, possessed!
