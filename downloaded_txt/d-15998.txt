urgent care wait times

not sure if you need to be seen in person?
we're seeing very crowded waiting rooms at both our emergency department and urgent care locations. if your child does not need emergency care we recommend scheduling an appointment with your primary care physician or you can visit our 24/7 virtual urgent care.
use this chart to help you decide if your child needs to be seen in person.
