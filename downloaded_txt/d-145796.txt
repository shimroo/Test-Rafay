2013-20152015-20172017-20192021-present




2013-2015 - 
                                          avery osen began his journey at cowley college, where he was an active member of the
                                                media club, a student ambassador, and a member of phi theta kappa. he excelled academically,
                                                earning recognition on the dean’s and president’s honor rolls. while at cowley, he
                                                also gained valuable experience in sports announcing, commercial production, and promotional
                                                video creation for the college.










2015-2017 - 
                                          after graduating from cowley in 2015, osen earned a scholarship to kansas state university,
                                                where he entered the school of journalism and mass communications. at k-state, he
                                                contributed extensively to the collegian, wrote for usa today, and created a radio
                                                program called “out of left field.” his on-air experience extended to k-state channel
                                                8, and he worked with espnu as a campus correspondent. he was also recognized by the
                                                kansas association of broadcasters in 2017, earning first place for news anchoring
                                                and an honorable mention for sportscasting.










2017-2019 - 
                                          osen graduated with his bachelor’s degree in 2017 and later earned a master’s in mass
                                                communications in 2019. while at k-state, he worked for k-state hd tv as a sideline
                                                reporter and in the video production department, covering all sporting events for
                                                the wildcats. he also gained national experience as a sports writer for the associated
                                                press, covering kansas state athletics, the kansas city royals, and other events—a
                                                role he still holds today.
alongside his journalism work, osen took on various broadcasting roles, working part-time
                                                for espn and fox sports, assisting with football and men's basketball broadcasts.
                                                in 2019, he joined the kansas city chiefs as a grip for their video department, contributing
                                                to their production team during multiple championship seasons. he now proudly owns
                                                three super bowl rings. that same year, cowley college recognized him with the young
                                                achiever award, honoring his professional success and service.










2021-present - 
                                          in 2021, osen was hired by ksn-tv in wichita to host "good day kansas," where he travels
                                                the state, highlighting the best people, places, and events for viewers. additionally,
                                                he serves as an emcee for the wichita thunder and wind surge, bringing energy and
                                                excitement to local sports events.
his contributions have also gone beyond broadcasting. in 2022, he was named a nextgen
                                                under 30 honoree by the state of kansas in its inaugural year, celebrating outstanding
                                                young professionals. committed to giving back, he has participated in multiple volunteer
                                                efforts, including:

raising $20,000 as a leukemia & lymphoma society (lls) man of the year candidate (2024)
hosting battle of the books for wichita public schools for four years
participating in men who cook (2021), a fundraiser for the pando initiative

a native of winfield, kansas, osen is the son of charles and kelli osen. looking back
                                                on his journey, he remains grateful for the support of cowley college and the ark
                                                city community and strives to pay it forward to future students.

"without cowley, there's no way i would be able to achieve what i have in my career.
                                          the instructors i had, the peers i met and the experiences i made, are the foundation
                                          of what has made me who i am. i'm forever grateful for my years at cowley and will
                                          never be able to fully repay the school for what it provided me."

tony lubbers





the journey of a heartland educator

tony graduated cowley college in 1989



1987-19891993-20172017-present




1987-1989 - tony began his educational journey at cowley college from 1987 to 1989, majoring in
                                             general studies. when he graduated from arkansas city high school, he was drawn to
                                             cowley by the academic excellence challenge (college bowl) scholarship, which allowed
                                             him to work with inspiring mentors like paul stirnaman and sue darby. these relationships
                                             left a lasting impression, particularly stirnaman’s influence, which shaped tony’s
                                             love for history and guided him in his career as an educator.







1993-2017 - 
                                          after cowley, tony transferred to wichita state university, earning a bachelor’s degree
                                                in history in 1993 and a master’s in history in 1998. during this time, he also began
                                                his professional career as an admissions representative at cowley college. he gained
                                                his first teaching experience by leading a current events class.
tony’s career in financial aid began in 1996 at friends university, where he served
                                                as a financial aid representative. he later became assistant director of financial
                                                aid in 1998 and eventually served as the director of financial aid from 2014 to 2017.








2017-present - 
                                          in 2017, he transitioned to the university of central missouri, where he works as
                                                the director of student financial assistance. along the way, tony earned his financial
                                                aid certification from nasfaa in 2020 and holds 15 nasfaa credentials.
throughout his career, tony has been deeply involved in professional associations,
                                                serving in leadership roles across state, regional, and national levels. he was president
                                                of the missouri association (masfap) in 2023 and a member of nasfaa task forces. his
                                                dedication has earned him numerous accolades, such as induction into the kasfaa hall
                                                of fame in 2014.
in addition to his financial aid work, tony has been a passionate educator, teaching
                                                western civilization and u.s. history at institutions such as friends university,
                                                newman university, butler community college, baker university, and cowley college
                                                for over 20 years.
tony lives in missouri with his wife, shawn. they have two adult children and seven
                                                grandchildren. his journey exemplifies the transformative power of education, mentorship,
                                                and a commitment to lifelong learning.



cowley provided me with incredible learning experiences, thanks to inspiring instructors
                                          like sue darby and paul stirnaman, who not only taught in the classroom but also mentored
                                          as college bowl coaches. the supportive environment and opportunities at cowley have
                                          left a lasting impact on my career and life.
