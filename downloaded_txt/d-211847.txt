our mission 



our mission statementindiana horse rescue is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization dedicated in its mission to facilitate the rescue and rehabilitation of equine in need. indiana horse rescue is not a sanctuary in the sense that it is our belief that we have a moral and ethical responsibility to evaluate  and relieve the suffering of an animal unable to live it’s life free from pain or whose quality of life is greatly diminished. we further believe that we have a duty and responsibility to public safety to ensure any animal placed for adoption or foster is not an animal with the potential to harm human health. while these decisions are never easy we alone bear the burden of having to make them. we do not take such decisions lightly. our hearts and souls ache with the burden, but we also know there are many more in need waiting in the shadows, needing us to heed the call. we honor their lives and their loss by being there for the next call for another in need no matter the outcome to our hearts.because it is so true that“if the only cost were love,we could save them all”.
