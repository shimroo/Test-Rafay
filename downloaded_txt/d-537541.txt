nature photography is my passion â exploring wild natural landscapes with my camera. i am less interested in literal landscape photography â in photography that simply records the natural environment â than in the emotions and feelings that wilderness and wild places inspire. and one feeling above all, a feeling of mystery.

my most popular book, unknown patagonia,â 
is now available both as a handsome large-format coffee-table book and also as a free ebook (in english, spanish, german, portuguese, italian, and recently in french). see the books section of my site for details.

enjoy your visitâ
