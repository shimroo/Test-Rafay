when you want to
                recapture the warmth, charm and authenticity of
                the early american home, there is no substitute
                for wide pine boards.


 
 


the early american
                colonists made their houses and furniture from
                the large, straight pines growing in abundance in
                new england forests. they sheathed the broad
                surfaces, such as floors and walls, with the
                widest of these boards for flooring, paneling and
                wainscoting since they could cover large areas
                with fewer joints. 


 
 




much of the early
                furniture was made with a single wide pine board
                for table tops, bed headboards, and the sides,
                tops and bottoms of various case pieces, such as
                chests and cupboards. 



 
 




today, after an
                unbroken 350 year history of practical use, these
                wide pine boards are hard to find. when they are used,
                they greatly enhance the beauty and authenticity
                of antique building restoration and reproduction,
                whether it's a log cabin, a southern mansion, a
                western ranch house, or a new england colonial.
