    "we chose eprcdc because of its great reputation and commitment to the growth, development, and safety of the children. prior to our child becoming a student we heard nothing but great things about epr. we knew many families who had success with their children there. so it was very comforting when it came time for our little one to join the epr family. all of the staff are very friendly and professional. the technology/apps are an extra bonus; they are an excellent way to keep track of our child's daily activity without having to veer from the busy workday. we have not been disappointed."
