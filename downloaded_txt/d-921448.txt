ceed lending is an initiative of the great lakes women’s business council (wbc). providing business expansion and start-up financing to small business loans in the following nine southeast michigan counties: wayne,  oakland, macomb, monroe,  jackson, hillsdale, lenawee, livingston, and washtenaw. we have made more than $9 million in loans, creating more than 1,800 jobs. as the first microlenders in michigan, now offering lift loans and oakland county revolving loan fund (ocrlf) loans, we understand that small business owners typically need more than financing. our loans are partnered with business assistance services.to determine if you qualify and which loan best fits your needs, please use the get started button. if you have questions or need assistance, contact one of our ceed lending loan officer at 734-677-1400.
