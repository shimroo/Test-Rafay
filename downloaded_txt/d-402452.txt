    private charter
let the carolina princess host your next event! whether you are looking for a unique way to say thank you to those individuals who deserve something more than just a token gift card, or you have a special event coming up and want to celebrate with a party that is totally different, we have the perfect idea for you. charter the carolina princess for a full day on the open seas, reeling in the big catch, soaking up the sun or just relaxing with the sea wind in your face. or, set sail on a three-hour (or more) cruise around the pristine waters of the crystal coast, enjoying the sites of the morehead city waterfront, historic beaufort waterfront, carrot island and the wild horses, dolphins and birds. a cruise down shackleford banks to scenic cape lookout can also be arranged. our chef is available to cater your day or evening event, or you may provide your own food and drink. we can also arrange for a deejay, if required. your group will appreciate this special trip as it sets the course for adventure and makes memories to share for years to come. groups of up to 70 anglers or 120 cruisers can charter the carolina princess for an expedition. think of all the fun you can have with your family, friends or customers. call us now to reserve your special day and make your special event something everyone will remember for a lifetime.
