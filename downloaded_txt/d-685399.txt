bespoke design + fit + finish



          craftsmen are known by their tools. quality depends on planning, preparation, tools, and training. the results convey a commitment to quality. ours and yours.
        




full stack development



          there is no substitute for experience. whether its for the web and the cloud, windows, a service, active directory, exchange, saas, sql, oracle, mysql, crm, etl, powershell, or apis, our solutions are backed by almost 100,000 hours of actual hands on experience in finance, insurance, government, judiciary, law enforcement, commercial software, banking, wall street, leisure, direct marketing. point-of-sale, and telecom.
        




update + upgrade + modernize



          sometimes the most efficient approach is to modernize your existing software. we help turn hard to maintain, outdated, or problematic software into modern, fresh, easy-to-maintain software, giving new life to a product that has helped your organization be successful over the years.
        






the right tools for the job


        we use best in class tools for every aspect of the engagement.
        rather than offering pretty good solutions in every language or tool,
        we have selected industry standard tools and developed deep expertise.
        deep expertise allows us to leverage those tools for the best result.

        our focus is on building tailor-made software
        with .net, mvc, sql server, and include the latest versions of
        jquery/javascript, css, html5, bootstrap
      







microsoft

            microsoft is one of the most widely distributed and broadly accepted technology companies in the world. we use microsoft tools--like sql server, visual studio, c#, mvc, tfs, ssis, ssrs, exchange, unity, and active directory--because they yield great results, are highly integrated, and microsoft demonstrates a commitment to continuously improving their product offerings,
