my 
        domain origamiboulder.com, but most people too stupid to understand, so

        is wadded up paper! you understand now, dumbo? then hurry up and buy wadded 
        paper! you see picture at top of site don't you?

        for you and you buy it now. i am famous internet artist. you find my site 
        didn't you? 
site 
        is real. you order and you really get origami boulder artwork with 
        special card to display at your home or workplace. make good unforgettable 
        gift for friends!

        very nice gift that no one ever forget! i include special card with every 
        order that explain work of art. you buy 20, i send you free extra one 
        with special message from me!
hurry 
        up and order now!
i 
        send you wadded paper with priority mail. it is fast with nice free box 
        from post office. 
post 
        office worker tell me, "don't take so many free boxes! you must order 
        them online from usps! other customers mad when you take them all!" 
        i laugh and yell, "it says free, bureaucrat!! what you expect, dumb 
        dumb?"
update!!!! 
        wall street journal article on 5/29/02 say that priority mail is ripoff 
        and doesn't arrive faster than first class mail. this is outrage from 
        post office lazy people. i complain today at post office and they laugh 
        and pretend article isn't true. who you believe, slow postman or wall 
        street journal? now maybe i buy special boxes and send first class instead 
        of wasting money on priority mail. i make most efficient decision for 
        customer benefit. 
my 
        friend is graphic designer for big company. she design page for me because 
        frontpage too hard for wadded paper artist!
i 
        change design and she send email that says, "you've ruined my beautiful 
        site!!! :o( what in the hell is up with origami boulder?!?!?!?!"
i 
        tell her, "you designer, not site owner! i change whatever i like. 
        you get paid, didn't you? then go away now!!!" her design have too 
        many pages and jakob nielsen say internet people too lazy to click so 
        i make everything one page.
now 
        i answer question so you stop bothering me with stupid email to:
artist
letters 
        from dumb dumbs
 

frequently 
        asked questions
q: 
        origami boulder? aren't you talking about a wadded up piece of paper?

a: yes dumb dumb! i already explain this 
        at beginning. why you too lazy to read first before you ask obvious question 
        like this? people on internet not very smart.  
q: 
        is this some kind of a joke?
a: 
        you 
        want joke? look in mirror, you ugly person! this site real. you order 
        wadded paper origami boulder and see for yourself. 
this 
        very nice artwork that come with card and make good gift for your friend. 
        your friend never forget you when you send fine art gift like this! i 
        am famous internet artist, so original wadded paper origami art become 
        very valuable some day. especially haiku version, because it is double 
        artwork. 
i 
        repeat -- site is real, artwork is real. you order origami boulder 
        and it comes in mail and you enjoy it. 
q: 
        what is the haiku option?
a: 
        you 
        don't know nothing about anything! haiku is japanese poetry. it goes with 
        wadded paper because origami is also japanese. don't you understand anything 
        about other culture? people on internet are so stupid sometimes, but not 
        the ones who buy wadded paper origami boulder with haiku!!!
q: 
        but how can i read the haiku if the paper is in a boulder shape?
a: 
        you can't, but it there. what is the sound of one hand clapping, dumb 
        dumb? 
q: 
        but can't i unfold the page to read the haiku?
a: 
        you 
        unfold wadded paper, you ruin artwork! don't be stupid. haiku is there. 
        i even write it in english. you not read it though. 
i 
        give example:
buy 
        wadded paper
from 
        very famous artist 
and 
        then you like it
i 
        write a different new one for every haiku order, ok? you will like it 
        very much but you don't read it because it ruins artwork.
q: 
        what is the performance art option?
a: 
        this brand new innovation in origami boulder wadded paper art! you buy 
        performance art option. then artist wad up artwork create custom for you, 
        and throw directly into waste basket. you just paid for custom performance 
        art! you receive email describe performance. if wish, write name or other 
        small message in comment box and artist say, "this art made for _____" 
        when perform. 
very 
        important. you not get anything in mail when you order performance 
        art option. artist truly create artwork and throw in wastebasket and email 
        when finished. you pay for this art performance, not physical art that 
        come in mail.
q: 
        do you have a money back guarantee?
a: 
        money 
        back guarantee? this not wal-mart dumb dumb! this work of art from artist 
        -- me! you ask picasso for money back? i don't think so! you no ask me 
        for money back either. you don't like art work, you sell it on ebay and 
        get your money back or go away. it already cheaper than starbucks, so 
        what else you want from me? 
q: 
        do you do custom pieces?
a: 
        finally 
        good question!! this is the kind of person who should visit site, not 
        dumb people too cheap to spend money. yes, i make custom piece for you! 
        only $25! you send me piece of paper and i wad up for you and send back 
        with priority mail! 
recommended 
        item for custom artwork include enron or pets.com stock certificate, breakup 
        letter from girlfriend, collection letter from landlord or moon 
        deed. then it become valuable one day and you have last laugh! 
q: 
        what kind of paper do you use?
a: 
        this 
        also intelligent question from person who appreciates art. i use very 
        expensive paper called old money. it is made from real money! it is 100 
        percent recycled with 30 percent post-consumer currency and 70 percent 
        recovered cotton. 
that 
        means you send me money and i send you money back. only my money is artwork 
        and you can't spend at the mall so don't try it or you go to jail. card 
        explaining artwork made from old money card stock. it is even light green 
        like dollars and very nice to look at. i don't use cheap paper because 
        my art serious and no joke.
q: 
        why do you use paypal?
a: 
        i 
        go to bank to accept credit card and banker says, "you can't sell 
        wadded paper. that's not a real product or service." 
i 
        lose patience and scream at banker and tell him, "you banker, not 
        art critic dumb dumb!!! you don't know nothing about art. wadded paper 
        art much better than andy warhol painting of soup can or that guy who 
        put crucifix in big jar of urine! at least my art not offensive or stupid 
        picture of food product!" 
now 
        i can never accept credit card directly because i get escorted from bank 
        by big man with gun. i use atm and drivethrough now so banker doesn't 
        see me and call police.
q: 
        can i order now?
a: 
        yes! 
        order online now please and i send you artwork and you like it very much. 
        i tell you for last time that artwork is real, and you really get art 
        in mail when you order.
