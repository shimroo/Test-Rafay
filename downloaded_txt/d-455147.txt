my new golf ball 
golf humor


if you are in your home and
want to have fun, you
should do like me, i had a
good day for golf,
my game had gone well so far;
if i could make this one shot,
i would finish close to par.
i had tried this shot before,
it wasnâ€™t an easy call;
drive straight across the water?
i had always lost my ball.
i had seen others do it;
it would cut my score by two,
so i had to decide now,
what i was going to do.
iâ€™d not lose a brand new ball;
i placed an old ball on my tee.
thatâ€™s when i heard a clear voice,
it was speaking just to me.
â€œuse a brand new ball,â€ it said,
â€œi know that you can do it.
have faith in your golfing skill
iâ€™m here to talk you through it.â€
i put a new ball on my tee,
sure of the luck it would bring.
the voice said, â€œbefore you play,
take at least one practice swing.â€
i made the swing with my best skill
the voice went silent, then it said,
â€œlet me see that swing again,â€
speaking clearly in my head.
i gave the club a mighty swing.
the voice was sure no help at all
when disgustedly it said,
â€œmaybe you should use the old ball!â€
