transformation


february 23 @ 10:30 am-11:30 am 


rev. beau rivers preaching



what are the necessary ingredients for transformation to occur? who, or what were the catalysts that beckoned us to change our way of being in the world? how often have we been called to be more than we ever imagined we could be? there will be an opportunity for us to share our experiences during the service.  the chalice choir will be singing.

minister’s message


january 29, 2025





during a post-inaugural prayer service, the episcopal bishop of washington, dc, the right reverend mariann edgar budde, expressed her concern about a normalized culture of contempt that threatens to destroy our country. in a subsequent interview with npr’s all things considered, budde stressed the importance of being able to speak to one another with respect rather than jump to outrage. as a people of faith, we are called to serve as instruments of peace who speak the truth with love and strive to bend the arc of the moral universe toward justice.

from the parish committee


january 29, 2025





the generous spirit of our church members and friends burns bright. as of mid-january, more than 30 families have pledged $157,000 to the building restoration fund, bringing us to 78% of our $200,000 goal. on behalf of the church, building & grounds chair alan melchior has negotiated a contract with paul macuch painting & restoration, llc, for the needed roofing work and shingle replacement. during the winter new white cedar shingles will be hand dipped in stain in the shop to extend their longevity. outdoor work will begin in april when weather permits. for cost efficiency, alan and mr. macuch compressed the original 3-phase work plan into a single 4 to 6 week effort, meaning the project should be complete by early this summer. because the work will take place sooner than originally planned, those of you who have pledged contributions to the restoration fund are encouraged to make your payments as soon as you can, by june if possible.

february music musings


january 29, 2025





february is a relatively calm month, musically speaking, when it seems timely to set up a tour of our charming 1890 woodberry & harris tracker organ. did you know that our little organ is registered in the pipe organ database of the organ historical society? did you know that our organ was fully mechanical until electricity came down main street around 1920, and the “hand pump” was replaced by a motorized turbine to generate “wind”? did you know we had a major refurbishment of our organ in 2014, partly funded by a community preservation grant?

announcement from music director


january 9, 2025





dear friends and members of uu middleboro, 


it is with mixed feelings that i announce my retirement at the end of this church year in june. being your music director is a joy, a creative mixture of music making and music teaching. i am eager, however, to embrace the freedom of retirement to read more, travel a bit, tackle some new music, explore some new horizons. the time has come for me to step down and to let someone else take up the baton.
