proposed rezoning
posted by lcs communications on 2/10/2025 8:00:00 am 




the challenge: for years, john g. riley elementary has had more students zoned to attend than the school's capacity allows. that means if every student currently zoned to attend riley elementary school showed up to attend school, there would not be enough classrooms. additionally, more than 50 pre-kindergarten students currently attend school at the wesson center across town. 
the proposal: lcs is proposing to rezone john g. riley elementary for the 2025-2026 school year to shift some students to astoria park, ft. braden, and sabal palm elementary schools. this would decrease the number of students zoned to attend riley and free up classroom space to allow for up to three pre-kindergarten classrooms. 
parents: each school impacted will host community meetings to provide more information about the rezoning process. parents of current john g. riley elementary school students impacted by the new proposed school zones can choose to keep their students at riley for the 2025-2026 school year. however, there will be no bus transportation provided. this parental decision will need to be made by april 18, 2025.  
public meetings: 

sabal palm: wednesday, february 12 at 6:00 p.m. 
ft. braden: thursday, february 13 at 6:00 p.m. 
riley: wednesday, february, 19 at 6:00 p.m.
