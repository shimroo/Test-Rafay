jessi hyde
mcc store student worker
hyde recommends mcc to prospective students because of the personalized experience the college provides. "mcc is much more caring than bigger schools because of its size, but itâs not so small that there aren't opportunities."

anthropology at mcc
even if his students arenât planning to pursue a career in anthropology or archaeology, many of the lessons learned in dr. davis' classes can be applied to a variety of careers.
