calibrate is a combination of calcium and boron and quickly adjusts your soil ph for a 90-day period. in contrast, typical limestone applications take a year to break down and become effective. the calcium builds healthy cell walls and tissue and the boron allows for better uptake of the calcium. calibrate also enables diverse nutrient availability to your trees, shrubs, and turf.calibrate is nutritive for your plants and turf and will prepare them for summer and winter stress periods like drought. don’t forget - healthy plants ward off insect pests and tolerate environmental extremes. most importantly, healthy soil sequesters carbon.for properties up to 1/3 acre of recreation area and wooded perimeter.call for pricing on larger properties.
