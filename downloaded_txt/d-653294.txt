good clinical practice: why it matters for our health 

as a layperson, you may be wondering what exactly is “good clinical practice” (gcp) and how it impacts your health. it refers to the set of ethical and scientific standards that guide the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analyses, and reporting of clinical trials. essentially, it ensures that clinical trials are conducted in a safe, ethical, and scientifically sound manner.
good clinical practice is important because it can greatly impact our lives and well-being in a number of ways. below are a few examples:
ensuring safety of treatments
one of the primary goals of gcp is to ensure the safety of treatments being tested. this includes ensuring that the doses and duration of treatment are safe, monitoring for potential side-effects and adverse events, and ensuring that patients are adequately informed about the potential risks and benefits of the treatment being tested. by having rigorous safety standards in place, gcp helps to ensure that patients are not put at unnecessary risk during clinical trials.
improving data quality
gcp also helps to improve the quality of the data that is collected during clinical trials. this includes ensuring that the trial is well-designed, with clear and measurable objectives, and that the data is collected and recorded accurately. this is important because it helps to ensure that the results of the trial are reliable and can be used to make informed decisions about whether or not a treatment is safe, effective, and worth pursuing further.
protecting patient rights
gcp is also focused on protecting the rights and well-being of patients participating in clinical trials. this includes ensuring that patients are fully informed about the nature of the trial, their rights as participants, and the potential risks and benefits of the treatment being tested. patients also have the right to withdraw from the trial at any time, without repercussion. by protecting patient rights, gcp helps to ensure that patients are not exploited or exposed to unnecessary risk during clinical trials.
overall, good clinical practice is of utmost importance in maintaining the safety and efficacy of clinical trials. by ensuring that trials are conducted in an ethical and scientifically sound manner, gcp helps to protect the rights and well-being of patients and improve the quality of data collected. this helps to ensure that the treatments being tested are safe and effective, and can ultimately improve the lives of millions of people around the world.

types of excessive sweating 

 

excessive sweating of the underarms (axillary hyperhidrosis) and of the hands (palmar hyperhidrosis) is what we commonly know as hyperhidrosis. all of us sweat, and it is not hazardous. although the condition can cause embarrassment, it does not affect anyone’s respiration, as the sweat glands are functioning just fine. on the other hand, sweating of the feet (plantar hyperhidrosis) can be a problem, and as you know, it causes foot odors. anyhow, it is not a life-threatening problem, but it can be uncomfortable, especially when your clothes start to smell.
there are two types of excessive sweating: general and focal hyperhidrosis. general excessive sweating can be displayed regardless of your mood or before/after exercise. and it does not depend on weather conditions. fibromyalgia (chronic fatigue syndrome) has a similar phenomenon, known as focal hyperhidrosis.
for some people, sweating is a symptom of illnesses they have no idea about. fibromyalgia is a disease for which the cause is still unknown. therefore, the best treatment option is to consult a doctor. however, if the sweating is not caused by any physical illness, the simplest and fastest way to reduce excessive sweating is to use antiperspirants that contain the ingredient aluminum chloride, which is the active ingredient that blocks sweat ducts. this is a real guarantee that if you use a good antiperspirant you will not sweat very much!
the majority of excessive sweating is harmless. it is just the skin becoming irritated by super hot air. however, there are some cases when excessive sweating can be a sign of another problem. take note that hyperhidrosis may occur in more than one location on the body.
one of the examples is excessive sweating of the hands. if you know someone who has sweaty palms, you may want to ask if they use tabletops for additional ventilation. tabletops are great to help ventilate the air to your hands quickly and help eliminate that excessive sweating problem.
excessive sweating of the feet is not a medically recognized condition, but if you feel sweat is just simply too thick for your skin, you may have to seek medical guidance. note that some people with sweaty feet develop foot odor, as the sweat patches are open and allow air to come in. this condition is known as plantar hyperhidrosis. a treatment of some kind is needed to eliminate the odor.
excessive sweating may also be a symptom of menopause. if you are experiencing hot flashes, you may want to discuss this with your doctor to help determine if you have this condition or not. menopause has some unwelcome side effects.

if you start to notice telltale signs of excessive sweating, you will want to determine if your excessive sweating is a natural feature of your aging process, due to your changing body chemistry (such as hormonal changes). to help with these naturally, you can use an antiperspirant containing an aluminum chloride to address the problem.
there are some other conditions that same may exist, and should be looked at if you can eliminate the excessive sweating and subsequently any other health issues.
people often use excessive sweating as a defense mechanism to prevent teasing by others, and may subconsciously put on more when nervous. self-consciousness also can play a role, which may cause you to literally stop sweating altogether. if this is happening for you, you may want to consider addressing your situation.

mangosteen – what you need to know 

 

mangosteen, which is considered as the “queen of fruits”, has several health benefits to give a person who eats it. this is also a very good source of xanthones, nutrients that enhance your immune system. it belongs to the family of plants of clusiaceae and has a latin name of garcinia mangostana. this is an exotic fruit first seen in the southeast asia, but since it has a lot to offer people, there have been plantings in the tropical parts of the central and south america. however, it takes years to produce this fruit commercially, ranging from ten to fifteen years.
first of all, the mangosteen tree is fast growing. it can grow up to 40 feet tall and nearly 20 meters in diameter. this gives the plant a very sturdy root system. a great variety of new plants are formed each year, some of which are used for multiple purposes, while others yield crop after crop of fruit.
mangosteen tree produce “xyzic” acid which is a flavonoid called an alkaloid. the acidity of these acids allows them to interact with rheumatoid which is an inflammatory agent. this allows for its use as an anti-inflammatory agent.
these acids can also serve as antioxidants, xanthones and polysaccharides. these are the elements that give the mangosteen fruit its unique and delicious taste. because of this, for years the mangosteen tree has been used in medicine in many countries.
the mangosteen fruit used to be very perishable and it was hard to get it from other parts of the world. today, perishable tree fruits are sold in local organic fruit markets. the new industry of fruit adulteration has made it possible to harvest the mangosteen fruit in many countries and markets it internationally.
the mangosteen’s use in medicine dates back to pre-historical times. ancient egyptians and asian healers used it as a cure for common illnesses. garcinia mangostana is used as a preventive medicine for many diseases including diabetes, arthritis and intestinal parasites.
it is also a very good source of xanthones which is an antioxidant that strengthens the immune system. xanthones are water-soluble polyphenols that offer preventive medicine for many diseases including cancer and heart disease.
the mangosteen is now marketed in many commercial centers both in southeast asia and the pacific islands of malaysia and indonesia. it is being grown for both the public and private use in many countries.
in the past, the mangosteen was eaten fresh only in places like fabrics and paper mulberries. but people also realized that it must be preserved in an acceptable fashion for long transport. so they turned to the process of changing the leaves into a concentrate before exporting it. this makes the mangosteen readily available in many parts of the world.
you may wonder why mangosteen is not a popular fruit juice ingredient though it is. aside from its bitter taste, it contains very potent medical properties and is very costly to generate and export. therefore, it is usually employed as a medicinal supplement.
it is not possible to grow the mangosteen tree in many countries due to its built in restrictions. the mangosteen tree can only be grown in malaysia, the country of its roots according to its experts.
advantages of mangosteen
mangosteen has introduced a lot of improvement in the medical field. it has been able to treat a wide range of illnesses including:

allergies
acne
allergens
cancer
colds
diarrhea
heart problems
hair fall
successfully defend cells from damage and restore the balance of the immune system
free radicals
increase the energy level
improves sleep
makes you feel more energetic and more alert
increases your metabolism rate
improves support of your digestion
mangosteen juice or smoothies can help you adjust your body decision making
fights many diseases including hiv

chiropractic practices revolve around the notion that the nervous system is responsible for controlling the functions of body cells and organs. as and when any portion of the skeleton is forced to deviate from its actual position, there is an irritation in the nervous system. people suffering from such conditions usually experience difficulties and sometimes excruciating pain in their normal daily movements. once these conditions are corrected, the patient can resume their daily activities. chiropractic physicians also treat such improperly positioned joints and bones. they treat such misalignments by introducing slight adjustments in order to restore proper alignment to the bones and the spine.

sources of omega 

 

nature has packed a lot of nutrition in a tiny flake. there are stores of omega where a single omega-3 or omega-6 supplement is the principal. the sources of omega are the green leafy vegetables which we see on a daily basis. they are the colorful plants which are packed with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and, most importantly, with the omega-3 or omega-6 balance which is so crucial to proper nutrition.
nutrition is so very important to the body. omega 3 or omega-6 make up approximately thirty percent of the brain’s weight. that is why omega-3 and omega-6 are called essential fatty acids. they are essential because the body cannot produce them. the body gets them from diet or by supplement.
it is important to get enough omega 3 and 6 whether through diet or through supplementation. the latter is the best method for ensuring that you are getting the highest quality of omega available. in the old days, we got our omega from eating two or three meals of fish per week. these days it behoves us to take a fish oil supplement on a daily basis.
the fact that our body can produce omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids is a sad fact. our diet includes a lot of foods which contribute to the production of omega 6 and others which basically contribute to omega-3. omega 6 is probably the most overused of all the essential fatty acids.

how exactly do these two combine to enhance our health? omega 3s are the precursors to eicosanoids, which basically are responsible for the functioning of all the other essential fatty acids. omega 3 also helps to develop the brain and studies have shown that people who have sufficient amounts of omega 3 are better able to cope with stress and also possess a stronger attention span.
omega 6 also plays a crucial role in the human body. if there is an omega deficiency in the system, then the body will convert omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids and use the omega 3’s for energy. however, if the omega 3 stores are low, then the body will convert the omega-6 to omega-3 to fuel the body.
from the above it is clear that the only way to ensure that you are getting the correct amount of omega-3 is to ensure that you have enough omega-3 in your diet. but what kind of omega should you be taking?
there are several sources of omega 3 fatty acids. however, it is important to differentiate between the different types of omega 3 fatty acids. one of the most common types of omega 3 is fish oil. fish oil contains both omega 3 as well as omega 6 and it is the only omega 3 fatty acid that contains no omega 9.
however, it should not be used as a sole source of omega 3 as it will still include the effects of omega 9. another well used type of omega 3 is flaxseed oil, which contains either alpha-linolenic acid (ala) or docosahexaenoic acid (dha).
the body needs both of these essential fatty acids in order to function properly, but it is easier for fish oil to convert ala into epa and dha. this means that a fish oil supplement will contain both the omega 3 and omega 6 in the correct proportions.
a third omega 3 is known as olive oil, which contains both omega 3 and omega 6 in a ratio of roughly 4:1. people who consume this oil regularly are at a much lower risk of developing heart disease and colon cancer.
all of these fatty acids are necessary for human health and the only way that we can get them is through diet or through supplementation. with the convenience of modern cooking techniques and food processing, it has become quite easy to increase your daily intake of omega 6 and omega 3.
however, the unfortunate thing is that most of us do not increase our intake of fatty acids in this way. instead we get more omega 6, through many of our foods, than we do omega 3.
this can lead to an unhealthy balance between the two fatty acids, which can be detrimental to your health. you can determine this balance by ensuring that you eat a healthy diet containing plenty of omega 6 and omega 3.
since most of us (including those in the medical profession) prefer a healthier lifestyle, we are careful not to increase our intake of omega 6 too much.

one thing that you can do to correct this imbalance is to add a high quality fish oil supplement to your diet, every day. this allows you to maintain a balanced ratio between omega 3 and omega 6.

alzheimer’s disease – natural treatment with spices 

 

alzheimer’s disease is a debilitating and ultimately lethal neurodegenerative disorder that currently afflicts about 18 million people worldwide. the incidence of the disease increases exponentially with age and in this day and age, the prevalence of the disease is expected to reach 40 million by 2050. alzheimer’s disease is characterized clinically by four major symptoms: memory loss, agitation or agitation, personality changes, and some impairment in the ability to concentrate or pay attention. while there is no cure for alzheimer’s disease, treatments that have traditionally been used to slow the progression of the disease or even completely halt it in its tracks are becoming more and more irrelevant in the face of increasingly aggressive cognitive losses in patients suffering from alzheimer’s disease.
recent studies have shown that continued use of standard alzheimer’s disease medications is not going to reduce the risks of further brain damage. what’s more, these same medications are known to contribute to rather than alleviate the symptoms of the disease. in some cases, they actually increase the severity of certain symptoms.
there is therefore a major gap between what we know to be true about alzheimer’s disease and what we know can be done to alleviate the symptoms of the disease and help improve patient-doctor communication. what can be done is a whole lot of studying into the changes that occur within the brain as well as the genetic makeup of those who will eventually experience alzheimer’s disease. what can be done in fact is a lot of moving parts.
exercise builds new brain cells
exercise is known to be one of the very best things that you can do for your brain. it has been shown to specifically stimulate the growth of new brain cells. what this means is that the more you exercise, the more new brain cells are created. this has profound effects on your brain because in the future those cells will be fluorescent and you will be able to discover them easily. the consequences of this are that you will be able to process a lot more information because your brain will be functioning at a much higher capacity.

eat a lot of broccoli
studies have repeatedly shown that the more broccoli you eat, the more your brain cells are stimulated. what you’ll therefore find is that you’re not only learning faster, your memory is also better. and broccoli is particularly good for your brain because it contains a high level of folic acid, which is essential for brain health.
eat fish
fish contain a kind of fatty acid called eicosapentaenoic acid (epa) and this is wonderful for not only your brain but also your cardiovascular health as well. additionally, the omega 3 fatty acids found in fish oil have a very good effect on your cardiovascular health. and if there isn’t enough epa in your fish, you’d be getting a lot less of this fatty acid. that’s why it’s so critical to eat fish or supplement fish oil to keep your brain healthy.
eat berries
bruits and vegetables are some of the best foods your brain can put into its best shape ever. research has demonstrated that they’re great for increasing the blood supply to your brain. not only that, but items like berries are terrific for creating new brain cells as well.

so there they are, some of the best foods your brain can eat. they not only help your memory and prevent dementia, they’re also some of the smartest foods you can put into your body. incorporate them into your regular diet and you’ll not only prolong your life, but you’ll also increase your memory, improve your thinking abilities and won’t have to rely on those alzheimer’s drugs so much anymore.

another ‘get hot’ item that many people buy is coffee. you may want to consider drinking it black, if you are not liking the taste of the drink. you can make the coffee in your own home with a great coffee maker. you can add simple powdered ingredients like cocoa, and other spices that can make the drink even more enjoyable. you can even make flavored grinds to add a savory flavor to the coffee.
although, you may not be addicted to coffee, it is a good idea to reduce how much you have every day. when you do go to the store to shop for coffee, look for a few signature machines. these will ensure that you are drinking fresh and quality coffee that is almost free from any harmful ingredients. shop once every couple weeks to ensure you are buying high quality coffee.
