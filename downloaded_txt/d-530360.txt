                    festival of flowersafter 31 incredible years of the providence foundation festival of flowers, the decision has been made to pause the event this year. this is an opportunity to reflect, honor, and celebrate the remarkable contributions of the volunteers, donors, vendors, and community partners who have made this event a success for more than three decades.the festival of flowers has always been about celebrating creativity while raising crucial funds for providence hospital. this success wouldn’t have been possible without the dedication, energy, and passion of so many. this year, the providence foundation will focus on acknowledging the countless hours, ideas, and hearts that have shaped this beloved tradition. a private celebration will be held to honor these individuals in april 2025. thank you to the thousands of community members near and far for being part of this journey and attending the festival of flowers over the years. the providence foundation and usa health leadership will reflect and plan during the new year and look forward to continuing this legacy to support providence hospital, together.can you see it?  click on the "reveal" button to reveal what we're seeing at usa health
