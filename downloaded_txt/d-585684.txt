in i see myself, joe bonsall reflects on the contrasts and the crossroads of his life. from growing up in the inner city of philadelphia to sitting on the front porch of his log home in rural tennessee. from hanging with a street gang in his teens to surrendering to christ at a youth camp. from working as a short order cook to headlining sold-out arenas. and nowâfrom running across the stage each night to being sidelined by a neuromuscular disorder that has stolen his mobility. however, despite the changing circumstances of joeâ s life, two things have not changed. his unwavering faith in god. and his ability to inspire others.

"for someone who âcan't build a campfire,' this city boy from 3517 jasper street has brought a lot of joy and happiness to millions of peopleâand i mean millions ... and a few cats, too. his spiritual strength and love for his country, family, and friends is a great example for all of us to live by. i'm proud to call joe my friend." â joe west, american former baseball umpire.
 
"the series of essays found in between these covers presents the story of a man who never forgot his roots, lived through tragedies, hit wall after wall, and saw each failure as a lesson rather than a stop sign. when his last hurrah was stolen by an illness that is both relentless and unforgiving, he didnât quit living, but rather found new ways to enjoy life and inspire others." â ace collins, bestselling author.
 
"reading i see myself, i found myself crying, smiling, and laughing as i read all these little short stories from joeâs life. this book has so many great moments that show you why joe is the man he is today. i loved going down memory lane in each story. i love you, joe." â ben isaacs, member of the isaacs, gospel music group.

"this book is special because joe gave us the gift of sharing his lifeâs highs and lows at a time when he was quite aware that for him the gift of life heâd found exhilarating was coming to an end. iâm in awe of his life and of the fact that joe has shared it with us in his own words. what a gift. what a legacy." â dan rogers, executive producer, grand ole opry / grateful friend of joe bonsall.
