	 pr and movie!
    


when i had started thinking about current trends in public relations, i do not know why i decided to write about pr and movie industry. there is no books on that subject, and the only information which i could find were in movies magazines, internet and i have some private experience. yes i love good movie.as i know pr companies are very interested about movie industry. why? first of all, it is a good money ( i am sorry, but it is true). secondly, if they are doing all pr stuff like preparing all campaign, press conference or the premier, and the most important (especially for people who likes serial 'sex in the city') after-party.the movie industry has got lot of money, but they do not want to spend a lot, so they try to use pr agency which can do everything cheaper...even that this money are huge. because there is lots of things to do, movie (industry) company is using advertaising agency.when i think about the future, there will be more cooperation between pr and movie industry. preparing a campaign or premier of a famous movie must be really excited.

	 who told that it will be easy?
    


the movie industry is not so easy to promote. but from some time ago there is a big trend to have a pr company which could take care about everytjing. it is important, because to make a movie is not so easy, because actores and whole cast is just people like we are. so they have thir good and bad days. when somebody from cast have this bad day there is a lot of trap for them, so they need somebody who can protect them.another thing is that pr industry is using in tourist promotin. there is lots of nice places which were not well know, but when there were some shoots to a good movie the industry of that country or city increase. it is next mechanism of pr or another trend in pr.every year milion of people spend a few minutes watching a fountains of the bellagio hotel, maybe it is because of the movie 'ocean's eleven' maybe not. or every person who is visiting tunesia is inform that on the sahara desert there were took pistures to 'the star wars'.pr and movie industry must cooperate together, they need each other.

	 the polish movie 'tylko mnie kochaj'
    


after an excelent movie 'nigdy w zyciu' there is time for a second part 'tylko mnie kochaj'. the movie will be on the polish screen on the valentine's day. it is a good promotion of it.the promotion machine moved. the first pictures were created in august, from that time every second day we can find a new materials about movie, actors and so on. even in poland pr industry is working on a good image of the cast.the pictures are taking in sopot, polish see side. in my oppinion this nice city is famous but after that movie will be more famous. the picture are taking in many nice and well recognize place in that city, so after the premier in february there will be more tourist.pr agency decided to promote a movie and thier cast in the charity foodball match. there were two groups, a 'tylko mnie kochaj' and from the series 'm jak milosc'. so the polish society is talking about a new film and thier cast before it is on the screan. every body who saw the first part of the movie and read a book is waiting for next production.  i am waiting too :-)a trailer: http://film.onet.pl/11162,23865,1,0,2,zwiastuny.html

	 'lord of the ring'
    


new zealand a capital of 'lord of the ring'. in 2004 the tourist industry in new zealand 89% of visitors knew that in that country was made a big production of 'lord of the ring'.about 7% of them came to new zealand after the movie, 3% were on the trips which shows places conection with tolkien books and jackson movie. it is another evidence that pr industry can use a movie industry to promote a nice places. pr helps a national economy to increase.

	 daniel radcliff vs harry potter
    


why there is a lots of information that daniel radcliff is too old to be harry potter in the next movie? wow. my explanation is simple. we can always find this information before the next premier or before the movie have their first shoot. i think it is another pr trick.pr company is using that information to promote a new and young actor. it is trend in that industry, everyday we can find many information like this, especially if we check some magazine like the cinema or the paper like the sun. it is a good promotion if actor and a new film.if  funs finds information that d. radcliffe is too old to play in the next part of the harry potter movie they start to call to director and they give a lot of question and their approval for a young actor. they are worried, so they go to the cinema and they spend another money. this trick is good, we can check it, every movie with d. radcliffe brought more money.

	 how harry potter is promote the united kingdom?
    


 the first part of the story 'harry potter and the philosopher's stone' is using by the tourists offices in uk to promote tourists places like the london zoo, the glouster cathedra or the oxford library and hall.it is a really good pr move. lots of children and adults is reading the story evry day and they are watching movie about the young wizard. so, it is naturall that finally somebody decide to use harry and his story for a business purposes.i was one of this people, i like the harry potter books. so, when i was visiting oxford i was really excited, because i knew that in the christ church in the hall there were a shoots to the movie - 'harry potter and the philosopher's stone'. my observation was amazing, there was lots of people like me who want to see this place.when i was looking for some information in the tourist office in oxford a very nice lady informed me that in oxford there is several places to see, the hall in the christ church because of the harry potter movie and there is also a lots of places which are close to book pf l. carroll 'alice's adventures in wonderland'.the pr knowledge is perfectly using in the promotion of the tourists places in the uk. i can just believe that the polish pr company are going to do the same thing during the promotion of our country, they can use to it 'the chronicles of narnia - the lion, the witch and the wardrobe'. good luck!

	 the chronicles of narnia - the lion, the witch and the wardrobe
    


in 7 th of december in poyal albert hall in london had place a premier of the film 'the chronicles of the lion, the witch and the wardrobe'.that day the royal albert hall looked like magic land narnia, full of snow, magic creatures and there was also a lamp. it was special because it was royal premier, what is very important for the british society.the chronicles of narnia - the lion, the witch and the wardrobe was created in the disney studio and the budget is estimated 150 million $. it is till then the most expensive production for the disney. during my research i found that the disneys' studio have financial problems. so they decided to spend lots of money to promote their new film - the chronicles of narnia, not just for advertising. before the premier there was many articles in press. the articles were about the new disney production and very often the disney studio were attacked. magazines like -cinema, film and many more, presented information that the chronicles of narnia have some christian motives, and the catholic church is doing a good and free promotion of it.the movie industry is using a pr knowledge to promote their new films. the disney studio was started promotion of the chronicals of narnia 6 months before premier, and they were exploit media and church. they were attacked because some churches are using film to promote a christian spirit. they interpret some motives like christian one, for example the lion - aslan is compare to christ.this time the disney studio had a good link between politic, religion and business. pr agency found that and they used it to promote that new production. how often movie industry is using pr to promote their new film or to create a good image?
