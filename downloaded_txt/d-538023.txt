      it is the soldier not the 
	reporter who has given us freedom of the press

 
    perceptions are stronger than fact



      loud talkers    low 
	achievers           
	hmm      
	and      

 
       
    freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose.  



destruction is the first resort of the very 
stupid   -   before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig 
two graves

i happen to 
believe that a law abiding citizen should be able to own a firearm,                                 

but i would never advocate that anyone or everybody should.


my 
pledge


i have read sagas 
memorandum 

and support its objectives. i am not a member of any 

organisation 

which wishes 

to overthrow the government of south africa 

by force.


i have never been 

charged or
convicted 
of a crime of violence.
i will hold to sagas principles of safety and responsibility in firearm 
ownership and handling and will fulfil the 

obligations of good 
sportsmanship 

and good citizenship.


memorandum



saga is an independent non-party-political, 
non-profit


association of law abiding citizens.
saga was formed to protect 

the rights 
of citizens who own, or wish 
to 
own, firearms 
for

legitimate 
purposes.
saga acts as a spokesman for all responsible firearm owners and 
strives 
to 
promote the many positive aspects of 
private firearm ownership.


saga 
negotiates
with government 
and other bodies to obtain reasonable and 
rational firearm-related 
legislation and 
regulations.


saga promotes the 

safe handling,

safekeeping 
and judicious use 

of firearms 

for sport, recreation and 

personal protection.
saga's 

overall 
objective is to 

protect and promote the interests of owners of firearms in south africa
and to encourage 

safety and responsibility in 

the ownership of firearms.
