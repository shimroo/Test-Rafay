deep sea fishing with the kelley fishing fleet
when capt. george kelley started the kelley fleet in 1957, his goal was to offer the public a safe, low-cost way to enjoy deep-sea fishing. this meant replacing old uninspected boats with modern us coast guard inspected vessels and concentrating on superior customer service. pretty simpleâ¦and it workedâ¦ 
today, weâre still operating from the same location. haulover marina is just minutes from great atlantic fishing and weâre easy to reach from ft. lauderdale, hollywood, south beach and anywhere else in south florida. from solo anglers to chartered affairs, our fleet of spacious custom-built vessels and award-winning service will meet your needs.
give us a call today. capt. kelley and his family are still here to extend you a warm âwelcome aboard!â
