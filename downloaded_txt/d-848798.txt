here’s what our happy customers have to say… 

  
butter baths have been a godsend

“
i was introduced to global soap by a friend i used to work with in australia, who hails from nelson nz. when i checked out the website i found a few things that i wanted to try, like the furniture polish and the butter baths. initially i was impressed by the service (and the fact they posted to australia!), and once i received my order, i just loved the fragrance and quality of all of it. i also have to say, that as i am now pregnant, the butter baths have been a godsend as my skin stretches - they stop me feeling dry and itchy as my belly expands! i have recently run out, and am about to order some more today 🙂 also the fragrance of the furniture polish offers a pleasantness to the household chores.”

“
i love this soap and have been using it since a visit to nelson last year. i have finally found a soap i can use on my dry sensitive skin. previously i had to use sensitive body wash and hated the amount of plastic i was adding to the environment. also being able to order online and get it delivered so quickly makes the whole process so easy - but i would love to come back someday and have a proper fossick through the other beautiful scented delights!”
