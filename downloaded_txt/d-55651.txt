latest album -- "dream 
			world"





in this album, i revisit and 
			reinterpret some of the songs i 
			have written over the past 40 years, but never released.  the common 
			element is 
			relationships, with partners, family, friends, colleagues, and 
			ourselves. in a sense, i connected with the person i was when i 
			wrote them, adding the perspective of subsequent life experiences. 
			the 15 tracks encompass a broad range of genres, 
			including rock, pop, and country anthems and ballads. i hope you enjoy it.
and the 2024 follow-up album is in progress . . .
