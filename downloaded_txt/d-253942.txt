the plansource, inc advantage: unlike other websites that are operated by the same 
				   parent company and acting as resellers for the designs of others, we 
				   are an independent company with our own exclusive designs. 
				   with everything being done in-house rather than offering 3rd 
				   party plans across different websites, it allows us to keep 
				   overhead down and work with you on achieving the plans you desire for your project 
				   at a better price. in short, we are not a "middle man" in your 
				   plan search like so many other plan sites. 
				   to help keep your construction costs down, most of 
				   our plans are designed from the beginning to be light on 
				   material to help get the most from your budget.
