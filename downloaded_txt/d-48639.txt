 golf tip of the fortnight 
iron play tip

i see many people that strike their iron shots fat and thin frequently, and almost never very crisply. as an experiment, try hitting all your iron shots with as low a trajectory as you possibly can (without moving the ball back in your stance!). this will promote a hands forward position at impact, which is an important sensation to cultivate. in fact, irons are made to be contacted in a hands-forward 
position.you may be surprised at how high the ball goes even when attempting to hit it lower.

i work with golfers of all skill levels on all areas of their games (individually or in small groups of friends, family, co-workers, etc.) in my private golf schools.
