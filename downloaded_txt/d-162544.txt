confidentiality in adoption 
confidentiality in adoption means that   those who are separated do not andâ  cannot know each other.â  
	  in   most states there are a minimum of seven ways people can and do find and know each other without having an original birth   certificate.,â 
everyone has the right to refuse   contact.â  
	  that is the only degree of confidentiality that 
    exists, and   it exists whether you do or do not have your original birth   certificate.â 
 several ways adult   adoptees and birth parents can find each other   under 
    the sealed birth certificate system in   most states


â good causeâ  - under the law in most states, all   sealed birth certificates may beâ  accessed withâ 
          a showing â of good cause.â    the birth certificate accessed could be the one that locates the one 
        birth   parent or adoptee who does not want to be found.â 


support groups - support groups have a very good   reputation for helping triad membersâ 
          access birthâ information and locate   birth relatives.â  the relative they find may be the oneâ birth parent or adoptee that does not want to be foundâ 


black market - for a   price, most people can be found if the information has notâ  been   falsified,.those with means can find; those without cannot


agency searchesâ  - finding   one member of the birth family gives possible access to allâ 
          members of the   â birth family.â  access to any member may lead to the one birth parent   who
        does not want to be found 


internet - finding on the   internet is rapidly becoming a science.â  this can lead to the oneâ 
          birth   parent or adoptee who does not want to be found.


identifying informationâ  - given to adoptive parents or keeping the   adoptee's originalâ 
          birth nameâ could locate that one birth parent or adoptee   who does not want to be found.â 


private investigators -   can find the one birth parent or adoptee who does not want to   found.â 


sealed birth certificates are a symbol of a   confidentiality that does not exist -â  not when people can and
	  do   findâ each other daily.â unsealed birth certificates are a symbol of an adoptee's   identity and their civil
    rights as a citizen.
