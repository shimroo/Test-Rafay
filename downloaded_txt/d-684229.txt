we are considered unique by recruiting firm standards in that we offer two equally attractive engagement options to our clients. for some clients a retained search is the appropriate option to fill a crucial need, while for some others a contingency arrangement is the more practical option, and for many, a tailored combination of both could be the ideal solution. there are several criteria with which this decision is made and we pride ourselves on our ability to be flexible and responsive to a clients unique needs. from our standpoint the most important factors are the nature and the level of the position as well as the sensitivity of the assignment. please contact us directly at (630)-690-0055 for further information on the appropriate arrangement for your needs as well as our fee schedule.
