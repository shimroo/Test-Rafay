                      	 chicken oporto
	                       
                          

this is a family staple, and probably my favorite chicken dish to make. it is absolutely to die for and easy to boot!ingredients1/2 cup butter1/2 lb mushrooms, thinly sliced1/4 cup ap flour2 teaspoons salt1/4 teaspoon pepper1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg6-8 chicken breast halves1 1/2 cups heavy or whipping cream1/2 cup white port wine (i often substitute cooking sherry and it works wonderfully as well)directions-in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat, in hot butter, cook mushrooms five minutes. with slotted spoon, remove to small bowl, set aside.-on waxed paper or in small flat container (i used a square tupperward container), combine flour, salt, pepper and nutmeg. use to coat chicken chicken breasts. in same skillet in remaining butter over medium-high heat, cook the chicken breasts until browned on all sides.-sitr in cream, port and mushrooms; heat to boiling. reduce heat to low; cover and simmer 30-45 minutes or until chicken is fork-tender. the longer you have to simmer, the better it tastes!

                      	 new orleans pancakes
	                       
                          

this recipe comes from a typewritten cookbook i bought for 25 cents at an estate sale. it was written by the woman's club of the united states public health service hospital from new orleans, louisiana in 1967 so i figured it would have some great, old school new orleans-style recipes. and i was right!  this is one of my favorites, and i typically have all the ingredients on hand. it makes a pancake that's like a cross between a crepe and a pancake. yum.ingredients4 eggs1 cup cottage cheese or ricotta1 cup sour cream1 tablespoon sugar1/2 teaspoon salt1 light cup flourdirectionsmix all ingredients and drop by large spoonfuls on griddle like pancakes. serve with jams, jellies, or butter and syrup.

                      	 spinach parmesan balls
	                       
                          

these make a great party appetizer, but i really love them as a dinner side. this is a great way to make vegetables palatable, it's inexpensive, uses ingredients you have on hand, and is really very easy!ingredients2 (10 oz) boxes frozen spinach, thawed, drained, squeezed dry4 t butter, melted1/2 yellow onion, diced2 t minced garlic1/2 t italian seasoning2 eggs, beaten1 cup dry breadcrumbs1 cup grated parmesan cheese1 t black pepper1 t saltdirections-preheat oven to 375 degrees. spray a baking sheet with nonstick spray-stir all ingredients together in large mixing bowl. form mixture into 1 1/2 inch balls and place one inch apart on baking sheet. (i made larger balls and served two to a plate as a dinner side. they were excellent.)-bake 15 minutes, until puffed and slightly brown. serve warm.

                      	 beef hash
	                       
                          

beef hash sounds kind of yucky. but trust me, it tastes great! my whole family loves this recipe, and it's a great way to make a pot roast (or any beef leftovers) go an extra night. if you don't have leftovers, just buy 6 ounces of deli roast beef. serve it for breakfast or dinner.ingredients1 cup cubed, cooked beef1 cup peeled, cubed red potato (any potato will do in a pinch)1/2 cup chopped onion1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley1/4 teaspoon salt1/4 teaspoon pepper1 tablespoon vegetable oil1/3 cup milkdirectionscombine first 6 ingredients. cook misxutre in hot oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat ten minutes or until mixture is browned and potatoes are tender, stirring occasionally.stir in milk, cover, reduce heat, and simmer five minutes.

                      	 roasted pumpkin seeds
	                       
                          

ingredients-pumpkin seeds-salt-old bay seasoning (optional)-olive oil (optional)-soy sauce (optionaldirectionswash seeds. soak in water for 8-24 hours. dry with paper towels. (they do not need to be completely dry for this recipe).preheat oven to 250 degrees.spray a tray with non-stick spray, then spread pumpkin seeds on it and season with old bay and salt, or whatever spices you prefer.roast in oven for about an hour to 1 hour, 20 minutes, taking pan out every 10-15 minutes to shake seeds around.once seeds are done, you might want to drizzle a little olive oil and soy sauce over the seeds, then stir them up. the soy sauce has gotten raves from others online, but i personally haven't tried it yet. i was just happy to find a recipe that didn't scorch my seeds!

                      	 durkee's chicken
	                       
                          

this recipe is both easy and a great money-saver. buy the largest package of breasts you can find so that you'll have a couple of halves left over; use them in the chicken a la king recipe the next night. also, a jar of durkee's is good for two batches of this chicken! my family loves it!ingredients6 chicken breast halves1/4 cup ap or whole wheat flour1/2 cup butter, melted, or 1/2 cup oil1/2 cup durkee's famous sauce (1/2 of a bottle)3 cups cooked ricedirectionsplace flour in small, flat container, dredge chicken breast halves in it and place in single layer in shallow baking dish.blend butter and durkee's; pour over chicken.bake, covered, at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. uncover, bake 15 minutes more or until brown. serve chicken atop bed of rice, pour drippings over all.
