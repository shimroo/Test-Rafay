what our members say







i’ve seen how much we can accomplish for san diego physicians and their patients when we work together... it is essential that we speak with one voice in order to preserve the practice of medicine and protect the health and lives of our patients.


wayne sun, md











[sdcms is] the most effective way to have an impact on important issues that affect the daily lives of physicians and patients. time and time again, i’ve seen sdcms and cma make a key differences on matters ranging from physician wellness to reimbursement rates to public health to promoting diversity in medicine.  


toluwalase (lase) a. ajayi, md











no other organization supports physicians and advocates for the best interests of doctors and patients like sdcms. it’s impressive how much they do. i’m also grateful for the relationships that sdcms has helped me build with my fellow physicians throughout san diego county.
