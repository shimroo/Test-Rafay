planes in our world
























paragliding – as one of the most spectacular types of flights the sky has always attracted with its infinitely large horizon and opportunities. thanks to technical discoveries – we can ascend to the sky by plane or helicopter and fly anywhere. but at the expense of feelings and emotions, which is not comparable to anything you get while flying a paraglider. there are no cabins that are not the roar of the engine, but only the wind, the sky and freedom from flight.
the paraglider is a fairly light aircraft, and looks like a parachute, but still has a few differences. the wing of the paraglider is much longer with a flatter surface. and unlike a parachute, in which the flight on which the height decreases, the paraglider flies directly, using upward air currents. the design of the paraglider consists of a fabric wing, which consists of two panels and a sling system. when flying a paraglider, the rate of descent is one meter per second. the duration of the flight can be adjusted independently, due to weather conditions and finding upward air currents. one paragliding flight can last more than 5 hours. the altitude of paragliding can exceed 1000 meters.
the best thing about paragliding is that the flight is available to most people. independent flights are allowed from 16 years. every year this type of flight develops at a rapid pace and the number involved in paragliding increases. paragliding has many advantages over other aircraft – availability and minimum requirements, and adrenaline, excitement and thrills can not be compared with anything else.
