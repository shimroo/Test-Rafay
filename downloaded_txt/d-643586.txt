cathyâ€™s most popular presentationwhat is coming up for 2025? 
being close to home in the pyrenees means ski touring. looking forward, i have a trip Â to new zealand south island, a wonderful adventure mix of sea kayaking, caving and canyoning. spring will bring ski touring in the alps, sea kayaking in turkey and canyoning in the balkans. towards the end of the year i have a private trip down the grand canyon.
there is still plenty of space on the calendar for the serendipitous adventure, planned at short notice. and to accept speaking engagements, virtual and in-person. my first talk of 2025 â€“ a new country to add to the 47 where i have already given paid speeches. heading to mauritius!

exploring the canyons of the world! 
iâ€™m just back from a brilliant trip to utah, exploring the canyons of zion national park, escalante and capitol reef. definitely a place to go back to!
now iâ€™m busy with the final planning for two weeks canyoning in ticino in switzerland, the most famous concentration of canyons in europe. from there i will be heading north with my car and my sea kayak, for a week paddling along the west coast of sweden, followed by several weeks exploring the fjords of southern norway.
