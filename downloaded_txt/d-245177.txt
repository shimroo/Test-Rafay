aviation 
      links from pilotfriend 


we have experience some 
      difficulties with our server when using forms, as security arrangements 
      have been tightened up.

if you would like to have your link included 
      on our pages, please read the following requirements.
pilotfriend will only accept websites 
      relating to aviation. we do have a category for 'other interesting 
      websites' and we add these at our discretion only.


popups attached to your 
       homepage will disqualify your website.

any programme attached to 
       your index page that 'takes over' the browser will be disqualified.

we do not accept websites 
       'under construction'.

pilotfriend is an 
       international website. we will therefore not accept any website which has 
       overtly political or racist content. 

any website which 
       contains any porn content will be disqualified.

our links are moderated, 
       and should any link change its contents description, it shall be removed 
       and the url banned.

we will not accept any 
       website that is promoting an individual book.

you must have placed a 
       link back to www.pilotfriend.com 
       with the description of 'aviation portal' before submitting your 
       website.

if you do not wish to 
       place a reciprocal link on your website, you can still be included as a
       

       featured ad..

your links page must have 
       a direct visible hyperlink from your homepage.


just 
email to us 
      including:

1.  name of your website
      2.  a short description of your website
      3.  website url
      4.  the webpage where you have created a link to pilotfriend.
      5.  the specific page of our links where you wish the link to be 
      added to (such as 'aircraft rentals')

we will then add your link
