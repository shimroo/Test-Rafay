” i was in a summer program when i was just a real little child about three. i can remember playing around in a wading pool. when i was 3 1/2 years old, i can also remember quite a few things. i can remember the frustration of not being able to talk. i knew what i wanted to say, but i could not get the words out, so i would just scream. i can remember this very clearly.” 
– dr. temple grandin
