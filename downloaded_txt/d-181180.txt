about aikido
the nature and history of aikido
the japanese word aikido is written with three
	  characters which translate as "the way of spiritual
	  harmony." aikido is a budo or "martial way," evolved in
	  the tradition of japanese warrior arts, yet has a unique
	  approach to self defense. aikido is more than a martial
	  science of strategy and tactics, it is a discipline for
	  training the mind and spirit.
aikido was developed by morihei ueshiba (1883-1969),
	  known to aikido students as o sensei (great teacher). as a
	  young man, he overcame debilitating childhood illnesses
	  through martial arts practice, eventually becoming a
	  master of the sword,the staff, the spear, and the art of
	  ju-jitsu. o sensei also held strong shinto religious
	  convictions concerning the ultimate futility of conflict
	  and the illusory character of victory based on
	  strength. this internal contradiction, which drove o
	  sensei to adopt a life of austerity and rigorous training,
	  was resolved through an enlightenment experience which led
	  to the development of aikido, a martial art influenced by
	  a philosophy of universal harmony.
dynamics of aikido
all aikido techniques and movements are based on the
	  idea of harmony. aikido emphasizes blending with an
	  attacker by moving in such a way as to neutralize the
	  force of the attack itself and thus neutralize the
	  attacker. this is done by using spherical movements which
	  allow the aikido student to deflect the attacker's energy
	  while simultaneously entering close to the attacker; "to
	  blend with the attack," and so neutralize it.
properly executed, some techniques are spectacular,
	  sending the opponent flying through the air. others are
	  more subtle: small deft movements that immobilize the
	  aggressor. both results are achieved not through the use
	  of brute strength, but by blending and neutralizing the
	  attack, followed by circular and flowing techniques to
	  unsettle the opponent, and completing the movement with a
	  throw or immobilization. because great strength is not
	  required,
	  aikido can be practiced by men and women of all
	  ages.
aikido practice
aikido training has also been shaped by its philosophy of
	  harmony. there are no competitions or tournaments in
	  aikido. rank is awarded through a testing procedure which emphasizes
	  self-discipline, rather than the mastery of others. daily
	  practice focuses on the development of technical skills and
	  awareness through the constant repetition of techniques in a
	  controlled environment in order to master the fundamentals
	  of moving, timing, and breathing.
	  



	    most practice is done with a partner: each working at
	    his or her own level of ability, alternating as uke (the
	    attacker) and nage (the one who is attacked). both roles
	    are stressed; each contributes skills that enhance
	    overall sensitivity and control.
	  
wooden practice weapons â a sword (bokken),
	  staff (jo) and knife (tanto) â are
	  sometimes used in aikido training, not to understand how
	  to use the weapon, but to better understand the techniques and
	  movements of aikido itself.
	  
students train to neutralize the energy of the
	  opponent's attack and to redirect and focus it into
	  techniques of martial efficiency and power. at the same
	  time, the student can use the same philosophy to deal with
	  stress and conflict in daily life, and learn to remain
	  calm under all conditions.
centering
the final aim of aikido is to integrate physical and
	  mental training to develop a confident person who can
	  think clearly and react instantly on and off the mat. it
	  is only through constant training that an aikidoist can
	  acquire the habits of mind which make this integration
	  possible.
in aikido, such an integrated person is said to be
	  "centered." a centered person displays a confident and
	  relaxed posture, and centering gives aikido movements
	  their appearance of grace and simple elegance. thus,
	  aikido training helps a student to become calm and
	  centered and enables the student to deal with stress and
	  aggression in an efficient and decisive manner on the mat,
	  at home, at school, or at work.

how to begin practicing at capital aikikai

the best way to start training at capital aikikai is to
	    show up!  aikido is a very open and inviting martial
	    art. previous martial arts experience is not required to
	    begin practice, and at all levels, you'll find aikido
	    practice to be quite social and cooperative. in aikido we
	    practice with each other, not against each other.
if you are unfamiliar with aikido practice then you
	    have a few options available to you to help you learn
	    more. you can visit one of our classes and watch; you can
	    join our beginners class; or you can practice in any of
	    our general-level classes.
visitors interested in learning more about training at
	    capital aikikai are encouraged to stop by and watch a
	    class.  we kindly ask that new students show up 15-20
	    minutes before the scheduled class start time and
	    introduce yourself to one of our members and complete a
	    liability waiver form.
please review the information given below to decide which
	    approach you think is right for you.
	    

beginners classes
we dedicate one class per week specifically for
	    newer students.  the focus of this class is learning
	    the fundamentals of how to roll/fall safely ("ukemi"),
	    the core stance ("hanmi") and footwork of aikido, and
	    basic techniques and vocabulary.
the beginners class is a good place to start your
	    journey with others who are also new to aikido. senior
	    students are there to work with you.  after a few sessions
	    in the beginners class you should feel ready to jump into
	    the general practice at any of the other capital aikikai
	    classes.  check the class schedule
	    above for the day and time of the beginners class.
to attend the beginners class please show up about
	    15-20 minutes prior to the start time and introduce
	    yourself to the instructor.  wear comfortable clothes
	    for working out, e.g. full-length sweat pants and a
	    t-shirt.  no shorts or jewelry please.  changing rooms are
	    available at the dojo.

attending general classes
you can start participating in any of capital aikikai's
	    regular scheduled classes
	    immediately.  you may attend your first three classes,
	    beginners or general, at no charge to see if aikido is
	    right for you.  to start practicing with us please show up
	    15-20 minutes prior to the scheduled start time and
	    approach one of the students (before class begins),
	    introduce yourself and sign a waiver. that's all!  you can
	    then take the class. you'll need to wear a dogi or a pair
	    of sweat pants and t-shirt (no shorts or jewelry, please).
	    changing rooms and showers are available.
classes are ongoing; new students simply begin
	    attending the classes they prefer.  aikido training in
	    general has no fixed curriculum.  for your first few
	    classes you will receive personalized instruction,
	    generally from one of the dojo's advanced students. very
	    soon afterward you will be practicing with everyone else
	    in the class as a regular student.
it helps to be in reasonable physical shape, but this
	    is not a requirement. as you continue to practice, you
	    will begin to achieve increased flexibility and balance,
	    and better breathing.
there are no contracts or long-term fees at capital
	    aikikai. new students are entitled to three free
	    classes. after that, you would have to pay either a
	    daily mat fee ($15 for each day you practice) or a
	    monthly membership fee ($80 per month). if you plan to
	    practice more than twice a week, the monthly rate will
	    probably be more practical.  you can pay online using
	    our payments page.

thinking of beginning aikido? often-asked questions
what is aikido?
aikido is a martial discipline for training the mind
	    and spirit. aikido does not stress competition, but
	    emphasizes a win-win situation that helps develop a
	    spirit of harmony and cooperation, mutual respect and
	    consideration for others.
from a technical standpoint, aikido is basically
	    defensive and oriented towardrolling, joint locks,
	    flowing movement and control of balance. it is not
	    "rough," and in fact appears to be quite smooth and
	    graceful to first-time visitors. 
what is aikido training like? what can i expect?
aikido is basically oriented toward rolling, joint
	    locks, flowing movement and control of
	    balance. weapons training emphasizes the
	    basic postures and stances that are a fundamental part
	    of aikido.
when you visit or begin your training, you will learn
	    the most basic â and important â things
	    first: how to roll, how to stand properly,
	    etc. as you progress you will begin to learn the
	    fundamental movements from which techniques
	    develop. during a typical class you will practice with a
	    variety of partners, of all skill levels.
you do not need to be in excellent aerobic or
	    muscular shape to practice aikido, but as you progress
	    you will find youself becoming more healthy and fit.
when is capital aikikai open?
we are open and training seven days a week. classes
	    are held in the evenings during the week, and in the
	    mornings during the weekend. please click for
	    our daily practice schedule. 
can i watch or try a class?
yes! visitors are always welcome to stop by and watch
	    or take classes. if you would like to try a class, just
	    show up about 20 minutes beforehand and ask one of the
	    waiting students or instructors about taking a
	    class. generally, first-time students are given personal
	    orientation and instruction by one of the dojo's yudansha
	    (black-belt students). new students are welcome to any of
	    the general classes. you do not have to call ahead or make
	    other arrangements. 
what type of people train in aikido?
all kinds of people train in aikido â men and women,
	    young and old, even children. because aikido is based on
	    balance and circular movement, strength and size is not
	    particularly important in training. in fact, women often
	    have a natural affinity for aikido because, unlike men,
	    they often do not have to unlearn forceful or muscular
	    habits in their movement.
one unique feature of aikido training is
	    the mixing of all skill levels.
do i need special clothing or equipment?
if you want to try attending a class or two, simply
	    bring loose-fitting clothing such as a t-shirt and sweat
	    pants. be sure to remove any watches, jewelry,
	    etc. before stepping on the mat. the aikido "uniform" is
	    a judo-style dogi, available either from us or from
	    various area martial arts equipment suppliers, as are
	    wooden practice weapons. showers are available in both
	    the men's and women's changing rooms.
typically we train in bare feet, on a canvas-covered
	    mat.
how much does it cost to train?
those practicing regularly at the dojo are expected
	    to pay monthly dues. new or
	    prospective members may take three classes free of
	    charge. there are no hidden fees, term limits or
	    contracts.
