hello my visitors...i enjoy writing 
      fictitious tails about fishing that are on the humorous side.  please 
      enjoy what i hope you will find as funny as i 
do...




cool links for the accomplished 
      angler














the best technical rods 
      for the accomplished angler









the best accessory line 
      of products for hiking into high mountain lakes and streams.  why do 
      i say that?  because i use them 
silly.









i like my boats like my 
      men.  to be able to withstand my abuse and keep on going.  
      willie boats are just "simply the 
best".

angie's 
      guide page want to go with a guide who  will actually take you 
      when fishing is good or tell you when it sucks?   why would i do 
      that?  because i only go when we'll catch fish. getting skunked and 
      fishing in over crowded conditions makes my clients cranky and i just hate 
      that..









hidy 
      hoh! i'm angie and i'm like one of the only female fishing guides in 
      the northwest.  i'm different from other guides because i lack 
      testerone and actually give a rip about your fishing experience. like we 
      only go when you'll catch something and you'll actually learn a thing or 
      two.  please see my guide page!  i'm not just another pretty 
      face.  i'm as tough as i am 
hot.




my 
      lovely sidekick danny and i fly fishing the skykomish. fishing for 
      summerruns in shorts is one of my favorite things to do. why would you 
      wear waders when it's 90 degrees out? isn't that stupid?  fishing in 
      the elements means just going with 
it.









please 
      note i've fished in some of the world's most beautiful places. why don't 
      you all  take some intiative and let me show them to you.  
      imagine getting into your car and driving to them?  come on it just 
      takes one phone call or one email.  you too can have an experience of 
      a life time.  i have them all the time and so can 
      you.



















  warning: this website is not for the 
      weak and the sensitive fisherman. this is for all of you secure in your 
      fishing manhood. you happy go lucky folks that want to discuss fishing, 
      see some pictures, bash some idiots and have some good wholesome fun. hee 
      hee...
