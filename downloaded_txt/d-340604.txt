done read that.



it all started with a challenge....

one friend dares other friends to start blogs.  personally, i can't stand being on the web.  however, i also can't resist telling people about the books i've read.  so, a book blog was born.

closing shop





i'm finding that i have less and less time to sit in front of a computer these days.  because of that, updating this website has become more and more of a chore instead of a pleasure.  i do like looking back on what i've read, so i'm going to give good reads a try.  it's a bit more automated and hopefully a bit less work.if you're a good reads member, look me up.  my user name is the first 3 letters of my first name and last name.

the sons of heaven ~ kage baker





this is the company novel that finally answers the question "what happens after the silence falls on july 9, 2355?"  for fans of the company series, this is one satisfying book.  it doesn't fall into that dreaded sci-fi trap of "to be continued."  instead, baker elegantly answers all the questions, wraps up the loose ends, and still leaves a possibility for further stories.  the best of both worlds!

it's all too much: an easy plan for living a richer life with less stuff ~ peter walsh





a dead easy read (i read it cover to cover in less than an hour), this book has some good advice for cleaning up and throwing out.  as someone who has been carting around childhood mementos ever since my mother downsized from a house to an apartment, i can take a lot of his advice to heart. he advises that the first step toward getting rid of emotional and physical clutter is to decide you want to change, then imagine the life you really desire. i can probably live without this step - but some of the advice on deciding a room's function and purpose would be good when applied to our remodeling plans. the second step is to demystify the causes, costs and conflicts surrounding clutter, and to incorporate small acts of organization, or "daily rituals," into your normal routine. next, walsh offers organizational strategies based on your lifestyle and each room's function and purpose. he finishes up with a maintenance plan, a cleanup "checkup," and suggested monthly rituals for proactive planning and year-long order.

the happiest baby on the block ~ harvey karp, md





once again, boil this one down to a tri-fold leaflet and i'd be much happier.  the rest of the book is just filler.

automated alice ~ jeff noon

the feminine mistake ~ leslie bennetts





boy, i'd really like to discuss  this book in depth, but taking care of a newborn means that i don't really have the time. this is from the jacket blurb......the arguments for stay-at-home motherhood also fail to consider the dangers of dependency and the difficulty of reentering the workforce after opting out. when women sacrifice their financial autonomy by quitting their jobs, they become vulnerable to divorce as well as the potential illness, death, or unemployment of their breadwinner husbands.basically, it argues that the financial and personal rewards of working are more beneficial for your and your child's well-being than the temporary rewards of staying at home.  having had both a stay-at-home grandmother and a working mother, i've seen both sides of this and benefited greatly from having female role models on both sides of this argument.  i don't think any "side" is right.  it's just what's right for your family.trying to decide for myself though is difficult.  if i'm a stay-at-home mom, then my child doesn't benefit from seeing me as a working woman.  if i'm a working mom, then my child doesn't benefit from the added security of having a parent home at all times.  as you can see, i'm still working through this issue.

the mistress's daughter ~ a.m. homes





ms. homes is a fiction writer but writes her memoir as an adoptee.  from the beginning, you follow as she is plunged into a life-altering change after her birth mother contacts her through her lawyer.  there is no turning back from this knowledge and it utterly changes her and her life.  sadly, unlike a novel, the ups and downs and crazy roller-coaster ride of adoption turmoil is actually the life that someone lived.her birth parents turn out to be unsavory people and her birth the result of their adulterous union.  her birth mother is needy in a way that can never be satisfied and frankly, is undeserved.  her need quickly becomes stalkerish. her birth father treats her not as a person, but as a secret to be covered up.  full of grand gestures, he wants to include her in his family but offers that she call his car phone "since his wife is hardly ever in the car."  after promising to, he ultimately refuses to introduce her to her half-siblings.  the pain of finding her birth parents combined with their need to either engulf her or hide her is tremendous and sends ms. homes into a whirlwind of emotions.the questions hidden within the work are intriguing. do birth parents have a moral obligation to surrender information? a legal obligation? how far is too far for a birth parent to go when seeking an active reunion? how far is too far when the adoptee has not initiated the search?very well written and intriguing book.  recommended.

obit: inspiring stories of ordinary people who led extraordinary lives ~ jim sheeler





again, why i love the library.  they don't have a book; you request it; they buy it; you read it.  love them!!this is an interesting collection of obituaries written by pulitzer prize winner jim sheeler.  most of the obituaries we read are of famous people.  mr. sheeler has made an art out of writing obituaries for ordinary people - but their stories are anything but ordinary.  at turns inspiring, remarkable, and earth-shattering, their stories are written in bare, direct prose and elevated to the status of legend by the author.

cheese, glorious cheese: more than 75 tempting recipes for cheese lovers everywhere ~ paula lambert





the table of contents on this was enough to make me drool!  i normally check out new cookbooks from the library because so many of them turn out to be disappointing.  this one however had so many good and easy to follow recipes that i quickly turned around and bought myself a copy.  the gouda bread pudding is going to become a holiday staple around this house if i have anything to say about it!

complications: a surgeon's notes on an imperfect science ~ atul gawande





this is dr. gawande's first book - just as enjoyable a read and as thought-provoking as better.  in this book, he explores the power and the limits of medicine through accounts of true cases.    we like to think that medicine is a perfect science with doctors giving us definitive answers and operating with supreme skill.  yet, that is often not the case.  seen through his insider eyes, medicine is revealed as an imperfect science, full of â€œconstantly changing knowledge, uncertain information, fallible individuals, and at the same time, lives on the line." consider the balance between the desire for the best possible care with the need to train the next generation of doctors. new techniques carry steep learning curves, and while doctors improve greatly with practice, that is scant consolation to first patients they treat.  if you were given the choice between a resident performing a procedure for the first time versus a doctor who had years of experience, which would you choose?  most would choose the experienced doctor.  so to get the practice they need, many times doctors do not give the patients a choice.   they are simply told that "dr. so and so will be assisting the procedure,"  when assisting means doing the procedure while the senior doctor watches.  is this ethical even though it is necessary?these are the type of questions that dr. gawande ponders.  his skill as a storyteller and his invaluable honesty pays off, painting an inspiring picture of medicine as an imperfect pursuit, but a noble one nonetheless.

eternals ~ neil gaiman





the eternals deals with familiar territory for gaiman: a race of immortal, super-powered beings called the eternals who had been worshipped as gods by humans before they drifted into obscurity and began living undercover.  maybe a little too familiar.  the story never captured me.

better: a surgeon's notes on performance ~ atul gawande





ah, the capricious timing of the library hold system!  just when i'm about to head into the hospital to give birth, the library delivers mr. gawande's unflinching look at the sheer human fallibility of doctors.  the library gods have a distinct sense of humor! i've read a number of his essays in the new yorker and love his writing.  he's got a real knack for putting science into layman's terms, while exposing deeper truths that most would never notice.  he tackles many difficult issues, such as bacteria transfer in hospitals.  he demonstrates how hard it is to do something as simple as wash your hands in between patients - something that would greatly cut down on the risk of inflection.  yet, doctors, being human, often forget or decide to skip this step -- not out of carelessness but simply because they do it so often. his book is full of great insights into the medical profession - everything from the distribution of polio vaccines to doctors who oversee death sentences.  in the end though, his message that doctors are only human is always followed by the corollary that they also must always be diligent and resourceful in fulfilling their duties.   by striving to be better, they raise the standard of care for us all.

asimov's science fiction magazine: 30th anniversary anthology ~ sheila williams (editor)





i love buying asimov's magazine when i travel.  it's perfect for travel - lightweight, disposable, and has short stories that can be completed while waiting for take-off. at home though, it's a different experience.  i'd much rather dive deeply into a novel than quickly skip through a couple of stories at a sitting.  this anthology suffered because of that.  the stories are still quite good...just too short.
