"the soul shack" by justin waterman







what is the soul shack?


the soul shack was an idea born in the late 1990's when scott relf and 

johnny rivera started to get together occasionally to listen to old r&b, blues, funk and

  soul records. as time went on, and their record collections expanded, they realized that it was a

  shame that only they were hearing this music and that they needed an audience. they began to

  record shows dubbed "the soul shack". it featured the very best in 60's and 70's soul music.  

the show first appeared online march 14, 2001 and ran until april 28, 2007.  

they produced 162 episodes plus 33 editions of the night hawk show 

which featured the very best in 50's rock 'n' rhythm records.

the show appeared on radio stations in winnipeg, south carolina and 

west yorkshire, england, among other places.


johnny rivera passed away in october of 2022, but his memory will live on in these timeless programs.

each week a classic episode of the soul shack or the night hawk show will continue to be available.
