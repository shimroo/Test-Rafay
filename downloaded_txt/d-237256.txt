welcome from the onrc director
thank you for visiting our website. the olympic natural resources center—in forks, wa—is administered by the university of washington’s college of environment, and the school of environment and forest science. the center was established in 1991 by the washington legislature to pursue the goal of better integrating ecology and economics in the management of both forest and marine resources. our current focus is to help sustain our treasured resources by serving as catalyst to simultaneously improve the wellbeing of communities and environment. we pursue this goal through research, education, and outreach, and by applying an approach that we call learning-based collaboration. this approach has helped us serve washington by bridging across the different perspectives of researchers and managers and among various stakeholder and tribal communities. we invite you to join with us.
bernard bormann
onrc director
