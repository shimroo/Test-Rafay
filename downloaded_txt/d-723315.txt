				about
			




about bellarmine

		bellarmine preparatory school is a catholic college preparatory school in the jesuit tradition of education. under the inspired leadership of the jesuits, the school was founded in 1928 in a lone building on what was then a remote hilltop overlooking the young city of tacoma – a site it still occupies today.

faith and service

		as a catholic school, we believe that jesus' message is that god loves us, calls us to him, and that all people are brothers and sisters. this provides a challenge for us. the call to be a follower of christ, through the church community and in service to the world, is one of continual conversion. it is our hope and prayer that bellarmine, with the help of god's grace, is a place where this can begin and continue.
