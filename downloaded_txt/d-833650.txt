why do i need gutters and why choose seamless aluminum?





seamless gutters means there are no joints to leak. the finish on the materials will not blister, flake, chip, crack or peel for a period of twenty years. when considering the addition of seamless gutters it is imperative that you hire a professional roofing contractor to perform the installation. be sure to do some research when you are deciding on a san antonio roofing contractor; qualified roofing contractors will be listed with professional trade organizations in your local area. you can also use the internet to help in this process. some of the more common ones for this type of industry are: the bbb, angies's list, and service magic.
key benefits:
• no need to repaint year after year.
• aluminum doesn't rust like galvanized steel.
• aluminum is lighter than steel.
• with no seams, except at the corners, you can be sure that there will be no leaks.
• gutters are offered in 14 different colors, which are baked on for a long-lasting, beautiful appearance.
• seamless guttering provides a more uniform appearance.

why do i need gutters?
• controls roof run-off.
• water is the most destructive element to houses.
• helps prevent wet walls.
• helps prevent wall stains from roof splash-over.
• adds value to the home.
• prevents "waterfall" during storms when entering or leaving house.
• helps prevent erosion along roof line.

how many downspouts do i need?
• gutter capacity is determined by downspout drainage area.
• general rule; one downspout per 20 feet of gutter.
• wide roofs and heavy rainfall areas will require more drainage in some cases.
• two sizes of downspouts are available.
• standard 2"x 3" = 186 gallon per minute.
• commercial size 3" x 4" = 434 gallon per minute.
• commercial size downspout will fit 5" gutters, requiring 3" x 4" outlets and elbows (available where 3" x 4" downspouts are stocked).

the benefits of using gutters far outweigh the initial cost of installing them. in the end the use of gutters may actually end up saving more money than the investment due to the gutters ability to prevent damage that may occur in cases where gutters are not used. when you consider the fact that for most of us our home is the largest investment we will make in our lifetime it really shouldn't be hard to justify the investment. if you are looking for san antonio roofing contracting, you have to find out the service provider with a reasonable price.

tips for choosing a roofing contractor





everyone loves a good horror story.  ask your friends, family and neighbors if they have had roofing work performed on their home and prepare yourself for a list of truly scary stories.  in order to ensure you don’t add your own terrible tales in the future keep a couple of things in mind when choosing a san antonio roofing contractor for your home!
the first and most important thing to consider when looking for a roofing contractor is references.  you wouldn’t expect to be hired for a job without references and neither should your contractor.  ask those same friends, family and neighbors for a referral.  check your local better business bureau for the local contractors with the highest ratings for san antonio roofing contracting.  finally, the best references your contractor can provide you are their previous customers, so ask your contractor if you may contact some of their previous customers and follow through!
another important element in choosing your contractor is responsibility.  does your contractor carry general liability insurance?  insurance is not only for the contractor’s protection, but also your protection should things go awry on the job site.  will the contractor offer you a written estimate and contract you both sign?  it is important to put the specifications of your job on paper; this ensures your contractor remains responsible for fulfilling your contract.  does your contractor offer a warranty?  most responsible and reputable roofing contractors offer a warranty on their work, and this brings us to an important factor many consumers over look.  does your contractor have an office?  in the event you needed to exercise that warranty would you be able to locate your contractor again?  ask if your contractor has an office.  are they set up with a physical address and permanent phone number?
perhaps the most important element in choosing your roofing contractor is your own instincts.  do you feel comfortable with the contractor you’ve chosen?  are they able to explain in layman’s terms the work that needs to be performed on your home and do you trust that they will be able to competently perform the job?  when in doubt always go with your gut and you will no doubt make the right choice in your san antonio roofing contractor.

why radiant barrier?





in san antonio most people don’t use their attic for much more than storing old christmas decorations.  well, what if you could make your attic work for you?  hiring a local san antonio roofing contractor to install a radiant barrier in your attic can finally put that wasted space to good use.
to understand the concept of the radiant barrier you must first understand how radiant heat works.  radiant heat is defined as being a direct source of heat that transfers to the nearest surface.  while every object gives out a certain amount of radiant energy, in texas our greatest source of radiant heat is the sun which beats down on your roof in those hot summer months, which causes your air conditioning system to work overtime and your energy costs to rise.  the purpose of the radiant barrier is to reflect those rays, and heat, back toward the source thereby saving your air conditioning system the additional load and saving you on those energy costs!
the effectiveness of your radiant barrier is greatly dependent on correct installation.  in order to ensure proper installation of your radiant barrier the best course of action is to hire a roofing contractor to perform the installation.  incorrect installation can lead to several factors that can reduce your radiant barriers effectiveness.  if installed incorrectly your radiant barrier can collect dust which can reduce the efficiency up to 50%.  incorrect installation can also lead to moisture buildup between the barrier and existing insulation.  moisture retention will not only be detrimental to the effectiveness of the radiant barrier, but can also promote the growth of mold.
in short, when you are prepared to lower you energy costs and increase the life of your air conditioning system call your local san antonio roofing contractor to schedule an appointment for radiant barrier installation.
