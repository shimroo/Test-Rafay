we are in the shit storm









unless there is a yet unforeseeable, dramatic change here is what is going to happen.



there are only two real issues:  the coming election theft and the climate disaster. everything else is a distraction and any opposition too feeble to be effective.  in the election actual votes will not be counted and trump and republican senate candidates will be declared winners.   this will happen because all important federal law enforcement positions are already, or soon will be, held by trump loyalists.



given our inability to effectively react, it is likely too late to avoid a climate disaster.  food shortages, storms, fires and floods will cause starvation, panic, and epidemics starting with the poorest suffering first and most and then going up the economic ladder, affecting everyone while sparing only the mostly white ultra-rich, including russians and their american vassals. best (and ever shortening) timelines for this make it a reality for our children.



barring political and social miracles, current, dithering opposition to this unfolding horror show is too feeble to prevent it.



have a nice day.

democrat candidates debate





not sure what tapper's agenda is.  he seems always up to some agenda different than the one he is being paid to advance.  of all the cnn legions of anchors, pundits, experts, and analysts to choose from, putting tapper and bash in the spotlight was a sorry choice.

virtual potemkin village





team trump warned russia ahead of the bombing of the syrian airport thus ensuring that no real damage would be inflicted. the bombing had little to do with syria's use of chemical weapons.  i believe the bombing and subsequent break with putin are elements of an elaborate, team trump/putin charade aimed at diverting attention from their continued collusion. it began with the lead-up to the presidential election, the election itself and now the cover up of the earlier conspiracies.  it may be the alleged syrian use of chemical weapons was actually engineered by the russians to provide a foundation for the current cover up phase. unlike trump, the russians are  capable of engineering this entire charade, in all its complexities. 

what we have here is an effective virtual potemkin village designed to fool us all.  all the components of the simple cold war realities are back in place. we can be comforted by a national defense-strong president trump, always ready to demonstrate our power and holding  russia in place.   the reality behind the facade is putin (with a pocket full of blackmail worthy info on trump) pulling trump the puppet's strings.

only big government can save the country; save the planet





on a crowded planet on the edge of climate catastrophe, we no longer have the luxury of small government, low unemployment with a now primitive goal of deregulation and an every man for himself society. no matter how strongly paul ryan wants it that way.  those days and those options are gone forever.

$1,997,000 kill fee for waterbuck.





how's that for priorities and social responsibilities almost $2 million to kill a waterbuck. and, how's that for trickle down economics and how tax breaks for the ultra rich are  so necessary and good for all of us.

america has turned into a comic book with  bizarre villains but much fewer heroes-- the latter all powerless and confused.

this article has several images of our homegrown aristocratic comic book heroes at work, social responsibility nowhere to be found.

foxes in the hen house





imagine what a business advantage it would be if the otherwise less than remarkable trump kids had top security clearance. wonderful tool for destroying those that piss you off and also a fantastic advantage in negotiating deals.





trump son has an elephant by the tail.

if we can afford lots of billionaires we can afford universal, single payer healthcare insurance





a little bit of googling can give you plenty of evidence of how our system compares to europe's and canada's and  does not measure up.  in one comparison (forbes) we come in tenth of ten. canada is very highly rated always.  it is sinful that their targets to balance budgets focus first on medicare, a program that is vital to older, less than rich americans.  a greater sin is their lust after social security money which is our money. we coughed it up, deducted from paycheck after paycheck.  it is  not theirs to screw around with.
paul ryan is so fundamentally stupid that he believes  his simplistic approach has uncovered the holy grail of budget balancing.  you just shut down medicare, lay off all those that administer it and then tap into the oceans of social security money and there you have the solution to all problems. 

they will do anything, absolutely anything to avoid increasing the taxes on the rich, collectively, the golden goose that keeps the whole stinking wad of them flying hither and yon on fact finding missions, golf outings, conferences about yo yos and fiddle de das. 

ryan is a no good s.o.b.  who is shrouded in enormous blind spots that let him seize the podium and blather on about how it all fits together..  take a little piece here, tighten this old guy's belt, and there you have it.  the solution to all budget problems as presented to you  by the mighty kermit the frog in simple quacks and chirps.

paul ryan, dedicated to eliminating medicare





what is it with ryan anyway?  why is he so big on frightening old people.  to be dedicated to eliminating medicare is a pathetic life goal.  but he is determined to eliminate it and force old people with little or no money to purchase heath care coverage on the open market.

what a nasty, close minded little prick he is.  leave medicare alone. don't mess with social security.  find something bigger to do with your life than waging war against, old, poor people.

prick.

cnn = supermarket tabloids





cnn's failure to confront trump's lies and air and examine his business failures and alleged sex crimes while drilling deep into all hints of hillary's misdeeds contributed significantly to trump's victory.  cnn should never again be a trusted news source and, as a source, is now as unreliable and silly as any supermarket tabloid.

also, if you watched anderson on jeopardy, you found out he is not very knowledgeable, but also not very smart.  he must take direction well and does a good job projecting facial expressions of approval or concern.  mostly, though he is apparently an empty suit.
