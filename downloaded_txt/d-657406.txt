go anywhere but hidden coast realty.jeff long1656003902second post: this is the second time i've used hidden coast realty, and nothing has changed (see my first post below).  these guys are knowledgeable on every property in the tamarindo area, they are always the first to know when a property comes on the market, and they know the value of every property in the area. if you’re selling, they’ll get the best offer.  if you’re buying, they’ll get you the best price.  if you’re unfamiliar with the area, they’ll walk you through the buying/selling process and give you excellent advice along the way.  take my advice don’t shortchange yourself by using another realtor.first post: hidden coast realty is the best realty i’ve ever worked with.  i’ve bought and sold many properties and no other realtor has come close.  my realtor was bruno grenier, and this guy was friendly, knowledgeable, and always familiar with the area/property i was interested in.   i can’t say enough good things about them.  do yourself a favor and give these guys a call before you look at any property.  i highly recommend them.dalia g1649852129i have used bruno’s and hidden cost realty services for the purpose of both renting and later buying/purchasing property and i was beyond satisfied both times. i cannot praise bruno enough for everything he has done for me and the high quality service he provides. bruno’s humanity, humility, professional skills bound together with grace, personal attention to detail and kind manner are simply unmatched. bruno was able to bridge the gap between the costa rica tico time and my western desire to tackle things in a timely manner when it comes to the property i can now call my own. he tended to my requests promptly at all hours with his precise and calm demeanour, which i am certainly most thankful for. bruno has a special skill of somehow marrying the pura vida attitude with a dedicated and exacting approach you’d expect from a swiss watch as the saying goes. i’d put my trust in bruno wholeheartedly any day without hesitation, as i know the outcome will be most agreeable. thanks to bruno and hiddencostrealty, i was able to find a place to call home, jump through all the hoops and secure it with just the right person on my side to make the job smooth and satisfactory. i will certainly be a return customer should the need arise again.show quoted textdeep pockets1647886278joost, christian and the entire team at hidden coast realty have done a 5 star job. really they have gone far beyond 5 stars. joost took us to a number of properties. we made an offer on a house that did not go through. joost reassured us that is wasn’t meant to be. which led us to the best find ever. a 2 bedroom 2 bath steps from the beach. we were in the u.s. when our offer was accepted. since we were outside of costa rica we relied heavily on joost and his long term experience in guanacaste. he did not disappoint. we arrived 10 days after closing meeting christian with keys in hand. joost had taken it upon himself to cover the utilities and pool maintenance until we arrived. what a relief to arrive in our new home with power, water, and a clean pool. besides walking us through the purchasing process and numerous financial forms, hidden coast took the time to walk us through how we can pay our utilities, property taxes, home owners insurance, arranged their handyman, reynaldo, to install an outdoor garbage container, and other necessary fixes, acted as translator to the air conditioner service men, and more. this is truly beyond any level of service we have received from any agent in the us. after seeing listings with 5 other agencies in tamarindo, i can tell you do not waste your time. there is only one team you should have working on your behalf, hidden coast realty.lara horgan1643031974you could not ask for a better realtor than bruno grenier.  at every step of the process, bruno went above and beyond our expectations.

market and valuable advice.  after we left costa rica, we placed our trust in him to find the perfect home for us, and he proved that our trust was well placed.  after the sale was complete, bruno continued to be an invaluable help in obtaining all the goods and services we required.  if you’re looking for an enthusiastic, knowledgeable and hard working realtor who you can trust to faithfully

found whilst trying to find a long-term rental in the tamarindo area.  he responded quickly to all of our queries, immediately found us a selection of appropriate houses to view, assisted with getting utilities set up and went out of his way to assist us when some major problems came up out of hours.  we found that he went far above and beyond anything that we would expect from someone helping with lettings and we’ll definitely be talking to both bruno and hidden coast again soon.  coming from the uk it was completely novel to have a real estate agent actually try and help us – rather than work against us.  it was genuinely the first time that we felt we had someone on our side trying to help us get the property we wanted.  we briefly worked with joost at the office when bruno was away over a weekend and found him to be just as helpful.×

knowledgeable on every property in the tamarindo area, they are always the first to know when a property comes on the market, and they know the value of every property in the area. if you’re selling, they’ll get the best offer.  if you’re buying, they’ll get you the best price.  if you’re unfamiliar with the area, they’ll walk you through the buying/selling process and give you excellent advice along the way.  take my advice don’t shortchange yourself by using another realtor.first post: hidden coast realty is the best realty i’ve ever worked with.  i’ve bought and sold many properties and no other realtor has come close.  my realtor was bruno grenier, and this guy was friendly, knowledgeable, and always familiar with the area/property i was interested in.   i can’t say enough good things about them.  do yourself a favor and give these guys a call before you look at any property.  i highly recommend them.dalia g1649852129i have used bruno’s and hidden cost realty services for the purpose of both renting and later buying/purchasing property and i was beyond satisfied both times. i cannot praise bruno enough for everything he has done for me and the high quality service he provides. bruno’s humanity, humility, professional skills bound together with grace, personal attention to detail and kind manner are simply unmatched. bruno was able to bridge the gap between the costa rica tico time and my western desire to tackle things in a timely manner when it comes to the property i can now call my own. he tended to my requests promptly at all hours with his precise and calm demeanour, which i am certainly most thankful for. bruno has a special skill of somehow marrying the pura vida attitude with a dedicated and exacting approach you’d expect from a swiss watch as the saying goes. i’d put my trust in bruno wholeheartedly any day without hesitation, as i know the outcome will be most agreeable. thanks to bruno and hiddencostrealty, i was able to find a place to call home, jump through all the hoops and secure it with just the right person on my side to make the job smooth and satisfactory. i will certainly be a return customer should the need arise

helped me purchase 2 apartments and a luxury home in costa rica. it really helps to have the european professionalism mixed with the years of experience with the pura vida. investing in costa rica

lernout1599840563bruno and joost @ hidden coast realty are a pleasure to work with! if you are ever in need of a short or long term vacation rental or even looking to purchase a new home these are the go to guys in costa rica!!! they have helped me settle in my new home and made the transition super easy! thanks again team!guy powell1598912149bruno at hidden coast was the most helpful agent that we found whilst trying to find a long-term rental in the tamarindo area.  he responded quickly to all of our queries, immediately found us a selection of appropriate houses to view, assisted with getting utilities set up and went out of his way to assist us when some major problems came up out of hours.  we found that he went far above and beyond anything that we would expect from someone helping with lettings and we’ll definitely be talking to both bruno and hidden coast again soon.  coming from the uk it was completely novel to have a real estate agent actually try and help us – rather than work against us.  it was genuinely the first time that we felt we had someone on our side trying to help us get the property we wanted.  we briefly worked with joost at the office when bruno was away over a weekend and found him to be just as helpful.×
