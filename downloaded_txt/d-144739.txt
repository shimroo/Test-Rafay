didn't think i  would write again?...well, i am up to my ears in great cheese, bread and wine here in paris but i was surprised this morning to see "my james" on the cover of metro times...very neat and thank goodness for the internet! travel has been great so far - and i am off to berlin saturday. i am excited to see what the booming art scene is like there!

	 good-bye!
	 
    


moving dayjames stephensi'm not really one for grand good-bye's. even good-bye's at the end of the evening, and am the perfect example of the giver of awkward one-armed hugs...when someone left i always found it much easier to give a painting or gift than sometimes expressing what they meant to me. i have found it difficult to bring an end to this blog (thus the week off). this has been a big part of my life for the past few years and has taken a lot of time and dedication but very much worth the trouble. i feel that i have gotten to know not only the local detroit art scene completely but  the national/international scene as well! well, i leave tomorrow for europe and beyond and will miss this city but can't express how much i look forward to seeing new places! it has been an interesting ride...thanks to everyone who participated and supported the blog!thank youlinda ridgway,                  bronzebe sure to check back in a few months....i will most likely have a link to the new la blog...or end up never coming back and living in a beach hut in thailand (which ps i have learned a beach front hut is under $5 a day!)thanks again!

glad to see someone taking over this space (former ycg)...and i hear it will be up for grabs again in another couple months. i am in packing mode right now and it is hard to comment and feel focused on this art scene when in less than two weeks i will not only be out of this state but out of the country. i am trying to keep up with a few last good posts but excuse me if i start to fade out. this blog has been a wonderful experience and has quickly immersed me in this scene. i have met many wonderful, supportive people here and i hope to stay in touch. i haven't decided if i will be posting from europe or not - a lot depends on internet and timing and also not feeling "at work". ok, back to packing!
