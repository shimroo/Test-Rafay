14 
                different fabric quilt labels

 
                adding a label to your finished quilts is an important way to 
                share the details, for many years to come.
                my fabric quilt labels make that super easy to do!
                these are now available through my spoonflower shop here.

 






                this collection of ideas for backing a quilt is available in a
