lending for historic preservation
as the lending arm of phlf, landmarks community capital corporation (lccc)—a non-profit subsidiary— advances the cause of preservation by extending loans to projects that facilitate renovation activities in historic neighborhoods throughout the pittsburgh region.
among the projects we financed in 2023, was a $350,00 loan to architects, erik and kalina kath, who are creating a multi-use live-and-work space in an 1800s era building that was near demolition when they bought from the community alliance of spring garden-east deutschtown. the couple are creating two residential units and an office space for their architecture practice in the old building.
certified by the united states department of the treasury as a community development financial institution (cdfi), lcc makes sixty percent of its loans in low-to-moderate-income neighborhoods to either for-profit or non-profit developers.
contact senior loan officer, rob wagner (rob@phlf.org or 412-471-5808, ext. 538) for more information or if you wish to discuss your project or to apply for a loan.
