     unit development & revitalizationunit development & revitalization (ud & r) may be a perplexing title for an american legion auxiliary program. however, when we dissect the name, the title of the program becomes self-explanatory. first, we have unit development, the starting of new units. secondly, we have unit revitalization, giving new life to units that are on a decline in membership or experiencing other problems.unit development & revitalization is all about finding new and seasoned members with new ideas that breathe life into our units which leads to growth. unit development & revitalization is more than just organizing new units and trying to help units hold on to charters. unit development & revitalization is also about providing mentors for struggling units, and providing training for new members. unit development & revitalization is about suggesting ways that new members can be given opportunities to be active. unit development & revitalization is about trying new ideas and exploring new ways to get better attendance at unit meetings. unit development & revitalization is not about solving personality conflicts in the units. however, through “conflict resolution” training, unit members learn to solve their own problems. ud&r committee page.
