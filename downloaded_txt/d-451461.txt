welcome to the old watch shop website, which shows some of the quality pre-owned  
  watches we have for sale. the shop was established in 1997 to further the interest in 
	quality mechanical and prestige watches, 
  and went online as "theoldwatchshop.com" in 1998, although we have now been 
  trading on the internet since 1989.  we appreciate the custom of our many valued 
  clients from all over the world, and we look forward to your continued support 
  in the future. 
	


  
we have now closed the doors to our shop, and will continue to trade online through our website.
it will be possible to meet us at the shop premises by prior appointment to buy or sell a watch. 
please contact us by e-mail ( info@theoldwatchshop.com )
to arrange a convenient time to visit.
	



all of the items listed on the old watch shop website are available from stock and we do not 
  believe in selling from catalogues. we feel that this is the fairest way to 
  trade. we stand by any item we sell, and, 
  to coin a phrase: "the buck stops here!"
	



thank you for visiting our website, and we look forward to seeing you again soon...

  full the original purchase price on any watch we sell immediately upon receiving 
  the watch back in the same condition as when sent.

a guide to our terms: "available" - the item is available from our stock; "in stock" - the item is being prepared for sale; "at service / cleaning" - the item is in our workshop being prepared; "reserved" - item reserved and awaiting payment; "deposit received" - the item has been secured with the payment of a deposit; "on hold" - the item has been sold / posted and we are awaiting acceptance by the purchaser; "sold" - item being enjoyed by its new owner. the "red line" sometimes visible on the reverse of our watches is a protective backing to stop watches being scratched whilst being handled!
  



we are now able to provide free shipping and insurance on all watch purchases within the uk.  we will be pleased to advise the cost for insured shipping to overseas destinations.
  



we regret that due to import restrictions by us customs, we cannot send rolex or tudor watches to the u.s.a.
