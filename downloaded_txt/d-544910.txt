the
informed investor began publishing from offices at 13 nottingham
place, london, w1 ( see picture left) in 1972. it started as a printed
publication for drummond & co offering investments and insurance.
long before today's regime in regards commissions drummond & co
pioneered discount  selling of  linked insurance and unit
trusts-
splitting the commissions with the purchaser. many in the industry
condemned this and many leasing insurance groups refused to take their
business. most of those companies have gone out of business today &
drummond & co are recognised as the company that led the way. today
38 years later drummond & co still lead the field in financial
innovations and have advised both the public and professionals.
as financial commentators the informed investor have, over the years,
informed investors about dangerous offers and financial mis-doings
sometimes years before the scandals broke.
this we continue to do through our many websites. in 2009 over 79
million visits were made to our pages and over75 million in
2010. 213 million in total

congratulations
nick & david- and to our two helpers david laws & oliver letwin

a) now let's be
one britain striving together. curb the illegal actions of hmrc
b) stop services
between british companies & our citizens being run through foreign
call centres. firstly the data protection act has no validitity in many
countries and those jobs should be done by british workers in
britain.companies who use non-european call centres should not be able
to claim those costs as a trading expense.
c) ensure once more that highly qualified british workers are not
driven out of the country by punitive measures.
d) give back the tax relief that pensioners had contracted for on pre
1997 pension schemes.
