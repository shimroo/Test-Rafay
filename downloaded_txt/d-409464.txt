the d’souza family
st. charles has offered us a strong partnership in preparing our boys for life, through their focus on education, the catholic faith and development of well-rounded young men. the friendships that the boys developed - the "brotherhood" cannot be emphasized enough. we were pleasantly surprised at how many alumni stay in touch and get involved with the school, years after graduating.




the rivera family
“we have been so blessed that all five of our sons have been here! i think that st charles chose us, as when the boys were very young, we were asked if they were going to go to st. charles? they have not only been given an outstanding education, but given an enormous opportunity to learn and live out what it really means to be their “ brother’s keeper” in the world.”




the rice family
our boys were set on st.charles for awhile, but as parents we had reservations. as we continue to witness the incredible commitment of the faculty and staff to the growth of their students, we are certain that here our boys are seen, known, and supported.




the huffman family
the diversity of the student body brings boys from all over central ohio. not only do boys come from many schools but also many interests, cultures, and life experiences. the large mix of backgrounds and personalities surprisingly blend, making for a unique student body.  the bigger surprise is how the boys support each other. no one is an outcast. everyone is a brother.




the koesters family
st. charles is a welcoming community focused on respect, knowledge and growth.  my son has had a wonderful experience both with teachers and fellow students transitioning from a public school.  the decision to change to a faith based education is one we are thankful we have made and had no hesitation to send our younger sons to as well.
