tintagel, situated in the centre of a rugged and 
romantic coastline, is the mecca of every 
traveller who wanders into the west. the 
legendary connection with the life of the mystic 
king arthur, is undoubtedly one of the reasons 
for the attraction the village exerts. yet the 
group of old and modern houses on the bare 
upland half a mile inland, the isolated church, 
and the gigantic headlands with their majestic 
cliffs falling steeply to the never-ending roar of 
the atlantic breakers, hold in themselves the 
mysterious charm of cornwall, old and new. its 
bleakness and its humanity, its openness and 
it's ancient scenery. the castle ruins which 
tradition has associated with king arthur and 
his knights, awaken the enthusiasm of 
sightseers from the world over, but what binds 
them to tintagel is the spirit of cornwall which 
the place expresses. and if they are very 
modern and not open to that spirit there is so 
much for them to love.
 
words taken from the 1950âs official souvenir 
guide  'tintagel and boscastle. north cornwall' 
by the late ronald youlton, an excellent 
photographer and a good friend of mine.



tintagel is situated on the north coast of cornwall and is renowned for its association with the legend of king arthur and his knights of the 
round table. the magic of the association is captured particularly by the castle, king arthur's castle, which is reached by steps leading from 
the main land. originally the castle was attached to the main land but by erosion over the years a bridge had to be built. it is a hard climb to 
the top but well worth it. the castle is maintained by english heritage. there are many beaches in the area, for surfers trebarwith and 
bossiney are the main attractions, but the castle beach is renowned as a very safe bathing beach. for the visitor to tintagel there are many 
attractions to see in the village apart from the cliffs area. nearby are the lovely villages of boscastle and delabole, the town of camelford 
and the pretty fishing village of port isaac.
