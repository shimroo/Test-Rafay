parasite zapper/
        colloidal silver generator 







           one "dual purpose" electronic device enables experiments 
        on animals involving parasites, bacteria, and viruses, including aids, anthrax, bubonic 
        plague, cancers, e-bola, fungi,
        hiv, small pox, typhoid fever, etc., and many other diseases. also, colloidal 
        silver can be made in high or low concentations for alternative experiments.
           the veterinary zapper/colloidal silver generator can be used 
        in the field with external power options, including a small solar module.
           no published data on animal fetal safety or animals fitted with 
        low power electric
        or electronic devices is available; therefore, parasite elimination experiments on
        pregnant animals or animals fitted with devices such as pacemakers should not be done in
        the zapper mode.
           colloidal silver has been used by humans to fight about 679 known pathogens
        and parasite conditions since pre-1938 with no toxicity and without any reported cases of
        agryria with silver that remains in colloidal suspension.   notwithstanding the above,
        this device is for experiments with experimental animals.
