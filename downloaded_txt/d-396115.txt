                      this 
                      site is dedicated to the uconn basketball legends that have played 
                      at 
                      uconn through the years. for those of you who have been wondering what has 
                      become of them, this is the place to find out. 
                      they will tell us when 
                        they started playing basketball and how basketball became a part of their 
                        lives growing up. we find out how they decided to come to uconn and what 
                        it was like playing uconn basketball. we’ll find out what life was 
                        like after uconn, what career paths they took and what they are doing now. 
                        they have also provided us with some up-to-date pictures.
the players give us 
                        their thoughts on the current uconn basketball team and how far they think 
                      the team will go in the  national collegiate athletic association tournament this year.





 





                  if you are a uconn basketball 
                legend and haven’t been contacted yet to be a part of this 
                website, please  contact us so you can 
                be included.                  

 if you know where we can find a uconn basketball 
                legend that is not listed, please contact us and 
                provide the contact information for us and hopefully they will 
                soon be on the website.
