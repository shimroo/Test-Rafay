 the conference of western wayne (cww) is an organization of 18 western wayne county communities that coordinates 9-1-1 services for its 730,000 residents and a 340 square mile region. cww also represents its 730,000 residents by meeting monthly to discuss issues such as legislation, transportation, public safety, substance abuse prevention, community and economic development, employment and the environmental health of the region.
the cww board of directors is…

made up of the chief elected officials from each of the 18 member communities. this bi-partisan board works collectively to discuss mutual issues, share information and generally improve the quality of life for the  730,000 residents who live in the area.
the cww communities are the cities of belleville, dearborn, dearborn heights, garden city, inkster, livonia, northville, plymouth, romulus, wayne and westland, and the townships of canton, huron, northville, plymouth, redford, sumpter and van buren.

the cww area is…

340 square miles, bordered by washtenaw county to the west, oakland county to the north, the city of detroit to the east, and monroe county to the south.

the conference is the access point for funneling information to local units from county, state and federal agencies. in this capacity, the cww will monitor state and federal legislation for its impact on local government. in addition, the cww works as a liaison between local government and many service organizations by representing its members on various committees and boards.
the conference serves as a collective program planner and developmental entity and provides a forum for the discussion and review of issues.
despite the diversity of size, economic development and population density, these communities have been working together – working regionally – to enhance this area of wayne county for 40 years.
