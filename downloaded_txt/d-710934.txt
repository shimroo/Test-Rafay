why us? 



ncbaa was created by nc bondmen to be a “non-profit association.” as such, all monies, received by ncbaa through membership and continuing education and pre-licensing classes, continue to be used for nc bondsmen long after those classes are over in getting laws passed to help nc bondsmen make and save more money.(no other provider can say this because they take your money as “profit” only.)

the most respected instructors of any provider 



invest in your future by utilizing ncbaa for your bail bonding educational needs. 



where would you rather see your money go? into the deep pockets of a for-profit group who doesn’t put your money back into supporting bail agents or into an association of your peers which will support and protect you and your profession? ncbaa puts its money back into your business and future. 



ncbaa - simply the best - teaching longer than any other provider 



there really is a difference! your success is our priority! 

















i just wanted to take a moment to say how impressed and appreciative of the ncbaa i am. i turned 20 last august and for a while i have wanted to be a north carolina bail agent, so i did some research and signed up for the class in late october. i was not aware that you have to take the class 6 months or less before you begin the licensing process, so i thought i had wasted my time, and money. doug cozart and melissa seiler both helped me out immensely by allowing me to come at a later date with no extra charge to retake the test, and whole class, if i wished. doug personally took time out of his day to spend about an hour with me after class had ended to give me advice, share some resources, and some very meaningful encouragement to help me reach my dream of being a bondsman, and my own boss. also, i would like to add that i was very impressed with how, during the class, doug articulated to all of us the movements and changes in legislation that the ncbaa and everyone involved have made to help improve and preserve the the flourishment of north carolina bail agents. there is absolutely no other organization i recommend using to both take your class, and get further education on being a bail agent in north carolina.

how very! very! important the ncbaa is to every bail bondsman and all they do for us.

i came to this agency (ncbaa) so that my money would be put back to helping bondsman.

i really enjoyed the class and it has helped me to better understand the business, which in return will help me with my daily duties here in the office. mr. cozart did a fantastic job with instruction while keeping it interesting.
