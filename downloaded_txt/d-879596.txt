wonderful to work with, very creative, but at the same time practical and very knowledgeable!










trillium came up with a beautiful and unique solution to our renovation needs and found the staff to be incredibly responsive and helpful.  we have recommended them to many people without hesitation.














"...we have a 'phase two' coming up, and instead of dreading it i look forward to the project because i get to keep working with elizabeth and her trillium team..."- stamford, organic waterfront renovation














the process has been a very pleasant and fun experience. elizabeth and her team are creative and practical, but have also been very receptive to suggestions from us. 










 

 

designing bespoke homes in connecticut and new yorkleaders in cutting-edge sustainabilitytrillium architects has been actively designing sustainable, energy efficient, custom homes since 2004. now a leader in the industry, we’re a boutique firm of a dozen architects producing cutting edge, bespoke residences throughout fairfield, litchfield, and westchester counties. 

  

there are three reasons to become a trillium client: you want a house that performs like a luxury ev. did you know that you can live in an all-electric house that costs $18 per month to heat, cool and operate? trillium’s homes – whether they are 2,000 sf or 10,000 sf- are built to meet this goal. we utilize tried and true building methods alongside the latest tech and materials to produce the most reliable, top of the line homes available. you want a house that is safe for your family. there are so many toxins and allergens in our world these days. from building materials to indoor air and water quality, trillium’s homes are designed to be healthy and free of red list items, and consistently provide fresh clean air. knowing that your house is healthy and clean allows you to breathe easy knowing that your home is actually the safest place you can spend your time and that your family will be well for years to come. you want to help combat climate change. many of our clients care deeply about the environment. sustainable building materials and methods produce houses that have very small carbon footprints. with each home we strive to make our building foot prints smaller and smaller. whether that is by reducing the energy loads, providing alternative fuel supplies to achieve net zero, by using benign or carbon positive plant based insulations, or by collecting water for irrigation, we are reaching ever more rigorously toward ensuring each house ‘leave no trace’. imagine if every home were a trillium home! sophisticated to the eye, thoughtful to the user and meticulously detailed, trillium architects homes are sustainable luxury defined. as expert guides and facilitators, allow us to usher you through your dream green home build.  

 










a home that is good for you and good for the environment












 we believe in healthy, efficient homes.we have done our homework on the effects our lives have on the environment and the effects our environment has on us. the homes we live in have great capacity to impact our health as well as the environment. our homes need to provide us with a safe comfortable living experience, but also they need to not contaminate us with toxins or allergens. we design houses using all natural, no-voc, non-toxic materials, and we assemble them in ways that will not cause mold, mildew, or other detrimmental effects to indoor air quality.




    learn more about our philosophy
  



we believe in getting back to nature.the connection that we have with the land our house sits on can enhance our experience of our immediate environment and of nature at large. deeper connection to nature and our immediate environment can lead to a deeper understanding of our impact upon the world around us, as well as a deeper knowledge of our house and how it works as shelter. the more that our house is in harmony with its environment, and the more we actively participate in the operation of our house as shelter, the longer the house will last.




    meet the team
  












where we work
