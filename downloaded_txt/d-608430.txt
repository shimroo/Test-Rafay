the bolack museum of fish and wildlife was built by and dedicated to tom bolack by the bolack family. it is one of the largest private collections of it's type in the world today with over 2,500 specimens. the collection from five continents gives visitors a change to view animas in their natural setting and to appreciate the beauty in nature's animal kingdom.
