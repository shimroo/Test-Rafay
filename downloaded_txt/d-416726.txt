 austin’s american grill is simply extraordinary
austin’s american grill is the quintessential taste of colorado. with three great northern colorado locations—one in the heart of old town fort collins, another on harmony road in fort collins and one in downtown greeley, we’ll have you wondering why mom’s food never tasted so good and when you can come back for more. savory roasts and chicken cooked over an open flame in our front-of-the-house rotisserie. all-natural buffalo seasoned to perfection. cornbread baked in iron skillets with honey butter. signature cocktails sweetened with fresh-squeezed fruit juice. plus, our decadent desserts are made fresh daily, giving you an excuse to stop in for a slice that reminds you of home. there’s a reason austin’s is one of northern colorado’s favorite destinations.
