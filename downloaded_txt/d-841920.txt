cwi
a force for a stronger economy
employment opportunity for adults 50+
for over six decades, we have led the way in workforce development, crafting innovative job training and placement programs to meet employers’ business needs and unleash the potential of our nation’s 60 million older american workers.










employment opportunity for adults 50+
unleashing the potential of older americans
our nation’s labor force is increasingly dependent on the 60 million older workers in our nation. by 2028 workers aged 55 or older will represent more than 25% of our labor force. but only 4% of firms have committed to programs that help integrate older workers into their talent pool.
recruiting and training older workers is critical to the success of employers, job seekers, and communities. with 60 years of experience, we are leading the way. since our founding, we have trained nearly 500,000 clients with in-demand skills to secure employment with more than 5,000 employers in industries that range from financial services, hospitality, and office administration to social services, health care, transportation, and manufacturing.

skills that matter

          digital certification program (dcp)
        

a cornerstone of our current work is addressing the technology skill needs of older americans. the digital certification program (dcp) is a data-driven solution that equips unemployed older americans with the tools they need to thrive in the modern world of work: in-demand skills and a means to showcase those skills to american businesses.
