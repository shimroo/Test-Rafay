2018: the peter gurney light that went around the world

for those not familiar with peter gurney, or this annual event, peter
            gurney was an author and guinea pig advocate in
            england who died of cancer  in 2006.  he wrote many of the books on guinea pigs that we all
            use, and his website is still a vital source of information to all
            guinea pig lovers.  in 2006 we held our first candle-light memorial in
            his honor, and to remember all of the guinea pigs and pets who are with
            him at the rainbow bridge.

here are some photos of this year's participants:

the peter gurney 2010 light that went around the world
the annual peter gurney candle-light memorial, held on march 9th, 2010. it was the best participation we have had in the 5 years of doing this - with 84 participants! 
peter gurney memorial candle lighting on march 9th 2010
we will be remembering peter gurney, and other gpdders, including alge, debbie, kirsten, and joseph petrillo.
you are invited to participate in our fifth annual "light for peter  gurney" candle lighting memorial on tuesday, march 9th, 2010, at 8:00  pm.  as i promised to be the official "reminder person" for this event,  i'll keep sending out reminders until march 9th.

      this is a "real" event, as everyone is invited to light a real candle  at or around 8:00 pm, in your respective time zone, in rememberance of  our beloved alge, debbie, kirstin, joseph petrillo, peter gurney,  and all of the guinea pigs who are now with them, at the rainbow  bridge.  peter gurney was a tireless advocate for guinea pigs, who  passed away from cancer july 1, 2006, in great britain.  he wrote many  of the books that we use, and he was probably the best guinea pig  authority and advocate in the world.

      march 9th was his birthday, and many of us who read the gpdd decided  that it would be a fitting day to remember and honor him.  we have now  expanded this memorial to include and honor our dear gpdd friends who  are with him at the rainbow bridge.  basically, all you need to do is  light a candle on march 9th, in the evening, and the light will move  around the world.

      the memorial is also for all of the piggies who have passed away and  are now with peter gurney.  we know that he and our gpdders with him  are looking after all of them.

      this will be our fifth memorial candle-lighting, and at the end i will  ask you where you lit your candle, and post a listing of all the places  where the light went. so, mark your calendars for march 9th at 8:00 pm!

      also, if anyone has ideas on how to expand our world-wide coverage of  this event (guinea pig forums in other countries), please let me know  if you can help.  the more, the better!

      we will be lighting our candle on march 9th.

march 9, 2008: special candlelight ceremony in memory of peter gurney: 
  invitation to light a candle in honor of peter gurney  sunday, march 9, at 8:00 pm. march 9 would have been peter's 70th birthday. 
peter crossed on july 1, 2006 (see articles below, and tribute on this website). he has been gone almost two years, and is still greatly missed.
lighting a candle is easy, and something we can each do to honor peter's memory. he was a tireless advocate of guinea pigs, and left the world with guinea pig knowledge that we would have never had without him. his books and knowledge (not always conventional) has helped everyone here.

  we can share the moment with or without our piggies, and light a candle on march 9 at, or around 8:00 pm, in your particular time zone. mr. gurney will have a light in his honor that will move around the world. i hope you all like the image of that - it really is something special for someone who has done so much for guinea pigs.

"last of their kind " - peter's final book 

after his passing, peter's family saw to the completion of peter's final book, "last of their kind". it is a truly beautiful book, full of amazing pictures of piggies. 
from the winking cavy store description:


"in the months before he died, peter gurney was working on this book. he never tired of writing about and photographing his favourite animals and in this book we are given an insight to ‘life with peter’, as seen from the guinea pigs’ viewpoint. it includes more than 70 full colour photographs and some poems peter wrote about his guinea pig friends."


the book can be ordered from the winking cavy store
 
"someone for everyone" - a new guinea pig storybook  

our friends at willow lodge tales in australia have published a new guinea pig book, just in time for christmas and the holiday season. titled "someone for everyone", it uses digital photography to tell the story of three sister piggies, cinnamon, nutmeg and sugar. although the authors call it a childrens' story book, it's really for everyone, young and old.
 
the book sells for $19.95, which includes shipping anywhere in the world (and some free gifts as well!)  note - delivery for christmas is guaranteed if you order by december 7!

the                  guinea pigs' rainbow                  bridge now has its own site.
the guinea pigs' rainbow bridge pages have been part                  of the gpdd site for about a year now. but we felt there should                  be a site dedicated to the memories of our departed companions.                  
                     the guinea pigs' rainbow                  bridge has a new design and is now located at its own place                  on the web.
