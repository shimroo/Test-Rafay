karen hofferbertexas“thank you to jeffrey, age 10, for sending us his school report on our “time for school” video. read jeffrey’s report.”
jeffreystudent with autism“the lesson plans are wonderful. my students are learning without even knowing it! i would recommend this as a valuable tool for anyone working with students with autism.”
candice clarkspecial education teacher“i know my students will be able to relate to these lessons more because students their age are teaching them, not adults. the format is great–simple, colorful and creative, but not too distracting. i can tell that someone who understands the unique social needs of autism created these lessons.”
