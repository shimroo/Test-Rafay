leader of the pride ... bc lions introduce new ownership as amar doman brings industrial experience to franchise





 from a lumber baron, provincial industrialist and british columbia philanthropist;  to the latest cfl owner of a storied british columbia franchise.  that's the path that brought amar doman to the surrey practice facility today, a wednesday morning press conference called to announce the transfer of the franchise to the doman collection of enterprises from that of the estate of david braley.mr. braley who passed away in 2020, had long been the financial white knight for the lions franchise a long time and devoted member of the cfl infrastructure since 1987. owner of three franchises during his tenure and serving as an interim commissioner at one point, braley was the glue that kept the league solvent in some of its most dire days.  in the case of the lions, he took over a team in 1997 that had struggled to find local ownership and was suffering a malaise in the sports market which had embraced soccer's whitecaps and as always stayed true to the nhl's canucks.still, braley to his credit never wavered in his commitment to the lions and the community and that's a debt that was never paid back by the football fans of the province.with his passing, the search to bring the ownership base back to british columbia accelerated and today, the new face from the ownership box was introduced. the day one which was steeped with hopes that with a new generation of british columbians at the helm, the team will once again become the focus for the province's sports fans that marked much of its time in the provincial spotlight in decades past. “the lions are part of the fabric of this great province. i’m honoured to take on this role because of  our team’s history. but i’m motivated, most of all, by the future i see ahead for this franchise. i am extremely excited to get started.”the new owner will get to take in his first home game on thursday when the lions welcome the edmonton elks, the night at bc place the first time that a lions team has played at home in over 650 days, with high anticipation for the first large scale event in the province since covid arrived and delivered a lost season.today mr. doman was saying all the right things that a football fan would want to hear, a commitment to an iconic sports team and league, setting a change for the future that brings a sense of optimism through some challenging times.commissioner ambrosie spoke of the uncertainty that not only the lions but the cfl faced in the last two years, and how today's announcement offers a sense of certainty for the bc franchise and the league, something that will be built on the foundation put in place by the former owner who was in the thoughts of many on the day. “the support and patience shown by david’s estate, led by grant, the hard work of lions’ president rick lelacheur and the lions’ staff, and the dedication of the players, coaches and the entire football operation, especially as we all navigated the challenges presented by the pandemic, are all a testament to david’s legacy and his vision for the future.now, the future has arrived in the person of amar doman. we look forward to working with him to move this great franchise forward and to help us build the canadian football league of the future.”still, the new owner will bring a businessman's view of the team's future, taking a blue print from the range of corporate interests that he is involved with and shifting elements towards the football team operations. in the end however, it is a business decision and part of the deal now is on the fans to return to bc place stadium in numbers that make doman's investment one that brings a return that benefits both him and the fans and a sport that still remains part of the canadian fabric.the prospects look good, but as is always the case, time will tell how it all works out.more on today's announcement is available here.some further background on the new leos owner can be reviewed here.

frantic finishes chart the path of week one action in cfl return





 the cfl is back, and if you needed a quick refresher on what makes the cfl a full sixty minute experience, three of the four first week games provided more than enough action to keep those watching on tsn fixed to their couches and easy chairs.after a lost season owing to covid, the first game since november 24th of 2019, kicked off the return weekend with a grey cup rematch between the blue bombers and tiger cats, with the blue and gold showing little rust as they sent the tabbies on their way with a first loss of the season.the season opener, result one that really wasn't in much peril as the bombers made the most of their opportunities with little push back from hamilton making for a thirteen point bulge on the scoreboard for the home side, the bombers taking their first victory for 2021 by a score of 19-6.the rest of the weekend however, offered up some close contests, though for the most part that came out of two games in one, with the home side taking charge in the first half, then looking to hold off a strong push from the visitors, once successful, twice not.friday gave us the lions and riders, with saskatchewan fans once again showcasing why a trip into regina makes for a challenging experience. with starter mike reilly sidelined at the start, the riders cruised to a 32-9 half time lead that seemed insurmountable, though the leos canadian understudy nathan rourke showed some flashes of what could come as the league looks for a marquee canadian qb to chart the future.reilly was inserted into the game at half time, and while clearly featuring little range to his arm, he fashioned a comeback making good use of his receivers on short patterns, the leos pushing the riders hard in the final half coming up just short of a remarkable comeback, falling to saskatchewan by a score of 33-29.the first of the saturday double headers, saw the double blue from toronto show a fourth quarter surge to take their first two points of the year, that after a pretty tightly contested first half that saw the stamps head to half time with a two point lead. the second half however saw the stamps start to falter, the argos making the most of their opportunities with eleven points in the final frame to claim the 23 to 20 victory.the game a bit of work out for two of the cfl's top qb's in mcleod bethel-thopmson and bo levi mitchell, who both had strong efforts in their cfl return.the redblacks/elks (careful folks old habits are hard to break) wrap to the weekend provided a defensive battle for the most part, the field goal teams playing a large role, a pick six in the final quarter making for the most exciting play of the day, securing the redblacks victory. though not after a late game surge by edmonton that almost took the victory, coming up just one yard short as the clock expired, the clock securing the 16 -12 victory for ottawa.while at times sloppy as would be expected with little in the way of exhibition games to work out the timing, the games still provided for their own cadence and after a year away from canadian ball, we'll take the opening week and go along with the learning  curve in the weeks to come.things for the most part couldn't have gone much better, the finishes for the most part providing for the excitement that often marks a november playoff matchup, heralding more of the same as we travel through the upcoming months and our rendezvous at grey cup in december. there will still be some twists and turns before we reach what should be a much anticipated and iconic canadian moment, covid may still rise up and take a swipe at all the planning, the cflpa has also served some notice that they're not really on board with the cfl's latest covid planning on game day play should the virus wreak a bit more havoc.those however are housekeeping issues, that will sort themselves out, for most of us it's just fun to have three down football back and on we go to week two, which starts on thursday when the lions continue on with their prairie experience, taking on the stamps at mcmahon.til they tee it up in four days, we'll keep an eye on how the reviews come in for week one.

cfl 2021 ... welcome back old friend





after a far too long sabbatical, canadians had a chance to catch up with an old friend this weekend, with the return of canadian football to four fields as the 2021 season kicked off an unusual year, but one welcomed into the homes of football fans across the nation.having put this blog into hibernation for a lengthy period of time, we've caught some cfl fever and are just glad that the league survived the last year that we felt it time to give this venture a reboot and share some enthusiasm for our unique canadian tradition.as we move forward into this start of the season, we'll rebuild some of our archive pages and introduce new features, as we look to revise our work and celebrate the game that has shaped many of our memories over the years.there are so many things to catch up on, and so many new faces to take note of that it will take some time time to get up to speed, but we're hopeful of building the blog back to hosting some original material to track this season all the way through the sweltering summer to the frigid days of mid december that bring us the grey cup, the 108th edition to take place in hamilton.there's something about having been denied something for a lengthy period of time, to give one cause to remember how much you enjoyed it. with a year lost to reflect on the key moments of the past and the impact that the cfl has had on this nation for over a century.the league which at times is venture that at times seems on thin ice, but one that remains a social compact for many of its communities and reminder of the importance it has held through the decades. having come through the last year of uncertainty, it remains a symbol of normalcy for a nation that is looking for the familiar themes of the past.as joni mitchell might put it ... don't it always seem to go that you don't know what you've got till it's gonehopes remain high at least for this author, that we'll never have to know ... bring on a season of thrills, canadians are more than ready to follow along!

bowling for prospects  -- us bowl season keeps cfl scouts hopping










while fans of the cfl settle in for the long winter, counting down the days until the first of the training camps and then the launch of the 2017 season, cfl gm's, coaches and scouts have been facing a hectic few weeks as the us college bowl season gets underway.

with the christmas and new year's period now a long running festival of football, the traditional bowl games of the past have at times tended to get lost in the shuffle and more importantly the growing list of bowl games makes for a lengthy list of potential prospects for cfl teams to explore.

is this thing working ... is this thing on?








having stumbled across the soundtrack above to relaunch our efforts to track the cfl, we offer up some cautious optimism that as we dust off our blue print and turn our attention back to our favourite league of pigskin, we can hold to a regular schedule of updates for the 2017 cfl season.

and while we'll admit that owing to any number of reasons, some of our past attempts ended up sidelined by the labour day break, we look to building a site that will maintain itself to a fashion on those days where our blogging plans go astray.

hope as they say springs eternal, and the reality is that only time will tell if our ambition can put some pace into our delivery ... but considering we still have folks checking our archives on a daily basis, there still appears to be some interest in how we chronicled our observations of the past on the cfl.

we launch the site this first week of a brand new year,  and with it being the season of resolutions, we'll put one aside to seek to make a steady diet of cfl information a part of our blue print for 2017.

over the holiday period we've been tossing around a few ideas on how best to relaunch our blog and as they come on stream, we think that they'll make for a helpful guide to the off season work in the cfl and provide some enthusiasm for the 2017 campaign.

with the us bowl season in the final stages of the us season, we are putting the finishing touches on a recap of the results of the last two weeks and any notes related to the cfl that may come out of the month long festival of football in the usa.

we also have noticed a surge of video offerings on canadian university players over the last few months, so one of our plans is an archive of sorts of some of those contributions with an eye on the cfl college draft for 2017.

as well, our early plans include the creation of dedicated pages for each cfl team with links to media items and other sources of information in the lead up to the 2017 season. you can wander through some of those past segments from our right hand column area to get an indication as to where we hope to take the blog as we get back into the swing of it all.

with a range of other blog properties to maintain, we don't guarantee a daily contribution to the themes of the cfl, though as we get closer to kick off we do anticipate that our pace will pick up and the blog will begin to expand on some of its offerings heading to the start of the year.

one thing that won't change will be the volume of work that will make use of our right hand column features where we will once again keep the file pages updated on a regular basis, while looking for new items to add to that roll call of cfl information.

we invite you to check back from time to time to see how it's all coming together.

redblacks and eskimos ready to bring curtain down on 2015 cfl season







the hoopla, awards and grey cup week commitments now behind them, sunday brings the focus back to the field at the 103rd edition of the nation's november celebration of the canadian game.

the ottawa redblacks the storyline of the season looking to write that final chapter in a story that was one of the more positive of themes for a cfl season that offered a few concerns for those that have a strong attachment to the three down game.

issues of attendance for some cities has provided for the customary bit of reflection as to the state of the nine team league, a dip in television ratings as well noted by more than a few, though some terrible play by the teams most mentioned perhaps had something to do with the slippage in both areas.

an epidemic of quarterback injuries left teams scrambling from week to week to revisit offensive plans to fit replacement pivots, a situation which gave those following at the need to research pretty well every week, sometimes looking up to their screens to proclaim ... who the heck is that?

one of the main stories was the fact that the residents of the nations largest market for the most part were left unaware to their own team this year, owing to any number of reasons that left the toronto argonauts to be cfl bedouins, wandering from city to city seeking a few fans and a little respect.

they are issues that will be examined we imagine as part of the season review, but should  make for a task that can wait for 24 hours. 

today is grey cup sunday, there is but one question to ask on this day, can the redblacks make a remarkable run through november last one more game, or will the edmonton eskimos a team with their own pretty impressive back story this year return a championship title to northern alberta.

you go back a few decades in the cfl history books and the concept of an ottawa - edmonton championship game would be an expected match up, the two cities fixtures in championship games that remain vivid for fans who can rattle off the participants on the field from memory, heart breaking moments still to be mourned, levels of excitement and success for others to be relived.

this final sunday of november, will bring new additions to those reports, tales of exploits yet to be written at grey cup 103.



there are of course the sub plots, the return of ottawa to the championship in only its second season of rebirth and the timeless nature of henry burris who has taken this squad and brought them along for a most fascinating ride. a coach in rick campbell with famous cfl bloodlines about to face the team that his father made a perennial champion. and the work ethic of the redblacks defensive unit, a group that brings back memories for the long starved fans of the days of the capital punishment units of the seventies and eighties. a time when a trip to ottawa meant a win wasn't guaranteed and a toll would be claimed from the turf at lansdowne park, the personality of the team and their dedication to task quickly found favour with the fans, who having been burned by owners of the past have been quick to embrace the redblacks, a team that has brought a new attitude and work ethic to town.

the eskimos offer their own stories for today's finale,  a team which has responded so well to head coach chris jones, the turnaround from the dark years of but two seasons ago replaced by a team that has resembled the machines of the glory years. the key feature a defensive unit that shows no weaknesses, holding the opposition in check. a team with depth in many positions, the most important at the quarterback position, with starter mike reilly injured and out until late august, it fell to james franklin to hold the fort, a process which delivered valuable playing time and key game time experience. when a healthy reilly returned by labour day, the energy level for edmonton built with each week,  his performance against the former champs last week an indication that he and his offence are on mission, with only sixty minutes left to see that blue print through for the year.

when you reach the final game of the season you want the two best teams to be the one's standing, both edmonton and ottawa have earned their way into the grey cup the best way, through hard work and a commitment to their work.

no one will argue the point today that the representatives of the east and west don't deserve their place on the field when the anthem is played.

whichever team claims lord grey's cup at the sound of the final gun, one thing will be certain, both teams will have left all they had to offer on winnipeg's near frozen field, neither has travelled this far into the 103rd season to take a day off now.

and the winner is ...







henry burris was a double awardwinner at thursday night'sshaw cfl awards

the cfl recognized excellence from 2015 on thursday evening, handing out the shaw cfl awards at the annual ceremony this year held at the club regent event centre in winnipeg.

the event, which signals the start of the real countdown to grey cup sunday featured 11 different presentations and by the evening's end it became a familiar refrain to hear ... representing the ottawa redblacks  is ....

the remarkable second season for the reborn entry for the nation's capital was recognized frequently at the awards podium on thursday, as redblacks accepted five trophies on the night, with quarterback henry burris making two trips to the stage.

burris, the team leader and most amazing story for 2015 was honoured as the league's most outstanding player, the second time in his career that the has been awarded that trophy, he also received the tom pate memorial award which is awarded to the player who displays qualities that distinguish him from his peers.

the redblacks also were honoured for the work of sirvincent rogers who claimed the most outstanding offensive lineman award and brad sinopli, who provided the redblacks with big play after big play through the season, was recognized as the most outstanding canadian.

rounding out the redblack night was head coach rick campbell, and there surely is no more deserving candidate for the coach of the year award, with campbell having led his team from expansion to grey cup finalists in but two seasons of play.

thursday's awards show may provide a bit more motivation for the edmonton eskimos, the esks only received one award on thursday as receiver derel walker claimed the outstanding rookie award for 2015.

other award winners on the night include the tiger-cats brandon banks, the explosive receiver and kick return specialist for the cats received the most outstanding special teams player award, while the commissioner's award also honoured a player with ties to the cats organization, with berine custis, one of the trail blazers in the fifties was honoured for his contribution to the game. 

the most outstanding defensive player of the year award went to adam bighill, a standout on the bc lions roster this year during a year off challenge for the west coast team.

the jake gadaur veteran's award was presented to the montreal alouettes offensive tackle jeff perrett, who used his own story of struggles with alcoholism, to raise awareness across canada on the impact that addiction can have on families and to stress that help is available.

and bob iriving, the longtime cfl broadcaster in winnipeg and walking encyclopedia of canadian football history, was recognized for his contribution to the game. irving was awarded the hugh campbell distinguished leadership award.
