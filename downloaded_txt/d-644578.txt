voices of lightmusic and film combine for an unforgettable event



voices of light is a stunning evening of music theatre. the critically-acclaimed event has brought sold-out houses to their feet at the brooklyn academy of music next wave festival; at avery fisher hall in lincoln center; at the kennedy center and wolf trap with the national symphony; and in dozens of major concert halls across the country. it has been featured on cbs sunday morning; on npr's performance today and all things considered; and in numerous national publications, including the new york times and the wall street journal.voices of light merges the legendary silent film masterpiece the passion of joan of arc with a live performance of a beautiful new work by composer richard einhorn. an incredibly moving and popular composition for solo voices, chorus and orchestra, voices of light has been hailed as "a triumph" (los angeles times) and "an overwhelming experience" (chicago tribune).the film is considered by critics to be simply one of the 10 greatest films ever made. thought to have been destroyed in warehouse fires, a perfect copy was discovered recently and lovingly restored. with its raw emotional power, its naturalistic acting and an utterly contemporary visual style, the passion of joan of arc looks like it was made only yesterday. it is a haunting, extraordinary film.the music - praised as "lush," "brilliantly effective" and "moving" by the new york times, washington post and chicago sun times - has attracted a huge audience on its own. the sony classical cd of voices of light, featuring the famous medieval vocal ensemble anonymous 4, is an international bestseller and has spent over 7 weeks on the billboard charts.with over 100 performances to date, voices of light has a proven popular appeal and a special ability to deeply touch the hearts of its audiences.for booking information, contact:
