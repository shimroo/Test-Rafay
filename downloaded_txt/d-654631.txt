the kennamer page











 

 
welcome to www.kennamer.com!
this page contains information and links to genealogical materials on the kennamer 
family.  there are several common spelling variations of the family name, including 
kennemer, kennamer, kennemur, kennimer, kenemore, kennemore, kenimer and others. 
we believe that all of these people in the united states can trace their ancestry 
to one man, stephen kennemar, who came to the u.s.  with his son, jacob, in 
1732.
kennamer reunion
the annual kennamer reunion is held in
kennamer cove at the
kennamer family pavilion on land near the original 
hans kennamer farm. the reunion is ordinarily held on the first saturday in august, but the 2020 reunion has been cancelled due to the pandemic. the reunion normally begins in 
late morning, around 10:30, 
with a business meeting followed by a picnic-style lunch and an 
afternoon of visiting.
everyone is welcome. if you would like to 
attend, please bring food, water or soft drinks for the luncheon. additionally, 
while seating is available, many families prefer to bring their own folding chairs 
to sit in. the association will provide trash bags and portable restrooms.
due to the increasing cost of mailing and the time required to update the 
mailing list, a written reminder is no longer mailed. 
information on future reunions will be available on this web site. additionally, 
if you will provide cheryl kennamer 
with your email address, she will send an electronic reminder about the reunion 
in mid-july. you may give cheryl your address at the 
reunion, or you may send it to her email 
account.


the family now also has a
facebook 
group. reunion news will be announced there as well as on this web site.
the first kennamer reunion was held on august 15, 1929. the upcoming one will 
be number 91 (90 years, 91 reunions). kennamer cove is near
woodville, between huntsville 
and scottsboro.  click here for directions and maps.
a collection of minutes, newspaper articles and other materials on the reunions 
was assembled in 1976 by ralph kennamer. i've scanned it in, along with additional 
minutes through 2009. the minutes make for fascinating reading and are valuable 
sources for tracking down your relatives.  you can read 
them online or download them in microsoft word format. 
i'll add new minutes as they become available. 

from rodney kennamer, kennamer family association president :
for all the distant relatives planning on making their annual (or initial?) pilgrimage to the cove, we think you will find these websites helpful in making your return to where it all started even more memorable. check these out for additional fun, interesting and historical activities for the weekend.

the kennamer family association maintains the kennamer reunion pavilion and the 
adjoining pisgah cemetery. its address is: 
kennamer family, 133 kennamer circle, woodville, alabama 35776.  
anyone interested in kennamer family history should get a copy of the early 
history and european origin of kennemer (and similar spellings), written by 
harkness kenimer.  it is a 25-page monograph describing the basis for the author's 
conclusion that the kennemer family originated in the palatine area of germany, 
in a small town named oppau. 
he believes that the family descends from stephen kennemar who immigrated to philadelphia 
in 1732. he also concludes that the original family name was probably genheimer. 
by the kind permission of mr. kenimer, you can read it online 
or download it in microsoft word format. wayne kenimer 
has supplemented this material with a short genealogy and 
timeline. about 40 miles 
northwest of oppau is a town named genheim. as far as i know there isn't any documentation 
to back this up, but it is tempting to speculate that the family might have come 
from there to oppau before the 15th century. an occupant of genheim would have been 
called a genheimer.
another possibility for the original name―really 
a variant spelling of genheimer―is
gönnheimer, pronounced 
something like kurnheimer.
