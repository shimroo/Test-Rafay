	 u.s. links smuggled cash to venezuela
	 
    


a miami man who brought $800,000 in a suitcase into argentina was trying to deliver a campaign contribution from the venezuelan government to the argentine presidential candidate cristina fernández de kirchner, american prosecutors said wednesday. assistant united states attorney thomas j. mulvihill said in court wednesday that conversations recorded by the f.b.i. indicate that mrs. kirchner, who won the election and was sworn in on monday here as argentina’s president, was the intended recipient of the money, said alicia valle, special counsel to the u.s. attorney in miami.the united states attorney’s office in miami charged five men with acting and conspiring to act as agents of the venezuelan government within the united states, without having notified the attorney general, in a scheme it said involved the highest levels of president hugo chávez’s government. according to prosecutors, venezuelan agents tried to cover up the purpose of the cash and intimidated a witness in the case.go to full article...

	 venezuela hands narrow defeat to chávez plan
	 
    


voters in this country narrowly defeated a proposed overhaul to the constitution in a contentious referendum over granting president hugo chávez sweeping new powers, the election commission announced early monday.it was the first major electoral defeat in the nine years of his presidency. voters rejected the 69 proposed amendments 51 to 49 percent.the political opposition erupted into celebration, shooting fireworks into the air and honking car horns, when electoral officials announced the results at 1:20 a.m. the nation had remained on edge since polls closed sunday afternoon and the wait for results began.the outcome is a stunning development in a country where mr. chávez and his supporters control nearly all of the levers of power. almost immediately after the results were broadcast on state television, mr. chávez conceded defeat, describing the results as a “photo finish.”“i congratulate my adversaries for this victory,” he said. “for now, we could not do it.”opposition leaders were ecstatic.“tonight, venezuela has won,” said manuel rosales, governor of zulia state and the opposition’s candidate in presidential elections last year.go to full article...

	 venezuela threatens to expel us official
	 
    


venezuela threatened wednesday to expel a u.s. embassy official for allegedly conspiring to defeat a referendum championed by president hugo chavez, accusing the diplomat of plotting to sway public opinion.the allegation comes ahead of a fiercely contested referendum on reforms that would allow chavez indefinite re-election and help him establish a socialist state in venezuela. sunday's vote has generated large pro- and anti-chavez rallies and chavez kept the rhetoric high on wednesday by repeating his charge that washington is plotting to kill him.in caracas, foreign minister nicolas maduro showed state television a document that he claimed was written by the unnamed embassy official and was to have been sent to the cia as part of a plan to help ensure that venezuelans vote against the proposed constitutional overhaul."it's a script from the cia to try to generate a block of opinion among venezuelans that would give a sure victory to the 'no' vote," said maduro. "we will investigate and if it's that way, we'll remove this person from here as a persona non grata."go to full article here.

	 venezuela knows what it's doing
	 
    


in recent weeks, u.s. policymakers and pundits have warned that a set of constitutional reforms being considered in venezuela are but a step toward dictatorship.a little calm, and context, is in order. since president hugo chavez's first election in 1998 and his most recent reelection in 2006, venezuela has undergone a dramatic revolution in peace and democracy. the venezuelan government aggressively works to expand political participation, create an equitable and sustainable economy and address long-standing social deficits.the numbers indicate that the changes are working. the economy has entered its fourth year of consecutive growth, poverty has fallen from 55.1% of the country in 2003 to 30.4% in 2006, and venezuelans are the second-most-likely population in the region to call their government "very democratic." venezuela is slowly establishing the basis for a new model of democracy and development -- "socialism of the 21st century," as it has been termed -- one founded on grass-roots democratic participation, a social economy and equality in access to vital services such as healthcare and education.go to full article here.

	 venezuela chavez: cnn may be instigating my murder
	 
    


venezuelan president hugo chavez said on wednesday cnn may have been instigating his murder when the u.s. tv network showed a photograph of him with a label underneath that read "who killed him?"the caption appeared to be a production mistake -- confusing a chavez news item with one on the death of a football star. the anchor said "take the image down" when he realized.but chavez called for a probe in an interview on state television, where he repeatedly reviewed a tape of the broadcast, questioning why the unconnected photograph and wording were left on screen for several seconds."i want the state prosecutor to look into bringing a suit against cnn for instigating murder in venezuela," he said. "... undoubtedly it is part of the psychological warfare."go to full article here.

	 chávez's 'socialist city' rises
	 
    


like most ambitious state projects in oil-rich venezuela, the new city being built in the thickly wooded mountains here began as a whim of president hugo chávez's.flying in his helicopter north of caracas over forests filled with monkeys and tropical birds, the president suddenly had a eureka moment -- he would carve a self-sustaining, self-contained city from the wilderness. chávez envisioned this as the first of several utopian cities, a bold plan reflecting both venezuela's capacity for undertaking ambitious projects and the president's growing propensity for making all major decisions."he told me, 'i want to see if it's possible,' " recalled ramón carrizales, minister of housing. "so we began to explore it, and we found vast tracts that could be utilized."go to full article here.

venezuela and spain have a common future, the venezuelan ambassador in madrid said monday, downplaying an announcement by president hugo chavez that he was "freezing" bilateral relations until king juan carlos apologizes for telling him to shut up."the two countries have a common future beyond ups and downs," ambassador to spain alfredo toro said after holding a half-hour meeting with the top foreign ministry official for latin america, trinidad jimenez.jimenez said that, "after hearing what president chavez had said," she contacted the ambassador to "ask him if this would affect our bilateral relations."she said toro assured there was no change in the countries' bilateral relations.on nov. 10, juan carlos told chavez to "shut up" during an ibero-american summit in chile after the venezuelan leader called spain's former premier, jose maria aznar, a fascist.go to full article here.

	 polarized politics again in venezuela
	 
    


by: daniel hellingerpresident hugo chávez has called venezuelans to the polls in support of his quest to construct “21st century socialism.”  on december 2 they will vote on two packages of amendments to the 1999 constitution, which already lays out an innovative blueprint for government, mixing principles of representative government with participatory democracy.most of the media has focused on revisions that would expand presidential powers to limit speech and detain individuals during states of emergency and would extend the presidential term from six to seven years, permitting indefinite re-election as well.  mayors and governors would still be subjected to term limits, and critics ask why the national executive should operate under different rules.  although the bar would be raised modestly, venezuelans would still have the right to petition and force a recall election after the midpoint of a presidential term is reached.the emergency provisions are not radically different from those found in many other constitutions and were added by the chavista-controlled national assembly because of the complicity of the media in the short-lived coup of april 2002.   some chavistas worry that the broader emergency powers might be turned against them someday.political violence is rising, with the international media too quickly believing accounts laying blame on government supporters and failing to report attacks on pro-chávez demonstrators.  in this polarized climate the contest once again becomes revolves around chávez and less on the issues.  a large block of voters (roughly 40 percent) identify with neither side, but their votes have usually broken favorably for the president.  more likely enough venezuelans will feel compelled once again to support chávez, but his margin of victory may be narrower than in recent years.  rejection of one or both sets of reforms cannot be ruled out, however, especially since retired general raul baduel, a hero to chavistas for his actions to defeat the coup of april 2002, has spoken out strongly against the reforms, equating them to a coup. the referendum comes at a time when neo-cons and anti-castro figures entrusted with washington’s latin america policy are seizing on venezuela’s economic and diplomatic accords with iran as pretexts for intervention.  these militarists darkly warn of iranian “terrorists” using venezuelan territory for safe haven.  increasingly, they feed a compliant media “analyses” painting chávez as “crazy” or, worse, a bloody tyrant.  as the end of bush’s term nears, we can expect them to ratchet up the propaganda machine against venezuela.provisions ensuring equal representation of women on party ballots, outlawing discrimination, and giving the vote to young people have attracted scant attention in the media compared to coverage of changes to the presidential term, emergency powers, and new articles dealing with forms of property.echoing opposition voices, the international media wrongly presume that the amended constitution threatens private property.  private property in fact is given equal status to forms of state or collective ownership of the national oil company, cooperatives, micro-enterprises, co-managed or worker managed firms, etc. the most ambitious parts of the reform are those attempting to redesign the “geometry of the state.”  these articles create a new branch of “popular power” consisting of councils composed of representatives (voceros, or spokespersons, is the preferred chavista term) of local, grassroots community organizations that will directly allocate funds for projects.  these councils will be organized on the level of “communes” within municipalities; their funds will come directly from the executive, bypassing mayors, governors, and state and municipal legislatures.why this change?  president chávez hopes through this mechanism, and through the re-organization of his supporters in the new unified socialist party of venezuela (psuv) to strengthen direct, “protagonistic” democracy, which in his view and that of many of his supporters has been repeatedly co-opted by opportunists and professional politicians.  the communal councils and grassroots alternative economic structures will have to co-exist with capitalism and the political institutions of representative democracy, but over time they are to expand their presence and influence, flowering eventually into “twenty-first century socialism.”observers of venezuela can easily find reason to be optimistic or pessimistic about this project.  several of the government “missions” in areas of health care, urban land reform, cooperatives, sanitation and water have produced inspiring examples of participatory democracy at the grassroots.  however, corruption and cronyism continues to plague the cooperative movement, the subsidized "mercal" markets, and the administration of community grants. politicians with personal connections to the government can displace genuine grassroots councils merely by obtaining certification of themselves as “authentic” representatives.  venezuelan socialism will for the foreseeable future be less about democratizing control over the means of production than about democratically distributing a bounty that springs from the subsoil -- oil.
