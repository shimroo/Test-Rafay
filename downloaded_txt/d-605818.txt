does god heal today? 

i’ve heard people say “it’s god’s will” or “i’ll just leave it up to god” when faced with a serious illness or tragedy. don’t fall into that trap. god wants us to pray to him for help. in luke 18:1 jesus told his disciples that they”should always pray and not give up.” and then jesus asked “…will not god bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night?”pray to god from your heart for healing. don’t stop. don’t give up. god wants us to ask him for help. he loves us.
over 20 percent of the gospel is about the healing ministry of jesus christ. jesus taught his disciples how to pray and heal. he sent them to carry on his work. wouldn’t jesus want his followers to pray for healing today?
many spiritual writers have defined the call of healing so narrowly that some people feel they don’t qualify. but today a new awakening in faith has made us realize we are not only called into healing for ourselves, but also in various degrees into healing each other.
the bible actually gives us some directions on how to pray for healing. for example, in james 5:14-15 we are told: is any one of you sick? he should call the elders of the church to pray over him and anoint him with oil in the name of the lord. 15) and the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the lord will raise him up. if he has sinned, he will be forgiven. and in james 5:16 we are asked to “confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed.” and then told that “the prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.” in mark 11:23-25 jesus further instructs to forgive when we pray “i tell you the truth, if anyone says to this mountain, `go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him. 24) therefore i tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours. 25) and when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your father in heaven may forgive you your sins.”
only someone facing or sharing a serious sickness, pain or tragedy knows how hard it is. they know how hard it is to cope with the fear and uncertainty. they know how absurd it sounds when someone first tells them to “keep a positive attitude”. they know how terrifying it is when the doubt comes. they know how hard it is to throw a mountain into the sea. but remember what jesus told us in matthew 17:19-20 when he said “i tell you the truth, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, `move from here to there’ and it will move. nothing will be impossible for you.” faith as small as a mustard seed sounds a little like hope to me, and that’s a good start.
god bless you on your healing journey.
