video by gary edensâ  â  â photos by marlene klotz-collinsâ â arizona media & advertising survivors35th annual reunionsaturday oct. 12, 2024â was another great success!catching up with...greg cookefrom local phoenix tvâ to 60 minutes and more...he writes us:â  â  â i moved from ktar to klz tv in denver continuing as a cameraman. then tried freelancing for a bit before being hired as a staff cameraman for cbs news covering the war in vietnam in june 1970 - just after the kent state university shooting at a vietnam protest.â â  â  â wild times in those days and i worked with all of the well known cbs correspondents who would swing through the war zone on special assignments. one of the stories i shot lives on today thanks to youtube - and was the inspiration for a scene in the movie platoon. this according to a marine corps retiree and friend who was the military âtechnical directorâ for oliver stone on the film production. portions of my story always seem find their into many vietnam documentaries. hereâs the original:https://youtu.be/bip7tvbzwxi?si=gj0te2pjvj6wc3khâ  â  â after 2 years in saigon i returned stateside and was assigned to george mcgovernâs campaign plane covering the 25-thousand mile crusade cris crossing the country in his bid for the presidency against nixon. for the next 8 years i was one of a select handful of freelancers shooting exclusively for 60 minutes and cbs documentaries - including the controversial hunting documentary: the guns of autumn.â â  â  â i got a couple special assignments along the way: walter cronkiteâs dedicated cameraman on president nixonâs final european tour before resigning the presidency, and pool cameraman traveling on henry kissingerâs plane as he traveled to china on a formal state department tour.â  â  â good friend and correspondent morley safer brought me onboard as a staff producer for 60 minutes with a move to new york city. after several years in the big apple i moved west to los angeles to try my hand at entertainment producing by creating a 60 minutes âinspiredâ reality show called love stories with stu billet and ralph edwards who were having great success with their reality show peoples court. after one season, got a gig as show director for the supernatural/alien reality series sightings under actor/producer henry winkler at paramount studios. then - that led to a senior producer position helping create and launch the cbs reality show amazing race.â  â  â wow - this must sound like some phony baloney historyâ¦. itâs the first time iâve actually chronicled my past since ktar and even iâm amazed by all these experiences. thanks for asking what iâve been up to :)â  â  â today, my wife (a long time disney executive) and i bounce back and forth between our place in gilbert and our condo in burbank to keep up with our kids, grandchildren, and 5 great-grandchildren.â ,.. hope to see the âsurvivorsâ in 2024!gregâ  â  â ps:â  â  â but! - i forgot to mention the most important part of my saga - it all began because of a kind word from jack murphy! i left washington high school with the intention of becoming an architect and took a summer job as a cameraman at kool tv where jack murphy was instrumental in developing their tv news programming. about three years later i was trying freelancing and jack had moved on to a position with the us information agency developing a national tv network in vietnam during the war. then one day in saigon, jack mentioned my name to a cbs correspondent, don webster, when cbs was looking to fill a cameraman position in saigon. soon after that don webster knocked in my door in phoenix - and my journey into world events began. as i said to him many times later -"thank you jackâ. if it were not for him,.. iâd still be sitting in front of a computerized drafting program.above left: with henry kissinger, above right: in vietnambelow: todayour ownsandy cowenin aâ balance of naturetv commercial!website designed at homestead™ list your business for free
