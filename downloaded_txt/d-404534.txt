cat and exotic care of the central coast
we are your source on the central coast dedicated to the special needs of cats, birds, reptiles and small mammals.
cat and exotic care is the first veterinary hospital on the central coast dedicated to the special needs of cats, birds, reptiles and small mammals. founded in 2004 as a sanctuary for cats and smaller, more timid exotic pets, cat and exotic care is a place where animals can receive premium healthcare and boarding without the added stress and noise of dogs. utilizing cutting-edge technology and specialty equipment for cats and exotic species, our goal is to provide a low stress environment that will allow us to perform advanced medical and preventative healthcare.
