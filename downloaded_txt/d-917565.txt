all of the doctors and team members at the cat vet clinic are fantastic, empathetic and extremely caring with our two senior cats (one is a special needs tripod kitty) and our two younger bonded cats. it is so nice to have a local vet clinic with expert veterinarians and staff that focus solely on cats.

there are just not enough good words to say about this place, other than they just get it. there is a reason i'll drive 45 minutes to take my kitties to them, and it's because they are nothing but the best!

exclusively feline practice helps lower the overall stress level, and ensures the vets in the practice have the expertise to effectively treat your fur baby. always excellent care.
