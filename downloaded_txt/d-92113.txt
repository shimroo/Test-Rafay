a chinese navy helicopter flew within 10 feet of a philippine patrol plane on tuesday in a disputed area of the the south china sea, as the filipino pilot warned by radio: “you are flying too close, you are very dangerous.” the helicopter was attempting to force a cessna caravan turbo-prop plane belonging to the philippine bureau of fisheries and aquatic resources out of what china claims is its airspace over the hotly disputed scarborough shoal off the northwestern philippines. an associated press journalist and other invited foreign media representatives on the plane witnessed the tense 30-minute standoff as the philippine plane pressed on with its low-altitude patrol around scarborough.

top russian and american officials met in saudi arabia on tuesday to begin talks on improving ties and negotiating an end to the war in ukraine. the meeting in riyadh marks another pivotal step by the trump administration to reverse u.s. policy on isolating russia and is meant to pave the way for a meeting between u.s. president donald trump and russian president vladimir putin. trump earlier this month upended u.s. policy toward ukraine and russia by saying he and putin had agreed to begin negotiations on ending the war. ukrainian officials aren’t taking part in the meeting, and ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy said monday that his country won’t accept the outcome if kyiv doesn’t take part.

a delta air lines plane has flipped upon arrival at toronto’s pearson airport and ended up on its roof, injuring 18 people. the airport's chief executive says all 80 people on board survived and those hurt had relatively minor injuries. the flight from minneapolis attempted to land on a dry runway at around 2:15 p.m. monday in toronto. wind gusts of up to 40 mph were blowing snow at the time. the cause of the crash remains under investigation. video from the scene shows the mitsubishi crj-900lr upside down on the snowy tarmac as emergency workers hosed it down. the plane was somewhat obscured by snow from a winter storm that hit toronto over the weekend.

efforts to shut down online scam centers in myanmar appear to gain momentum with a visit by a top chinese official to the border zone ahead of expected large-scale repatriations of workers in the illicit industry. the visit monday by liu zhongyi, china’s vice minister of public security, is part of a stepped-up effort by the three countries to address the online scam problem. areas of myanmar bordering thailand have been havens for criminal syndicates employing an estimated hundreds of thousands of people who help carry out online scams including false romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes. victims worldwide have lost money to such scams, and the workers were often lured there under false pretenses and found themselves trapped.

a judge in argentina has been selected to investigate allegations of fraud against president javier milei for his brief promotion of a cryptocurrency that collapsed in value hours after it was launched last week. milei and his office deny involvement with creators of the $libra cryptocurrency, saying he initially drew attention to it friday as an entrepreneurial project that might benefit argentina but that he learned more about it later and then withdrew his support. lawyers in argentina filed fraud complaints against the libertarian president on sunday. the case was assigned monday to chief justice maría servini of the federal criminal court in buenos aires. she doesn’t have a deadline to finish investigating the allegations
