creators of

thrills

ebl ziplines is the nation’s premiere installer of canopy zipline tours and operations

no other company has the expertise, knowledge, installation experience, or infrastructure to assist you better when it comes to your project. whether we build it and walk away, train your staff, or fully operate your tour, we provide the structure necessary for success. no other vendor, program, or franchise can offer you this level of service for canopy zipline tours.

build with the best

since 2002, ebl has created some of the most dramatic, breath-taking zipline canopy tours in the us, created the current common practices for installation and operational practices, professionally engineered tours (designs, platforms, and termination methods), conducted destructive testing of our practices, and assisted the professional ropes course association with the acceptance of standards for construction, installation, and training. 
why ebl?
in the air & on the air

a new adventure show, zip away tv, is our self-produced show. it is a mix of documentary and technical content featuring site visits, zipline construction, training and crew interactions, and operations of the large network of tours overseen by ebl.

safety is our priority

our courses are engineered for thrills, but safety is key! in addition to certified structure design and construction, ebl has developed custom harnesses, pulleys, and safety lanyards under rigorous iso-9001 standards. not to mention installation techniques that are environmentally friendly.
safety standards
the sky is the limit

from remote, exotic locations to the off-the-beaten-path, we create memorable experiences with a very successful track record of design and consultation, inspection, training, and installation since 1999. some 50 projects and counting, ebl is the leader.
