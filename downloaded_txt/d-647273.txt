              what are child ages?
            

a child is between the ages of 4 and 11 years.
many trains in italy and beyond offer a discounted fare between 30% & 50% off the adult fare for children.
the child offer is now extended to children ages 4 to 14 years when traveling on high-speed frecciarossa, frecciabianca, frecciargento, intercity, intercitynotte, eurocity, and thello trains. your child will be assigned his/her own seat and children must be accompanied by an adult when traveling on this offer.
regional trains will still offer discounted fares for children ages 4 to 11 years.
infants & children 3 & under travel for free and will share a seat with the adult companion.
