      happy new year everyone!! time flew this past year didnt it! wow...so much happened to me last year, and i am so blessed to say that my recovery from my caraccident has gotten somewhat better...never will be 100% back to my old self...but thankful for the range of motion i have gotten back in my neck and back! on a brighter note...i have plans for 2010 that will keep me very busy! we are preparing for our move to our florida condo in oct! hubby retires oct 31st and that will be the day we pull out of our nj home forever!!!! its going to be bitter sweet, the house goes on the market in early spring and if it seels before the move date...we rent until oct...no biggy, as we are selling most of our furniture and other items, so that move will be quick and easy. as far as my clients i have 3 now that will be competing in bodybuliding! 1 female and 2 males...very excited for them all, my one young client is only 19 and doing his first show!! actually, he will be doing two local shows! my workouts have changed drastically since the car accident, i have had to "downsize" my body and train with more moderate weights and i love the changes, because i feel much lighter on my feet and like the way i look to boot! i am down to 115lbs right now and cant say i miss the extra weight at all, its much better for my injuries. i have a big surprize in store for all of you soon! i am keeping it under wraps a few more months...so stay tuned for my big news!!!! i can hardly keep it to myself!!! untill next post..please feel free to email me! i love hearing from all my fans and friends out there! thank you for your support! if you have not seen my dvd documentary yet, its for sale in my store here on my website! if you want it signed just ask!! love and hugs   have a great new year! may all your dreams come true!! i know mine are!!!

      ok, here we are in may already. so much has happened this year, since my last blog mr nixon , my hubbies dad has gone through so many health issues and needless to say we were the ones who stepped up to the plate and took care of things, because we love him, and felt that nobody else would. we were right...after many days by his side in the hospital and everyday in his rehab i was there to listen to his thoughts and concerns, he became so dear to me in the past few months. brian and i took him to change his will after he got well enough and we took over his everyday bills and made sure he got to all his dr appts ect...and as of now, hes home and doing as well as he can. he had 2 weeks in the hospital for bacteria infection and then 2 weeks in rehab to get his strength back and then after being home for one month he decided to get the much needed carodid artery surgery which brian and i took him to and sat by his side each day afterwards. all the while i have been trying to get better from our car accident back in dec. 2008. my rehab didnt go so well and after 4 months of terrible pain i decided to take it to another dr. for pain management, epidurals and more mri's. well, i am happy to say that 3 days ago i finally started to feel some pain releif! i had been seeing a chiropractor for 4months and getting nowhere..and for some strange reason after stopping my adjustments, i feel better. i still have pain, but i can now turn my head and take a deep breath! thank god! and my shoulder mri was approved for this monday, so i will keep you posted there.but for now, no need for an epidural! yippee!!!brian and i have also been studing  for our nfpt personal trainer certification which we finally took our test last friday and passed!!! so we are both good to go for our fitness training when we move to florida in 18 months from now, with his massage theraphy and pt certs he and i are going to make a great team! we leave may 18th for 15 days vacation in sunny florida, while we are there we are going to look into some jobs and scope out the area more:) we are flying because we are both afraid to make that long drive ever again after our car accident. 15 hrs in a car is no fun!!! so, next time i blog i will fill you in on our trip to florida:) as far as my training goes, i still get to the gym 4 days a week and do my light lifting for rehab and cardio to keep me somewhat lean:) cant let 25 yrs of hard work go to hell completely!! take care and god bless,    vicki nixon ifbb pro bbgood luck to all the ladies who are competing in the ny ifbb pro show, i decided not to attend this year, to much to do to prepare for our trip.  brian and i have also been studing

      well here we are in april already! update on my injuries are: 3 new blown disks in my neck and back...causing pain in arms and legs and feet. good news is i am finally able to do light weights after 10 weeks of nothing!!!! i do cardio 4 days a week and my rehab exercises 3 days...so i am not just sitting around by any means! lol! besides i am not one to sit still very long anyway...i am always moving!! my rehab is now down to 1 day a week for adjustments and 4 days weights. my headaches finally have slowed down to one a week and not the everyday events i was having. the dr put me on a med about a month ago that helps with migraines...so far its helping. i am excited about our may trip to florida! we are flying with our dogs with us in the cabin!!! no more driving for us ever again!!!!! the trauma the accident caused me is so bad..i could not drive that far if i wanted to. the cost of us flying with the dogs is 700.00 compared to the 300.00 we used to spend driving...but its going to be well worth it!!! we will be there in 2 hrs instead of 15 hrs!! i will be going to the ny ifbb pro show on may 16th which is 2 days before we head to florida. there will be about 20 ifbb pro ladies competing this yr in ny and i look forward to supporting them all!!!   until next time, e-mail me! i love hearing from you all!         stay healthy!

      ok here goes the bad news...yes..more bad news:( saw the dr yesterday, he says no gym until i am able to recover....i cant stand the thought of more time away from the gym, but i know that i have to do whatever it takes to get better!! my back and neck pain are out of control at this point. so, i will just have to suck it up and focus on getting better and other projects, which i have plenty of right now:) more time for photography and studying for my new personal trainer cert! i cant even help my clients with their workouts...so now all i do is point and count for them:) i will feel like juliane on the biggest looser! i may even scream at them! lol! no, thats not my s style of training.please say some prayers for me, i hope to be back to my old self again before to long!i will keep you posted on my progress, i start pt next week...take care and have a great weekend!   xoxo
