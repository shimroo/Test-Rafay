…i found meiji techno through an online search…i emailed the same evening and received a reply first thing on the monday morning answering all my questions concisely and accurately as well as providing accurate prices. i rang and spoke to andy who again answered my questions and within a couple of days i had ordered, paid for and was waiting delivery of my microscope. my order arrived on the agreed day superbly packaged and having used my equipment for approaching a year now, i cannot fault any part of it.

…we had spoken to andy at an event a few years back & were impressed with the products on show. responses were swift & an onsite demonstration was organised quickly. andy had great knowledge of the products, available brands & application. this made us feel more confident with the equipment & the supplier (in the past we have found salespeople come with little knowledge & try to sell the top spec model when it’s overkill). we have been using the microscope & camera equipment on a daily basis. with are very happy with the piece of equipment & think it was great value for money.
