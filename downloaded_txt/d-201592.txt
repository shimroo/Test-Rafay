proven success since 1985
hoop mountain began in 1985 with 32 summer campers in northfield, massachusetts. today we have year round hoop mountain branches throughout the united states as well as internationally. well over 100,000 players and coaches have attended hoop mountain camps and clinics. thirty eight former and current nba players have participated in our events. as well, hundreds of players have earned college scholarships at our events.
our philosophy has always been to be a “hands on” and highly personalized organization. we strive to extend ourselves to align with our players in any way to assist them in achieving their basketball goals. whether we are putting on a college showcase or exposure camp or instructional camp our mission is to be “all in” with our players. we look forward to hosting you at one of our many events we offer on a year round basis.
the backbone of our organization are the hundreds of caring coaches and teachers. since 1985 any player landing at one of our events nationwide has come to expect first rate teaching and hospitality. now we have brought our hoop mountain elite coaching to the middle east and soon to open up in india. we extend a warm hoop mountain welcome to you and your family or we take the basketball journey together.
