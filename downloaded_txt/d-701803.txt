                                                        canada has a robust history of sightings of ufos beginning in many eyes even before european exploration. we continue to look into these sightings from both an archival viewpoint and a discussion of hypothetical causation of these experiences.

the paranormal is "...beset by true believers ('they must be, therefore they are!') and true unbelievers ('they can't be, therefore they aren't!') rare are those who pursue evidence wherever it may lead, no matter how the results may square with their cherished hopes and dreams. ironically, both the tbists and the tuists see themselves as champions of objective analysis and critical thinking, when in fact they are defenders of their respective faiths and, not incidentally, their egos." - karl pflock
