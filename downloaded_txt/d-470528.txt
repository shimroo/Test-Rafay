fwd z frame cf gravel bike    25 june 2021







				the highracer recumbent that i built in 2010 has been reincarnated as a dual 26" fwd bike with disk brakes and fat tires to be better on gravel and rough chip seal roads. over the years this bike has morphed from the original dual 700c highracer to the z frame highracer, and now to this fwd z frame cf gravel-ish highracer.

barracuda racing trike 1.0    25 may 2018







				over the past two years i had been considering building a trike. a carbon fiber racing trike was designed. i decided to build a mostly steel version first using existing parts to get the geometry and steering right before committing it to carbon fiber. 



				the trike is now built but will need a summer of testing to see what needs to be tweaked.  here's the build blog. these two trike pages also explain the whys and hows of trike building.

					charles brown has created four great documents detailing many of the fundamentals and esoterica of recumbent vehicle design.
