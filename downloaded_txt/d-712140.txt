remembering the 
		bonnie blue flag & harry macarthy

by sue burns moore


it is a close race as to whether dixie or the 
		bonnie blue flag was the most popular song of the south during the 
		war, for both strongly gripped southern hearts. during the vicksburg 
		siege, steamboats on the mississippi river played both songs on their 
		calliopes to encourage the confederates in the trenches. however, the 
		bonnie blue flag was the only one actually written and sold as an anthem 
		during the war. its powerful lyrics and rollicking tune stirred 
		patriotic men and women to tears and to action. in time, as with other 
		famous war songs, questions arose as to who wrote it and when was it 
		first performed.

on june 30, 2009, the issue was settled--the 
		bucolic fields along highway 18 south of raymond would remain that way, 
		even though the fight to save them lasted 1,065 days, as opposed to the 
		single day of combat on those hallowed grounds in may of 1863. friends 
		of raymond, a local non-profit volunteer historical preservation group, 
		working with the civil war preservation trust, a national organization 
		dedicated to saving americas civil war battlefields, purchased 66.62 
		acres of core battlefield property, thus, ending a three year process of 
		negotiations and fund-raising. as a result, the preserved area of the 
		raymond battlefield has grown from 65 acres to almost 150, because the 
		purchase of the property brings with it a preservation easement for 
		additional acreage on the battlefield.

the marker, originally placed at the willow 
		springs crossroads in the early 1960s, disappeared approximately ten 
		years ago; was recently found under the porch of a rental house, and was 
		rededicated by the port gibson heritage trust. hills was the guest 
		speaker for the historic event, price has researched deeply into the 
		area history, and st. john is president of the trust.

the
68th ohio infantry 
in the battle of raymond

excerpt from chapter four





        the early morning of may 9 found us once more in motion. after a 
march of about 10 miles we went into camp near the little village of utica. early the following morning, sunday, our brigade 
was ordered out to lead the advance. however, the order was revoked and we 
remained in camp until late in the afternoon, when we formed into line as third 
division train guard, marched 10 miles, and toward the hour of midnight went 
into bivouac. 

on may 11 we took up our line of march in the 
direction of raymond. we moved rapidly over the ground, now in bright sunshine 
and now in a torrent of rain, until late in the day, when we came to a halt and 
stacked arms on roach's plantation, where we remained until the next morning.

the morning of tuesday, may 12, we silently moved 
out of camp. soon the enemy showed up in our front, when a heavy line of 
flankers was deployed on each side, and all moved forward in line of battle 
until about 10 o'clock, when we found the enemy strongly posted about two miles 
from raymond.

"come 
	on riggin, the day is lost"


    by rebecca b. drake





a first- hand account of the battle of raymond 
          written by thomas. b. 
        riggin,
        a member of hall’s scouts,
          a state company, who patrolled the utica-raymond road 
        the night before the battle.





on may 12, 1863, the night before the 
        battle of raymond, general mcpherson’s advanced guards were located at 
        “magnolia vale,” six miles from raymond. the area was known as 
        fairchild’s crossing since the utica-raymond road connected to the 
        oakley-crystal springs road in front of the fairchild residence. today 
        the historic home is owned by reuben and sue lott. 







battle of raymond as sketched by theodore davis, a new 
          york sketch artist who worked for harper’s weekly.  davis 
          accompanied the union army from the time they disembarked at 
          bruinsburg landing until the surrender at vicksburg.
