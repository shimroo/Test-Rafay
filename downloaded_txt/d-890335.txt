what people say










“my goal is to be the absolute best i can be. to leave every stone unturned so i can walk away from this game with no regrets. one of the biggest and most under valued traits that can set an athlete apart from the pack, is their mental game. we spend so much time training our physical tools when they are ultimately undermined by a poor mental game plan. you can be the strongest guy in the gym, with the hardest fastball and best curveball, but without a strong mental approach and that ‘attack’ mentality it will all be for nothing. eventually, all you will have to set you apart from everyone else at your level will be your mental fortitude. attack it.”— brett graves: (mlb/aaa) with the oakland athletics






“sean and i were teammates at louisiana tech for 1 year where he was a key component to leading our team to its first regional appearance since 1987. he continued to dominate conference usa until injury ultimately took the game he loved so much from him. as a pitcher, i always took notice when he talked about hitting and what he was thinking while competing against the pitcher because it was different than the cookie cutter approach and the results talked for themselves!”— phil diehl (mlb/aaa) colorado rockies






"sean and i become close friends while in college and remain close to this day. i know he is a good man with high character. he runs his company like he runs his life, with an aim to help people above anything else. sean has personally endured setbacks in the game, and he came out stronger on the other side. he will teach you how to do the same. you will be a better player for having worked with impact performance.”— braden bristo: aaa in the new york yankees organization
