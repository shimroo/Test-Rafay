faq
                    







what is a booking process?




we make booking simple and easy: you may sign a contract and make a deposit online! 







should i choose a duo, trio or string quartet?





                                   string duo is a good option for small and intimate weddings with a low number of guests. string trio and quartet are both suited for all kinds of occasions: presentations, corporate events, birthday parties, christmas and new year selebrations, and weddings. quartet, though, has a slightly wider song list available than a trio. besides these standard options, we do play in different kinds of ensembles depending on your needs: harp and string quartet, cello/piano duo, guitar/string quartet, trumpet/string trio, classical guitar and others







can i request a song which is not on the list




absolutely! we'll be delighted to bring to life all your creative ideas! if needed, we do custom arrangements at a flat rate of $99 per song.however, we have an extensive library of avilable songs which gets updated every week. it may happen that we have a song you are looking for, though it's not listed in our repertoire. all songs from our repertoire are free therefore, shoot us an email with the name of a song and we'll tell you upfront whether we have it or not.







do you travel?





                                   yes, we do! it happens that the most romantic and beautiful places are hidden from everyone's eyes.

great experience with this group! i recently proposed to my girlfriend at the downtown and hired the quartet to "surprise" her. they were excellent- very professional, punctual and pleasant. i recommend them highly.
