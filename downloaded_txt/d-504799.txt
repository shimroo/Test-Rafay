memory lane











 

it all started when…partners carmen la mendola, domenick sportelli, nick dorris & peter leonidas wanted to provide local customers with texas weiners; a custom blended beef and pork hot dog, deep fried and delicious. they started with a small building and 20 stools at the counter. seven years later, after much success and long lines, they renovated adding booths and seating for 60 people. in the 80's, they needed more seating for all the customers that had become so loyal to their hot dogs and other delicious stuff. they expanded seating for 145 people.over the years, the hot grill has become famous for menu items such as their texas weiners “all the way”; a deep fried hot dog with mustard, onions and chili sauce (a secret recipe) and their delicious french fries with cheese and gravy.as they approach their 63rd year in business, the hot grill is grateful to the community for their loyal support and looking forward to continuing the tradition for many years to come.the hot grill ... all the way!
