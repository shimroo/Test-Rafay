st. john’s is a wonderful church full of caring, giving people. we do many social ministry projects to help the community. if you like to help others, as christ taught us, come to st. john’s! – jan viola“if you have kids you need to become a member of our congregation. there are so many activities outside of worship for them.”  cheryl schweigermy st. john’s family is just that….my family. people at st. john’s have been friendly, kind, & generous to me during difficult times in my life, i am grateful for them and so blessed. it is good to be back hearing the word, and worshipping safely, with my st. john’s family. -cindy peck“our church staff has been diligent in restarting in person worship.  they have paid attention to so many details and provided everyone with a safe environment.  my husband and i feel very comfortable attending worship and are happy to be here once again.”  cheryl moreau
