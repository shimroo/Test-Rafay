jill conner browne 























									
i give a 25 – 45 minute, highly motivating, hopefully hilarious, totally g-rated account of how i came to be the sweet potato queen and my resulting contributions to world peace (in spite of the fact that all i ever wanted in life was to be a 5’2″, red-headed, large-breasted, tiny-footed singer and never got any of it). afterwards, i answer questions – and since i know pretty much everything (except for algebra) – this is most helpful to the audience.
