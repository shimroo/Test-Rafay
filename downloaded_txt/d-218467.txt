   			who we are   		


the farm equipment manufacturers association serves as a resource and advocate for the shortline farm equipment industry. we represent manufacturers of specialized agricultural equipment, their suppliers,  and their distributors.
we understand the distinct needs of this niche group and work hard to support them so they can do what they do best: bring choice, value and innovation to agriculture.
we succeed by creating opportunities for members to connect and learn from one another, keeping them informed on the news that matters most, providing customized educational opportunities at conventions, and building a body of essential information online that is available exclusively to members.
