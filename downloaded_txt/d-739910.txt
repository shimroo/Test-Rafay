 “most people would probably agree that improving people’s lives and preserving the environment are very worthy goals. if both of these objectives can be achieved at once, it’s even better. that’s exactly the value proposition we offer in the portable restroom industry.”

why satellite industries
satellite industries is one of the leading innovators in the portable sanitation industry. for over 65 years satellite industries has been advance engineering their portable restrooms, restroom trailers, trucks, vacuum technology, and deodorizers to be stronger, last longer, and most importantly, be user friendly.

why safe-t-fresh?
safe-t-fresh has recently released a new line of advanced engineered deodorizers that last longer, smell better, and mask the color of the grey water with its deep blue dye. safe-t-fresh’s chemist has taken advanced engineering to a new level. our deodorizers don't just mask the smell. they bond with the malodor making it completely encapsulated leaving the restroom smelling fresh after every use.

why satellite vacuum trucks?
a work truck should be designed for ease-of-use, and that is the thought process behind every truck that comes off the truckxpress line. our team of well trained mechanics build trucks so they create less wear and tear on operators. specifically placed tools, and cabinets help decrease the amount of time each operator has to spend servicing the restroom. which puts more money back in your pocket!

why satellite suites?
satellite suites was introduced by satellite industries in 2014. since its introduction to the portable restroom trailer industry satellite suites has become the leading trailer on the market. the many advantages of a satellite suites trailer can only be appreciated by comparing our models with the competition - item by item, feature by feature. the use of none wood materials in building the structure eliminates the chance of structural rot and our polyethylene waste tank is easier to clean, upkeep and simply lasts longer.

why vacuum technology?
over the past decade, the vacuum technology field in europe has experienced steady growth. in 2022, satellite made a strategic move to enter this thriving market by acquiring sanitrax international. since the acquisition, satellite has been instrumental in making vacuum technology accessible worldwide. they achieved this by ingeniously adapting the technology originally designed for large-scale events to suit smaller gatherings, bringing this revolutionary fresh-flush experience everywhere.
