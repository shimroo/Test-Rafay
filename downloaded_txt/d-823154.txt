welcome to new hampshire lakes real estate 
 

 

there is a different mind set to living on or near water. waking up to the call of loons and the splash of fish jumping. the sound of waves foaming up on shore or the sight of seagulls facing the wind on a pier.  
as a real estate agent, i have marketed and sold more properties on more different lakes than any agent covering the entire state, giving me valuable insight. with more than 1,300 lakes in new hampshire, there is a waterfront home for sale or lakefront property for you.  
i have lived on or near water my entire life. my family owned a private island nine miles of uncharted waters by boat and 28 miles by car to the nearest town. that town was called little current--and was an over statement. i understand and appreciate the emotions and fond memories attached to such special places. so whether you are a buyer or seller, choose this site to be and to be seen, along with the unsurpassed global exposure and local expertise only the berkshire hathaway homeservices - verani realty can provide.
give me a call, won’t you. let me be your waterfront agent. (even if your home is not on the water)
