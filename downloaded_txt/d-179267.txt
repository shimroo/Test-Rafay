what is a perennial?
a perennial is a plant that lives for more than two years. in comparison, biennials live for only two years, and annuals only live for one year. what are commonly referred to as perennials are actually herbaceous perennials, or non-woody plants that dies back to the ground in the winter. woody plants, or plants that do not die back in winter (such as shrubs), are also technically perennial in nature but are usually kept in a separate category.
