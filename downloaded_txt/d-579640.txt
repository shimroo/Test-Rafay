why the states suing trump should lose





as you expect from margot cleveland, a clear explanation of why 14 states should lose their case vs. doge/trump.it's also a medium-length essay, so we'll cut to the chase. ...the tro the plaintiff states proffered
 to the court on saturday would ban musk, doge, “and their agents, 
officers, and employees, or anyone acting in active concert with them,” 
from accessing data systems and information at a variety of federal 
agencies, including the office of personnel management and the 
departments of education, labor, health and human services, energy, 
transportation, and commerce. the proposed tro would further prohibit 
musk, doge, “and their agents, officers, and employees, or anyone acting
 in active concert with them,” from firing, furloughing, or otherwise 
placing on leave any employees working for those same agencies.
as the trump administration stressed
 in its saturday night response, the language is so “exceedingly broad” 
that, as written, it would even ban the president and senate-confirmed 
officials from accessing data or terminating federal employees if they 
collaborate with musk or doge in the decision-making process....not only that; the administration makes clear that the states are trying to run a sleight-of-hand trick right past the judge (chutkan, a bitch-in-black): ...the states alleged two separate counts — one premised on an alleged 
violation of the appointments clause of the constitution and another 
that asserted doge acted beyond its statutory power.
“both claims — the constitutional one, and its statutory 
counterpart,” the defendants stressed, are premised on musk and doge 
having the “authority to make decisions for the u.s. government.” 
“that premise is of course wrong,” the trump administration 
countered, explaining that the theory “rests entirely on conflating 
influence and authority.”...iow, it's foo-foo dust.margot repeated something else which you did not hear on "the news."...[l]ast week {...] two different district courts entered tros that 
restrained the trump administration from freezing or canceling grants, 
except as allowed by statute, regulation, or the terms of the grants. as
 i detailed
 at the time, the exception provided for in the tro swallowed the rule 
because federal contracts and grants uniformly provide the government 
may cancel the funding. thus, while the headlines from last week create 
the appearance that the courts were barring the trump administration 
from cutting funding, in reality, the terms of the tros had little 
impact on the functioning of the executive branch....why didn't you hear that on "the news"?  you know why.  doesn't fit their narrative.the bigger case is the one we mentioned below.  let's settle the question:  does sentence one of article ii mean what it says, or not?

"for sale" signs in dc?  not a big deal





a lot of websites have been wetting their pants over the "for sale" signs going up around d.c.relax.you may recall that there was an election last november, and a change of administrations is following that election.are democrat operatives, hangers-on, and camp-followers leaving dc, taking their syphilitic members with them?  of course.  did some of them work for holy-card fake charities?  yes.  there are a lot of them, as you can see from the graphics embedded here.but is this a sign that the deep state is clearing out?  hell, no.the republican jackwads have not left.yet.

trump going to scotus over article 2





it (finally) begins.the trump administration’s first major legal battle reached the supreme court on sunday. in an emergency application,
 president donald trump asked the justices to allow him to fire the 
leader of an agency dedicated to protecting whistleblowers, hampton 
dellinger, after a lower court ordered his reinstatement....[trump's lawyers:]   “until now, as far as we are aware, no court in american history has 
wielded an injunction to force the president to retain an agency head 
whom the president believes should not be entrusted with executive power
 and to prevent the president from relying on his preferred 
replacement,” it continues. “yet the district court remarkably found no 
irreparable harm to the president if he is judicially barred from 
exercising exclusive and preclusive powers of the presidency for at 
least 16 days, and perhaps for a month.”...and the really important part:... the petition also asks the justices to “end the practice whereby courts 
seize article ii powers for two weeks, yet disclaim the availability of 
any appellate review in the meantime.”...cj "julia" roberts will attempt a ruling based on the word "the", of course.  and if he can find an even-narrower matter on which to rule--avoiding the article 2 elephant in the room--he will.this might only be skirmish #1, but it might also be for all the chips. update:  wauck thinks this is a very big deal.

was "bird flu" a planned epidemic?





 the other day we mentioned that the usda forced the slaughter of millions of "bird-flu infected" chickens, (47 million since 12/1/24) which made the price of eggs rocket into the sky.  there was a suspicion that the usda did this in order to screw trump, who would enter office with the egg-price problem.  quarantining the affected chickens is the old-fashioned and preferred method of dealing with "bird flu."but now we have something even more interesting. right before bird flu started becoming a problem in america, us 
government was looking for a way to pass and enforce their electronic 
ear tag on cattle bill. this would allow radical liberal environmental 
groups access to regulate all cattle in america, mandate vaccines being 
used and slowing shrinking the amount of cattle you’re allowed to own. 
many farmers said ultimately this would put them out of business and end
 cattle production in america american cattle rancher warned the usda 
would use a bird flu outbreak to start the eid tags on cattle mandate 
awhile after he made this video wouldn’t you know it, the usda mandated 
eid tags on cattle and bison for the reason of “disease traceability,” 
so they could track the bird flue outbreak i mean what are the odds!? 
another amazing “coincidence”……maybe it is, maybe it is not.  but it bears close scrutiny and--if true--the "helicopter" method of punishment should be applied to the usda perps.  sauce for the chicken, sauce for the "expert."

biden's usda ordered the chicken slaughters





 one way to make the cost of a commodity rocket upward is to eradicate the commodity. ...when the people who controlled joe biden lost the 2024 election, they
 were angry.  they wanted to leave president trump with as big a mess as
 possible and all actions were taken to create chaos that trump would 
have to deal with.  intellectually honest people noticed.
part of their chaos operation was to drive up the cost of food, 
intentionally create inflation that trump would have to handle.  the 
“bird flu” issue was part of the plan.  after the 2024 election the u.s.
 dept of agriculture ordered millions of chickens to be killed.  simple 
quarantine process was dismissed in favor of a ridiculous slaughter....we suspected that it was a deliberate order from usda.  (by the way, this "bird flu" thing is also suspicious.  someone please check bill gates' phone calls to red chinese biolabs....) anyhow, kevin hassett demolishes a dummy "news" person at this link.

state farm v. californicate





this looks ugly. california’s insurance commissioner on feb. 14 turned down a request by insurer state farm for an emergency interim rate hike of 22 percent for home insurance, amid a flood of damage claims due to the devastating los angeles fires.... ...state farm has requested a 22 percent rate increase for non-renter 
homeowners, 15 percent for renters, 15 percent for condominium unit 
owners, and 38 percent for rental dwellings, all effective may 1, 2025, 
for interim rate increases.state farm said it was disappointed by
 the rejection. “this lack of approval sends a strong message to state 
farm general about the support it will receive to collect sufficient 
premiums in the future to protect californians against the risk of loss 
to their homes,” a feb. 14 statement posted on the company website reads....it gets worse. ....state farm said that because the commissioner has not yet approved its request for rate increases submitted last march [!!!?!!], it is now asking the agency to “take emergency action” to approve interim rate increases and allow the company “to start collecting additional premiums much more quickly and possibly begin rebuilding its risk-bearing capacity.”it also claimed in the letter that over the nine-year period ending in 2024, it paid $1.26 in claims and expenses for every $1.00 collected through premium payments, resulting in more than $5 billion in cumulative losses....at some point in time, state farm has to recognize that its non-california policyholders will rebel at picking up california losses year after year after year....maybe now is a good time.

slaughter on seventh ave (?)





 well, not exactly seventh ave.  actually, federal plaza, nyc.short story:  biden opens the border, texas begins shipping thousands of criminals and wastes of oxygen to nyc, nyc pays $$$mega-umpty millions to feed and house the ingrate bastards.  mayor of nyc (lefty dem) gets po'd, tells biden to go to hell with his refugees.merrick garland decides to go after mayor of nyc....when the charges against adams were revealed, he was accused of big 
stuff...like taking airline upgrades and helping the turkish embassy 
navigate nyc's byzantine building code system; see breaking: we now know the charges against new york mayor eric adams – redstate. the charges were framed to look big time, but they were eerily reminiscent of the hit jobs done on alaska senator ted stevens and former virginia governor bob mcdonnell, where normal activities were mutated into federal felonies by lawyers out to get a scalp....iow, the usual department of total injustice criminal playbook 101.trump gets elected....there was some speculation that trump might pardon adams; that didn't happen, but trump did order doj to dismiss the charges against him .....l the acting us attorney for sdny, danielle sassoon, wrote to attorney general pam bondi that she refused to drop the case; see read danielle sassoon’s letter to attorney general pam bondi, annotated.
 she tendered her resignation unless she got her way. deputy attorney 
general bove fired back, reminding her that she was not in charge, 
accusing the sdny office of unethical conduct in their investigation; 
see read the letter from emil bove accepting danielle sassoon’s resignation, annotated, and, oh, by the way, you're fired. bove then turned to the public integrity section in doj to file the dismissal. five supervisors resigned in solidarity with sassoon rather than sign the filing....five?  that's only a good start.... sassoon's firing left the office under the leadership of hagan scotten, 
another guy who is supposedly a conservative. he decided to go out with a
 bang; ...now six.  still just a start.next: poor, poor babies.  strong-armed?  how about the grannies in club fed for praying at abortion clinics, or the j-6 defendants tracked down and crushed by the oh so holy doj and the bitches-crew of aliens with black robes in dc?  maybe those poor, poor, poor, us attorneys would like a little time in riker's so they know what "strong-arming" really is--with your trousers down.....more delicious and christmas-present activity will follow!!!  stay tuned.

the bozos running fomoco





 this is also of interest to milwaukee people.  why?  read on. kelley blue book reported that ford’s ev sales were 30,176 for the 
fourth quarter and 97,865 for the entire year. therefore, ford lost 
$46,394 for each ev it sold in the fourth quarter and $52,113 for each 
ev it sold in 2024.
for the full year, ford reported net income of about $5.9 billion. 
thus, ford’s operating losses on evs were nearly equal to its total 
profits...powerline quoting robert brycewhy a milwaukee interest?because the ceo of ford is a member of harley-davidson's board.  and the ceo of harley is a green nutbag, too.meantime, harley is losing sales yoy and profits dropped significantly yoy.

the artful deception of the uw system





 trump's national institutes of health (nih) imposed a change in their grants schedule.  going forward, only 15% of the grant can be used for "administrative overhead", meaning travel & entertainment for "conferences", rent charged to the research, equipment & supplies, and secretaries, etc.the uw system immediately blasted the change, claiming that millions of third world inhabitants will die, tens of millions of children will be disfigured, and medical research will halt immediately.  plus all those talented secretaries and all those 5-star hotels for conferences will go bankrupt!  (we made up some of those claims.)as it turns out, even the researchers couldn't take that bullshit. ...some researchers see the new 15% cap on "negotiated indirect cost rate agreements" – paused monday by a president biden-nominated judge
 in 22 states that sued to block it – as welfare reform for colleges and
 a shot across the bow to administrators to stop pilfering from their 
researchers, who can get bigger grants with lower nicras.
"cutting indirects might even mean more science," epidemiologist vinay prasad, who runs an eponymous research lab at the university of california san francisco, wrote on his website among a slew of recent posts on nicra in theory and in practice.
"less money spent on the administration is more money to 
give out to actual scientists," the self-described liberal democrat 
said. "i am shocked to see researchers crying about how much money the 
university gets – it means more grants can be given per cycle."but but but you peasants have to understand this correctly, after all: 
...he specifically called out the president and medical dean at johns hopkins university, which is private, for suing nih while earning $4 million together on the backs of taxpayers....see?  it's our money, say johns hopkins poohbahs.  ours.  you cannot take it.see article two, first sentence, jagwads.

kid rock on nfl halftime:  "both middle fingers...."





 the guy gets it. ... kid rock claimed that lamar’s choice to select an all-black cast for 
his performance was “the epitome of dei blowing up” in the face of the 
nfl after years of pushing diversity. “it’s like all black people or all people of color speaking to his crowd
 in the hood, black people. it was like the most exclusive thing ever 
and i’m like, ‘f*** yeah, that’s awesome.’ i’m laughing my ass off,” 
said the rock artist, to the shock of maher....indeed.  want to find the 'both middle fingers' quote?  read the story at the link.

lindsey still living in the 1970's





 another mitch mcconnell-class true believer in war!! and we rule the world!! sen. lindsey graham (r-sc) laid out a scenario where ukraine should receive “automatic admission” into nato, days after other u.s. officials including defense secretary pete hegseth said that membership for the country into the 32-member alliance is unrealistic.graham, a staunch supporter of ukraine, made the comments in an interview at the munich security conference, where top u.s. and european officials have gathered to discuss the war in ukraine, among other issues.... ...graham also sought to cast aside the attention given to hegseth’s comments from earlier this week when he said that the united states does not believe “nato membership for ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement,” stressing that all that matters is how the three-year war ends....musk & co. discovered $49 billion in offshore accounts that came from us aid to ukraine.does lindsey graham own one of those accounts?  two?  thirty??

that tro?  voided.





news that you may not see in the "news" narratives because it does not fit their narrative:u.s. district judge john bates ruled on friday that elon musk’s department of government efficiency (doge) can continue
 accessing critical records from multiple federal agencies, dealing a 
significant setback to unions and nonprofit organizations that sought to
 block the effort.
the ruling allows doge to move forward with its mission of
 identifying and eliminating wasteful government spending by maintaining
 access to records from the department of labor, the department of 
health and human services, and the consumer financial protection bureau....yah.  it's in the constitution, under article two.  first sentence.there is a technical part to this.  the judge ruled that doge qualifies as 'an agency'--an appellation the trump team has tried to avoid.more will follow on this and all the other spurious/fake/extreme-left/union objections and lawsuits.meantime, doge will continue to do its work.

crawford, a democrat, lies.  surprised?





an extreme-lefty dane county judge-ette is running ads which are constructive lies about brad schimel, her common-sense opponent.a lefty liar.  surprised?? dane county judge susan crawford is slamming former attorney general 
brad schimel for not rushing the testing of rape kits in which sexual 
assault survivors did not consent to the testing, rapists were already convicted or were acquitted, or the accusations were false....oh.  when a victim refuses consent, crawford would go right ahead anyway?  puh-leeeze.  when the perp is already in prison, do we need testing?  puh-leeeeze.  when there is an acquittal?  when the "victim" made up a story? . ...crawford has repeatedly argued he should have rushed testing of the 
full 6,000, but schimel (like josh kaul after him) excluded testing 
cases in the above categories, which no one thought was controversial 
until crawford started launching political attacks. he also prioritized 
using taxpayer resources in the crime lab for current cases, especially where the evidence was needed in an upcoming court case or the statute of limitations was nearing....schimel found and used private grants to fund the testing.  very little public money was available at that time.  also of note:  the democrat now pretending to be "ag" is doing exactly what schimel did.huh.her lips are moving.  she's lying.

stirring the pot on deportations in mke





 one does not have to be gifted to understand the "teacher's aide deportation" story being flogged about in milwaukee.start with an illegal-immigration activist christine neumann-ortiz, who tipped the "news" people to a very small "demonstration" behind the scenes.  gotta have signs and marching!!have that activist .........ummmmnnnnnhhhhhh........create a narrative story-line featuring a sympathetic character.  make the "news" people believe that this character (mommy, school-employee, young, attractive) was going to be deported any minute now, despite trump's statement that only criminals were on the short-list for deportation.  this is called "stirring the pot," and gets the rabble all fired up.the only problem here?  the activist forgot to control the press' knowledge.so we have a woman who "needs more time" to complete some paperwork with ins.more time????this woman has been in milwaukee for eleven years, a factoid available on the tmj4 story. ortiz is slipping.  time to replace her with a better propagandist.

suspicious activity reports vs. politicians





every bank operating in the usa must file "suspicious activity reports" (sar) when they notice...........well.........suspicious activity.  the epa's bazillion-dollar "dump" of funds should be included here, by the way.  "pop-up" non-profits get non-profit status in august, get $billion grants in january?   hmmmmmmmm.......doge's audit of the treasury will include audits and examinations of sar's; specifically, sars which include the names of politicians, their families, and their close pals.that is why all of d.c. is sweating blood.  the reports that certain people have accumulated enormous wealth (g h w bush is one) during or after their term in office--not to mention the reported wealth-gains of people such as the biden crime family--will become very clear when that treasury audit is completed.look at this, then understand: u.s. presidents net worth before and after office: ronald reagan: $10.6m  $15.4m george h.w. bush: $4m  $23m bill clinton: $1.3m  $241.5m george w. bush: $20m  $40m barack obama: $1.3m  $70m donald trump: $3.7b  $2.5b numbers don’t lie.

another school shooter....another tranny





it's getting to nearly a 1-1 ratio. mooresville, ind. – an 18-year-old mooresville high school student 
who had a collage of mass shooters in the student’s bedroom was arrested
 on wednesday for allegedly planning a school shooting on valentine’s 
day.

arrested on the following charges: 
one count of conspiracy to commit murder, a level 1 felonyone count of intimidation: threat to commit terrorism, a level 5 felonyone count of conspiracy to commit intimidation: threat to commit terrorism, a level 5 felony ...law enforcement reportedly seized a number of notebooks from shockley’s 
room. the notebooks allegedly included several passages including one 
where shockley identified as “dex… a transgender male (who has) a lot of
 homicidal thoughts.” ... they just ran the story on fox6 milwaukee.  no mention of "tranny."when the lips of the "press" are moving, they are lying. this is a girl who is wannabee boy.

esolen's strong warning





we're not big fans of anthony esolen, but on occasion, he hits it out of the park. ...the american church in my lifetime, as an institution rather than as 
individual priests or bishops here and there, has done nothing to keep 
the indigenous working class in the fold, and has especially done 
nothing to keep such men as many of those high school boys will grow up 
to be, if they are not going on to college. men who work with their 
shoulders and backs don’t listen to feminist scolds, male or female, 
whose hands are as smooth as their words are shrill.  ...and that saps the vigor of the church. where did the american church 
once get all her vocations to the priesthood? where, i mean, before the 
elitism of the college-educated set in after vatican ii—when priests and
 religious sisters sure that they knew better obliterated one form of 
popular piety after another and devastated the churches the people had 
long cherished? in my small town, which i guess was typical in this 
regard, the church got them from an energetic, faithful, and 
multi-ethnic working class; roughly fifty, from my town’s incorporation 
in 1876 to 1965.  i count only three since then.  ... you cannot get priests unless you appeal to men, and you cannot do that 
unless you actually like their company, and by that i emphatically do 
not mean the company of the occasional effete and effeminate. but 
feminism is a luxury belief, as is, in the united states, a high-toned 
costless pretense of charity regarding the influx of millions of people,
 many of them men thus detached from their families, to depress the 
labor market at its low end. all men who do manual labor understand the point, and a church that blithely ignores their situation says to them, implicitly, “get lost.” you've heard about the ordo amoris.  esolen reminds us that unless the ordo justitia is recognized and obeyed, the church will continue to shrink.  she will never disappear, of course; but losing souls through sabotage will cost many churchmen their eternal souls.

sudden halt to war in ukraine.....and cia involvement





 you already know some of this.  but with the "news" orgs we have, parts will be a very pleasant surprise.... nato, the u.k and the european commission are not happy that president 
trump and russian president putin may end up framing the terms of a 
peace deal that ends the war in ukraine. the eu, the u.k, blackrock and 
jp morgan are expecting financial gains; president trump dismissing 
their claims and efforts while simultaneously demanding surety for any 
further u.s. funding has left the eu very angry....do you feeeeeeeellllllll sorry for jpmorgan?  blackrock?  the euroweenies?i didn't think so.moving along: ...suddenly, president trump begins extracting the u.s from the proxy war. 
 without the u.s. remaining involved, ukraine has nothing.  the eu and 
nato group understand this, and yet they must pretend a proxy war -with 
their participation- was not the reality....another very significant eo from trump:... president trump signed an executive order [see here]
 outlining that anyone from the state department or cia who attempts to 
retain their involvement in ukraine and subsequently defies the 
expressed change in approach by president trump, will be removed from 
their position....that eo was signed the same day as trump spoke with putin.not a co-incidence. it's another christmas day!

retail sales crash in january





this is not surprising at all.... bofa nailed it - as retail sales (nominal, remember) plunged 0.9% mom in january (after december's +0.4% mom was revised up to +0.7% mom). that is the biggest mom drop since march 2023...remember that 'nominal' sales means 'dollar sales.'  since prices are up, less goods are being purchased."adjusted" all to hell, too: ... the non-seasonally-adjusted retail sales for january actually crashed 16.5% mom ...... nine of the report’s 13 categories posted decreases, most notably motor vehicles, sporting goods and furniture stores...well, there were fires, floods, and snow--in the south!!--which probably had some effect.but we'll bet that bidenflation of food and insurance (not to mention the yuge price-hike in pharmaceuticals for geezers, another bidenflation move) is behind a lot of that decrease.  when you can't afford eggs, cars and furniture go off the shopping list.

who d'ya believe???...





....a perverted-sex promoting jesuit or your lying eyes? jesuit father james martin has struck back at the 
“internet,” launching the disingenuous and counter-factual claim the 
vatican “is not a walled city.”
father martin, a gay rights activist, was responding 
to critics who have pointed out the obvious irony involved in pope 
francis’ harsh criticisms against u.s. immigration policy while the 
vatican itself is the only walled sovereign territory in the world.... ...the massive, 40-foot-high walls surrounding vatican city state were 
built by pope leo iv, after islamic saracen troops sacked old st. 
peter’s basilica in 846 ad.
the original wall encompassed the entire vatican hill, surrounding 
what came to be known as the leonine city, but was later reduced to 
circumscribe the 110-acre vatican city that exists today....here's what the blind will not see.  (don't try running through st peter's into the city unless you want the swiss guard to impale you--or demonstrate proper use of the halberd.....)

tom tiffany's great move





you may--or may not--find this in a se wisconsin "news" report. republican wisconsin rep. tom tiffany asked secretary of homeland security (dhs) kristi noem to end a loophole that allows chinese nationals to visit the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands (cnmi), a us territory, without a visa, in a letter exclusively shared with the daily caller.specifically, tiffany requested that noem take steps to end the january 2024 rule called the “guam-commonwealth of the northern mariana islands (cnmi) visa waiver program automation and electronic travel authorization; creation of cnmi economic vitality & security travel authorization program (evs-tap).”the biden-era rule continues an obama program which allowed “‘categorical’ parole” to chinese nationals to travel to cnmi, according to tiffany.as a result of the program, he wrote, chinese citizens “were able to sidestep the legal requirement that they first obtain a tourist visa before entering the cnmi.”the loophole, tiffany continued, has led to a “troubling rise in ‘birth tourism.'”...tiffany's action is not approved by lefty wankers.  if coverage emerges, look for the usual condescension and name-calling.

bidenflation remains--and is worse





the old pervert left you his legacy (aside from the stains in his diapers): as has been the case for many months, today’s producer price index 
for january included big up-revisions of the prior month, driven by a 
whopper up-revision for services which account for two-thirds of the 
overall ppi. on top of these upwardly revised december figures, the ppi 
rose further in january.
in january, the overall ppi accelerated to an increase of 3.51% 
year-over-year, the worst increase since february 2023, following a 
persistent zigzag line higher from the low point of near 0% in june 
2023, driven largely by the services ppi.
and december was revised up to an increase of 3.48%, from 3.31% as 
reported a month ago. this up-revision was powered by a massive 
up-revision in services....the ppi is, roughly, prices paid by the people from whom you buy your stuff.so like it or not, you're getting hammered in the next few months--again.

trump usaid cuts "spoiling the food"??  nope.





 peter, who has been there and done that, notes the frantic whines from the msm. almost $500 million in food aid is at risk of spoilage as it sits in ports, ships and warehouses after funding for the u.s. agency for international development, or usaid, was paused by the trump administration, according to a feb. 10 report from a government watchdog. the report from usaid's inspector general highlighted the risks of "safeguarding and distribution" of $8.2 billion in unspent humanitarian aid after the trump administration ordered almost all staff to be placed on leave and ordered a review of u.s. foreign assistance programs. ...--quoting seebssimilar bullshit can be found at msn.peter has a comment. ...i've worked in the third world for decades.  i've seen usaid food 
distributed in several countries.  i've helped organize, and led, aid 
convoys into disrupted and/or disaster areas.  i know whereof i speak - 
and i can tell you that those reports are mostly bull****.first 
off, the food that usaid distributes (or should that be "distributed"?) 
isn't broccoli and bananas, guaranteed to go bad within days.  it's dry 
grains such as rice, wheat, sorghum, and so on.  it's flour (in large 
quantities) from wheat, maize and other grains.  it's beans of any 
number of varieties.  the stuff lasts for months, if not years, and is 
selected with that as a primary requirement.  since destinations for 
that aid seldom have luxuries such as refrigeration or air-conditioning,
 you send them food that can remain edible and healthy under such 
conditions.secondly, the "risks" of "safeguarding and 
distribution" are real, whether or not usaid is involved.  have you seen
 photographs of tents made from or supplied by usaid, in use by 
terrorist movements such as hamas, the taliban and others?  of course 
you have.  have you seen tv footage of food for sale in african village 
markets, including sacks filled with usaid-supplied grain?  yep, that 
too.  all those aid products were stolen by those selling and/or using them. 
 they don't pay for them.  they don't even ask for them.  they simply 
raid the warehouses where they're stored and take what they want, or 
hijack entire convoys loaded with aid products....and yes, usaid knew about the thefts.  they don't care.  it's not their salaries (until very recently) that are being pilfered.look for more of the doom doom doom babies die babies die grannies collapse.  the cia makes up very good fables, after all.they're paid to lie.

another christmas!  kill dept of "education"!!!!





 trump wants to dump the federal department of "education" into the trash-bin of history.another christmas day for actual taxpaying us citizens who are not members of one of the marxist teachers' unions!america is ranked as #40 in educational attainment.but america is ranked #1 in per-student spending.let the states decide what's best for their own children--although in the case of wisconsin that's another lost cause--and shutter the dei/tranny/pervert-love pusher outfit in d.c.soon, please.

nice little breakdown of usaid-funded ngo's which all promote "democracy."  or so they say.note the names of the principal officers--and that they are paid officers--of these "democracy-promoting" ngo's.  you can smell "republican" and "democrat" flop-sweat.  note that the number here is greater than $1 billion.  annually.the stench...........it gags.

it is passing strange that the fbi has not 'cracked' the phone of thomas matthew crooks, of failed-assassination fame.remember when the fbi said they were the premier crime-fighting entity in the world?remember when the fbi was clean as the driven snow cleaner than the mafia?huh.

states lose "who runs treasury" battle





 a fed "judge" named engelmeyer prohibited the secretary of the treasury from accessing treasury information and data very late last friday night/saturday morning.  we'll give him the benefit of the doubt and suggest that he was dead drunk when he signed the tro.aside from the sec/treas, he also prohibited "political appointees" from access.(following relies on shipwrecked crew's x account relayed by wauck) today he was reversed in 90++% of his drunk-order.  1)  there is no distinction between "civil servants" and "political appointees," said a sober (biden!) judge.  2)  there is no "irreparable harm" shown, nor alleged.  there may be "risk," but that doesn't trigger a tro.  3)  "special government employees" (the doge boyzzzz) and "employees of other departments" will remain banned until a final order is issued this friday.based on the wording of today's judgment, it's likely that the doge boyzzzz will be back in business on saturday morning (while the usual bureaucrats are sleeping in) and a number of states have just blown a few hundred thousand dollars on stupid.  but they're democrats, so "stupid" is their middle name.

heavy metals in sheboygan & mke valley?





wisconsin energy (wisconsin electric) brags about its battery storage facilities in sheboygan and milwaukee's industrial valley.should they?... days after one of the world’s largest lithium ion battery storage facilities burst into flames in monterey county, researchers found alarmingly high concentrations of heavy metals at a nearby estuary that is home to several endangered species.the concentration of nickel, manganese and cobalt measured on the surface of the soil is hundreds to thousands of times as much as the levels in the surface soil prior to the fire or compared with levels measured deeper in the soil.san josé state’s soil samples suggest there could be long-term environmental and health effects from the toxic blaze… --quoted at aoshqmilwaukee and state taxpayers have already spent millions cleaning up the industrial valley.  so why not spend several millions more when that bunch of batteries spontaneously combusts?we can call it "death by green."

"overhead"?  no.  theft.





 cutting to the chase here, trump now requires 'medical research' grant-takers to limit their "indirect expense" (overhead) charges to 15%.this is not "chopping research so millions will die die die!!"  this is taking away the catered lunches and dinners, fleets of secretaries, limousines, first-class airfare, dozens of "conferences" in exotic locations, pretty buildings and primo office furnishings. who's hardest hit by this?  you guessed right.  harvard's fun and frolics were chewing up about $36 billion.  the sick people?  they got the hind-most, about $17 billion.

fbi leaked ice raid info





this outfit has been seriously evil ever since j edgar (gay-boy) hoover. ...there was a very disturbing article in the los angeles times,
 warning criminal aliens of a pending ice operation sweep that was 
coming to the la area.  the source for the advanced tip-off were 
indicated within the reporting to be fbi officials in washington dc.
today, it appears that dept of homeland security secretary kristi noem is confirming the leak came from the fbi...the new fbi building that trump wants should be built at gitmo, and everyone in the dc facility should be transported there wholesale.

good to have sundance around to remind us that while doge may or may not have info on you, they certainly weren't the first. ...an fbi whistleblower came forth to inform rep jim jordan and rep matt
 gaetz that the fbi maintains a workspace inside the law firm of perkins
 coie.  {direct rumble link}
in response to a letter sent by rep. matt gaetz and jim jordan, perkins coie, the legal arm of the dnc and hillary clinton, admitted they have been operating an fbi workspace in their washington d.c. office since 2012....iow, perkins, coie clerks, lawyers, and partners had access to the fbi's files on every american since 2012.do you trust a bunch of political-hack lawyers who work for the democrat national committee with your info?well, they have it.

bidenomics for cars





a friend who recently moved from full-time to part-time employment, and who took social security to make up for the lost earned income, complained to me that 'it's not enough'.  what looked very nice only 8 months ago has turned to "not enough."yah, we know about bidenomics.  but here's another reminder.remember when you could buy a nice 'certified' used car for about $15-$18k?  that was a long time ago.  what you see on this chart is the wholesale price average.  add about $3k for the retail price.

signs of the (secular) times





this from an essay on the necessity of christianity that wauck dug up.  we've only excerpted the punchlines; the discussion previous to this graf is worth reading for context and nuance.... in germany, protesters are now beaten by the police for protesting against genocide as the protests are framed as being “anti-semitic”. in france, the ceo of telegram was arrested for refusing to abide by demands for censorship under the moral argument that “content moderation” is required to fight criminality. in britain, the freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and freedom to protest have been criminalised to fight “hate” without a clear definition or consistent implementation of the laws. nato argues that weapons are the path to peace in ukraine, while the eu openly punishes member states attempting to restore diplomacy and restart negotiations with russia as this allegedly appeases and emboldens russia. collective punishment is permitted under the vague assumption that the entire population contributes to some extent economically or culturally to “putin’s war machine”. germany thus makes a moral case for even seizing the private belongings of tourists due to their nationality. unthinkable practices like legalising the theft of a nation’s sovereign funds are permitted under the guise of helping the victim. in the us, the democratic party argues democracy can only be preserved by voting for their candidate, and even sabotaging candidates from their own party as the new leaders should be selected by a well-intentioned elite and not elected by the uninformed public. in germany, the political-media elites are openly discussing the need to ban the main opposition party altogether as it allegedly does not conform to liberal democratic values. humanitarianism no longer constrains the use of force, but is instead used to legitimise the use of force and exempt the west from abiding by international law....europe is in the advanced stages of its demise, but the united states has the same cancer.  here, it's beyond "nascent," but not yet terminal.why is that? ...the moral arguments made in society and by our political leaders do not have any solid grounding and are not linked to anything permanent. anything can be put into laws, but without a shared moral foundation, these laws will rely excessively on coercion. as our most sacred values are now contested under the new moral relativism, should we question the durability of secular morality in terms of the ability to provide the foundation for a cohesive society?...doh.  we are seeing child mutilation, child murders (called "abortion"), a wide variety of publicly-practiced and -flaunted perversions, and many government actions which are contrary to natural (and constitutional) law--all from "our betters" on the east and west coasts.perhaps the election of a vaguely-religious president who retains the values of the ancien regime will be a turning point.if not, things will be ugly, and soon.

a reminder about usaid





sundance highlights the really important part of the usaid problem.....there are many ‘revelations’ certain to surface, including how the usaid
 priorities included the control of information on the internet through 
their partnerships in the private sector.  the larger objective was 
always information control and manipulating political outcomes both 
domestically and abroad. that is the impetus for the usaid spending.... ...the senate held oversight, and they knew exactly what was going on, 
who was doing the orchestration of the agenda, and what the priorities 
of the usaid operation was all about.
senator marco rubio sat on the senate foreign relations committee.  
secretary of state marco rubio advanced with a confirmation vote of 
99-0.  secretary rubio now controls usaid.
to understand the issues as they are now surfacing it is very important to retain clear context.
usaid was a sub-silo, a child of the parent organization, the cia.  
the cia controlled the big picture, and usaid was the institution to 
carry out the objective.
when you see a controversial issue within the usaid operation 
reaching sunlight, always remember it is the cia behind it.  when usaid 
targeted a foreign government for removal, it was the cia behind it.  
when usaid engaged with domestic and foreign media to control 
mis-dis-malinformation, it is the cia behind it.  the cia is defining 
the information.
when usaid pressured various global news agencies and organized 
advertiser boycotts against information sources averse to the interests 
of usaid, it is the cia behind it.  when usaid funds the clinton 
foundation, or mccain institute, or any of the cause celebre’ ngos you 
now see in the headlines, it is factually the cia behind them.  when 
usaid funds media for influence control, it is the cia behind it....so when the media yammers about "humanitarian aid", they are covering for the cia--who paid the media to censor what the cia did not want known--and to promote "news" which was what the cia did want known.so..........what did you "know" or "not know" about covid-19, for example?hmmmmm??

another new york jackass-in-black





one suspects that this "judge" ruled this way as a joke, and that on monday, he'll say "fooled you, bert!!" and reverse or rescind it.on the other hand, he's a new york judge.... a manhattan-based district judge has just removed secretary of treasury 
scott bessent from his authority over the treasury department; blocked 
any political appointee from accessing records within the treasury 
department; blocked any “special appointee” of president trump from 
records within treasury; and demanded that all information previously 
extracted be destroyed...."well, then," you say, "the judge heard the arguments and so ruled based on those."wrong, sucker! new york judge paul engelmayer just forbade all political appointees — including treasury secretary scott bessent — from accessing dept. of treasury data, all based on blueanon conspiracy theories!!

those theories couldn't be challenged because the order was ex parte — meaning trump's lawyers weren't warned, and couldn't weigh in. only democrat attorneys general were allowed to argue. if that moron "judge" was focused solely on making judges look as bad as possible, he is succeeding.  this will not go well for him, nor any other judge, federal, state, or local.  so is anarchy the real goal here?hmmmmm.

re:  uscc "catholic charities".....what we said!





 the author here came to the same conclusion we did, for good reason:  it's the only conclusion.... the catholic church teaches that it is a mortal sin to facilitate a 
mortal sin. for example, if someone knowingly and willfully assists in 
facilitating an abortion by providing counseling, shelter, or driving 
the mother to an abortion clinic, the enabler is guilty of sin. the sin 
is even more egregious if the facilitator financially benefits. it is 
blood money.    similar to the driver who committed a mortal sin by taking the 
expectant mother to an abortion clinic, the church’s actions 
facilitating illegal immigration are committed with “full knowledge and 
deliberate consent.” making the matter even worse, the church is accepting billions in what could reasonably be labeled blood money....did you write a polite letter to  your bishop about this?better yet:  if you did so, what was his reply?

$50 billion/year in fraud entitlements





 that "i was told" means there's some squish-room in the numbers, but....... yesterday, i was told that there are currently over $100b/year of entitlements payments to individuals with no ssn or even a temporary id number. if accurate, this is extremely suspicious. 

when i asked if anyone at treasury had a rough guess for what percentage of that number is unequivocal and obvious fraud, the consensus in the room was about half, so $50b/year or $1b/week!!...elon musk/xthere's a reason that social security, medicare, and medicaid are going bankrupt.  that reason is government employee laziness and incompetence--plus--in many cases--outright malicious cooperation in fraud.  (yes, there are other reasons such as under-taxation in the case of medicare.)further, musk tells us that there are agreed-upon changes which will be made. - require that all outgoing government payments have a payment categorization code, which is necessary in order to pass financial audits. this is frequently left blank, making audits almost impossible. - all payments must also include a rationale for the payment in the comment field, which is currently left blank. importantly, we are not yet applying any judgment to this rationale, but simply requiring that some attempt be made to explain the payment more than nothing! - the do-not-pay list of entities known to be fraudulent or people who are dead or are probable fronts for terrorist organizations or do not match congressional appropriations must actually be implemented and not ignored. also, it can currently take up to a year to get on this list, which is far too long. this list should be updated at least weekly, if not daily.

the above super obvious and necessary changes are being implemented by existing, long-time career government employees...how will actblue survive this?answer:  it won't.

wars and rumors of wars.....





the usg expects that there will be "kinetic" action on the drug-front. ...flight tracking data from flightradar24
 shows a us air force rc-135v/w rivet joint reconnaissance aircraft 
conducted its second signals intelligence (sigint) operation near 
cartel-controlled territories within mexico this past week. the sigint 
mission coincides with remarks from us border czar tom homan, who warned
 on thursday that he "expects" a hot confrontation between the us 
military and drug cartels. flightradar24 data shows the 
usaf rc-135v/w rivet joint taking off from offutt air force base 
in omaha on friday evening. the spy plane arrived at the heavily 
fortified southern border hours later and flew a sigint mission in us 
airspace from el paso, texas, to the big bend ranch state park, located 
in west texas. ...juarez is across the river from el paso, home of the army's fort bliss.  going west from there, the white sands missile range borders army's ft. huachuca (in az).watch the activity in the state of arizona, as it is rumored that the cartels have..........ahhhhhh..........quite a bit of..........ummmnnnnhhhh.........influence........in that state and in many of its cities.

trump v. u of st thomas in minn.





the university of st thomas in minnesota has been left-ish for decades.  now trump cuts off some of their free money for racism.  maybe ust will learn something from this. the department of education on friday canceled $15 million in federal 
grants that were used to fund diversity programs at three universities... ...at the university of st. thomas, a "cultural assessment" quiz asked 
teachers whether they "understand how white privilege and racism affect 
me and others," according to grant applications reviewed by the washington free beacon....yes.  normal people understand racism when they see it.  and it's the giant red flashing light in dei/marxist programs such as the one at ust.

rancho palos verdes:  get a clue!





at least one resident of rancho palos verdes in california wants us taxpayers to bail her out of a problem. residents of a california coastal community are begging for federal aid to stop a landslide from pushing their ritzy homes into the ocean.residents of rancho palos verdes - which is the wealthiest retirement community in the us and also votes overwhelming democrat - have been grappling with volatile land movement for six decades.but unprecedented rainfall in 2023 and 2024 has created a dire situation, as landslide motion has accelerated and expanded to areas that were previously considered low risk. ...umnnhhh.....when you are living in a landslide area, it might be smart to pack up and get the hell outta there.  you've only had sixty years to think about it, honey. ask newsom for the money, not the rest of us.

after scoring $500 million/year (2013-2022) from the virulent-disease-infested usaid......things came to a halt.it's possible that catholic relief services will dump half its staff into learn to code school.... "we anticipate that we will be a much smaller overall organization by the

trump saves wi taxpayer money!!





he dumped that 'roadside ev charger' program into the dustbin of history.  and that will save money for wisconsin taxpayers!... "the new leadership of the department of transportation (u.s. dot) has
 decided to review the policies underlying the implementation of the 
nevi formula program. accordingly, the current nevi formula program 
guidance dated june 11, 2024, and all prior versions of this guidance 
are rescinded,” biondi wrote.
“as result of the rescission of the nevi formula program guidance, 
fhwa is also immediately suspending the approval of all state electric 
vehicle infrastructure deployment plans for all fiscal years. therefore,
 effective immediately, no new obligations may occur under the nevi 
formula program until the updated final nevi formula program guidance is
 issued and new state plans are submitted and approved,” the official 
continued....among others hit:  kwiktrip.  now they'll have to sell more doughnuts.
