a member's perspective   "during my 30 years in banking, i have been a member of many chambers based upon the state and town my branch or branches were based in.  while i have found value in the business connections that i made at each of those chambers, none, in my opinion, have compared to the close-knit community that exists within the tri-town chamber of commerce.  while we cover three towns, the connections are powerful and far-reaching.  someone always knows of someone who can help you with your business.  i especially love the collaborative events held by the women’s link.  women supporting women, i always find these events inspiring.  most importantly, as a member, i have enjoyed doing business with other chamber members and have formed friendships over the last nine years that i truly appreciate both from a personal and business perspective."  carie bailey, bluestone bank   more from our members
