welcome to the links at lighthouse sound




not often is a golf course architect provided a site with so much natural diversity. our goal from the beginning was to create a course that allows mother nature to show off her beauty.
lighthouse sound offers great variety in terms of visual excitement and strategy. as often as possible we tried to take advantage of the expansive views of the bay and ocean city skyline. ten holes border the pristine marshlands found within the 1,000 acre site while others are framed with mature hardwoods.
together, this collection of holes will hopefully provide a challenging and memorable golf experience. we hope you will come back often to test your skill and experience the exceptional beauty of lighthouse sound.
