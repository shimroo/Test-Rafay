so… its been a year since the last post on here. sorry! i've been busy with a lot of life events and changes. to try and make it easier and maybe encourage myself to post more things online, i've decided to split xanthic.net off as my artwork focused site and have set up a new site for me to post about my life… the biggest thing happening right now is my move to portland, oregon and my home renovation, thus the slight focus in the name of the new site - xanthicasa. anyway, i'll still try to post some new artwork here soon. i've actually got a bit of a collection of unfinished and close-to-finished misfits that i'd love to complete soon and share with the world. in the meantime, though, i hope you'll enjoy a peek into some of the other things overtaking my life at the moment over at www.xanthicasa.com.

trying hard to post more often... we'll see what happens. :p i've got quite a backlog of unfinished misfits pieces that i've been meaning to finish up and post so that i can move onto new ideas. so far i've managed to finish up two more pieces and here they are!

mary – the misfits


february 21, 2017
       in art, misfits





i've always had a slight fascination with statues of the virgin mary. they're quite often elaborately decorated with what seems like hundreds of pounds of jewelry and amazing crowns. for the misfit incarnation, i wanted to pay homage to the neon lighting that is often used to illuminate externally housed statues, as well as a nod to the amazing givenchy septum jewelry riccardo tisci has introduced in recent runways.

lucy – the misfits

i've toyed around with the idea of a painting involving an encephalectomy for years, probably all the way back to 2001 when i was in my teens and watched hannibal the movie. the dinner scene was one of the more memorable scenes to me, and i'm glad to finally get this image expressed and out of my head.
