aztec shops oaxaca culinary immersion
two chefs from sdsu dining and two from 386 hospitality at snapdragon stadium were part of an sdsu delegation to oaxaca in 2023. they trained with some of the most renowned chefs in the region, with a plan to bring back new, oaxacan-inspired recipes and techniques to sdsu as part of an expanded menú azteca. the trip was designed to significantly differentiate sdsu’s culinary offerings while also contributing to the university’s mission to transcend borders.
