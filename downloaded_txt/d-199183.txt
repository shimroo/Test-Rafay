friends only

strangeletprove yourself worthy.tell me who you are and how you found me.i will rarely approve nude accounts only, as i post both in one because i am not shy, nor aspiring to anything political.this is my personal journal. you aren't missing out on any extra nudity.this is the woman inside the body, good and bad.

moving fund donations


jun. 2nd, 2009 at 2:40 am



 


strangeleta couple people mentioned that they would like to kick a few bucks my way to help fund my move, so i thought i'd put this out there in case i have a mysteriously rich friend who'd like to be my anon sugar daddy. or if any of you would just like to give me $$ because you love me and are anxious to have me back home. every little bit helps! :)

nobody panic (gustav)


aug. 28th, 2008 at 3:36 am



 


strangeletgustav?! wtf is with that name!?but if any of you nola peeps need to venture my way in a few days, i have a papa san and a floor. i also have a dog who prefers the ladies, but if any guys need crash space just be sure you're cool with dogs. especially important for my austin kreweif you have floor space available should this turn to the worst, feel free to offer it up to me, i'll place good people with you.also, my phone service has already started to falter. i would highly suggest that y'all text me if you need to talk to me. william tried calling me 3 times tonight already before he got through, and the message "the network is busy" was the same thing everyone got in august '05. i can't think of any other reason for the problem. i can call out with no problem though.i refuse to give up my 504 area code. suck it.
