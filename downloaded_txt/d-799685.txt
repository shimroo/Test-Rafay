cliche paris  


so i'm having culture shock issues and hating it here - but only when i'm not moving.i think the pinnacle of my trip thus far was the pair of $1500 designer shoes i found at the flea market today. they're gently worn and from "last season" so i snagged them for 20 euros. and i've been looking for a pair of neutral heels forever. c'est bien!so here are some photos...i feel like a chanel model caught in headlights here.avec ma amie mindy. we met in paris. it's like a romantic movie. except without the romance.giverny: standing on monet's famous bridge in his water lily garden.les x-men! tres bien!

literatti  


i've decided i enjoy a mixed metaphor as much as anyone - especially when it's mixed with gin.studying for my poetry final, which is immediately after my french final. then i get to write five papers by thursday while studing for my aristotle final on wednesday.bookworm, i must be. but a bookworm with gin.

oops.  


sorry, guys. you scored as dr gaius baltar. you have betrayed humanity, for a blonde.  however you'd rather people learnt to just get past that.  after all, you never meant wipe out the human race.  luckily you are cleverer than everyone else, so no one will ever know.  even though they look at you with suspicion behind their eyes.dr gaius baltar81%lt. kara thrace (starbuck)81%capt. lee adama (apollo)63%tom zarek63%commander william adama56%number 656%cpo galen tyrol44%lt. sharon valerii (boomer)38%president laura roslin38%col. saul tigh13%</td>what new battlestar galactica character are you?created with quizfarm.com

with warm wishes, richard ford  


southern pulitzer prize winners are nice. they're also amusing, warm and courteous.richard ford signed a copy of his short story collections. i picked it up because one story is set in paris and i'm going there this summer. another story is set in montana and my mother was born and raised in montana. i told him the sportswriter took my innocence - because it did. i made the mistake of reading it when i was about thirteen.the true highlight was meeting my senior honors fiction thesis adviser, john biguenet. his collection of short stories, the torturer's apprentice, showed me new yorker fiction needn't be dull, inaccessible to the average person nor fit the literati mold. i'm excited to work with him in the fall. he was also lovely, like ford.now, i suppose i should write. but a french test tomorrow tells me i shouldn't be writing in english but in french...
