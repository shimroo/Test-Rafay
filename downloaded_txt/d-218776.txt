 what is changing at comicsoncdrom...






we are currently re-designing our entire line of
								comicsoncdrom golden age comics.
please keep your eyes here for announcemts in spring
								2007 about our entire new line of comicsoncdrom which will have larger
								collections of comic books than our previous cdroms and with easier
								navigation..
we will also be adding many new titles from the golden
								age of comics as well as huge libraries of classic comic strips from 1904-1950
								 
 


during this transitional period we are not offering our
						cdrom product because we know you will like the new cdrom's better when they
						come out. so please check out our download site at the links in the column to
						the right.. we have 100's of great classic golden age comics available in high
						resolution for your reading pleasure.



 

meanwhile, we have uploaded a couple of free golden
								age comics downloads for you
this week we have a complete spacehawk comic story
								from target comics by basil wolverton to download. the download is an adobe
								acrobat file.
this is an adobe acrobat file and
								is 6mb.





also this week we have a
								gallery of jungle comics covers with art by golden
								age comic artist dan zolnerowich at our companion comic history site.
download them to use as your desktop graphic or just
								collect new covers each week.
