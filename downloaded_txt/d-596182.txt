domestic violencedomestic violence is more than just physical abuse—it's a complex web of behaviors designed to control and intimidate through fear, manipulation, isolation, financial coercion, and sexual and verbal abuse. it's a pervasive issue that affects everyone regardless of age, race, gender, or income level.

the impact of domestic violence is far-reaching: in the past year alone, incidents of domestic violence rose by 4.7% in memphis and 2.7% in shelby county.  nearly half of all calls to law enforcement are related to domestic violence.  a staggering 70% of inmates were exposed to domestic violence during their childhood.we operate the only 24-hour emergency domestic violence shelter in shelby county. every day, through shelter, education, and advocacy, we strive to break this cycle of violence.
