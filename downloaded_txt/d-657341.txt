why am i making bankers rich when i can get a piece of the pie?

like a bank, but with better service, nicer tellers and smaller lines. you should have seen my smile when we got a share bonus in our account. just for banking at servus and having our house mortgage (excellent rate too) over $600 bucks. you gotta ask yourself, why am i making bankers rich, when i can get a piece of the pie?

the staff here are always friendly

overall, i've had a great experience with servus over the last 15+ years of being a member.

no bank has ever treated me as well as servus has

the employees at bonnie doon branch are to be commended. they have gone out of their way to help me navigate online banking for business. i am so grateful for all that they did.

always friendly and helpful

i have lost track of how many of the staff actually know my name! and if someone does't have the skill or knowledge to help me, they sure can find someone who does.
ââââ google review




great service from a lady named tia

she took extra time and went a little above and beyond to help me out, explain things and get the exact stuff i needed to get done. really appreciated it and couldn't have been more happy. exactly what good customer service should be like.
