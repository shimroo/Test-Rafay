dental patient reviews
service worth talking about






"i absolutely love this office. i came to them for a second opinion on dental pain after my last
                        dentist was giving me the run around. they saw me right away, found the problem, and fixed it."

 michaela m.
                    



"rocky river dental is amazing! dr. farr and his staff are so nice and they make you feel at home! i
                        detest going to the dentist, but iâm sure that i wonât have any problem going back for cleanings,
                        etc.â
