						find seeds now					


						february is the perfect month to begin your seed search. why february? right now, companies have their entire catalog of seeds in stock. as the winter goes by, they usually do not restock their inventories for the current year.

years ago, every major seed company mailed seed catalogs to your door right after the holidays. this has been replaced by the ease of online shopping for your seeds. nowadays, we sit by the fireside with a mug of hot chocolate and browse online catalogs on our computer, cell phone, or ipad. then, we can immediately order our seed selections. what can be easier!?

backyard birds in winter 












 











 




						hungry birds at the feeder					


						this is the toughest time of the year for backyard birds. natural food supplies are low and continue to become sparser. in addition, food supplies may be covered in a heavy blanket of snow. to help them get through the remainder of the winter months, homeowners and birdwatchers put up a bird feeder or two to help our fine feathered friends survive until spring arrives.

each species of bird has certain seed preferences. if you have lots of different birds, a mixed variety of seeds works well. for others, consult our bird seed feeder chart to ensure your favorite birds are well-fed.

forcing blooms indoors 












 











 




						spring blooms indoors					


						nothing brightens up a gloomy winter day more than spring flowers blooming in your living room. and with very little effort, you can make it happen. forsythias and pussy willows are good examples. but, you can force many more bushes and shrubs to bloom indoors. so, put on your coat and hat. then, go outside and cut a few branches off of your favorite spring-blooming shrubs.

seed germination tests 












 











 




						ensure your seeds will sprout!					


						did you save seeds from your garden plants last year to use this season? it's a great way to grow plants you have had success with in the past. do you have leftover store-bought seed packets? while the snow's still flying, it is the perfect time to perform seed germination tests to ensure a successful start to the upcoming season.

planting by phases of the moon 












 











 




						plant by waxing versus waning moon					


						the concept of planting by phases of the moon has been practiced since ancient times. using this gardening technique, you sow the seeds of some plants during a waxing moon. others are planted during a waning moon. gardeners who use this planting technique swear by it. find out more.
