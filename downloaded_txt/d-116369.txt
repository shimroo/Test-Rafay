discover the delap differencediscover the delap difference
delap real estate was founded in 2005 by dennis delap, a well-known and respected realtor throughout the pioneer valley since 1986.  when dennis passed away in 2012, his wish that delap real estate continue as a cooperative office was born. delap real estate is the only cooperatively owned local real estate office in the valley.  our realtors work together for the good of the whole, all having a voice in how decisions are made with an opportunity to invest in a profit- sharing system that supports our office and our individual agents.  we are a community minded team, not only in our business model but also in the ways we give back to our community.
