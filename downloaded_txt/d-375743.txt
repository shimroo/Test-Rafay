prestigious




since the mid 1980’s, the name prestige mills has been synonymous with excellence in the wholesale carpet industry. our commitment to outstanding customer service, attention to detail and ability to offer the finest and most unique catalog of products from countless territories around the globe are what distinguish us from our competition.


we specialize in the creation of unique designs in “old-world” weaving techniques and have gained a reputation for providing a class of carpets not previously available in the market. our intimate relationships with a myriad of specialty mills around the world grant us exclusivity to many high-end niche products of various weaves, textures and constructions.
