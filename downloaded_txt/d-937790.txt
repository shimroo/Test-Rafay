standard silver mirror's antique mirrors and tinted mirrors 

silver mirror has traditionally been used in the smaller rooms in the home with great effect. with a range of colours, heated pads and bevelled edges, we measure, supply and install the correct mirror for the area that you are working with. 
the quality of modern flat glass is next to perfection therefore the quality of mirror that is now produced is clear and without distortion. antique mirror reflects a time when mirror production was not as advanced, the mirror had inherent flaws which would lead to each mirror having a character all of its own.




glass uv bonding

uv glass bonding allows us to bond glass to glass and glass to metal, marble and wood. one advantage of uv bonding is the clean application and a finished bond that is stronger than the glass itself. the enhanced clarity and ultra clean lines is especially noticeable on exposed polished edges and thicker glass such as tabletops. 
designing your own uv bonded furniture has never been simpler or looked better.
we can bond a shelf on an existing mirror or splash-back, we also offer an on site service allowing us to repair or bond your own glass.  




glass splash-back's

reverse painted glass is an extremely versatile product, creating a dramatic effect to any bathroom, shower or kitchen installation. reverse painted glass can be painted in virtually any colour to compliment your dã©cor and can be used as an alternative to tiles or to refresh existing table tops or works surfaces. 
we use low iron glass as standard when making our glass splash-backs, this removes the green tint from normal glass guaranteeing the best possible colour match available.
