my name 
		is renée 
		newman. 
i'm a 
		gemologist (gg, gia), lecturer, writer and author of 14 books on gems 
		and jewelry. besides 
		providing details about my background and my books, this site offers 
		information on gems, jewelry, 
appraisers, 
		buying and selling. my
        goal is to provide consumers and jewelry professionals
        with unbiased, affordable information on how to buy, evaluate and appreciate gems
        and jewelry. but the consumer principles i stress in my gem books
        can also be applied to other subject areas such as health. in both
        cases, you should be informed, deal with competent professionals and get
        proper documentation. for more information go to my osteoporosis 
		prevention website 
www.avoidboneloss.com.

my overall mission is to promote consumer issues, education, ethics, 
		good health and the 
		arts. 





what's new with newman?  

diamonds: their 
		history, sources, qualities and benefits. unlike my other books, this is a hardbound, large format (9" x 
		11") book. this lavishly illustrated guide features hundreds of 
		photos, maps and diagrams and covers everything from mining, geographic 
		sources, cutting, antique diamond jewelry, price factors and manmade 
		diamonds to the romantic histories of some of the world's most valuable 
		diamonds. click here for more information:

		 



a  
		revised and updated 8th edition of my 
diamond ring buying guide with 131 
		new photographs, added chapters on silver and alternative metals, new 
		information on lab-grown diamonds and diamond treatments, and updated 
		information throughout the book. unlike the diamond handbook 
		which is geared to trade professionals, the diamond ring buying guide is 
		directed to consumers and new jewelry salespeople.
