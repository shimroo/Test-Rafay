please
                      read -- pet food recalls  there are still tainted pet food
                      products being sold.  
                      a friend's companion was sickened by a product
                      that has not even
                      been formally recalled, although numerous consumer reports
                      have been made.

                      blog for news of recent
                      recalls,
