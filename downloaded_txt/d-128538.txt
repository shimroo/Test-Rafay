entry-master uses inovonics for wireless door control. 
there is no need running new wiring/cabling.







hosted solution - the full-powered system v operated from the "cloud" - this is the same web-based solution, but all of the main operating hardware and software resides on the internet "cloud," and is thus affordable and easy to manage.
        

system v - our powerful web-based solution.
        
        the system v card access control system was designed for medium to large sized systems (10+ doors, 60+ card readers, 5000+ cardholders) where volume of card use traffic is high, and instant response times are critical. this system is now scaleable to allow more affordable installation in smaller sites. 
				



security cameras - our system v security system has cctv and dvr capabilities - you can add security cameras to an existing ems system v or we can install security cameras to your non-ems system.
