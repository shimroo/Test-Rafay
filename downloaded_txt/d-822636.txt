congregational church and the united church of christ
we are a community of people, friends and neighbors and families, seeking a relationship with god and with one another.  many of our folks come from a religious tradition other than united church of christ.  in some ways we are outsiders welcoming people, seeking to make connections.  we are progressive and we are people who perhaps have been stung or even shunned for our belief that god is loving and accepting of people who may be different from us.
