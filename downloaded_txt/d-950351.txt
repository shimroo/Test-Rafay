just two more days of the arctic freeze

the temperature at inner drive technology whq has gone up all day, just surpassing yesterday's afternoon high of -11.3°c:

of course, yesterday's actual high was -10.3°c, at midnight, and we won't hit that again until tomorrow. but by friday we'll be able to walk outside without losing extremities, and by sunday it'll even be above freezing. and then, in 10 days: spring!
there is one advantage to arctic air over chicago, though: the air is really clear.






punzun ltd: 25 years (this iteration)

punzun ltd. (an illinois corporation doing business as inner drive technology) turns 25 today! i set up the corporation before i moved back to illinois from new york, so that i could take either a contract or full-time job when i got here.
i can scarcely believe i've been back nearly 25 years.
and 25 years ago—this was months before bush v gore, remember—i would not have believed that these would be the news stories i'd care about in 2025:

the unelected winger specifically tasked with destroying our soft-power agency for international development is, no surprised, a christianist fundamentalist.
one of the software blogs i read, the daily wtf, took space out of its usual lineup today to castigate elon musk's disastrous technical implementations in service of destroying the us government: "musk's 'algorithm' really is...a 5-step plan of bumper-sticker business speak that ranges from fatuous to incompetent...."
ezra klein talks about how the right thinks of most people as "npcs"—non-player characters in the gaming world.

finally, on this presidents day, let's return to washington's farewell address for just a moment:

all obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and associations, under whatever plausible character, with the real design to direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and action of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental principle, and of fatal tendency. they serve to organize faction, to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put, in the place of the delegated will of the nation, the will of a party, often a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community; and, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the public administration the mirror of the ill-concerted and incongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plans digested by common counsels, and modified by mutual interests.
however combinations or associations of the above description may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely, in the course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people, and to usurp for themselves the reins of government; destroying afterwards the very engines, which have lifted them to unjust dominion.
towards the preservation of your government, and the permanency of your present happy state, it is requisite, not only that you steadily discountenance irregular oppositions to its acknowledged authority, but also that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its principles, however specious the pretexts.

can't say what made me go back to that source today...

i threw a party for a few friends last night. cassie's friend butters came by and ensconced herself on the couch for most of the night. cassie, for her part, got oo-mox from one of the guests:

cassie has spent most of today sleeping, as i would like to be doing. at some point i may even get the motivation to read. first i have to tweak a feature of weather now that will help re-import all the data i mentioned yesterday.





nihilists on the march

david brooks breaks down the anti-populist behavior of the "populists" in the republican party:

if america elected a populist as president, you would expect him to devote his administration to addressing these inequities, to boosting the destinies of working-class americans. but that’s not what president trump is doing. he seems to have no plans to narrow the education chasms, no plans to narrow the health outcome chasms or the family structure chasms. he has basically no plans to revive the communities that have been decimated by postindustrialization.
why is that? the simplest answer is that trump really seems not to give a crap about the working class. trump is not a populist. he campaigns as a populist, but once he has power, he is the betrayer of populism.
what’s going on here is not a working-class revolt against the elites. all i see is one section of the educated elite going after another section of the educated elite. this is like a civil war in a fancy prep school in which the sleazy kids are going after the pretentious kids.
here’s the essence of trumpism: it’s to be blithely unconcerned that people without a college degree die about eight years sooner or that hundreds of thousands of africans might now die of aids but to go into paroxysms of moral panic because of who competes in a high school girls’ swim meet.
sure, the upper reaches of the federal work force are generally left or center left, as you’d expect from a group that possesses a plenitude of advanced degrees. but they are also mostly nonpolitical patriots who often work 60-hour weeks to keep us safe, to save lives, to make america work. this is a complexity the trumpists seem incapable of contemplating. they are people who would destroy your home because they don’t like your lawn sign.

anne applebaum agrees in principle, but frets that these nihilist idiots are perpetrating the same kind of regime change in the us that others like them have managed in venezuela and hungary.
the next election is 625 days away. that is a very long time.
 





new weather now release

i've added a couple of new features to weather now, including a view of the best weather in the world. more usefully, i've added a release notes page.
this weekend, i plan to to rebuild the gazetteer, and import all of the usgs records—about 900,000 places. this will also mean rebuilding the search index in the basic tier. the free tier is great for testing, but it only lets me index 10,000 items at a time. even if the free tier could support 900,000 records, i don't want to hit "rebuild" 90 times.
i'll also be setting up a donate button, for obvious reasons.
enjoy.





one last cold snap coming in

winter ends two weeks from tomorrow, but climate science and meteorology can only study nature, not command it. that explains why, despite ample sunshine, the temperature at idtwhq has stayed around -7°c since it leveled out this morning, and promises to shed another 8-10 degrees tonight. then we're in for a few blasts of cold interspersed with warm days and some snow here and there for about a week before it consistently warms up.
elsewhere in the cold, cold world:

the senate confirmed the unqualified and probably demented robert f kennedy, jr., as hhs secretary on a 52-48 vote, with mitch mcconnell (r-ky) crossing the aisle to vote against him.
in yet another orwellian display of up-is-downism, elon musk and his army of crybabies have started labeling ordinary journalism as "doxxing."
josh marshall says the oafpotus used his order to pause the corruption prosecution of new york mayor eric adams to essentially become the unelected mayor of new york—at least until everyone ordered to file the motion to do so has quit.
michael tomasky urges democrats to hit "economics, culture, and media" in order to take back the legislature next year. trissie mcmillan cottom agrees.
a jury convicted former illinois house speaker mike madigan (d-chicago) of 10 counts of corruption but acquitted him or deadlocked on about half of the charges. (who says only illinois governors get all the fun of public corruption?)

finally, google has suspended comments on the label "gulf of america" because of all the one-star reviews people gave the body of water. i realize google just follows the usgs on american place names (same as weather now), but still, they could have slow-walked it (as weather now is doing).





a cyber attack in plain sight

security expert bruce schneier can't believe the damage that elon musk's team have already done to us national security, and worries it will get much, much worse:

in the span of just weeks, the us government has experienced what may be the most consequential security breach in its history—not through a sophisticated cyberattack or an act of foreign espionage, but through official orders by a billionaire with a poorly defined government role. and the implications for national security are profound.
what makes this situation unprecedented isn’t just the scope, but also the method of attack. foreign adversaries typically spend years attempting to penetrate government systems such as these, using stealth to avoid being seen and carefully hiding any tells or tracks. the chinese government’s 2015 breach of opm was a significant us security failure, and it illustrated how personnel data could be used to identify intelligence officers and compromise national security.
the treasury’s computer systems have such an impact on national security that they were designed with the same principle that guides nuclear launch protocols: no single person should have unlimited power. just as launching a nuclear missile requires two separate officers turning their keys simultaneously, making changes to critical financial systems traditionally requires multiple authorized personnel working in concert.
this approach, known as “separation of duties,” isn’t just bureaucratic red tape; it’s a fundamental security principle as old as banking itself. when your local bank processes a large transfer, it requires two different employees to verify the transaction. when a company issues a major financial report, separate teams must review and approve it. these aren’t just formalities—they’re essential safeguards against corruption and error. these measures have been bypassed or ignored. it’s as if someone found a way to rob fort knox by simply declaring that the new official policy is to fire all the guards and allow unescorted visits to the vault.
the implications for national security are staggering.

the oafpotus and his enablers have already crippled the united states internationally. how do republicans in congress not see this? does musk have to personally give vladimir putin a thumb drive with our nuclear codes before someone in the cult wakes up? 





not as much snow as we thought

i promised snow photos.
so far, it looks like we've gotten only about 25 mm of snow, though it continues to fall and will probably keep falling until the early morning. cassie and i went out around 1pm, and i gave her a bit of off-leash time in the courtyard:


that is a happy dog. and we're about to go out again, because she insists on metabolizing food and water.
tomorrow she gets to go to day camp and i get to go to my downtown office. one of us will have a lot more fun than the other.

i'm just noting a few things and moving on with my day:

pilot project brewing has announced plans for a second brewery/taproom in wrigleyville, just 500 meters from the addison red line station.
google maps turned 20 four days ago, and the guardian has a history of how it began.
microsoft will be retiring the (11-year-old) database apis that this build of the daily parker uses, so watch this space for news about a brand new daily parker experience this fall!

i'm planning to wrap up a new release of weather now this evening, too. i'll post snow photos when i do.





how much will we get?

we have a winter weather advisory until tomorrow at 3am, warning of "mixed precipitation" with snow accumulations of 75 to 150 mm. it has begun in earnest:

if i don't get so busy that i forget to do it, i'll snap another photo before the sun sets for comparison. right now we've gotten maybe 5 mm of snow, with the temperature holding steady around -2°c, about 3°c below normal. normal snowfall for february is 273 mm, so this shouldn't surprise anyone.
