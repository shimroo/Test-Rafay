 in the dominican
 republic provided a unique perspective focused on service learning, 
engaging in  community-based projects, and learning about another 
country's history, culture, and
 geography.
 “i learned from this trip that you can  learn so much from being 
immersed in a culture
 different than the one you live…that’s what i would tell students who 
can apply to this program,”
 said lovell, an alum with ba and ms degrees in community psychology. the
 dominican republic (dr) study abroad program is one of  many 
opportunities at depaul for students to engage directly in issues of 
sustainability and equity through community engagement and service 
learning. the short-term study abroad program began in 2015 and is set 
to embark upon its fifth iteration during winter quarter and spring 
break 2025. during the trip,  student experience centers on a 
partnership  
 with high school students at the centro regional estudios de
 alternativas rural (crear) in the mountainous town of rio limpio near 
the dr-haiti border. read more...
