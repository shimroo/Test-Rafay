we had a fabulous time. the scenery was breath taking. star gazing on the night with no moon was priceless.  touching a glacier, jumping into 'gin clear' water (fishing guides term), i could go on and on. thank you again.

thank you so much for all of your help and for planning us an amazing honeymoon. we have had a spectacular trip and have made so many memories - and the helicopter ride was one of the coolest things we've ever done.
