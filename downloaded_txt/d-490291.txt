the mac-hunter astronomical observing site




















this is a 

      unique amateur astronomical observing site consisting of five 

      observatories, each housing two astronomers and their telescopes.


        



this project is the 

      culmination of a dream of ten members of the  midlands astronomy club of 

      south carolina in a cooperative effort to build a communal dark sky 

      observing and astro-photography site.
