						anytime i can support a non chain hotel i’ll roll the dice. this hotel was great! right on the beach, charming room and easy to get to. room was clean and i enjoyed the retro mini fridge and microwave. we’ll definitely be staying there again in the future!

						our family really enjoyed our stay! from the time we arrived till we left. nice and clean facility, and the staff was awesome and very friendly! we especially enjoyed carol she was really nice and treated us like friends and was very accommodating. the motel is right on the beach and right beside jeanette pier and very beautiful! me and my wife enjoyed how quiet and peaceful this part of nags head was and look forward to coming back and using this motel!
