batter's box has moved!


     hi! joe from the site's engine room here. if you're reading this, you're on the new batter's box server (inside canada), and you don't have to do anything. i hope you noticed nothing, or at least didn't have too many difficulties with the switch. (for those interested: from linode in new jersey to ovh in quebec.)
