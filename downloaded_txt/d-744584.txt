this is a one-man site, so i tend to focus my limited time on information related to the mozilla web browser and tivos. of course, i will occasionally add information about other topics as i come across something interesting and not readily explained by other internet sites. 

what's new...

              if there is anyone out there left with a directivo, i updated the hacking article to use the dvrupgrade boot disk.  i also fixed a typo in the backported article at the bottom.

              i successfully upgraded my directivo to version 6.4a and gave the series 2 hacking how-to a much needed update. i also added a how-to for installing usb backported network drivers. enjoy!

            wohoo! second update of the year! :-) i have given up on tytool. it hasn't been updated in nearly 2 years. files i burned to dvd a while back just don't seem to work like they used to. i have added two new utilities on the tivo page that convert .ty files to .mpg much better. i also wrote up a general how-to for downloading and archiving your tv shows from your tivo without using tytool. r.i.p. tytool. also added a link to the hyperlinks section based on a recommendation from a reader. i only add sites that are unique and informative. sites that are mostly ads and contain very little original content will be ignored. if you know of a website that fits those requirements, you can find my e-mail address by clicking on the site info button to the left.
