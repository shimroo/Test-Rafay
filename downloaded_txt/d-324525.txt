absolutely fabulous“stayed here while visiting dingle for few days. spotlessly clean. big spacious room. best breakfast i’ve ever had in any hotel or b and b. nothing was a problem to bernie or her staff. felt like we were staying in a 5 star hotel. mins from dingle village. highly recommended” rated 5 stars— 2020, tripadvisor



wonderful“we had a fantastic stay in bambury's guesthouse. bernie was a lovely host - very warm and welcoming. even before we arrived she was happy to provide restaurant recommendations. the staff at breakfast were very friendly too. the bedroom we were given was huge! there is plenty of free parking on site and the town is only a short walk away (~2 min).” rated 5 stars— 2020, tripadvisor
