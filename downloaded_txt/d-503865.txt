about aeasince 1963 the akron executives association (aea) has empowered professionals, united business leaders and has fostered profitable relationships for its members. founded by robert freed alongside a group of enthusiastic and well-connected business professionals, the aea was created to and continues to promote business by sharing leads between members within the local chapter and throughout the international executives association network.millions of dollars have been transferred through leads and direct business between fellow members within our association. but while the dollar value is benefit enough, sharing business ideas, concerns and solutions is an invaluable additional benefit that our members realize. it is like free consulting from experts within their respective industries.what sets aea apart from other business groups is that we accept only one member firm per business classification, thus eliminating conflict of interest when sharing leads or doing business with fellow members. we have business luncheon meetings every thursday as well as several social events throughout the year.have a question?call 330-515-6529email uscontact usakron executives' association3867 west market st.  #133akron, oh 44333phone: (330) 515-6529email: info@akronexecs.comterms of use • privacy policycopyright © 2022 akron executives associationweb design by the web factors
