welcome to our club
the rocky mountain sea kayak club is a nonprofit organization created to promote an appreciation of the outdoors, good environmental stewardship and the sport of sea kayaking in a safe, friendly and respectful manner.  the rmskc enables people in the rocky mountain region who are interested in sea kayaking to meet others and organizes kayaking trips in the are and beyond. 








day paddles



we meet at area rivers, lakes and reservoirs to practice our paddling skills and soak in nature's beauty.  this was a birding trip on barr lake.

each member of rmskc is also a member of the american canoe association.  non aca paddlers can join us on day paddles by paying a $10 insurance fee and signing a waiver.
