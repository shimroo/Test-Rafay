	!! tri-als of the day !!
	
  
 my strength lies mainly in my tenacity

my life as a novice triathlete, a yogini, a lawyer, a weight-watcher, and an auntie.
in 2008, recovering from the "year of no sleep" my mantra is "be strong, focussed, healthy, and aware."  i need to get back on track on my weight loss and lose the 50 pounds i've gained back, while re-learing how to train and re-building my base.  here we go again!

inspirational words
if you're a large woman in america, your whole life is an opportunity to feel self-conscious, embarrassed, resentful and way too big. you can hide in the corner or on the couch, you can go to therapy, or you can put on your lycra bike shorts and get out there and move.

      be patient towards all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themnselves. do not now seek the answers which cannot be given because you would not be able to love them and the point is to live everything.  live the questions now.~~~ ranier maria rilkelabels: questions

	 goodbye 2008, and welcome 2009!
	 
    


      2008 was the follow-up to the year of no sleep, with almost as little sleep as in 2007.  the cpap didn't work, the mouth guard didn't work, what *will* work?  somehow, mid-summer, sleep started returning again -- helped in part by new allergy free bedding (oh yes, i am now officially an "itchy" girl --  peanut gallery, please leave that alone), silk eyeshade, and ear plugs.  getting some sleep helped me get going again, and i managed my first double digit weight-loss in a couple of years.  the fall, work stress, and less sleep all conspired against me, and the struggle returned.  what will 2009 bring?  acceptance -- that i will get less sleep than i want, but maybe, as the stones sing, it's what i need.  persistence -- that i can find my inner athlete again.  dedication -- to training, exercise, healthy whole foods, and honoring my body and my mind.  quiet -- on the yoga mat, in my busy brain, when i need to sleep.  strength -- to manage it all.  love -- from my fabulous family and friends.bring. it. on!labels: life, plans

	 getting my running legs back!
	 
    


      i'm cleared to s l o w l y start back running. flat, soft surfaces to begin -- so why not the beach at low tide. i did 4/1 and 3/2 walk to run intervals after a walking warm up, and ended with a walking cool down. it felt really good to move at a pace slightly faster than a turtle!09/20/2008 routefind more runs in hull, massachusettslabels: injuries, running, the beach

	 recipe day:  parmesan spinach cakes
	 
    


      it took me a while to actually make them because i thought processing the spinach would be a pain. and it was -- it went fast, but little spinach bits get everywhere during the transfer and the cleanup.  still, these are very tasty little buggers.  they remind me of dr. praegers spinach cakes only they are better (and more filling)!12 ounces fresh spinach, processed in 3 batches so its finely chopped1/2 c part skim ricotta1/2 c finely shredded parm, plus some for garnish2 eggs, beaten1 clove garlic, mincedsalt and pepper to taste (don't really need the salt if the parm is salty)process spinach, add beaten eggs, ricotta, parm, garlic, salt and pepper. mix well. place in 8 small muffin cups, well-coated with cooking spray (i used 6 large muffin cups). bake in pre-heated 400 degree oven for 20 minutes. let stand 5 minutes. sprinkle with resereved parm and serve warm.serving, 2 muffins (using 8 muffin cups): 140 cals, 8 g fat, 13 g protein, 2 g fiber.labels: cooking

      "when you're stuck sitting in a comfort zone, small problems become magnified. get out of your comfort zone, touch the edge, and you come back with an appreciation for life."- barbara warren, 1943-2008racing my first triathlon was *definitely* outside my comfort zone, and so has been treating myself like an actual athlete.  i will continue to push myself to stay outside of the comfort zone, although what i really need to work on is getting to a place where treating myself like an athlete is the norm.not a whole lot to report this week. work has taken over my life and i've been exhausted, but i got a lot of rest this weekend, some yoga, and i have a plan for this week. plus a pre-packed gym bag, work clothes, and lunch. i've realized, if i'm not hyper-organized, the little stuff gets in the way of progress.labels: balance, life

	 i'm back!
	 
    


vacation was wonderful, and i wish it could continue.  i'm still gimpy and the achilles is affecting my running (none) and biking.  but i'm practicing yoga, spinning and swimming, and working hard on weight loss.  for the first phase on sister challenge, i lost 9 pounds -- my first significant weight loss in well over a year, probably closer to 18 months.  the tufts 10k next month is out, as we the nantasket seaside race this weekend, but i'm all about (1) healing and (2) getting lighter.  and i *will* race again in 2009.  the "tri" magnet is back on my car, too.labels: injuries, life, mojo
