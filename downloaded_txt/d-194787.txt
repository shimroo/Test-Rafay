* note: some gm documentation (brochures, parts book, etc.) 
			does not show this 765 code available in the sport coupe. of the 6 
			build sheets i currently have with a trim code of 765, all 6 are 
			convertibles.
those codes shown below are unique to the monte carlo. also note 
			some monte carlo interior codes are listed for both the sport coupe 
			and the convertible (noted by a double asterisk [**]) and several for 
			the convertible model only (noted by single asterisk [*]). these convertible 
			only interior codes were used in the sport coupe when it became apparent 
			the convertible would not see the market (see #785). to date there are 
			no known 1970 factory assembled monte carlo convertibles but, apparently, 
			general motors was ready for the model with interior codes. the 1970 
			model year is the only year from 1970-1972 to show a convertible in 
			the interior codes.
** some vinyl interiors were extra cost options, some were not. those 
			with a double asterisk are known to be extra cost options at $12.65. 
			convertibles, el caminos, and station wagons came standard with vinyl 
			interiors so there was no extra cost for vinyl in those body styles. 
			cloth interiors were standard in everything else and vinyl interiors 
			were optional at $12.65 with the exception being when bucket seats were 
			ordered. since bucket seats only came in vinyl, no extra cost (above 
			the cost of the bucket seats themselves) was incurred. it should also 
			be noted that vinyl interiors for 1970 were called "coated fabric" 
			and not "imitation leather" as it had been in the past.
(1) one gm documentation lists 777 as bucket seats while another 
			lists it as a bench seat.  since this trim code is for a sport sedan, it must be a bench seat.
