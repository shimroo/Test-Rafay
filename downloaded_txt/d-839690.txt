joseph brant hospital recognizes that our hospitals and community-based services are provided on the treaty lands and territory of the mississaugas of the credit first nation and recognize this land as being home and traditional territory to other indigenous people since time immemorial.
we must commit to not repeat past mistakes and to work towards more equitable and respectful relationships with the first nations, inuit (i·nyoo·uht), and metis (mey-tee).
acknowledging the territories and the original stewards of these lands is a fundamental responsibility of our organization and part of our commitment to work towards truth and reconcillation.
