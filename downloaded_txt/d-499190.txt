living and sharing the gospel

embracing faith within our modern society is undoubtedly a challenge, as the values and influences of the world often clash with spiritual principles. however, fortified by the unwavering guidance bestowed upon us by god, we earnestly endeavor to embody the discipleship demonstrated by the early christians. in our pursuit, we turn to the sacred scriptures, drawing profound insights and timeless wisdom that illuminate our path. as a community of believers, we diligently structure our individual lives according to the teachings found within his word, thus preserving the legacy of unwavering devotion that characterized the earliest followers of christ.









what to expect when visiting






we are unwavering in our commitment to studying the bible, offering a diverse range of bible classes tailored to various ages and knowledge levels, fostering a deep and comprehensive understanding of its teachings.



every sunday morning during our worship, we dedicate a specific time to commemorate the profound sacrifice of christ through our participation in the observance of the lord's supper.



we engage in acapella singing, refraining from instrumental accompaniments, creating a collective praise of god through our united voices, fostering mutual upliftment and spiritual connection within our congregation.



our preachers possess remarkable expertise in both eloquence and scriptural understanding, enriching our congregation with their skillful discourse. through each service, they impart valuable lessons that nurture our growth as devout christians.



youth activities offer a crucial platform for children's spiritual growth, enabling them to understand and apply christ's teachings while fostering a supportive community of like-minded peers. through these experiences, young individuals develop both a resilient faith and valuable life skills.
