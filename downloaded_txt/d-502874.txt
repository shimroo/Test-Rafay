                                should i use when submitting my electronic document for printing?
                            
                            pdf (portable document format) is the most common and preferred file format for
                            submitting
                            digital documents. with the installation of a pdf print driver on your computer,
                            virtually
                            any program can generate a pdf file suitable for printing. both commercial
                            and free pdf print drivers are available online for download from different sources.
                            although pdf files are recommonded, we do accept .tiff, high resolution .jpg, .ai, .psd,
                            .png, & .eps files too.
                         what is a proof
                                and
                                why is it important that i look at it?
                            
                            in printing terms, a proof is a one-off copy of your document after all modifications
                            and
                            printing setup processes have been completed. it is your last and best opportunity to
                            make
                            sure that the print job comes out the way you want. by carefully inspecting
                            the proof, you can help us assure an accurate, flawless delivery of your print job on
                            the
                            first run. please note, that approving the proof is also you agreeing to the terms and
                            conditions of the final product. any mistakes
                            or changes that you do not point out in the proof, will not be in the mix's
                            responsibility.
                         why do the printed
                                colors look different from the colors on my screen?
                            
                            in short, printers and monitors produce colors in different ways. monitors use the rgb
                            (red,
                            green, blue) color model, which usually supports a wider spectrum of colors. printers
                            use
                            the cmyk (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) color model, which can reproduce
                            most—but not all—of the colors in the rgb color model. depending on the equipment used,
                            cmyk
                            generally matches 85–90% of the colors in the rgb model. when a color is selected from
                            the
                            rgb model that is out of the range of the
                            cmyk model, the application chooses what it thinks is the closest color that will match.
                            programs like adobe photoshop will allow you to choose which color will be replaced.
                            others
                            may not.
                         what are basic
                                things
                                i should know when preparing my print file?
                            
                            make sure it's set at 300 dpi (do this prior to creating the art), set the file to cmyk
                            mode, use bleeds and margins, outline/embed any and all fonts you use!
                         what does the term
                                or
                                word "bleed" mean?
                            
                            in printing, the term "bleed" refers to the area of a printed piece that extends beyond
                            the
                            edge of the finished page. this is done to ensure that any images or colors that run off
                            the
                            edge of the page will still be visible after the piece is cut down
                            to its final size. for example, if a design contains a full-page background image that
                            goes
                            all the way to the edge of the page, it would be set up with a bleed to ensure that no
                            white
                            borders appear after the final trimming.
                            this is a common practice in printing industry to avoid any misalignment or white
                            borders
                            around the image in the final product.
                         what does rgb and
                                cmyk
                                mean?
                            
                            cmyk and rgb are two different color models used in printing and digital media.cmyk
                            stands
                            for cyan, magenta, yellow, and key (black) and is a subtractive color model used in
                            printing. the colors are mixed together to create various shades, and the colors
                            are absorbed by the paper, resulting in the final printed image.rgb stands for red,
                            green,
                            and blue and is an additive color model used in digital media such as computer monitors
                            and
                            televisions. the colors are combined to
                            create various shades and the colors are emitted by the screen, resulting in the final
                            image.in general, cmyk is used for printing and rgb for digital display. this is because
                            the
                            color gamut (the range of colors) of cmyk is
                            smaller than rgb, and some colors that can be displayed on a screen can't be reproduced
                            in
                            print, because the inks that are used in printing are limited. so, when you design
                            something
                            that will be printed it's good practice
                            to convert it to cmyk, and if it's going to be displayed on a screen, it's good to keep
                            it
                            in rgb.
                         what color mode
                                should
                                my files be?
                            
                            if you send us an rgb file, there is a chance that a color shift may occur and you may
                            not
                            be satisfied with your job. you should always start and finish your designs in cmyk
                            color
                            mode.
                             what resolution
                                should
                                my file be?
                            
                            low resolution files may be printed as is or will be placed on hold until we receive new
                            files, slowing your turn-around.
