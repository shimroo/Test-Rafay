		"i feel like i have been trapped in a dark, confusing cocoon for an incredibly long time, unable to find a real way out. i've tried every known technique i could get my hands on, but none of them seemed to work consistently. i cannot thank you enough for your generous sharing of this amazing technique - it has literally transformed every single aspect of my life! every day some new development seems to effortlessly occur, all in line with my highest goals. i hope everyone has the chance to experience the hamr the way i have, and my only complaint is that you weren't around twenty years ago! with deep gratitude -"

i keep hearing about hamr - what is it?



			hamr is a rapid change technique along the lines of nlp and self hypnosis. it was created based on an idea gleaned from some neurological research published in scientific american. the system is comprised of two parts: a technique that spreads and reinforces positive new thoughts within your brain (the hammer), and, a list of thoughts that are known to have great effect (the hamr module). 


okay, i'm going to try it. what do i do first?


the first thing you will want to do is learn the hammer method. that will enable you to utilize the module, which is designed to knock your socks off. there are two ways to learn the hammer. one is the 
			overview of the steps and the other is a 
			step-by-step tutorial. use whichever suits your personality best, or look over both of them. 


later, when your bell is ringing and you can't remember your name, a look at hamr theory will be instructive.
