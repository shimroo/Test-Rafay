twisted threads
designs from twisted threads, featuring ruth sparrow, listen
honey, dan dipaolo, tall guys and more!





twisted threads began as a retail shop in cincinnati, ohio in may,
1993. the first published design was from the original artwork of
cartoonist emerson quillin in september, 1993. since those early
days, ruth has published over 60 designs from the art of emerson.
listen honey and friends of mine are needle art adaptations of
emerson's cartoons. other collections that ruth has adapted into
published designs are fried green tomatoes by
dan dipaolo, tatters and spats by mary
burton and brushstrokes by susan hays.

inspired by her mother's exquisite embroidery, ruth began stitching
her designs over one linen thread several years ago. most of her
designs may be stitched over two linen threads, but ruth prefers
the delicate appearance of the smaller stitches. her technique of
stitching over one has been taught throughout the country at shops,
retreats, sampler guilds and trade shows.

we truly hope you will enjoy our entire line of cross stitch charts
and kits in the various design links. please select a link that
interests you to find your perfect pattern!
