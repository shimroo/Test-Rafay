we will be closed from feb 22nd to 24th for japanese national holidays. all orders received during this period will be shipped out after feb 25th. thank you! team japantackle.
we have started taking pre-orders for 2025 new models. please check them out.
welcome to japantackle.com website. this is jun sonoda, owner of japantackle.com. i sincerely appreciate your long-term relationships with us since 2002
i am testing and selecting products, offering them to customers and consulting customers for how to upgrade tackles. i do fish a lot, and may give some good insights of the tackle we deal. i mainly deal with high quality products available in japan from wide range of manufacturers, from large manufacturers like shimano and daiwa, to small hand-crafting manufacturers like avail, extreme and drt. please feel free to email for technical questions, recommendations, trade and anytime you want to talk with me. email jun. 
please check tackle topics pages as well for your more understanding of tackle upgrades and japanese fishing tackle. i list discontinued fishing reels at casting reels archives and spinning reels archives, hoping you find them valuable to understand fishing reels sold in japan in the past. hope you enjoy watching my website, and of course shopping with it.
best regards,  
jun sonoda and team japantackle
