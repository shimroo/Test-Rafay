what our customers are saying




“your product is great.  we were at the holiday isle sandbar in islamorada on memorial day.  the wind was blowing a sustained 15 to 20 knots out of the northeast.  we had three boats over 30’ bimini tied to the shore spike without any problem whatsoever.  even when the tide changed, the boats stayed put, which was huge for us because the place was absolutely packed with boats and people.  thanks again for making such a great product.”





“you saved my boat!”





“you guys couldn’t make anchoring any easier!”





“best item i’ve ever bought for my boat.”
