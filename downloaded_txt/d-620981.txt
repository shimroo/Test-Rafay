"the music-room in the governor's house at port mahon, a tall, handsome, pillared octagon, was filled with the triumphant first movement of locatelli's c major quartet."with these words, millions of readers have discovered the work of patrick o'brian, the twenty novels of the 'aubreyad' chronicling the voyages of jack aubrey and stephen maturin through the shoals and deep water of friendship, love, war and life.the gunroom is the home for a group of o'brian's readers who enjoy discussion of o'brian's works through the email list gunroom@hmssurprise.org. 


















here we share insights and information about the british navy and nautical world of the early 1800s, obsolete and unfamiliar language, maturin's medicine, natural history, politics, geography and history to enhance our enjoyment and understanding of the books and characters. we also discuss o'brian's other novels, short stories, interviews, book reviews, biography and early writings under the name of patrick russ.we have only two topics of conversation: patrick o'brian and everything else (politics and religion excepted). over the years, the list has developed into an enjoyable, general interest conversation group populated by people who happen to love patrick o'brian's books. as one list member wrote, though:"members of the gunroom enjoy friendly discussion of various subjects. sometimes patrick o'brian's works may not be on the agenda for some days or even weeks. but the new, delighted reader of o'brian has only to pose a question or state an opinion about the canon, or the part of it just discovered, to find any number of ready replies."our community includes resources and links to other o'brian sites, original stories set in o'brian's world, art, recipes, humor, book-by-book notes, discussion of o'brian's short stories, and pages that support our lissun community.visitors are welcome to sail on our pages and share a glass of cyberwine with new friends while discussing our favorite books... and everything else.give you joy, sir or madam. welcome aboard!follow the gunroom patteranwhere words drift over the sea(oh, purple words in a purple phrase)as we speak of pob.charles muñoz, list bard
