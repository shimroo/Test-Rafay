you are welcome here

 
































 

however you are connecting with saint peter’s, we hope you will find a wide and warm embrace. this is a place of respite and renewal.

    

if you are looking for a religious community, this may be a place for you! we are a sanctuary and reconciling in christ parish of the elca. we are a bi-lingual english-speaking and spanish-speaking community. we are brown, black, white and more. we are persons of all sexual orientations and gender identities. some of us hold citizenship, others of us are dreamers, asylees or seeking documentation. a good way to begin this journey is to participate in our sunday liturgies.if you are looking for community rooted in the arts and in social action, this may be a place for you! visual and performing arts, community engagement and a commitment to the city are at our core. our entire public building—our iconic modernist sanctuary with its distinctive organ is a treasured new york city landmark—is home to people and programs with an almost immeasurable impact: from world-class jazz to our immigration accompaniment efforts. louise nevelson's beloved chapel is an oasis of healing and saint peter's/lenox hill neighborhood house's older adults center provides key services to hundreds of people.  

  

and still, there is more! come explore.
