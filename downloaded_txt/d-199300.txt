what about the recession? isn’t this a bad time to start a new business?
no way! people must eat. and the trend in food service is towards pick up and take away foods as the recent time magazine article highlighted. it’s a growing industry even when the economy is faltering.
the key to success is drawing upon our more than 20 years of first hand experience. will hodgskiss, the owner of willydogs, was himself a hot dog cart owner. he built his business from the ground up and learned a lot about the business along the way. now he is sharing his knowledge with you.
our free online business guide helps you find recession proof locations in your area where you can set up your new willydog cart. and we teach you how to run your cart and avoid the pitfalls that those without our experience often run into. see our section on daily operations or learn about a typical day in the life of a hot dog vendor.
customer testimonial:


18 oct 2009
dear will and crew
i received my new hummer in june of 2009. she is a beauty. the first thing i had to do was inspected by the health inspector in windor, ct. the man came out to my cart (initially on the phone he told me it would be a lengthy process including igniting burners!) walked around it, ran his hands over it a few times and said he was ready to go back inside. odd i thought but hey, that’s easy enough. well we got inside and as he was filling out the paperwork he looked at me and said “you know, that is the nicest  cart i have seen in a long time.” then he asked me a million questions where it came from. he was quite impressed. i have people comment daily on how nice my cart is. i take good care of it and it gets covered nightly. it took a while for me to get the hang of steaming my dogs, my first couple of weeks i split lots of dogs and totally overestimated how many people would stop by. the neighborhood dogs loved me for a few weeks. the good news is i now have a very loyal following (sadly, winter is here and i will have to shut down as i work in an open field) and i have perfected my “steaming” of the dogs. yeah me! i absolutely  love my job and that is the first time in 35 years i have been able to say that! i can’t wait till spring gets here…. here’s hoping for a short winter… ha, this is new england!
thanks guys for a job well done…. i will send pictures of the crowds come spring!

customer testimonial:
i just got off the phone with you. i wanted you to have my e-mail address, so i decided to send you this brief note. again, thank you for getting me into this business. things are going great. i’m doing about $600 – $700 a day during the week, and around $1000 a day on the weekends. good stuff. as you remember, i had kind of gone under in the real estate finance business. you saved me, will. thanks again.
use me as a reference if you would like to. the cart is great. i modified the hummer a bit, and mounted two 40-pound tanks on the front of it. i had the work done by a welder here in syracuse. i’ll e-mail you some digital pictures. it really is a great cart.
again will, thanks for a great product, and thanks for everything you did for me. if someone told me ten-years ago i would be selling hot dogs and sausages for a living, i would have told them they were nuts, but i couldn’t be happier doing this for a living. and… i’m making great money. but more importantly, it’s a lot of fun too. i have a radio playing at the cart all day, jimmy buffett and bob marley….today i was actually dancing with a customer who pulled up to get a few sausage sandwiches! must have been quite a sight!
thanks again will,
