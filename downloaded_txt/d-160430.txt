better elections are possible 



in fact, they're already happening! 



some california voters are already experiencing the benefits of ranked choice voting such as reduced political polarization, less negative campaigning, and more choice. on top of that, votes matter more. every district becomes a swing district, each vote much more important. and it eliminates the problem of gerrymandering and makes voting more representative and fairer. 



now let's make them happen everywhere.

rcv elections in ca as of 2018 





















"of all the political reforms we might adopt to reduce the polarization and venom in our politics, ranked-choice voting is the most promising and most achievable.  ...it’s time to expand its use in california and the nation."

california voters understand and use rcv. 



it can be explained in under 2 minutes, and according to fairvote analysis, voters in california cities with rcv understood it better than they did the state’s top-two primary system.

proportional representation 






find out how pr works











instead of electing one representative in a small (and possibly gerrymandered) district, proportional representation uses much larger districts that elect several members at once. these larger districts can more accurately reflect the preferences of voters.
