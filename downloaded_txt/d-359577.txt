rio turismo radical - rio de janeiro 
rio turismo radical was created in 2001 as an alternative option of entertainment in rio de janeiro. the idea of taking foreign tourists to practice extreme sports in rio was quite new at that time, and very challenging. for more than 15 years we have worked hard trying to make people have their best time in our beloved city.
