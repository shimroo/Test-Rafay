member spotlight: susannah schoolman, tourlami founder 
with a career spanning bouchon bakery, lincoln ristorante, b.patisserie, and hart bageri, guild member susannah schoolman has worked in some of the world's most renowned pastry kitchens. her expertise in laminated doughs and viennoiserie has shaped her approach to cooking and baking. today, she's pioneering the plant-based pastry and cooking movement as the founder and ceo of tourlami, a plant-based butter designed for professional kitchens.  
in her upcoming guild class at the institute of culinary education in new york, susannah will teach plant-based lamination techniques–helping bakers master flaky croissants, brioche, and puff pastry. susannah is proving that laminated doughs can be just as flaky, structured, and delicious without dairy.
