testimonials 



what they're talking about our company 



 






						"in 1996 i sold a commercial property for $1.5 million. the buyer gave me $300,000 as a down payment and i financed the balance. i needed cash for another investment and i contacted harris note investors, in 2001, they bought the note and offered me a good buy out price for my note, and closed very quickly."

						"i own a mobile home park in upstate new york. i got into some bad shape with the irs and owed about $300.000. my credit was not the best, so mr. harris provided a hard money loan for 2 years for $750,000 until i rebuilt my credit and refinanced at a lower rate."
