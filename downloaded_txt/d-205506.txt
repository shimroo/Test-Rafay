who we are
we invest £8 billion of taxpayers’ money each year into research and innovation and the people who make it happen. we work across a huge range of fields – from biodiversity conservation to quantum computing, and from space telescopes to innovative health care. we give everyone the opportunity to contribute and to benefit, bringing together people and organisations nationally and globally to create, develop and deploy new ideas and technologies.
