 engineering and public policy
humanity’s greatest contemporary challenges transcend disciplinary boundaries. crafting effective policy in domains as diverse as climate change, misinformation, national security, artificial intelligence, natural disaster response, privacy, and critical infrastructures increasingly requires expertise that spans and integrates technical and social science fields.
the department of engineering and public policy (epp) at carnegie mellon university is a unique department that works to solve problems at the interface of science, technology, and society. 
we offer multiple double-major options for undergraduate students (in partnership with each of the five engineering departments and the school of computer science), master's degree programs in engineering & public policy and in engineering & technology innovation and management, and a research-oriented ph.d. program. our students build skills in policy analysis, risk assessment, data science, and decision-making needed to solve today’s complex problems in business, government, and non-profits across the globe.
