            we have been equipping people with the knowledge, confidence and skills to solve their legal problems since 2011.
      

we believe everyone should have access to clear, helpful information, self-help tools, and training to deal with legal issues, whether it's family and housing challenges or sorting out problems with benefits or work. these are part of everyday life, and if left unresolved, they can lead to bigger problems like poverty and inequality.

i was lost until i found your website – it has given me some strength and clarity and confidence in the worst days of my life to date.

thanks for being there. it would be easy to give in and accept injustice just to get it sorted but i don’t think that is right or fair.

            looking for help or advice?
      

getting free one-to-one advice is much harder than it used to be. all advice services are extremely busy. we are here to help everyone who cannot get in at an advice service and cannot afford to pay for legal help.we give you the knowledge, confidence, and skills you need to deal with the issue yourself, or with the help of friends or family.  if you need more help than you can get from our advice guides and self-help tools, we explain how to try to find advice.
