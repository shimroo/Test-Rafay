my art is going to the dogs,  spilling my guts,  the zoo 

a woman and her dog

i am so sentimental. i took cody on a “last walk” and made it a big deal. we took pictures, stopped and rested in all the shady places, and had petting fests. it was great.

he was happy, and i was getting through the grieving process that i had built into a bigger deal than it needed to be. this goodbye went exactly the way it needed to. i stayed for a week and watched cody act like a puppy again with five other dogs to play with. he likes my brother, he loves my sister-in-law who gives him treats all the time. he is going to be a happy, healthy, well-cared-for dog. in fact, they’ve already taken him to the vet, and his tumors are benign!  what a relief!  he’s already better off because of his new home.
me, well, i’m okay too. of course, i will miss our walks and all the times he follows me around with his big sighs and adorable puppy eyes. i’ll miss cuddling with him when i’m cold and having silly conversations with him. but there are a lot of things i won’t miss. like dog hair everywhere!  the slobbers, the constant having to hurry back in case he needs to go outside to pee when i’m gone—the worry!! i worried about him all the time. i’ve always been a helicopter mom, and i was no different as a dog mom.

we walked downtown, and i took some cool photos of old buildings. you know what i will miss the most besides his constant adorableness? the feeling of being safe with a big dog. i could walk in neighborhoods i didn’t know without fear. i could walk at night (not that i did, but i could if needed). i could walk by scary guys and know that cody would growl and take a chomp out of them if they even dared to act aggressively toward me. i loved having a big dog. he was a kitten in spirit, but he could look scary when he needed to, and i always felt safe with him.

i hope we both live long enough to be reunited. i like to dream of all the lives we might someday have.  but if this is the only one we got, it was pretty good!

i was on such a roll with my newfound time for blogging that i had prepped this post and was just about to write it up. then i decided i was tired and wanted to go to bed instead and write it the next day. that’s all fine, but i also have my laptop set up for automatic updates, and that night, when i went to bed, it was set to update to the latest operating system.
the following day, when i sat down to type up this post, i was greeted with the worst thing any laptop owner can be greeted by: the black screen of death.
i’m no stranger to the black screen of death. i’ve been through this many times, so i knew it could be as simple as re-installing the latest os, a little more complicated as erasing the hard drive, losing whatever i’ve worked on since my last backup (two weeks ago), or worst case, shipping it off to apple for 5-7 business days. i’ve paid for apple care since i left my ex-husband, my personal mac it guy, and it’s been worth every penny. whatever the prognosis was, i was offline until i could get to an apple store. my brother isn’t exactly close to an apple store in the middle of the desert in texas.
there went all those posts i would write in my downtime in texas.

good news! today, my dad and i drove to the nearest apple store, and they re-installed the latest operating system and i am as good as new! i’m so happy and relieved.
bad news: i’m back-posting. i’m already back in california, but i am now blogging about my time in texas.

i had a good time. it was a real adventure. i don’t love the dry, dusty, barren desert of west texas (or how dusty it makes my brother’s house), but it was very photogenic. the sunrises and sunsets were incredible.

my brother owns ten acres of dry, barren, dusty desert. he has grand plans for our whole family to move out there and live on a compound. i’m not as keen on that idea, but it is an option if california falls into the ocean or life gets so expensive that we are forced out.  lately, that’s been seeming more and more possible, much to my dismay.
when i rented a uhaul for my move to my parents, i found out there was a shortage of moving trucks in california because so many people were moving away.  i’ll be very sad when i have to leave my home state. but i’ve been giving up many things lately, so i’m learning to accept hard things and make the best of them.

cody seems to like the dry, dusty ground just fine and gets along well with my brother’s other five dogs and three cats.

momo stays indoors, but she also seems to love texas. she loves my brother’s big house and her new playmates (two kittens and a dachshund). they run the length of the house all day long. it’s great.

me, i just loved taking pictures. every day, i thought i’d seen it all, and then the light would change, and i had a whole new world to explore with my camera.

texas does not lack in beautiful skies. from horizon to horizon, as far as i could see, were beautiful colors changing right before my eyes.

it was so peaceful out there.

my brother and i talked about all his plans for his land. we discussed everything from rainy season to mud season to mosquito season and beyond. he plans to have a big garden in the spring, and i’m excited to see it.

i’m happy that he’s happy. maybe someday i’ll find my happiness out there, too, but for now, i’m going to hold onto my california girl cred as long as i can.
