about us


the history of our grocery store
in 1923, my grandparents, sidney and mollie ball, started a small neighborhood grocery store on the corner of 6th and stewart streets in kansas city, kansas.
there was no money to hire help, so the two of them ran the grocery store from early in the morning to late evening. my grandmother ran the cash register and kept the books; my grandfather stocked the shelves, went to the market, and unloaded the truck.
as their business grew, they were able to hire a couple of employees to help out. today that humble beginning has evolved into a corporation called ball’s food stores.
there are currently 27 stores that spread throughout the metropolitan area under the names of hen house market, ball’s price chopper, payless discount foods and sunfresh market. nearly 4,000 people – we like to refer to them as teammates – work in those stores. “our grocery store,” as my grandfather said decades ago, “is only as good as the people who work there.” we are very fortunate to have dedicated people who create great stores for our customers.
ball’s food stores has come a long way since my grandparents opened their first store in 1923. i take great pride in being a part of the best grocery operation in the area, and even greater pride in being the third generation to lead this company, following in the footsteps of my father, fred ball.
– david ball
