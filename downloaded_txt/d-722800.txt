in 1997, after extensive renovation, ardovino's desert crossing reopened with a vision to offer a dining experience that encompassed quality food and service from start to finish. for more than 20 years, we have proudly expanded that vision to contribute and commit to the sustainable movement happening in our community. we endorse farms that are locally owned and family operated – from our own estate-grown produce and estate-raised hens, to our farming and ranching friends throughout the area; who grow exceptional products without the use of pesticides. our property’s family history started back in 1949 with our great-uncle frank ardovino, who opened las lomas del rey (presently our restaurants main building) as a gambling establishment, then re-opened as ardovino’s roadside inn a fine dining restaurant. truly, there is no other place in el paso (or new mexico) like it. from our fabulous food and exceptional service; to the way our banquet venues transform from event to event; to the hand-made, locally sourced offerings of our farmers’ market, ardovino's desert crossing is a destination you don't want to miss.  questions? give us a call at 575-589-0653.
