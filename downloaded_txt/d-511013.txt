 indeed. on this day, february 4, 1968, 54 years ago, our beloved
father, neal leon cassady, 
passed away in san miguel de allende, mexico, 4 days short of his 42nd
birthday. as they say, 
the good die young.
   born on february 8,
1926, in salt lake city, ut, to parents who were driving west in their 
search for a "better life," and who eventually landed in denver,
colorado. young neal led a c
olorful life, as has been recorded so well in story and song.
   i have a gazillion
stories about him (don't we all!), of which i intend to write down one
day.
   in fond memory, dad...
   all best, john allen
cassady

and today, february 5, william s.
burroughs, author of the novel "naked lunch," as well as 
many others, was born in st. louis, mo, in 1914. he would have been 108
today (yeah, as if!). 
he died august 2, 1997, at the age of 83, in lawrence, kansas.
   the grandson of the inventor of the burroughs adding
machine, he had enough money to 
become a notorious heroin addict ("junky" was another book that he
wrote). i met him only 
once, at the cooper house in santa cruz, ca, during some beat
convention. i must say, he 
looked pretty "beat." (oh, sorry, ha ha). bill burroughs jr. was a
house-mate of mine in scotts 
valley for a while, until he died from liver failure, despite my
driving him down to dominican 
hospital in santa cruz almost daily. he was fond of red wine, and i
eventually gave up on trying 
to stop him from drinking it. there's only so much one can do. may he
rest in peace.

here's
something all book lovers and aficionados of the beat and 
       
   
           
           
       
                
prankster
generations
will
love:


the reprint release of the 1981 classic
"spit in the ocean, number 6: the cassady
issue."
a score of books, including "on the road," by
jack kerouac,
as well as the music of the grateful dead,
have delved into the myth of the iconic neal
cassady.
spit in the ocean was a local publication in 6
issues, produced by 
the kens kesey and babbs. the final issue, #6, edited by babbs, 
has become an essential (and rare) relic of the cassady legend.
this reprint edition of 500 copies is an
important addition to the 
study of the fiction, poetry, prose and music of both the beat movement

and the psychedelic generation.

of the cassady issue, go to book order.

    shysters
           
           
            

this has been the
story of the world. the shysters come in
and they convince the 
rubes that something is a good deal. once they’ve cleaned
the rubes out, they move 
on, and the rubes are left scratching their heads, and
saying ‘what happened maaaw?!
 well i don’t know cyrus, i think that, uh, well,
they gave us 5 dollars, uhh, and we 
bought all that flour, but err, the flour’s
gone!!
 
we are ‘god’s own rubes.’
they come in, they fleece us, and we
cackle and laugh! 
then we do something else and wait for the next band of
shysters to come in and fleece us again!
 
we grin when we see those
guys. we clap them on the back and
say, ‘maan! you so crazy! 
you so crazy, i think that i might even knock you on
the head!’ no, no, no, we’re not that bad! 
we just go along with it. besides,
you know what? ‘i think i just might outlive you.’
 
the sad thing about
it, the realistic thing about it, is
that there are a whoooole new crop of shysters growing--

         questions about neal
cassady 



 




how did you personally meet neal? 

the first time i met neal was when we took the further bus to madhattan
in 1964. he was the driver and i was
one of the fourteen merry pranksters he had never met before, with the
exception of ken kesey. that must have 
been around 1962 when neal just got out of two years in san quentin and
he went to keey's house in menlo park 
california; pullled up in his jeepster and the back end went out. he
borrowed tools from kesey and spent all 
afternoon fixing the car while talking all the while.

what was your relationship with him through the merry prankster days? 

he didn't think much of me at first. i gave him hell one day for trying
to show the racing car four wheel drift while 
driving the bus and throwing us all around. he called me a tourist,
which was his way of saying i didn't come up 
through the beat and bohemian ranks. but as time went on and we got to
know each other better, we became good friends.

did he influence the way you looked at things?

spend time with neal and he definitely influenced the way you looked at
things, from figuring out the one thirtieth of a 
second time it took for you brain to react to something you were trying
to do, to working at being a better person, one 
who would help another out, try to bring people out of their shells and
groove.

do you think neal could have ever settled down and had a life, or are
spirits such as his here on earth just a short time 
to be a bright star and then fade away?

hard to figure that one out. neal settled down to a regular life every
once in a while and then got pulled away into some 
other kind of adventure. i don't know about how spirits are destined to
exist; maybe they just are.

what is the message neal would want the youth of today to learn from
his passion and work. 

speaking for neal: "go wrong this curve, set up for that, unless you
got a flat or some other kind of suspension change, 
but what it really matters is to not go on the other side of the
railing unless you of course is really wailing, but they ain't 
working against you, remember that, what's in the way is going to join
you, like they say on the railrooad, you can always 
tell by the fear in your belly how limited you are."

"who are these
vigilantes?

why, they’re the dirtiest guys in any town.
 they’re the same 
ones that burned the houses of the old german
people
during the war. they’re the same ones that
lynched negroes.  
they like to be cruel.  they like to hurt
people, and they
always give it a fancy name, patriotism or
protecting the constitution."

zen cwen
 by ken babbs
 
        
she
was a cwen. the club of the queens. the campus queens.
cwen meant queen 
in olde english. only the prettiest and brightest could be
cwens, and service to others was mandatory.
 
professor clagmont was
chortling at the head of the long
table in the english grad room. 
the oxford english dictionary filled the
shelves, floor to ceiling, all the way around. 
 
        
“cwen,”
he guffawed. “a queen, for sure, but a kitchen queen. that’s what cwen 
really
means in old english. and the kitchen queens were the scullery queens,
the dish
washers. our 
darling campus queens are dish washers.”

questions from a friend in new york state



..... what the
hell is going on out there? i don't recall any mention of forest fires
on this level in the past..

four shore and seven yars ago there warn't this durned climate change
x-acerbaiting the sityation.

everything ok there in dexter? lots of smoke in the air (other than the
normal green type)...? 

for a couple of weeks when the fires in oregon were raging the red
smoke was so thick you couldn't go 
outside without wearing a mask. then the air cleared and now we are
getting high grey smoke blowing in 
from the california fires still raging

how's this all happening? man-made.. or au naturale ?

mostly lightning strikes but some man made through calessness and there
are idiots who set fires deliberately 
due to some maelstrom in their brains. and the change in climate with
the hotter dryer summers makes 
everything worse and this is only the tip of the iceberg, if we don't
reverse climate change only ones left will be 
the eskimos and penquins. projections say we have two decades to get er
done, alas.

the
first
hipsters
got
their
name
from
the
opium
junkies
who
lay
on
their
hips
while

smoking the pipe. to be hip
meant to know what was in the know, both above and below the 
flow of the
squares' desires to rise to the crop, for hipsters knew that shit rises
but
cream floats.
hippies
didn't
happen
as
a
"thing"
(like
the
beats
in
the
fifties)
until
1967,
the
summer
of
love.

kesey and i were forty years old. we were never longhairs or wore
tiedye.
by then we had gone 
"under the asphalt" to mean back to the earth,
for kesey, through his dad and brother, bought a 
sixty eight acre farm in rural
pleasant hill oregon and the pranksters moved there en masse and 
lived on the
farm for a couple of years until everyone got their own places.
cassady
bridged
the
gap
between
the
beats
and
the
hippies.
we
were
too
young
for
one
and

too old for the other, and
so exist as a phenom as our own thing, so the timeline goes: the beats
the

pranksters the hippies.
hippies
are
more
than
potheads,
music
freaks
and
bohemians,
for
there
is
an
underlying

philosophy of
self-sufficiency and ongoing efforts to restore the planet, one small
plot of
land at a 
time. don't forget sharing food and shelter and the spiritual side of
being in tune with creation and 
restoration; helping one another out, and most
important, being kind, not only to those you know 
and love, but also strangers who
live in pain and misery.

       found the preface. here it is










 
     the beautiful thing
about the vietnam expcrience was the way the american people rose up in
outrage
over a war we had no business fighting and put a halt to it. the
parents and
relatives and friends of all the people killed and wounded had the
stongest voices.
     it seemed to mark the
end of something. now we could get on with the business of grooving out
the new
millenium. but turned out, it's not over yet. war and threats of war
are still
with us; must be a fixed condition of the world experience after all.
     if so, what becomes
interesttng is the way we come through the experience, be it ulyssess
trying to
beat it home after the trojan war or robert jordan making ingrid
bergman's
earth move, prewitt preferring the bugle to the boxing ring, or
yossarian taking
a raft to sweden.
    young people today might
wonder why anyone used to go into the military at all. what they don't
realize
is that for a long time there was a thing celled umt, universal
military
training, a highblown phrase, much like the way the word assistance has
replaced welfare, but in this case the ugly word was the draft and in
those
days unless you secured a deferment, you served. the problern then
became how
to best serve.
     "if you don't
learn from your past mistakes you're doomed to repeat them agean,"
george
mcgovern parroted from someone else, when mcgovern was running for
president the second time.
nicarauga. beirut. panama. grenada. gulf war. iraq. we thought vietnam
settled
all this. but no, here it comes again. so how do we play it? how do we
carefully
tread the narrow path between total disaster and maddening victory? 
     the best clue is one
all followers of mash will recognize. if you're in an insane
situation a good way to keep your sanity is to act like you're insane.
do the
things that in a sane scene would render you mad, in the eyes of the
beholders.

     vietnam was a
tremendouls trauma, particularly for those who couldn’t see it as a
triumphant
note in american history. big munitions and big military and big
government
were anxious to try out their toys and vietnam seemed like a good
playground.
after all, foreign nations had been working over its soil for centuries.
     but the people of the
united states rose up and said, “back off. we’ve got no business over
there.”
and this was the triumph: that government of the people, by the people,
and for
the people again asserted itself. rightly so. one of the sad outcomes
was the
way the soldiers were treated when they got home. even if you are
against the
war you aren’t against the solders.
     enormous damage had
been inflicted. not just to the bodies and the pride but the psyches as
well.
take one man’s example. he was a navy corpsman in vietnam. he saw
terrible
things. bulldozing bodies into ditches. pieces of bodies. heads. arms.
legs.  awful memories. they were tearing
him
to pieces.      

   
then
one
night
he
had
a
dream.
     he was on a troop
plane flying with a group of militlry men. they landed on a dirt jungle
landing
strip. they got out and were marched in columns betweeen two rows of
quonset
huts. as they marched along, the men peeled out of the columns and went
into
the quonset huts.
     when it was his turn he
went through an open door. it was dark inside and crowded with bamboo
cages. so
crowded he had to crawl on hands and knees and fight to get through.
     the cages were full of
the remains of men killed in vietnam. some were rotten. some were
skeletons. some were only parts of bodies. 

     finally he got to the
end of the quonset hut and went out the back door. he was in another
building
that had long corridors with rooms and alcoves going off to the sides.
in one
of the alcoves were the guys from his outfit still living. they wore
old-style,
beat-up camouflage fatigues. they were eating crackers and drinking
pop. then
he heard something.
     he went down the hall
and around the corner and down a long corridor. at the end of the
corridor was
a screen door that led outside. standing in front of the door was a
group of
elite military men: special forces, seals. green berets, 
rangers. someone was knocking on the
door.
     one of the men opened
the door and let in a little, brown-skinned, asian-looking boy. he was
a
shoeshine boy wanting to shine their boots. they laughed at him. their
boots
were already gleaming. outside, a low rumbling started and began to
pulsate and
grow. the soldiers snapped to attention. a call for assembly came over
the
loudspeakers.
    the men from the
corpsman's outfit formed up along the walls at
attention. a general marched down the hallway with his adjutant
alongside. the
general shook hands with everyone. he had a big smile on his face. 
     "good luck,"
he said. "i know you will do your best. the country is depending an
you." 
     the adjutant’s face was
tough and impassive. he had on a pair of reflective sunglasses so you
couldn't
see his eyes. he and the general approached the corpsman. the rumbling
outside
got louder. the adjutant cupped his ear to hear better. he smiled.
     "it's starting up
again," he told the corpsman. 
     the wheels of war were
grinding and rumbling. the men marched out of the building and down to
a boat
parked alongside the dock. on the other side of the river was a long
line of
19-20-year-olds. fresh. green. raw. fgns.
     the men from the
corpsman’s outfit stood and looked at the recruits. the 
rangers and seals and special forces
moved in a group toward the boat. they got in and it imnediately pulled
away
from the dock, heading for the other side. a big black hand fell on the
corpsman's shoulder. one of his old pals.
     "it's all
right," the pal said. "everything is okay." 
     the corpsman realized
he didn't have to feel bad about not getting on the boat. he didn't
have to
feel bad about not having bought it in the nam..
     he woke up from his
dream and realized he was free of the guilt. he didn’t have to feel bad
about
it. no one who lived through vietnbam has to feel bad about it.
     after all, when all’s
said and done, there’s two sides all right. but they’re not the winners
and the
losers. they’re the living and the dead.
