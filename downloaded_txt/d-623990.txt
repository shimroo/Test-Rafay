lakeside marina
where lifestyle meets expertise 
lakeside marina is wisconsin's premier boat dealership and service center of chaparral boats, godfrey pontoons and tritoons, hurricane deck boats, recon fishing boats, and high quality used boats. we have the honor of being named the 'best boat dealership' in winnebago county for the last four years.
we specialize in providing you with a one on one experience from beginning to end with full walkthroughs and in-water sea trials. if you're in the market to buy a new or used boat, sell or broker your current boat, or are in need of service or storage, stop by our showroom in oshkosh, wisconsin for quick and easy assistance from our friendly crew members.
we are also proud to offer the fox valley's newest membership-only boat sharing program - on the fox boat club which operates out of lakeside marina and has full access to the lake winnebago water system.
no matter where you're located in wisconsin, from green bay or green lake, appleton, oshkosh, or anywhere in between, it would be our pleasure to assist you with any of your boating needs.
