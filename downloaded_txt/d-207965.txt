beware of the bitcoin bubble: investment and financial advisors warn



"an investor may choose not to invest in companies that he or she sees engages in practices detrimental to the environment.butâ¦'being emotional is not an edge in investing' -impactadvisor"




"if you want to put your money to work and to doing good, hereâs everything you need to look for."



"impactadvisor has a new portfolio simulation website called vegemize that helps people pick individual stocks and even bonds from companies that match specific social metrics for things like gender equality and coâ emissions."









"social responsibility is the central theme of us-based software provider impact labs. in september, it announced the launch of the first algorithmic portfolio software solely for those who actively adopt esg investing."



"the advent of robo-advisors can make sustainable and impact investing lessâ¦by automating the process and using algorithms to invest according to a customerâs preferences."



"impact labs launched an algorithmic portfolio generation and customization tool that it says builds a properly diversified investment portfolio while optimizing for social value and maximizing after-tax performance."



"mit team makes it easy: investors can now swipe-right for equality, sustainability and dozens more causes and if, like one prominent new england quarterback, you consider cola to be 'poison for kids', you have the option to swipe-left on big sugar."
