                        i have ordered twice from them in the last 30 days. everything is exactly what they say it is. it's been properly packaged. there's been absolutely no damage. they have done a wonderful job twice in 30 days. they are well worth the effort. i highly recommend them and would happily visit them, but i have no desire to go to winnipeg in the winter.                    david r.19:10 30 jan 25                        so pleased with my 6 royal doulton lambeth ware dinner plates.  i've been looking for them for a few years as family grows and even found them in canada!expected used like my old ones purchased in 1974 but they look brand new and arrived well packed in just a fee days.  many thanks!!!                    joanne m.23:32 14 may 24                        great service....found the pieces and they packaged them so very carefully too, after asking if i was satisfied with them...with bubble wrap and in a box!    highly recommend this place!                    lydia surasky m.17:08 07 may 24                        i'm so happy to find this site.  this will be my "go to" store for vintage dinnerware pieces aside from the missing pieces i need to complete my settings.  they put extra care when packing the pieces. i'm also glad that they recycle materials to use for the packages.  from my experience with the 2 purchases, i am assured i can always shop with confidence from them.ðŸ˜Š                    teresa a05:34 06 mar 24                        i have bought from missing pieces before.  their customer service is fabulous as they always aim to please each and every time. the shipment is always insured but never has there been a time when the china did not arrive on time and always safely.  the added service of being on their call list for my china patterns mean i have the best chances of completing my sets.  thank you, missing pieces.                    b s.22:17 07 feb 24                        i needed an antique lamp, heavy and delicate, shipped from winnipeg to pembroke ontario, and reached out to missing pieces because iâ€™d used them for other reasons.  janice and her crew did a fantastic job with the packing and the shipping and the client at the other end confirmed with me that the lamp arrived in pristine condition!  i knew missing pieces would look after everything perfectly, and they did!  i would recommend them at the drop of a hat for anything and everything that involves selling, buying, shipping, packaging - of all china, glassware, anything delicate.  they do superb work!                    d i.23:26 18 jan 24                        i am very pleased with the service i have received from missing pieces.  they are a pleasure to deal with and i feel like a child in a candy store every time i visit. simply delightful!                    roland k.18:47 27 dec 23                        fantastic!! i used missing pieces to sell my motherâ€™s china and crystal b through their consignment system when she downsized into assisted living. it was so easy! they were so professional and caring.  our family never had to follow up with them.  my mom just kept receiving cheques until everything was sold. their excellent customer service and owner janice, kept us informed with no hassles.  such a great experience to pass on valuable tableware for the next generation to enjoy!                    shannon c.14:42 28 aug 23                        i ordered china to add to my motherâ€™s set that i had inherited.  their site was easy to navigate and the pieces i ordered arrived at my house in calgary in less than a week.  excellent service!                    heather g.04:01 07 jul 23                        purchased new denby imperial blue stonewear from missing pieces.excellent quality and price. janice the owner is extremely knowledgeable and helpful in selecting the pieces i needed.i'd give this business 6 stars if i could!                    garyr21:42 03 apr 23                        had a friend at work with broken plates and he needed them replaced. looked on ebay and low and behold missing pieces had them!  aaaaa++++   now to find other's of my own                    mark16:46 18 feb 23                        the staff at missing pieces are so helpful! they looked at some photos of my items, spent a bunch of time chatting with me, then told me to go to another place where i could get a better deal for my items! they were very helpful, and they didn't make a dime.                    andrew m.22:53 13 mar 22                        exceptional service! i am sincerely pleased that, after ordering online a piece for them, which arrived with a tiny chip, they sent the replacement in a few days at their cost and did not want back the damaged piece. courteous and prompt;  i highly recommend them!                    anca r.15:55 08 jul 21                        janice from missing pieces is excellent to work with. she is knowledgeable and helpful. when she helped us pack and ship china during a move, her packing was utterly impeccable. any time we consult her about a pattern, she has a quick and informed answer right away!                    louisa h.16:13 19 jun 20                        i had talked with missing pieces staff about my mom's memory lane china. while it was not something they readily needed, they were very helpful in offering other alternatives for finding the china a new home.                    richard r.02:14 01 mar 20                        janice at missing pieces is an absolute gem! as a realtor i commonly am in a situation where china and glassware have to go. janice buys and consigns items that help my clients and if she can't use the items they go to charity so she helps the community as well. top shelf!                    colette & jeff b.17:49 26 feb 20                        missing pieces is a unique space full of many treasures, so make sure you've got plenty of time to check things out. thankfully the friendly and welcoming staff are available to help with any questions. great service!                    melissa d.13:26 19 feb 20                        excellent service! the bowls i ordered were well packed and arrived promptly. unfortunately one had a small defect and the shop rectified the error in a very professional manner. i will happily shop here again knowing that they stand behind their merchandise. the prices were much better than those on an american site i looked at.                    lesley t22:04 17 sep 19                        wonderful staff who are always friendly & helpful, and a high standard of quality to their pieces. i am always exceptionally pleased with any purchase i make.                    he c.04:37 26 jul 18                        i was sad to hear aynsley (the manufacturing plant who made my pattern) in the uk had shut down. how was i to add to my collection? how fortunate to find missing pieces! they found my pattern, brought it in and looks great! so happy this delightful shop is open in winnipeg. amazing, knowledgeable staff and so willing to help!                    marla k.17:04 13 apr 18                        if you have one dinner broken plate and you are the one using chinet missing pieces will find you a replacement quickly and affordably,this is a really great service!
