 robert g. - local guide 
"texas tubes is the best tubing experience on the comal. the location is perfect. if you get there early, you can park right near the water. then get your tube, walk about 20 ft to get in the river and relax for 3 hours. when you're finished, their shuttle (sometimes 2 or 3) will be waiting to return you to your vehicle. this part is critical! i've seen customers of other tube rental companies angry while waiting for that other company to pick them up. in the mean time, i'm chillin on a texas tubes shuttle already halfway to my truck so i can float again. i won't float anywhere else!"
 


 dana m. - local guide 
"been coming here for years. buses are fast and the people are friendly. get here early, it fills up fast. if your staying at the comal river rentals next door, there is a gate in the fence that makes it convenient to come and go without worrying about parking."
