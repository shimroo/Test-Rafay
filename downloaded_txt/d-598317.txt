happy new year! krampus rampant!

i've been up against various deadline dooms and just managed to finish my christmas/new year's mashup holiday card in the nick of time.researching krampus for this, i found a lot of people were posting material about this character from santa's european dark side. maybe it's a reaction to the rough year many people had in 2010 -- or maybe it's because he's just so much fun to draw.best wishes for the new year!©2010 jim wheelock. all rights reserved.

can anybody identify this charles bukowski-related print?

a friend of mine has asked me to help him identify a print he has that illustrates the work of los angeles author charles bukowski. we'd like to know the artist and the portfolio it's from, the publisher, and if possible get an idea of its value. any information would be appreciated. it's clearly influenced by crumb and other american underground cartoonists. the signature appears to contain the name "christian," but is hard to read. any information you have would be appreciated. thanks very much.

gore gore girls, jack the ripper and the road warrior -- 3rd street sketches!!

attractive women in skimpy outfits going at each other with knives -- a typical night in downtown l.a., really. in this case, however, these are not police artist sketches, just some of my recent drawings from the monday night gallery girls sessions at the excellent e3rd steakhouse and lounge in downtown l.a. (http://www.eastthird.com).one of the best things about halloween in the city of angels is the horror and monster-themed drawing sessions that happen at the gg's, the drawing club and other venues.it's been a long time since i've posted drawings on lj. i've been busy working on my and ron bassilian's graphic novel, inferno 2010, which remains in progress. i've been making the sketch sessions, but having had the time to scan and post. this seems like a good time to catch up with some of my recent work.here's a couple from a recent jack the ripper night......and here's a tranquil one of gg founder jen patton on s&m costume night...werewolves, vampires, road warriors and a viking, if you'll click to continue under the cut.( more 3rd street sketchescollapse )thanks for looking.all of this is ©2010 jim wheelock. all rights reserved.

murder! i drew...plus cruela!

from the flyer for last week's gallery girls drawing session, i got the impression the "murder" theme was more of the old '30s hitchcock gentile folks, blood-stained duvet sort. instead, the models excellently went all southern gothic on us... it seemed to be more of a parole violation than a sketch session!!past the violence, you'll find some drawings of the cruela deville character from 101 dalmations that i did last year and never got around to posting.i completely blew the proportions on this next one, but somehow the lady's mutant forehead adds to the creepiness...now on to cruela...these were done at the drawing club back in december and never posted. i guess the model was channeling the meryl streep version of the character from the live-action films, which i've never seen. the original 101 dalmations was my favorite disney film as a kid, and probably is still my favorite. i haven't back to the drawing club in a while, bccause 90% of everything i do happens on thursday nights. i'll get back one of these days, though. more drawings under the cut...( read morecollapse )© 2010 jim wheelock. all rights reserved.

3rd street venuses and wonder women!

it's been months since i've posted here, due to various projects and life things. i've got a backlog of drawings i want to get up here, starting with these most recent ones.lately, i've been going to the gallery girls' monday night drawing sessions at the e3rd steakhouse and lounge in downton l.a. (http://www.eastthird.com). the girls are great as usual, and e3rd's an excellent location, with some of the best and most reasonably priced food i'd had in a long time.last night the theme was venus -- the goddess as opposed to the planet.the theme the week before was a real fun one, with supergirl and wonder woman making an appearance...the caption above reads: "supergirl has come to accept this always happens when she goes drinking with wonder woman".i've never really kept a sketchbook as such, but i've recently found one that i like, and i've been using it a lot for these sessions and for the drink & draws i've been able to make it to lately. more sketches to come in the near future.supergirl and wonder woman are tm dc comics, of course. my stuff is © 2010 jim wheelock. all rights reserved.

more chicken endangerment -- annie oakley sketches!!

here are my drawings from another great session at the drawing club, this time with model marrisa gomez essaying the role of cowgirl legend annie oakley. as a bonus, when we continue under the cut, you'll find a great 1950s comic cover that was used to promo the session.as usual, it's taken a while for me to post these. one of the hazards of my experimenting with brown drawing paper is that it takes me centuries to get scans i can settle for. let's get the traditional old west chicken threatening out of the way first:and now, cowgirl thrills and adventures continue under the cut...( read morecollapse ) i can't get out of my mind the lyrics to one of the old cowboy songs played in the background while we were drawing. it was a singin' cowhand crooning, "i'm as blue as the alamo".  something just wrong there that i can't quite place.anyway, check out my fellow artists' great work at http://www.thedrawingclub.com/blog. you'll have to scroll down a bit for this batch. there was a great cruella de ville (101 dalmations) session last week. so enjoy those on the way down. i'll get my drawings of her scanned and up here... well, sooner or later.all my stuff © 2009 jim wheelock. all rights reserved.
