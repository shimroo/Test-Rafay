listen to recent releasessinger/songwriters angie miller and tony denikos have found inspiration in a collection of memoirs from angie’s father, mike miller, entitled "pot au feu et lagniappe". the stories touch on family, insecurity, alcoholism, catholicism, racism, cars, and dogs. told with a strong southern voice, these evocative reflections are alternately heartbreaking, hilarious, and insightful. angie and tony collaborate to retell these stories in music and create an additional path to the lush landscapes and emotions of mike miller’s youth.angie says, “the rich language and vivid scenes he created seemed like perfect fodder for songwriting, so i asked permission to attempt a song based on one of his stories. dad was thrilled at the idea. i contacted tony denikos, a close friend and colleague who is also one of my dad’s favorite songwriters. he agreed to join me in the project.”“dancing with preacher,” is based on a short vignette about angie’s grandparents, elaine and edwin (aka "preacher”), meeting for the first time at a dance hall near opelousas, louisiana. it features angie and tony on guitar and vocals, buddy griffin on pedal steel, scott smith on bass, and jen smith on backing vocals.“billy,” is based on a story about mike miller's uncle who was a welder on oil rigs in the gulf. it features tony on guitar and lead vocals, angie also on guitar and backing vocals, and brian simms on accordion..“point man”, is a reflective song from the point of view of an older man sitting by the fire with his dogs. it features angie on guitar and vocals and tony on guitar and backing vocals.“black puppy” comes with a warning label: if you are sensitive to sad dog stories, get a box of tissues before you listen to this one. tony is on guitar, lead vocals, and harmonica. angie is on acoustic guitar and backing vocals. scott smith on piano.“drive” is told in the voice of a young boy who has just learned to drive. he not only finds a new sense of freedom, but also an avenue of escape. angie is on acoustic guitar and vocals, tony on acoustic guitar and backing vocals, and scott smith on bass and ebow.“jawa” is about a teenager’s quest to own a broken-down czechoslovakian motorcycle. (the 1950s southern louisiana pronunciation may differ from the czechoslovakian one.) tony is on lead vocals, guitar, and harmonica, angie on backing guitar and backing vocals, mark st. pierre on drums, scott smith on bass and backing vocals, and jen smith on backing vocals.all songs are produced by angie miller and tony denikos, and recorded and engineered by scott smith at the wood and stone room in baltimore."pot au feu et lagniappe" by mike miller is available on amazon.







 

more songs from “stories” cd release
















stories (2018)ultimately, as the title suggests, this is a collection of stories. the feel may veer from delta blues to ballad to a shuffle, but in the end, it's americana-influenced tales gathered from family lore, personal experience, and modern society.i feel lucky to have been able to work with some of the finest musicians in the area on this project. i just want to give them a little shout out:larry melton (bass) and brad kimes (drums) are the rock-solid rhythm section with ryan cullen coming out from behind the mixing board to make a cameo appearance on drums for “little napoleon”. meg murray and dan haas perform beautiful backing vocals, tim stanley (trumpet) and jennifer krupa (trombone) coming in with the horn section, and erin snedecor adds the gorgeous and mournful cello parts. topher sisson brings his magic to acoustic and electric guitars as does ahren buchheister, who also adds accordion, melodica, dobro, and pedal steel to the mix (a man of many talents). ryan cullen, owner and engineer at annapolis audio lab, did an amazing job pulling it all together as co-producer of the project (and percussionist). thanks to everyone!
