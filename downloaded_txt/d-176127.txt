as a horsewoman myself, i decided to help horses and their owners in a way that benefits everyone. i am certified in equine sports massage, and i'm in the final stages of completing an associate degree in equine science from scottsdale community college. i have many years of experience with horses that vary in breed, discipline, and training. through this experience i wholeheartedly believe in the benefits that regular massage provides for your horse's health, happiness, and performance. hoursmonday – friday8am – 10pmsaturday8am – 10pmsunday8am – 10pmcontactphone602.505.5825faxn/aemailartfulequine@gmail.com
