 the question is, "what are the 3 most important factors
to
consider when choosing a marco island villa?" 
as
you drive onto the island via the jolley bridge, you'll
take a left
turn on to bald eagle st.  by this time you have noticed
what  a beautiful island it is.  if you have been to
other
beach front communities you would see billboards exhorting your kids to
spend money at go-carts, wax museums, and other tourist
traps. 
not on marco island!  this is a community which maintains its
tropical roots. far down the palm lined streets of south seas and
bonita ct. you will find our vacation home on the cul-du-sac. you
notice right away
the privacy of this neighborhood.  sure, if our neighbors, are
out
on their bikes ,  they are going to wave and greet you, but
this
is one quiet neighborhood.  you now know that you have left
the
condo and office buildings behind.  the only sound you hear is
the
occasional sound of pleasure boat traffic drifting down the canal.you
turn into the driveway leading to the double
garage, stop the car and run to the front door. step in the door and
your eyes are grabbed by the waterview through the wide patio
doors.  past the patio, over the large, heated pool, and
private
dock, all you can see is water!   all you
can  think
about now is relaxing in a lounge chair.  meanwhile your kids
are
hopping into the pool and you can relax because the pool is visible
from the patio,  bedrooms, family  room, and
kitchen.
