we

                                          7'5'', 297 lbs,
                                          blushing,

welcome to a quick
                                      history of the semi-literary
                                      website known as eyeshot's
                                        hindenburg complex of infidels
                                        & crusaders ("eyeshot.net"

                                      or "eyeshot," for short). a few things
                                        inspired our "launch" in
                                      august 1999:
1) an article by
                                        vince passaro in harper's
                                        said "with the internet comes
                                        the possibility of such an
                                        inexpensive distribution system
                                        of large blocks of language that
                                        writing essentially will become
                                        volunteer work, and similiarly
                                        oriented toward triage for
                                        victims of our culture."

2) circa 1998/99,
                                        the good-natured awesomeness of
                                        our experience with the saintly
                                        people at the barcelona
                                          review, our
                                        correspondence, translation, and
                                        publication on one of the
                                        earliest/best lit sites, amazed
                                        us. (all this relatively new
                                        internet stuff seemed really
                                        cool at the time -- revolutionary
                                        was a not uncommon word used
                                        with regard to its potential.)

3) a lot of
                                        semi-crappily conceived,
                                        unattractively named
                                        conventional sites at the time
                                        seemed to ape well-established
                                        print journals that consistently
                                        (and, in retrospect, quite
                                        rightfully) rejected the eyeshot
                                        editor's early submissions. and
                                        even some of the less-pukey
                                        conventional sites, like the
                                        now-defunct blue moon review,
                                        repeatedly rejected our shit.
                                        and so we reduced the
                                        then-unbridgeable aesthetic
                                        distance between editor and
                                        writer by submitting our stories
                                        to our own site and then
                                        accepting them (though please
                                        realize that we didn't bother
                                        sending submissions and
                                        acceptance letters to and from
                                        ourself, largely because we're
                                        not insane). and we ultimately
                                        tried to make a place that used
                                        the medium to its advantage,
                                        offering rolling posts instead
                                        of so-called "old-media issues."

so, in sum thus
                                          far: some writer/reader
                                        dude in his mid-to-late 20s, a
                                        loser who'd worked in an
                                        antiquarian bookstore for $7/hr
                                        and had just started working as
                                        a medical editor, this wannabe
                                        schlub who couldn't get his
                                        stuff published anywhere,
                                        started a lit site. and then he
                                        populated the site with his own
                                        unpublishable stories,
                                        attributed to pseudonyms. before
                                        too long, uninspiring
                                        submissions rolled in, with the
                                        occasional story that made it
                                        all worthwhile. he continued to
                                        post his own oft-rejected
                                        stories under ridiculous
                                        pseudonyms, and short9oddities
                                        that could only be posted online
                                        (and only if the editor and
                                        writer were one and the same).

a move to brooklyn
                                        in august 2000, plus the very
                                        important arrival of a digital
                                        camera, helped particularize and
                                        prettify the site's very simple
                                        design (a hybrid of suck.com and
                                        the original framed look of ubu.com).
                                        despite the simplicity, we've
                                        always wanted things to seem
                                        intentionally labyrinthine in
                                        terms of navigation.

so now what? oh


                                        boy! life in the big city! nyc
                                        feted our undernourished
                                        consciousness with certain
                                        cultural events, for example an
                                        early mcsweeney's


                                          reading and an after-hours

oldham


                                          show. and then things
                                        started to take off in the
                                        summer of 2001 when we posted a
                                        very popular piece about american
writers


                                          and their hair soon after
                                        a bawdy interview (that's
                                        recently been removed) with a
                                        very flexible man. then the
                                        oddities we posted got odder
                                        as a crew of youngish writer
                                        types, many inspired by the
                                        humorous heydey of mcsweeneys.net,
                                        started submitting postable
                                        stuff. 
did the eyeshot
                                        editor try to differentiate
                                        eyeshot from the previously
                                        mentioned site? he did. (that
                                        little q&a just then was a
                                        little joke related to a syntax
                                        trend at the turn of the century
                                        that derived from the
                                        aforementioned popular site.)
                                        maybe for a while a few hundred
                                        people who were "into" offbeat
                                        literary websites might have
                                        thought of eyeshot as the
                                        perverted alternative to the
                                        previously mentioned,
                                        extraordinarily more popular
                                        site -- a site that at the time
                                        inspired (or influenced or
                                        spurred or in some way was
                                        related to, or at least seemed
                                        always in the mix somehow or a
                                        dominant domain to consider if
                                        starting a new lit site etc) the
                                        creation of sites and print
                                        journals that lived for a while
                                        and then either: 
1) died a quick
                                        death like the american
                                          journal of print, reinventing


                                          the world, or facsimilation

2) lingered
                                        lovingly then expired like haypenny,
                                        (parenthetical note), dicey

                                          brown, uber.nu, sweet
                                          fancy moses, surgery of modern
                                          warfare, pig iron malt,
                                          bullfight, somewhat, absinthe
                                          literary review, taint
                                          magazine, and finally
                                        after a long good fight, pindeldyboz. 
3) or have somehow
                                        sort of humbly and awesomely
                                        beat on against the endless
                                        current of blogs, youtubes,
                                        social-networking hubs etc, such
                                        as hobart, monkeybicycle,
                                        and opium, or the
                                        slightly later yankee pot roast.

4) there was also a
                                        later wave of kindred sites,
                                        some still operational or at
                                        least still accessible, created
                                        and run by contributor friends,
                                        such as duck and herring,
                                        konundrum engine
                                          literary review, lamination colony,
                                        and pequin.

5) and king wenclas and the underground literary
                                        alliance were always
around


                                        for us to muss with. 
whew. lots of
                                        sites. (so sad that most of
                                        those sites in italics above, if
                                        you enter their old urls in a
                                        browser, now lead to weird
                                        generic pages offering debt
                                        consolidation --  if not
                                        something more hardcore, as
                                        expected, like sites loaded with
                                        links to unicorn


                                          porn). and of course there
                                        were other sites sort of
                                        unrelated to these (like failbetter, 5_trope) and
                                        others not necessarily unknown
                                        to us (though more or less
                                        forgotten), and some may even
                                        still exist . . . 
please remember
                                        that you're reading the history
                                        of eyeshot, and that we're
                                        talking about the history of
                                        literary sites from our pov, as
                                        opposed to that of, for example,
                                        webdelsol.com,
                                        which has always been around and
                                        which linked to eyeshot early
                                        on, thereby amazing us by
                                        officially recognizing us. but
                                        what's cool, we think, is that
                                        all these sites -- related or
                                        not, still alive or not -- were
                                        part of the first, real,
                                        semi-communal wave of using this
                                        thing called the internet to
                                        post writing that was generally
                                        accessible, admirably
                                        amateurish, often
                                        bawdy/humorous, and sometimes
                                        even unexpectedly inspired.

so then what
                                          happened? 
around 2002,
                                        blogging became popular!

                                        started blogging (we won't get

and as the trend
                                        turned toward blogging,
                                        excitement re: the creation and
                                        upkeep of silly lit sites seemed
                                        to steadily ebb . . . 
but, seriously, for
                                        a time there really had been a
                                        sense of excitement about all
                                        this online lit shit! a

                                        contributed to a handful of
                                        sites and everyone e-mailed each
                                        other and met in person and made
                                        babies or got married and some
                                        have been together ever since.

                                      xmas, we posted nothing.
                                      all this (and way more) happened
                                      before 2004. 
but then . . . 
in 2004, the
                                        eyeshot editor moved to iowa
                                        city to attend a graduate
                                        program, where it was rumored
                                        that he would learn to write
                                        creative fiction, or at least
                                        chill for two years and watch a
                                        lot of baseball and bergman and
                                        herzog movies. despite all the
                                        time graduate school provided,
                                        natural inertia and midwestern
                                        ennui (especially compared to
                                        all that old-fashioned energy of
                                        nyc) and other mysterious forces
                                        teamed up to decrease the
                                        frequency of eyeshot's
                                        postings!!! slower times in
                                        eyeshotville . . . but we showed
                                        heart! we never quit. we offered
                                        correspondence
from


                                          distant lands. we
                                        experienced a tornado.
                                        and we celebrated the passing of
                                        a
                                          master writing teacher.

in 2006, we
                                        resituated eyeshot operations in
                                      philadelphia .
                                        . . things continued to move
                                        along relatively stably, if
                                        still comparatively slowly, at a
                                        pace of about one new posting a
                                        month. 
in late 2008, we
                                        had a burst of e-enthusiasm,
                                        adding the readerly


                                          resonance chamber and a collection of well-liked
                                          posts. 
in 2009, roderic
                                        crooks's "fuckbuddy" took second
                                        place for the 2008
million


                                          writers award, and on july
                                        23, almost exactly ten years
                                        after we conceived the site, we decided to stop reading
                                        submissions and posting short
                                        fiction so eyeshot might evolve
                                        or dissolve.  
in august 2009, we
                                        started posting a few things but
                                        not exactly like some efffin'
                                        blog, thank you.  
and then in october
                                        2009, we started reading
                                        submissions again and posting
                                        new contributions. 

in january 2010, we


                                          called it quits again in
                                        terms of reading
                                        submissions.  
but then, in june
                                        2010, we started reading
                                        submissions and on july
4,


                                          2010, we started doing
                                          bimonthly "issues"
                                        featuring one story and other
                                        stuff.  
we stopped reading
                                        submissions again in late
                                        november 2010. but then in
                                        december 2010 we started doing
                                        something different and
                                        undefined that vaguely felt like
                                        the good old days when ye olde
                                        internet love was new. 

in mid-to-late
                                        february 2011, we reopened
                                        submissions -- but not
                                        electronic (e-mail) submissions:
                                        you had to send a postcard with
                                        your e-mail address and as much
                                        of the story as you can fit on
                                        it. this
actually


                                          worked for a bit. we also
                                        outsourced our daily archiving,
                                        announcements, and general
                                        evangelical activities to a site
                                        called twitter but then thought
                                        that was idiotic and deleted our
                                        account.  
on october 26,
                                        2011, we reopened electronic
                                        submissions and decided to try
                                        to put some energy into creating
                                        a safe online space for spastic
                                        semi-literary texts. 

on april 21, 2012,
                                        we closed submissions again
                                        (this time forever!). again, we
                                        figured the site would continue
                                        (maybe through solicitations or
                                        editor-provided posts etc) but
                                        we wouldn't read contributions
                                        from strangers.  
but then on july


                                      21, 2012, we decided to open submissions
                                      again. wtf not. 

                                      and then on august 25, 2014, we
                                      decided to call
it


                                        quits for good, once and for
                                      all. for real this time . . .

and then in july 2017 decided to
                                      re-open submissions because why
                                      not. 

and then a little before the
                                        end of 2017 decided to close
                                        again, most likely forever. just
                                        don't have the time or energy or
                                        interest.
