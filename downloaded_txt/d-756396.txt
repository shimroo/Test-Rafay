 what we do
spotco has played a leading role in developing broadway’s most iconic brands, from the stenciled typography of rent to the strikingly bold star of hamilton. we are a team of storytellers and research nerds, digital gurus and media-buying mavens — all driven by both brains and guts. we take laughter seriously and leave our egos at the door. we celebrate diversity because we know it makes us stronger. we are passionate about what we do, and compassionate in how we do it. we believe our end goal is to enrich the lives of audiences from all around the world. and that is what motivates us.
