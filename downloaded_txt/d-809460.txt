saints constantine & helen greek orthodox cathedral of the pacific may sound like the grand title of a church reserved for a specific ethnicity, but we are proud to say that our congregation is the most diverse greek orthodox parish in the united states. we are christians of pacific island, east asian, european and african ancestry. we're young and old, rich and poor, well-educated and not-so-well-read, who are unified in our love for each other and our lord jesus christ.
