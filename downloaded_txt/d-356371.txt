can you get hiv from fingering someone?



1) while i found a lot of info on oral sex and aids on this blissfully honest site, there didn't seem to be any info on "fingering" (not sure of the technical term?) a woman. i'm in a high risk aids country and recently "used my fingers" for a couple of minutes to delight a local woman who has turned out to be having her period. after noticing a considerable amount of bloody discharge, we stopped. but do i have a considerable aids risk? there were no cuts on the fingers i used but a small, possibly healed, cut on the thumb of the same hand. break it down for me. i'm a bit on edge.
2) can you contract hiv from anal fingering your partner if you had cuts/scratches on your fingers?

do plant-based sunscreens work?



recently i bought a sun protection cream from a health food store. the cream claims to provide sun protection (it's labeled spf 15) by a plant complex made of paba, willow bark extract, myrtle and myrtus leaf extract. it says that myrtle and myrtus leaf help protect from both uva and uvb.
my questions are as follows:
1) can this paba complex provide the sun protection it claims (spf 15 for both uva and uvb rays)? the reason i am asking this is because until now i had only heard of sun protection by titanium dioxide or chemicals like octyl mexaoxycinnamate (did i get it right?). so i am curious to find out.
2) i notice a slight burning sensation in my eyes after i apply the product on my face. is it true that paba is a common irritant? (since i notice many products proudly claiming paba-free i wonder if it's really not good for you.)
please help. i hope this question falls within your realm of expertise. after all, you are the 'know it all' around here, aren't you?
