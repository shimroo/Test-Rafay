turning your dreams into reality! 





i would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your interest in proformance unlimited and introduce you to our company. as you can see from our photos and videos each engine is built to precision with much pride and care. there is a lot more in technical design than just picking out parts. with so many companies out on the web today to chose from, it’s hard to make a decision. some may talk a good game and present themselves well, but can they really deliver your dream engine. this statement reminds me of a quote i heard once “those who can, do. those who can’t, teach”. we dyno test literary 100’s of engine combinations each year and with our skills and knowledge you will know you made the right choice. we personally custom design the proper power plant to match you to your vehicle and its needs. we will be up front and honestly tell you, if your engine selection is right for you and the final application. doing this ensures that you end up with your dream engine that will stand the test of time. we are most proud of our satisfied customer base. when you purchase an engine from proformance unlimited you become part of a growing family and you can be assured you made the right choice. you have my personal guarantee that we will build you a product we all can be proud of.thank you,doug mascaritola – president
