noir chronicles
repeat new york times bestselling author christopher moore returns to the mean streets of san francisco in this outrageous follow-up to his madcap novel noir.
guys. dames. san francisco in 1947. a deadly african snake. an airforce general from roswell, new mexico. what could go wrong?
death merchant chronicles

doing the job of death didn’t quite work out the way you had hoped, now you’re trapped in the body of a fourteen-inch tall meat puppet with a giant dong. things could get weird.


you’re a hypochondriac and you have to raise your baby daughter on your own, and now you’ve been given the job of death. someone has to do it.

chronicles of pocket the fool

set adrift by his pirate crew, pocket of dog snogging washes up on the sun-bleached shores of greece, where he hopes to dazzle the duke with his comedic brilliance and become his trusted fool.


pocket the diminutive english fool is envoy to venice, where he’s managed to make a lot of enemies, a senator, a merchant, and a soldier, and only one friend, a moorish general called othello who has troubles of his own.


he’s the least powerful person at court, but as king lear divides his kingdom among his three daughters, pocket the fool is behind the scenes, pulling the strings, and trying to bed some princesses.

sacré bleu

the greatest painters of their time are being enchanted by a color. lucien lessard and toulouse-lautrec need to figure out if that’s what killed their friend vincent van gogh.

vampires in san francisco

goth girl abby normal has waited her whole life for something dark and exotic to happen to her, and now her dark lord has chosen her as minion — to do laundry and battle a giant vampire cat?


they’re young, in love, and allergic to sunshine. someone still has to do the laundry.


a city girl with a new thirst for life but no instruction book and a boy from the midwest looking to find his fortune, and maybe a girlfriend who won’t eat him.

the pine cove books

it’s christmas in pine cove and someone just killed santa with a shovel, but the angel has been sent to perform a christmas miracle.


what happens when a whole town goes off its meds at once? libidos rise and so does an ancient, lonely sea beast looking for company and a snack.


a boy, his dæmon, and a small coastal town that needs to get rid of them.

fluke

marine mammal biologist nathan quinn has spend his life looking for the message in the song of humpback whales, and now he may have found it. it appears to be a warning.

lamb

thirty years of christ’s life were never told, now his rascally childhood friend biff has been raised from the dead to tell that story.

island of the sequined love nun

when you crash a pink, cosmetic company jet and lose your pilot’s license, and an offer comes from a remote pacific island to fly medical supplies, no questions asked, it has to be a blessing. right?

coyote blue

the crow trickster god coyote is in the modern world to give sam hunter everything he ever wanted. be careful what you ask for.

or, in the order they were written…
