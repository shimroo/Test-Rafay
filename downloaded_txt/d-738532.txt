      relatively certain no one reads this any more...

but that will not stop me from posting.  unemployment gives me an endless amount of time to play on the internet, and there's a lot of good stuff out there.today, my focus in on the church sign generator, which is exactly what it sounds like.  i hope this will provide everyone with hours of amusement.

      not dead, and some cool art links

digital empire, a neat little art project that seeks to link digital viewing with real-world scale,and the fm 100 hue test, a test of your ability to arrange colors in hue order.  i got a 6 the first try.  lowest score is 0.  it also tells you what colors you have trouble with.  i have trouble with indigo, apparently.all i do anymore (aside from apply for jobs) is read design blogs.

      stuff white people like

this blog takes a hilarious anthropological approach to the subject of white people and their tastes. it's pretty funny. and true! as a white person, i can say that i like many of the things mentioned.not new balance shoes, though. that's lame.

      what claudia wore

someone is going through her old baby-sitters club books, finding and posting the outfits worn by claudia:"you never knew what kind of outfit or hairdo you'll see on claud. for instance, on the day of this meeting, she was wearing a red shirt with mexican hats and cactus plants printed on it, and blue-and-white-striped pants held up by polka-dotted suspenders. on her head was what looked like an engineer's cap (it matched her pants), and dangling from her ears were miniature cowboy boots, which she'd made herself."
