becoming what god intended 5-course concentration

 













bc101 foundations of the spiritual lifea course on the 12 biblical truths every christian should know.foundations of the spiritual life is a discipleship process that leads the student to live within the life of the trinity so as to experience god as an abba father, jesus as our identity, and the holy spirit as our helper.  

  













bc102 head to heart - small group experiencesa discipleship intensive on what every christian needs to learn, integrate, and experience.head to heart: experiencing the father's embrace. the head to heart small group experience may well be the most effective and most thoughtful group experience presently being practiced in the united states. it is truly transformational with long-term, positive results in the lives of the participants.

  













bc103 theology of romansa course on the theological backbone of discipleship.the purpose of this course is to teach how the contents of romans created the backbone for the material in the foundation of the spiritual life course. this is to create confidence in the student to live their lives out of trinitarian theology. romans teaches what it means to truly surrender to our good god.

  













bc104 theology of emotionsa course on discovering what the bible says about emotions & how to minister to your emotions.theology of emotions surveys the old and new testament's description of the source, function, and management of emotions. the purpose is to create a true biblical psychology for the benefit of pastoral counselors, christian counselors and disciplers, and bible teachers.  as part of this course, we will examine the place of suffering and how scripture powerfully addresses the pain of life.

  













bc105 skills for livinga course on creating a bridge for sharing the gospel through secular versions of bwgi ministries materials.skills for living is a secular version of a christian mental health program originally designed to train counselors in the 60 mental health centers of the universities of beijing. this course serves as an introduction to mental health principles and instructs how to create a bridge for sharing the gospel. in this course, we will discuss eight skills for living and also how to teach biblical mental health principles to christians.
