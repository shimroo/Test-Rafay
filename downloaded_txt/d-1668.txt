lock haven


come home to the haven, where our greatest asset is you.








about lock haven
set along the susquehanna river overlooking signature central pennsylvanian shops and places to eat, we’re perfectly situated for you to find a new point of view or simply see things from a different perspective. a perfect spot? our levee riverwalk — a nice jog or fun bike ride steps from campus leading to insta-worthy backdrops, especially in the fall. and if you find yourself a little lost, no worries, the campus bell tower is always within earshot … a landmark to guide you home through your first year to your last, a comfort you’ll certainly capture on your phone under the neighboring lock haven archway on graduation day and each time you return as an alum.

living in lock haven


come home, as we love to say ... where more than 1,700 students do each year, living between residence halls, two apartment complexes, and a sweet suite-style complex — all within steps of dining options, available recreation, and picturesque views along the confluence of the susquehanna river and bald eagle creek. some unique specialties include pet-friendly and gender-inclusive housing. 
no matter where you come from — a big school district or a high school where everyone knows everyone — you’ll find your niche here.

campus dining


food for thought ... and it all starts with our flagship all-you-care-to-eat dining facility, bentley hall. here you’ll dine on hearty home-cooked meals, fresh out of the oven pizza, and house-made desserts. and then on your way out, hit up the bentley market for a fresh smoothie and your favorite snack treats.

student life


there’s a lot of forever moments at lock haven. that’s what college promises to offer, but it’s different here … it just is. generations of bald eagles relive and celebrate them all the time … at weddings, on vacations, crossing paths in the career field, and especially each fall “back home” during homecoming. 
these moments resonate from all walks of the haven experience — from residence halls to apartments, from classes to study lounges, from clubs to organizations, from first year to the graduation stage. and when you get to the haven ... you'll see it!


activities and organizations













get locked in


you’ll find ample opportunities at the haven for all levels of fitness and athletic ability — including playing on or cheering for one of 21 intercollegiate athletics programs. get competitive or go the recreational route. get in the game by testing your mettle during intramural competition (such as bowling, field hockey, men’s and women’s flag football) or step up and square off against our rivals as a member of a club team, including boxing, men’s and women’s rugby, and fly fishing.


athletics and fitness













inclusive campus community


you're coming to an accepting and supportive environment that fosters a strong commitment to cultural enrichment and social awareness. lock haven is a mosaic of cultures, backgrounds, and identities, enriching your educational experience.
