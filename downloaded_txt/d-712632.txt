greg howe music


wheelhouse (featuring richie kotzen)
âwheelhouseâ marks howeâs tenth studio album, which was voted #6 of the top 20 best guitar albums of the decade by guitar world magazine

tracks like âtempest pulseâ and âthrow downâ showcase howeâs infectious tone and fretboard wizardry while eclectic tracks like â2 in 1â combine a funk-infused vibe with forties swing. but perhaps one of the biggest highlights on wheelhouse; and one that long-time followers of howeâs career will certainly find appealing, is the track, âshady laneâ. 

a song originally written by howe and his brother back in the early nineties, on wheelhouse, "shady lane" is given a 21st century spin with an emotionally charged vocal performance by richie kotzen (winery dogs, mr. big). kotzen also complements his fellow shrapnel alumni by contributing a blistering guitar solo to the track as well.
