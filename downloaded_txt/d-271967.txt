"everyone at wallander was so friendly and helpful. bill twardy made my dream of finding a beach home come true. thank you wallander realty!"
steve fernandez



"psa about a wonderful company who helped us find a last-minute beach house a couple of weeks ago. we tried to work with randall realty and the experience was horrible! thank goodness we found william twardy just in time! from start to finish he was fantastic! thanks for taking such good care of us. we had an amazing vacation! there are great deals this time of year and the beaches are empty! call bill this year or next to book a week. you won’t regret it! ?"
christina henriques sayles



"bill twardy guided me through the rough challenges of buying and owning my own home. i could not be happier with my own home and most of with bill’s friendship and help. he is what is making wallander realty great."
