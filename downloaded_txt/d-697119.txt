back in 1986, we invented and shaped the field of 'applied computer vision' for computer-human interaction, and have continued as world leaders, inventing new video gesture control technologies ever since.
the company's multi-patented video gesture control technology (vgc) lets users engage multi-media content, access information, manipulate special effects, even immerse themselves in an interactive 3d virtual world – simply by moving their hands or body. we deliver kinect-like gesture-control without the need to wear, hold or touch anything
in the past 30 years, gesturetek has installed well over 8,000 interactive multi-media displays, kiosks, exhibits, digital signs and 


advertisements, virtual gaming systems and other interactive surface computing solutions, many with multi-touch interactivity.
our technology is used in museums, science centers, amusement parks, trade shows, retail locations, bars & nightclubs, real estate presentation centers, corporate showrooms, boardrooms, digital signage networks and other public spaces such as airports and stadiums. we’re also revolutionizing television production, game development, advertising, virtual videoconferencing, and even the healthcare sector, by applying our technology in unique and innovative ways.

gesttrack3d©
gesturetek is proud of its gesttrack3d sdk, the first patented 3d gesture control software. gesttrack3d lets you control interactive displays and digital signs from a distance with hand and full body gestures. navigate 3d game worlds, & interact with virtually any computer system or public display without ever touching it. gesttrack3d's robust tracking enables device control through a wide range of gestures and poses. gesttrack3d is the perfect solution for pixel accurate, reliable, off-screen computer control in interactive environments because the user does not have to stop to be measured or calibrated with the system, but instead can walk up and begin interacting right away.
the gesttrack3d hand tracker drives touch-free cursor control on windows-based applications by measuring the position of a user's hand(s) within an adjustable volume and distance from the camera. the tracker can follow one hand or two hands to create a multi-touch mode, and can track the xyz coordinates of up to ten hands simultaneously. the multi-tracker detects multiple data points on the user's body (head, torso, hands). the tracker can recognize circle and swipe gestures and can support activities such as scrolling, enlarging, shrinking or rotating items. tracking gestures have been used to control 3d navigation, as well as joystick, driving and drumming simulations.
