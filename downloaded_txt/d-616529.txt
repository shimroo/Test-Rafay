"you see, i think a sculptor is a person who is interested in the shape of things. a poet is somebody who is interested in words; a musician is someone who is interested or obsessed by sounds. but a sculptor is a person obsessed with the form and shape of things, and it’s not just the shape of any one thing, but the shape of anything and everything: the growth of a flower, the hard, tense strength, although delicate form of bone; the strong, solid fleshiness of a beech tree trunk. all these things are just as much a lesson to a sculptor as a pretty girl. . . .it’s as though you have something trying to make itself come to a shape from inside itself. this is, perhaps, what makes me interested in bones as much as in flesh because the bone is the living structure of all living form”. - henry moore (1898-1986)
