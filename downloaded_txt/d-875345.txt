hunt for gems





	 welcome to my web site. i put up this site to help new people to learn more about rock and minerals. i know what it is like to learn something new when you can't find help from some one.
	i've been gem hunting for over 20 years now. i've been faceting now for 
	over 18 years on a graves mack 1 with a xs3 #10 head. i collected gems and minerals from arizona, kentucky, indiana, iowa, ill, mo, north carolina, wisconsin, michigan, mn, montana, idaho and colorado - since 1995i also go gold prospecting in north carolina, california, colorado, idaho, washington, wisconsin, montana, and arizona.
