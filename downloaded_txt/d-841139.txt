the author
my father was a grace baptist minister and i have attended the last church he pastored for over 60 years.  i am an elder of my small rural church in suffolk, england.  it is an aging and declining fellowship.  this colours much of my thinking.  by profession i was a geography teacher.  in 2001 i retired and started writing expositions for this site.  i hope you will,'taste and see', if the work is good.  

i accept what scripture claims for itself: all scripture is god breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of god may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. 2tim3v16.  the bible is unlike any other book - it has shown itself to be inspired of god by meeting men and women's spiritual needs through the centuries. 


 
matthew 13 v52  he (jesus) said to them, "therefore every teacher.... who has been instructed about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old."
