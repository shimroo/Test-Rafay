about us


we champion every child’s need and right to play. 



we envision a future where play is valued in wales for being crucial to a healthy and happy childhood. a country where children can freely explore, discover, develop and grow through play.
we campaign for a play-friendly wales by leading with intention, collaborating with inclusivity, educating with enthusiasm, and supporting with sensitivity.





play






playing is one of the most important aspects of children’s lives. children value time, freedom and quality places to play. when asked about what matters to them, children consistently mention playing and meeting up with their friends.

playwork






playwork is child-centred and ensures that play is the main focus when adults and children spend time together. playwork is a recognised occupation with a set of professional standards, training, qualifications and careers.
