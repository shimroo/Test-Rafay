dear us human rights network,
announcement: relaunch of the us human rights network using the universal periodic review (upr)
we are thrilled to announce the relaunch of the us human rights network, focusing on leveraging the united nations' universal periodic review (upr) process to advance human rights in the united states.
as a collaborative effort, the network will engage civil society, human rights advocates, and grassroots organizations to amplify voices on critical human rights issues. by utilizing the upr mechanism, we aim to hold the u.s. government accountable and push for improvements in areas such as racial justice, gender equality, immigration, and more.
stay tuned for upcoming events and ways to get involved! together, we can drive meaningful change for a just and equitable society.
in community,
ushrn board
molefi askari, chair
eric tars, vice-chair/treasurer/secretary
noel didla, member
