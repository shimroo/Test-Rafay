rpgbot

documentation

some stuff for your object path.

sorry, no support is possible at this time.
warning! the rpgbot takes considerable set-up to customize it for your world.
read the documentation first!


unzip the documentation then create a shortcut to the index.html file.
go to "complete documentation" then "***getting started ***".


run the install file, which will put the rpgbot in c:\bots\rpgbot.
create a shortcut to mbot.exe and click to run the bot.

optionally, place the models on your object path.











magsbot help is no longer available on-line,
but you can download all the help files here.
unzip the mbh.zip file to it's own folder,
then edit magsbot.ini and in the [help] section add
url=path to mbh\mh_contents.htm
for example:
url=c:\bots\magsbot\mbh\mh_contents.htm
then magsbot will use the local help files
when you press f1.
