   it is again my honor to serve a second year as president of the hundred club of connecticut. in 2024 we lost three fallen heroes, two from the fire service and a connecticut state trooper.  it is my hope that this year we do not add any additional fallen heroes.  i am committed to continuing the hundred club's important work for the families of our fallen heroes.since the original founding in 1967, the hundred club of connecticut continues to assist the families of these dedicated public servants, law enforcement, fire service or corrections who have made the ultimate sacrifice. there is no organization in our state that provides this continuous care for the families of our fallen; that is why we are referred to as "the club with a heart.'i would like to thank the individuals who make the hundred club a success, the past and current officers and directors who give their time   in supporting the families of our fallen heroes. i look forward to working with our managing director, officers, and directors to continue the work that our club does for these families.on behalf of the hundred club, i want to also thank all our members for their support. the club is only able to help our families because of you the members, who are so generous, loyal, and committed. robert j. o'shaughnessy

   what is the hundred club of connecticut? it is a charitable, nonprofit organization chartered in 1967 for the specific purpose of assisting the families of police officers, firefighters, and correction officers who lose their lives in the line of duty. how many families has it helped? during its 58 years of existence, the club has aided the families of 106 police officers, 149 firefighters and 7 correction officers who made that supreme sacrifice.  gifts totaling over $14,000,000 have been made to these families. what are the "after care" programs? the club, through its staff and directors, maintains a confidential assessment of family needs and, when necessary, provides help in meeting unexpected expenses and pressing obligations that can overwhelm the family.  arrangements may also be made for other professional services that may be required. a continuing tradition of the club is to provide the surviving spouse and children with extra funds and gifts during the holiday season to make it a joyful time of year. last christmas, $93,935.00 was distributed to the families. as summarized below, the club offers a variety of programs for our families.  we take special pride in those benefits that enhance the education, development and happiness of our children. the fixed indebtedness program:  in addition to the immediate death benefit of $25,000, there is the fixed indebtedness assistance review. under this program, the special assistance committee will review the fixed indebtedness of new families and has the authority, where appropriate, to recommend to the board of directors additional financial relief for individual families concerning large mortgage or other debt service payments.  this supplements our regular special assistance programs in cases of unusual need.catastrophic injury:  it is provided on an as needed basis upon review and discretion of the board of directors.the scholarship program:
upon completion of high school, each student is eligible for up to $40,000 per academic year for tuition and other educational expenses.computers for students: each student, beginning at age 7, is eligible to receive a computer.the summer camp fund: under this program, we will provide four weeks of camp for every child between the ages of 5 and 18 who wishes to take advantage of this opportunity.the birthday $200 savings program:
each child receives $200 every year on his or her birthday, up to and including age 18.a holiday remembrance four times per year:each family receives a food basket at thanksgiving; each surviving spouse a check for $750 at christmas & $200 for each child under 19; and gifts at valentine's day, mother's day and father's day as appropriate. 

 where does the club get its funds? funds are received from the dues of its generous members who pay $250 annually for the privilege of being a part of the hundred club's humanitarian cause. who administers club programs? benefits are established by club officers and its board of directors who meet quarterly to transact business.  committees meet as needed and policies are carried out by the club's staff. how many are on the staff? the club employs a managing director - dale p. hourigan and an assistant to the managing director - alba hanson. the hundred club headquarters is located at 119 oakwood drive, glastonbury, connecticut 06033.  elected officers and directors perform their functions without compensation. who specifically is eligible for club benefits? after a review by the board of directors, club benefits are provided to the surviving spouse and children of law enforcement officers, firefighters or correction officers who die in the line of duty. currently, there are more than 40,000 men and women that serve in these uniformed services in connecticut. is the hundred club of connecticut a unique organization? it is a unique and most prestigious organization of its kind in the nation.  connecticut's club reaches to every corner of the state, assisting families of all firefighters (paid and volunteer), police officers and correction officers. our organization's benefits are so diversified and all encompassing, that our charity has become a model for others to emulate.  this is evidenced by the fact that leaders from all parts of the country have approached the hundred club of connecticut for guidance in forming similar organizations. how did the hundred club movement originate? it was conceived by a detroit businessman, william packer, in 1952.  mr. packer was inspired to organize the first club, raising funds following 2 line-of-duty deaths in 1950 and 1951:  patrolman andreas merlet, eow november 17, 1950 and patrolman stanley j. jerlecki, eow december14, 1951. mr. packer wrote to 100 detroit area businessmen asking for annual donations to create an emergency fund dedicated to aid the surviving families of police officers and firefighters following a line-of-duty death. the response was overwhelming and surpassed the original 100, however the name "the hundred club" survived. do hundred club members receive any benefits?they do not receive nor expect benefits.  they ask nothing in return except the satisfaction from serving the surviving spouse and children of our fallen heroes. what does a membership include?in addition to providing assistance to our hero families, membership includes:one membership card, up to three vehicle shields, up to three window decalsplease note: one free shield is included with your $250.00 membership fee when joining the club.
