information two electrical engineers saw the need for a way to conveniently burn anthracite coal, which was plentiful, but heating with coal had a bad reputation of being dirty and requires maintenance several times a day. our engineers developed an automatic stoker unit equipped with a coal hopper that held enough fuel for several days. this allowed the coal to be cleanly burned and without frequent maintenance. they then saw the need to make a hot water boiler specifically designed to burn coal and built them in multiple sizes to meet our customers’ needs.
