		those of you who use my books have often commented on my husband's photos of animals, which illustrate some of the paragraphs. 
		while i'm not especially objective, i also think he has a gift for revealing animal personalities. 
		that gift is now on display in his book animal portraits, available on amazon. i hope you'll take a look.
