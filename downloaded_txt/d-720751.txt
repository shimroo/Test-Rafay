the u.s. pluto return is really in aquarius and is happening now

dear friend and reader:
what is going on in the united states? the government is getting whacked like a piñata. funding to programs is being cut. federal employees are being offered buyouts. and it looks like they will be replaced by the machine thinking of “ai.”
very simply, the u.s. pluto return. but, you ask, wasn’t that in 2022 or something? isn’t the u.s. pluto in capricorn?
that is partly true. in this video, i explain how and why the pluto return is really happening in aquarius. this is due to the u.s. pluto having precessed into aquarius. so we look at the chart for the precessed pluto return, which happens throughout 2025 and into 2026. the aquarius theme is the conversion of the united states from an oligarchy to a technocracy.
i also explain the concept of a planetary return — somewhat like saturn, chiron or uranus — but most things don’t go for two-and-a-half centuries, not even countries.
this is subscriber-only video utilizing my new chartcam system — so you can see what i’m talking about, with the charts clearly displayed. i’m also including them below. i am now using this two camera system for astrology studio and other presentations. astrology is visual, so let’s see what’s going on.
in this presentation i also explain the public relations strategy of the trump/musk administration. pr is a topic we don’t understand well enough as a society. in many ways, it runs our lives.
i hope you love this interesting, next-generation planet waves video.
with love,

aquarius (jan. 20-feb. 19) — you can relax about one particular matter where you were certain the consequences would be much worse than they were. and the sun changing signs on the 18th will help you feel good about yourself. this is not a matter of opinion. your challenge here is that you have the most unusual sign pisces describing matters of self-esteem, and for many that can describe a deficit. at its best, pisces has a rare value system for this world, which is about service and not profits. and if it’s not about service, then you might enter a delusional state where you experience yourself as greater than, or lesser than — not as on the level. the sun’s transit through this part of your solar chart for the next four weeks will give you a clue what it feels like to be supported by your feelings, rather than flying above them or sinking into them.

pisces (feb. 19-march 20) — the sun entering your sign on the 18th will feel like your ears popping after a long flight in a jetliner. but note that it will be easier to forget all you’ve been through for the past four weeks than it will be to remember. so you might want to devise a means of commemorating what you have learned and making sure you take those experiences and lessons to heart. the opportunities for maturing remain abundant, though bear in mind that this is the last thing most people want. engaging a sane and composed response to adult situations would never fill a stadium or sell a bottle of beer. our society is addicted to petulant, adolescent behavior. and for the past few years you have been subjected to metamorphic pressure to grow up and take responsibility for your existence. to the extent you have, you’re in possession of something precious.

the students were right. it’s genocide.
dear friend and reader:
so it turns out that the pro-palestinian student protesters of last spring were right. it was genocide.
and to decry the daily bombings and bulldozing of gaza and the west bank was not about being antisemitic. it was about standing up for people whose existence was threatened and who knew they were really being removed from their homes by force.
that is euphemistically called ethnic cleansing, or more bluntly, genocide.
the students — mounting the most passionate campus protests since 1970 — risked arrest, beating by the legions of riot police called into opposing them, and expulsion from their university for taking part in nonviolent civil disobedience.
they had some public sympathy, but those who accused them of being anti-jewish got most of the legacy press coverage. protesters were falsely accused of being rioters when most of the direct actions were pretty chill — until the police arrived.
now we know the plan — described this week by pres. trump — is to remove all two million palestinians from the territory and build a kind of self-described israeli riviera along that prime ocean-front real estate once known as gaza. golf courses, luxury villas, hotels, marinas — a regular paradise on the mediterranean .
and the united states would own it. as what? a state? an unincorporated territory like guam? a conquered territory like puerto rico? a giant club med?

aquarius (jan. 20-feb. 19) — you simply must take care of yourself, whatever that means to you. there are mental elements to this, as well as physical and emotional. i’m not suggesting you follow the advice of every youtube ad telling you what not to eat, but rather that you do what you know you need to do — for yourself. this would best be accomplished one thing at a time. step one would be removing any artificial pressure you have yourself under, to accomplish anything, to get all your work done. your emotional stress may be associated with a sense of failure. you’re not concerned with real and present issues, but rather with your concept of the past. also, if you believe that you’re not supposed to be an emotional person and are trying to control everything with your rational mind, give yourself a break. let yourself feel.

pisces (feb. 19-march 20) — you might have the sense that something is bothering you but you don’t know what it is. it is more likely that you have already taken the evasive action you needed to, though if you have not, the sooner you act on any known problem the better. yet your present concerns seem to be reaching into the potential and the imaginary. your solar chart suggests a remedy, which is getting yourself into an expressive state of mind and emotion. notice the influences designed primarily to hold down your feelings and your creative freedom. small moves will mean a lot: find your sketch pad and your pencils. dust off your diary, the old-fashioned kind, on paper. tune up your guitar or ukulele. and give yourself one — just one — opportunity to express your sexuality in a way that is interesting and creative. you will feel better.

aquarius (jan. 20-feb. 19) — be bold about who you are and what you want. and if you’re in a relationship, be bold about who your partner is and what they want. the two are related, and anything that qualifies as a love affair requires both being steadfastly yourself, and generosity of spirit. i know, such a relationship would be the stuff of legend. and maybe you’d rather be alone. yet you do relate to others (whatever the context) and i am suggesting that comes with two parts: be real, and advocate for others. you might ask where getting your needs met fits into this description. there is little you can do about that except notice whether it’s happening, and choose to be where you feel good. you cannot ask another person to “meet your needs.” that is ridiculous. they do, or they don’t.

pisces (feb. 19-march 20) — you have a different value on sex than most other people. in my reading of the pisces psychic structure, it’s an important form of spiritual contact with yourself, with others and with the universe. for most people sex is halfway between a casino and a sewer, but this has never worked for you — and it never will. yet to live this value as real and sincere requires discipline. you must be contained in yourself, and make your sexual choices based on what you know is right for you, and what you understand others to be ready for. yes, you are the one who must determine both of those things. and then there is the matter of identifying those who hold a similar value as you do. here, you’re likely to find that there are slim pickins’. therefore, practicing patience and insisting on sincerity matter. they would have done wonders in the past, and will do so in the future.

the grand distraction and the dark design
dear friend and reader:
the question that nobody is asking is: why?
why exactly do we need “artificial intelligence” at all? what purpose is it going to serve? everyone knows what a blender is for; try making a frozen margarita without one. there is no good answer to the ai question. there are only bad answers, and very bad answers.
and why were the tech billionaires all sitting in the front row at the inauguration with the cabinet in the second row? if you’re wondering where technocracy fits into the trump administration, consider the sun-pluto conjunction in aquarius representing the new administration. [hear special edition starcast.]
that is about the power of the technological establishment to control, well, everything. does your blender need an ip address? does your body need one?

aquarius (jan. 20-feb. 19) — you seem to have a choice of going high, or going deep. but what you might really be looking for is a peak experience of inner awareness. the whole nature of the digital environment is to take people out of direct experience of ourselves; that’s what i mean by inner experience. the nature of your astrology now strongly favors living from your core outward, and not letting the outward part of the experience distract you from the core part. this is true confidence, undistracted by external responses. it takes practice; people respond to you, and you’re more emotionally sensitive than you let on. so you may need a routine of clearing your energy field of disturbance. this can also involve a practice of engaging with people close to you in specific and structured ways, such as regularly asking them, “so what’s on your mind?” this counts for being receptive and it also counts for giving people a chance to speak up if they have any grievances. and you limit your concerns to the specific things they say rather than what you imagine they might be. this is all rather honest and direct, which is exactly the point. there is a measure of immunity in insisting that people be on the level — and being so yourself. the benefit is that you get to focus on what really matters, rather than being distracted by drama, gossip, and other forms of social games. just remember, those games serve their purpose — toxic though it is.

pisces (feb. 19-march 20) — the theme this month is not just taking personal responsibility for your life, but also claiming the rewards that come with it. i raise this issue in a time when the role of “victim” is exalted and rewarded; when it is unassailable; when anyone who questions this social theory is just perpetuating “victimization.” whole empires are built on the notion of the victim (oprah) and it’s the easiest way to take a rocket ride to one’s 15 minutes of world-fame. and, it’s wholly self-defeating. yes there are times when people are entirely passive and shit just happens. (those too call for careful forensic analysis — and appropriate response.) but that’s not what i’m on about. i mean boldly taking over your function of making your decisions, for better or worse. and i’m talking about going back through your history and doing some cleanup work on what has happened in the past (by whatever means) and taking full ownership. hence, a history of childhood abuse calls for therapy (not raging against or blaming others). bad relationship choices call for making better ones. and the ways in which your neglect or self-interest have hurt others also call for a reckoning, which may include making that difficult phone call to apologize. our society is in a grotesque state right now, largely because nobody wants to take responsibility for anything — and is not encouraged to do so. the upshot here is that in your life, the buck stops with you.

life during wartime
heard about houston? heard about detroit?
heard about pittsburgh, pa? — david byrne
dear friend and reader:
last night, one of my clients in the awakening series of live readings said, “i don’t trust anything anymore.”
that about sums up the total effect of the environment we are living in. beyond the horrifying impact of specific events — the shootings, the holy wars, the nuclear threats, the sex scandals, the fires, the floods, and the frequent attacks on civic life — the effect of the total environment is to destroy trust.
by trust, i mean trust in existence, in yourself, in one another, in humanity, and in various authorities to hold society together, handle emergencies and protect people. this no longer seems to be the role of these people or entities in any form.
it’s often passed off as lack of judgment or preparation; as bad decisions or unforeseen circumstances. critics of the response are insultingly called “monday morning quarterbacks.”
i’ve been covering deadly corporate and government antics since i was 19-years-old. there is always foreknowledge; there is always warning; there are always studies and predictions and admissions saying exactly what will develop. there are often good plans for how to handle difficult situations. and they are usually ignored.

capricorn (dec. 22-jan. 20) — there is something driving you, by which i mean a source of motivation. the question is whether it’s about engaging your feelings, or avoiding them. it looks as if you’re split down the middle on this, though powerful forces are insisting that you actually confront how you feel. you may well be ensnared in a problem that’s going around — to do so would mean opening up a dimension of past crisis and pain. and this is just not interesting, and it’s not pleasant. yet here is where motivation comes in, which generally gets filed as “the desire for instant gratification” these days. your long-term mental and emotional wellbeing would be your ideal actual motive, and this will require pushing the pause button on letting others decide what is right for you. in fact, they don’t know, and you need to find out.

aquarius (jan. 20-feb. 19) —
the fundamental tension in your solar chart is between what you want, and what you want to do every day. anyone who has ever accomplished a long-term goal knows that it’s done a little at a time over a sustained period. and this can involve setting aside other seeming priorities — at least for a few hours a day. now is an excellent time to experience a little of that discomfort in order to establish habits and priorities that get you to your longer-term goal. use the tools of structure and timing to keep your focus. for example, if you’re planning to put two hours a day into a project you might be resisting, start the day with it and get it behind you. just about anything can wait for a couple of hours, and after a while you will create a workflow and a container for getting what you want.

live stream of jimmy carter arriving in the capitol building.
jimmy carter and the crisis of democracy
dear friend and reader:
this has been quite a week for pomp and ritual in washington, dc. on monday was broadcast the certification of the electoral college results, an all-day affair consisting of top congressional officials and vice president harris opening envelopes from the fifty states and determining that each one looked kosher. trump was declared the winner at 1:37 pm est.
the big news was that nobody “stormed the capitol” or “staged an insurrection.”
previously, only the wonk who was president of the high school political club knew or cared about this pro-forma procedure until a fuss was made in 2021. sadly, i forgot to wear my electoral college sweatshirt for the occasion. (i attended and double-majored in art and hanging out.)
tuesday, attention shifted to the capitol building’s exterior and then the great rotunda, as the body of jimmy carter made its final return to washington for an elaborate state funeral.
he received the full customary treatment: representatives of all the armed forces present, braving the cold; the riderless horse, symbolizing the fallen leader; the solemn-looking men and ladies standing waiting under the dome for the coffin to arrive and lie in state. my god, we are still a great nation after all.
carter’s contribution to that greatness is that he is being billed as an ordinary, cardigan-wearing, decent man who became president and wanted us to turn down the thermostat. in the day of the datsun, he had the nerve to expect cars to get better gas mileage.
his administration was troubled, ostensibly by that very decency, but we shall remember him as a good christian and as someone who built homes for the motivated poor. he would say things like, “the bond of our common humanity is stronger than the divisiveness of our fears and prejudices.”
and everyone thinks, what a lovely man to have as our leader. at least there was one.

james jacques joseph tissot, “journey of the magi,” c.1894
the three magi (magicians or sorcerers) who are said to have followed a star to the place of jesus’ birth were therefore astrologers. mean old herod wants them to come back and tell him the location of the child, but they were warned in a dream not to, and they take a different route home. in honor of caspar, melchior and balthazar, i propose a shrine to the astrologers in every church. the tissot above is my favorite illustration of the magi and their entourage.

planet waves weekly for january 9, 2025 by eric francis
capricorn (dec. 22-jan. 20) — it will help if you set aside presumptions and expectations of others, and ask them what they want. you may also politely inquire whether something is troubling them — if you think something might be. however, be prepared for a tale of woe, and consider that there are other points of view before you get dragged in too deep. mars retrograde is calling for a degree of introspection to which most people are not accustomed, here in our world of push a button for everything. however, the drama that a close partner may be going through involves where they are willing to place their attention, and whether they are willing to ask themselves difficult questions. and one of those questions is about what they want. when that is a constant variable, one is insulated from making decisions and taking meaningful action.

aquarius (jan. 20-feb. 19) — emotional maturity is in short supply these days, and you are being called on to muster up a little. actually the situation in our society is worse than i’m suggesting: people are conditioned to be off their rocker, and it’s an example of something going quite well. there are lots of examples and plenty of inspiration and an environment that tends to punish emotional depth and sensitivity. and that all may be fine for the other kids, but it’s not going to serve you; and i doubt it’s what you prefer. however, it’s another few steps to sustaining a commitment to stabilizing yourself and honoring your inner core values (which is the heart of the matter). it’s easier to slip, slide, distract and desensitize. yet there are no rewards in the long-run, and you are wise enough to understand that life is a long game.

no blood, no gore: bourbon st. on a typical day. photo by zack smith.
is anyplace safe?
dear friend and reader:
that we began the year with a national tragedy does not surprise anyone. we are past any form of shock from mass-kill events. the surprises now come in the press release. early new year’s morning, we are told that a guy with a rented pickup truck drove into crowds along bourbon st., killing 15, then shooting it out with the cops. his chickens, goats and sheep are all said to have survived him.
who exactly was behind this? a dead man named shamsud-din jabbar is accused, and in his truck, he allegedly had the flag of isis. remember that, from back during the obama administration? yes, the islamic caliphate, the islamic state of iraq and syria, the islamic state of iraq and the levant (isil), islamic state of iraq and al-sham, also known by its arabic acronym daesh.
that was the thing we were told replaced al-queda in 2013, and that named itself a trans-national “country” in 2014. was shamsud-din jabbar really part of isis? does isis even exist anymore? or did he have some of its memorabilia handy?
there’s a photo of me posing with the doobie brothers floating around, backstage before a concert. for all the world it looks like i’m in the band. i am not. no more does having a flag make someone part of a movement or a nation. but once again we are back to the myth of alleged arab terrorists using weapons of opportunity; in this case, the most american thing ever: a pickup truck.

capricorn (dec. 22-jan. 20) — the recent very unusual new moon in your birth sign suggests that you will want to take your usual reserved approach to your life situations rather than your unusual wild approach where you let it all hang loose. we are all feeling rather boxed into the grid of the digital environment with all of its apps and frames and passwords and triple authentication. it’s natural to want to do something outrageous, even if only a little. however, you want to be aware of the law of unintended consequences. recognize that big effects can have seemingly small causes. so pay attention to what you’re doing and make sure you understand the known consequences of every action that you take. then from there, consider the ones you may not be aware of, and pay close attention. the chances are you still have time to make a change of course.

aquarius (jan. 20-feb. 19) — this is not a good time to go blow-for-blow in any interpersonal confrontation. there will be effects that you did not predict and could not have foreseen. rather, take the approach of de-escalating any situation. this will require you to suspend the pretense of “being right,” or in any way intractable in your position. and from the look of the planetary setup right now — mars retrograding in your relationship house with pluto in your sign — that could easily be your preference. you are still getting accustomed to pluto in your birth sign, which represents a whole new phase of your existence — and an important one. your power and influence have increased. and in all sincerity, it’s unlikely that you have any idea to what degree, much less how to handle yourself under these conditions. experiment in small ways, and test the energy.

an albatross, eating from the hand of a sailor
dear friend and reader:
we have arrived at the last weekly edition of planet waves in this, our 26th year of publication. the awakening, the annual edition, will officially be published monday, the day of the capricorn new moon.
the new moon is conjunct a centaur planet, pholus (discovered in 1992; coincidentally its orbit is just under 92 years). it crosses the orbits of three planets — saturn, uranus and neptune — which is what makes it a centaur. they are all orbit-crossers. chiron is the most familiar in this group of minor planets. they all point the way to where we may retrieve what feel like elements of lost soul; they are keys to seeing in the dark.
each has a specific emphasis or theme. pholus describes the small cause with the big effect. this can be a “one thing leading to another” kind of situation; it can represent an action taken with the consequences unforeseen. were they predictable? maybe not — but there are usually warning signs that things are not going to end well.
pholus encompasses unheeded cautions, betrayals of commitments made in the past, the release of ancestral karma, and — from its mythology — being starstruck by celebrities who often get us to do whatever they want.
for monday’s lunation, moon, sun and pholus occupy the same degree, and the luminaries align with pholus to about 14 arc minutes. there is a lot of emphasis behind this lunation, which commences the lunar month wherein donald trump will be inaugurated the 47th president.

capricorn (dec. 22-jan. 20) — the sun enters your sign this year with the reminder that you are truly at a turning point. everything you’ve ever thought was true about yourself is up for reconsideration. you have made significant progress on several matters related to your family over the past year, and now the lights will come on and you’ll get to evaluate what you’ve learned. yet more than ever, an evaluation will remind you that you’re at a point of decision. this may seem like the choice to go one way or the other — however that manifests for you. seen another way, you are choosing between several options that it would be helpful if you articulated. one is to take developments as a matter of fate. another is to imagine that your life is a quest for survival. a third is to consider that your existence is a creative adventure, and one of the most important ingredients is an element of uncertainty and even a touch of chaos. if you cling to certainty, you will contract your awareness. if you allow for the uncertainty factor and make friends with it, you will feel better and open yourself up to greater possibilities. you will see possibilities that you might otherwise have missed, because you’re perceiving your reality with a broader spectrum of thought and perception. be glad when you get to a point where you know that a decision is both imminent and necessary. that’s the place to stop and ask yourself: on what basis do i want to make this choice? what would help, and what would hinder?

aquarius (jan. 20-feb. 19) — many factors suggest that you have the freedom to express yourself more than ever. the world has a problem now, which is if anyone speaks freely for more than five minutes, they will invariably say something that offends everyone in the room. (hence, people tend to do their talking in podcasts, where everyone comes to be offended.) i would propose as a personal goal completely dumping the notion of “offended” and not recognizing it as a valid thought or feeling in everyone. rather, it’s a big game, which would better be called “justified in being judgmental.” and as with most things, this is described by the very unusual digital problem faced by humanity. we now all live inside a robot, as our humanity is gradually being depleted day-by-day and year-by-year. in 2025, a very large pile of chips is being put on the gambling table, with some of them as bets on the success and survival of humans, and the rest on the success (and supremacy) of artificial intelligence. yes, many people feel that humans have outgrown our use, so they have taught something else to think for them. i would assure you of this: if a human did not think it, it’s not thought. your ideas and creative expression are far better than anything a robot could ever do. yet you’re under constant pressure to concede this may not be true, and that you are replaceable and nobody will know the difference. this is a final attempt to extinguish the human soul, and you know better than to fall for it. but it will take strength and passion to hold your course.

high anxiety
dear friend and reader:
don’t worry, everything’s fine.
drones have not only been spotted over the new jersey suburbs but also over two military bases — one in new york (which also serves as a civil airfield), and one in california — and the government claims to have no idea where they are coming from.
california has declared a “bird flu” emergency related to cattle, an example of abusing the wholly fictitious, allegedly molecule-finding pcr (of ‘covid’ test fame) — which is really a thinly disguised assault on the beef and dairy industries. somebody high up must be reading diet for a small planet. word is we will all be living on soybeans in a few years. hey they’re good for you; we can all use the estrogen.

capricorn (dec. 22-jan. 20) — the past few weeks have come with a series of revelations or discoveries about who you are. it will be easy — too easy — to forget these, and to exist like you never learned such meaningful things. you may have already done so. however, take a moment and track back over the past three to four weeks and make a note of what happened. what did you say to other people that surprised you? what came to you in your dreams? have you felt the presence of any spiritual guardians or experienced an unseen hand guiding you — subtle as it may have been? or maybe just this: are you asking questions you’ve never asked before? those are your most important tools; questions are more powerful than answers. curiosity is more powerful than being told something about yourself. it will lead you further, perhaps further into the unknown. in a world of false certainty, that is progress.

aquarius (jan. 20-feb. 19) — the sun’s entry into capricorn is often a deep and mysterious time for you, even if you live down in the southern hemisphere where it’s bright and sunny. however, i suspect the feeling is intensified for those in the northern hemisphere, with the days ending in the late afternoon followed by long nights. if you’re being called inward, i suggest you follow. aquarius is usually recognized for its extroverted and social qualities, though deep down you may be an introvert. and if not, you do well when you create solitude and time to reflect. meanwhile, you might notice that others have similar needs, even if they don’t say so. i do recognize that the holidays are rapidly approaching and this may take some planning or maneuvering. even if you want to be out and about, make sure you have time alone to get your emotional bearings.

gemini full moon, mercury direct in sagittarius
dear friend and reader:
most of what i have to say will be in starcast, though for the next few days we’re in an exciting interchange of the full moon in gemini at 4:01 am est on sunday, dec. 15, and mercury direct just shy of 12 hours later, at 3:56 pm est the same day. by the time mercury moves to direct motion, the moon has entered cancer.
one defining feature of the full moon is that the moon and sun meet neptune at 90-degrees, in what’s called a t-square. in case you’re looking for such a nifty thing, this is the perfect setup for being absolutely certain and totally wrong.
you would be wise to walk away from any arguments saturday into overnight, and when we get into squares to neptune i always flag an alcohol warning. beware of any rationalization grounded in survival needs; at the moment those are a distraction from a more relevant question, which i reckon is spiritual.

sagittarius (nov. 22-dec. 22) — mercury stations direct in your sign in a few days. the usual caution to not take action or rush decisions with mercury still retrograde translates to a potential situation of missing or concealed information. therefore my suggestion is to grouse around and think about what you may not know, and consider where you lack data. it should not be that difficult to figure out. consider a few things you think you know for sure, and ask yourself how exactly you know them. once you do the audit, you are likely to come up with gaps in knowledge or understanding, which i suggest you formulate into questions. of course, what you discover over the next few days is unlikely to have come up on your initial list. this is a good reason to pause and reflect on your situation — and keep your eyes and ears open.

capricorn (dec. 22-jan. 20) — there are things about yourself that you don’t know, and it’s a good thing, too. why else would you need to be on the planet? the thing is, most humans get rather uncomfortable entering any space of the unknown or the uncertain within themselves. yet this is your destination at the moment, as you are standing right in front of the door to a hidden room that’s about to pop open. information may come to you through your dreams, through intuition, or through a discovery about yourself that you make in the physical world. it will help if you’re open to learning about what exists beneath the surface of your personality and your motives. but this goes deeper than psychology: you may be inspired to think about what humans rarely do (thanks to massive obfuscation by this thing called ‘the ego’) which is to learn something about your relationship to existence. note, these discoveries are subtle; please don’t juice it like an orange.

 sagittarius (nov. 22-dec. 22) — mars retrograde begins imminently, and this is an important opportunity to reassess what you want. yet there is something here about checking in with a “higher authority,” which means going deeper within yourself to evaluate your intentions. in response to desire, one might dive in; one might hesitate for some reason they don’t understand; and many count themselves out. for you the necessity is to be aligned with yourself. that means acting in accord with your own ethics, and with your priorities — inconvenient, i know. as the retrograde progresses into next year, the questions of desire enter the context of your relationships and how your choices influence others, and how they are shaped by others. you will have to find a point of resolution between “this is my life” and “i have these commitments to someone else.” that’s a wholesome meditation, which you might begin now — the outcome will be far better than if you throw down.

caution: mars retrograde opposite pluto
dear friend and reader:
if you’re noticing a little unusual tension in the air, consider that mars is about to be retrograde. and not only that, it will be retrograde opposite pluto, which is extremely rare.
true, we are in an unusual mercury retrograde pattern at the same time, which i suggest is a time for cleaning up and wrapping up old tasks. clear your desk. get the filing done. stay up all night if you have to, or get a teenager to help. you will feel better, and you will make discoveries. there’s often treasure in those unfiled stacks of paper. (more about the peak of the current mercury retrograde in the new starcast.)
mars retrograde is a different kind of critter, and requires special handling. mars is a sharp, hot object. its range spans from desire to motivation to attack to self-attack (guilt, resentment, etc.). the retrograde turns it inward, and to me that is primarily about a reassessment of desire.
be gentle on yourself and be careful with what you want. it could end up producing a very different result than you intend. aggression, ambition and overdone self-assertion need to be given a rest. let things play out a little; if you have opponents or adversaries, just give them a little time to fuck up. let them do the work for you.
if you want to work out issues or preserve sincere peace in your relationships, then be patient with people and with yourself. give things time; there are many variables, and many unknowns. in total, mars retrograde is fully over in early may. so, easy does it.

planet waves weekly for nov. 27, 2024

sagittarius (nov. 22-dec. 22) — with your ruling planet jupiter hanging out in your opposite sign gemini, you may be mistaking an inner need for an external one. everyone needs companionship; though at the moment, your chart is making a strong case for needing introspective time. turning your focus inward will help you sort out your priorities and expectations in all relationships: past, present and future. you might want to set a policy of needing less and focusing more on your experience with and of the other. part of the modern relationship game is to think of them as entitlement programs, and this set of values needs to be burned and buried. also, if love is a dance, consider whether you want to lead, or follow. you cannot meaningfully do both at the same time. this may come down to what aspect of life we’re talking about. right now, your existence is more about what you have to offer than what you have to gain.

sagittarius astrology studio 2024-25 is releasing this week



capricorn (dec. 22-jan. 20) — there are certain kinds of emotional disturbance that you can do without, and one of them involves relatives, and their phantom memories, dictating the course of your life. these come through as overt and covert signals that sometimes seem encrypted in your nervous system. however, though this may be coming through more loudly than you want right now, you do have a chance to see these messages for what they are. note that they may come through as language, as feelings, or as both. if you pay attention, you can identify the characters. who is the drunk? who has the endless appetite for cruelty? who wants to gather the family together, and overlook people’s toxic influence? give these people names, and inquire what is motivating them. part of what vexes you is their anonymity. give these people names, and identify the specific messages they sent to you, or are sending. this will give you the upper hand.

pluto in aquarius rising for icc arrest warrants for netanyahu and gallant
dear friend and reader:
for those who may have doubted that pluto entering aquarius would come with some indication that we are in a different era, indictments and international arrest warrants were issued thursday afternoon for israel’s prime minister benjamin netanyahu and his former defense minister.
they were charged with crimes against humanity, including attempting to starve the palestinian people to death. as this has happened, the world has looked on in horror, though acting as if everyone is helpless to make a difference. the fear of calling out isreal for its atrocities has been compounded by fears of being labeled antisemitic — a claim that netanhayu wasted no time making on thursday.
now, it is accurate to say that benjamin netanyahu is an indicted war criminal. he can deny it all he wants; they all do. meanwhile sen. lindsey graham (r, sc) has tweeted that the icc should be permanently sanctioned. others in congress have chimed in. pres. biden has condemned the icc’s decision.
it is noteworthy that this comes within days of a major escalation of the united states’ proxy war against russia, which has now expanded to the use of long-range missiles launched from ukraine. the indictments, which will dominate the news cycle for the next few days, could serve as a scrim or smokescreen concealing the consequences of that escalation.

planet waves monthly for december 2024

sagittarius (nov. 22-dec. 22) — my core theory of sagittarius is that you’re a kind of extraterrestrial spirit visiting earth, and for that reason, you must take special care to adapt to the conditions here. you need to know what is good for you and what is not, then avoid what harms and encourage what helps. however, there are two main things you must be cautious of. one is overreliance on ‘positive thinking’. such can be helpful but it will only get you so far. rather, it’s necessary to be circumspect in your approach, considering all possibilities, and making sure you’re prepared. there’s another situation, which is about where you seek your grounding. here on earth, people rely too heavily on their families. that worked well in times long past; it does not work well today. and there are some profound negative attachments that people have to the muggles who raised them. often those bonds don’t seem what they are; despite many disappointments we might still expect people who should care for us to do so. yet here’s the catch: often, what we get from them is being emotionally triggered. no wisdom; no needs fulfilled; only the shock of being thrown back to a helpless childhood state, but in an adult body with adult concerns. please be cautious of this. if someone has hurt you in the past, you’re the only one who can call a stop to that. even then it will take time. here on earth, hope is a dangerous substance.

capricorn (dec. 22-jan. 20) — these days it’s difficult to consider what you’ve learned over a 16-year period. however, i would propose that this is an excellent time to ponder that. in digital time, we are leaping forward in dog years. but in physical time, in real experiences, in time spent outside, and with friends, we are moving a lot slower than real time. pluto has now made its way completely through your sign or rising sign. the beginning was january 2008, when so much changed so fast. pluto finally left your sign on november 19, mere days ago. so: what was your story arc? do you recognize the person you were at the beginning of this transit, and could you possibly fit into the shoes you wore then? another way to consider these years is that pluto was a sculptor, removing much of the stone from the original block. what can you now see that you did not see or know about then? the you who you’ve become was contained in that original material. were you aware of that shape concealed within something larger? the next epoch of pluto lasts 20 years — a long time, by any measure. the message of this new phase is to use what you learned in the last one, specifically about your core values and principles. these foundational personal laws must then match your priorities, your choices and your actions. yet this all depends on your having learned something tangible about who you are and what resides at the essence of your being.

alternate art for the awakening
 


















where are we headed?
dear friend and reader:
on the last night of working on the awa, my ebook accompanying your 2025 the awakening readings, i took up the matter of uranus entering gemini. typical of uranus, this took me by surprise. i didn’t think it was so close at hand.
the book is available now, with any purchase of the awakening.
the transition begins over the summer and extends into the spring of 2026 — though the way these things work, we are already under its influence. as with technological advances, attitudes and values change ahead of major transits.
the illustration above is alternative cover art for the awakening. i wondered what i was getting at in this image, and i would now say: uranus in gemini. that is the convergence point we are rapidly approaching.
astrology is the study of how humans interrelate with their rapidly changing environments. and we are about to get a lot of change, faster than ever. gemini is the study of how we think and how we talk to one another. it is the sign of the idioglossia, the secret language of twins. and with uranus, there’s a big one blowin’ in.

planet waves weekly for nov. 14, 2024 by eric francis

scorpio (oct. 23-nov. 22) — there is no such thing as tough love. or perhaps better said, as tough as it gets is being sincere and speaking your truth to those who matter. you may be mired in some concept of love or relating that was natural to your family of origin and that you may have decided was normal. yet love does not contain a trace of meanness, of the fear of consequences, or of laws and rules imposed on one person by another. you will find all the information you need in the speech patterns of your early family. the words they used and how they used them will reveal the feelings involved. if you find that some or all of this is unacceptable to you, that’s a wholesome first step on what is in truth a fairly long journey to reconciliation. however, gentleness, forgiveness and sincerity go a long way in the spirit of healing.

sagittarius (nov. 22-dec. 22) — yours is the most cosmic and mystical sign. i don’t mean that to play favorites in any way. your patch of sky is home to the core of our galaxy, and an energy vortex that groups together 100,000 galaxies, including our own. if you’re wondering why you feel so strange sometimes, or like your life is so intense, this is your metaphor. what you need the very most is grounding. that means direct involvement with the needs of your body, the food that you eat, and your earthly priorities. this takes special focus. you’re a little like an extraterrestrial from another star system. you have the intelligence to do quite well here, but you need to follow certain rules that exist on the physical plane. and to this end, your solar chart gives you many advantages. you have to know when to err on the side of caution, and when to take a risk. that is the question.

the view from physical plane
thank you to everyone who particpated in tuesday’s live election coverage. that was fantastic and i’ll be doing more of it. — efc
dear friend and reader:
what happened this week — a decisive victory for donald trump, who could not prevail in any age but digital — was a comment on the astrology of 2025-2026, and the electronic world in which we live. they are closely related.
the new york times headline wednesday read, “trump’s america: victory changes nation’s sense of itself.” but they got that backwards. it should have read, “nation’s changing sense of self leads to trump victory.”
the reversal of cause and effect is revealing of our relationship to the problem. shawn mccreesh, reporting from west palm beach for the times, summed up trump’s performance. “mr. trump was a ferociously effective campaigner. to watch him up close on this third run for president was to see him blend comedy, fury, optimism, darkness and cynicism like never before.”
in the digital age, that’s what feels good. that’s what feels trustworthy because it feels real. anything not infused with anger seems to lack authenticity.

eric – what is the best way to communicate with you?  the leo reading cuts off with about 8 pages of the transcript left out of the recording – is this just the way it goes… ie; is there a limit to the recording length?  on another topic, can i  share your covid info, which  is so rich and vital on social media?  many thanks, in advance, for your answers, karen
