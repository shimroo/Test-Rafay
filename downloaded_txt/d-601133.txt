important note many of the liquid-in-glass thermometers and many of the thermo-hydrometers in this website contain mercury as the thermo-sensitive fluid.  certain states prohibit the sale of mercury-added instruments. instruments containing mercury are not offered for sale where prohibited by law.
we make every effort to maintain information and pricing current, however despite our best efforts typographical errors may occur.  prices and product specifications may change without notice.
