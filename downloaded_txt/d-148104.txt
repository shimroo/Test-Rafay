if you need a tutor, mr. rapp has a list going, or you can try the  iu chemistry student tutor list


teachers! the 
          power points have been changed so the answers to the "learning 
          check" problems are deleted. if you would like the complete set of power 
        points to use in your class, please email me for instructions.







 whoops !







should we ban 
          dihydrogen monoxide (dhmo)?  did you know that this chemical 
          is not listed as toxic or hazardous?  read about the dangers 
          of this chemical. 
oh no, here we 
          go again! aliso viejo, ca almost bans dhmo! read 
          the story here. and now, a radio station in florida used this as an april fools' joke (and could be in serious trouble!)
elements 
          116 and 118 were not made after all! click here 
          for the article. since then, dubna in russia made 116. that story is 
        here.
element 118 has now been made, for sure this time!
