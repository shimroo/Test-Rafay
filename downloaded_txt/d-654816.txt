easter sunday





matthew 28after the sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, mary magdalene and the other mary went to look at the tomb.there was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it. his appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow. the guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.the angel said to the women, "do not be afraid, for i know that you are looking for jesus, who was crucified. he is not here; he has risen, just as he said. come and see the place where he lay. then go quickly and tell his disciples 'he has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into galilee. there you will see him.' now i have told you."so the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. suddenly jesus met them. "greetings," he said. they came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him. then jesus said to them, "do not be afraid. go and tell my brothers to go to galilee; there they will see me."while the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priesdts everything that had happened. when the chief priests had met with elders and devised a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money, telling them, "you are to say, "his disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep.' if this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble." so the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. and this story has been widely circulated among the jews to this very day.then the eleven disciples went to galilee, to the mountain where jesus had told them to go. when they saw him, they worshipped him; but some doubted. then jesus came to them and said, "all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. therefore, go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit, and teaching them to obey everything i have commanded you. and surely i am with you always, to the very end of the age.he is risen. he is risen indeed!

good friday





matthew 27:32-60as they were going out, they met a man from cyrene, named simon, and they forced him to carry the cross. they came to a place called golgotha (which means the place of the skull). there they offered jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it. when they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots. and sitting down, they kept watch over him there. above his head they placed the written charge against him: this is jesus, the king of the jews. two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left. those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, "you who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! come down from the cross, if you are the son of god!"  in the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him. "he saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself! he's the king of israel! let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. he trusts in god. let god rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, 'i am the son of god.' " in the same way the robbers who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him.from the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land. about the ninth hour jesus cried out in a loud voice, "eloi, eloi, lama sabachthani?"—which means, "my god, my god, why have you forsaken me?"when some of those standing there heard this, they said, "he's calling elijah."immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. he filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to jesus to drink. the rest said, "now leave him alone. let's see if elijah comes to save him."and when jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.at that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. the earth shook and the rocks split. the tombs broke open and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. they came out of the tombs, and after jesus' resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many people.when the centurion and those with him who were guarding jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, "surely he was the son of god!"many women were there, watching from a distance. they had followed jesus from galilee to care for his needs. among them were mary magdalene, mary the mother of james and joses, and the mother of zebedee's sons.as evening approached, there came a rich man from arimathea, named joseph, who had himself become a disciple of jesus. going to pilate, he asked for jesus' body, and pilate ordered that it be given to him. joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. he rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away.there were all kinds of reactions, that first good friday, to the cross. simon of cyrene was forced into service. the roman soldiers gambled to divide jesus' clothes. others hurled insults and accusations at jesus. still, there were those who asked insightful questions, saw the truth of who he was and reached out to minister to jesus. among them were mary magdalene, mary the mother of james and joseph, and the mother of the sons of zebedee. joseph took the body down from the cross and prepared it for burial after pilate had jesus certified as dead. why is this day so important? because of this: jesus went to the cross and died for you, so god offers you salvation. it's his free gift to you. there are no strings attached, there's no manipulation, there are no gimmicks. all you have to do is humbly receive that gift. the apostle paul wrote, "if you confess with your mouth jesus is lord, and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead, you will be saved. for it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved. (romans 10:9-10) jesus' crucifixion warrants a response from each one of us. what will your response to jesus be today?rdm

maundy thursday





matthew 27:1-31early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people came to the decision to put jesus to death. they bound him, led him away and handed him over to pilate, the governor.when judas, who had betrayed him, saw that jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders. "i have sinned," he said, "for i have betrayed innocent blood."       "what is that to us?" they replied. "that's your responsibility."so judas threw the money into the temple and left. then he went away and hanged himself.the chief priests picked up the coins and said, "it is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money." so they decided to use the money to buy the potter's field as a burial place for foreigners. that is why it has been called the field of blood to this day. then what was spoken by jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: "they took the thirty silver coins, the price set on him by the people of israel, 10and they used them to buy the potter's field, as the lord commanded me."meanwhile jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "are you the king of the jews?"       "yes, it is as you say," jesus replied.when he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer. then pilate asked him, "don't you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?" but jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge—to the great amazement of the governor.now it was the governor's custom at the feast to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd. at that time they had a notorious prisoner, called barabbas. so when the crowd had gathered, pilate asked them, "which one do you want me to release to you: barabbas, or jesus who is called christ?" for he knew it was out of envy that they had handed jesus over to him.while pilate was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him this message: "don't have anything to do with that innocent man, for i have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him."but the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for barabbas and to have jesus executed."which of the two do you want me to release to you?" asked the governor.       "barabbas," they answered."what shall i do, then, with jesus who is called christ?" pilate asked.       they all answered, "crucify him!""why? what crime has he committed?" asked pilate.       but they shouted all the louder, "crucify him!"when pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. "i am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "it is your responsibility!"all the people answered, "let his blood be on us and on our children!"then he released barabbas to them. but he had jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.then the governor's soldiers took jesus into the praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him. they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. they put a staff in his right hand and knelt in front of him and mocked him. "hail, king of the jews!" they said. they spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again. after they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him. then they led him away to crucify him.may i suggest a moment of quiet today?i'm not primarily talking about turning off the tv and ipod (though that's a part of it). i'm suggesting a time when you are quiet. and when i am quiet. i'm suggesting this because of a stark contrast found in today's scripture.when pilate asked jesus to answer the accusations made against him, jesus was silent (verse 14). this silence astounded pilate.in contrast, when pilate asked the mob what should be done with jesus, they shouted "crucify him." when pilate asked them why jesus should be crucified, they oh so thoughtfully answered the question by screaming "crucify him!" louder.we live in a noisy culture. traffic and copy machines and weed whackers provide plenty of ambient noise. music blares in markets and offices and our homes. pundits shout on talk shows, and we shout at our children.and with all that noise, it's hard to hear anything. so please, today take five minutes. maybe you can take an hour. shut out the noise. more importantly, be quiet yourself. look at this passage of scripture. and see if the silence of jesus will speak to you.

wednesday of holy week





john 13:1-20it was just before the passover feast. jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and go to the father. having loved his own who were in the world, he now showed them the full extent of his love.the evening meal was being served, and the devil had already prompted judas iscariot, son of simon, to betray jesus. jesus knew that the father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from god and was returning to god; so he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist. after that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him. he came to simon peter, who said to him, "lord, are you going to wash my feet?"jesus replied, "you do not realize now what i am doing, but later you will understand.""no," said peter, "you shall never wash my feet."       jesus answered, "unless i wash you, you have no part with me.""then, lord," simon peter replied, "not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!"jesus answered, "a person who has had a bath needs only to wash his feet; his whole body is clean. and you are clean, though not every one of you." for he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not every one was clean.when he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. "do you understand what i have done for you?" he asked them. "you call me 'teacher' and 'lord,' and rightly so, for that is what i am. now that i, your lord and teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another's feet. i have set you an example that you should do as i have done for you. 16i tell you the truth, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them."i am not referring to all of you; i know those i have chosen. but this is to fulfill the scripture: 'he who shares my bread has lifted up his heel against me.'"i am telling you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe that i am he. i tell you the truth, whoever accepts anyone i send accepts me; and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me."these twelve friends of jesus knew the meaning of “devotional time with god.”they didn’t set out fifteen minutes at the beginning or end of each day for a “devo;” they followed the christ for close to three years: homeless, transient, outcast, and evading arrest. at the call of christ, peter had left everything  to follow him. surely, he knew what it meant to be devoted to the christ? instead, peter tried to stop him with a question in v.6 and a retort in v.8 that amount to a very polite way of saying, “not on my watch, lord!” until now, peter hadn’t let the son of god love him and hadn’t allowed himself to be blessed by his love. he hadn’t allowed jesus to draw him close.suddenly, in these verses, his rabbi and master approached peter in the lowest servant’s role dressed to do the least desirable task. peter recognized that he ought to be the one washing jesus’ feet.jesus modelled selfless servanthood as the greatest devotion that anyone could show. jesus restored the cultural standard of love to the high watermark of god’s love. and in blessing peter with a humble love of heavenly portion, jesus revealed that true devotion is pressing in to intimacy with him.if you haven’t let jesus wash your feet yet, then give in and let god love you.if you have let him wash your feet but you have settled there and told him, with one reason or another, that it was enough, then let god love you with a greater intimacy than you ever thought he could before. these are the devotional times god is waiting for us to have with him. vs

tuesday of holy week





matthew 26:1-16when jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples, "as you know, the passover is two days away—and the son of man will be handed over to be crucified."then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, whose name was caiaphas, 4and they plotted to arrest jesus in some sly way and kill him. "but not during the feast," they said, "or there may be a riot among the people."while jesus was in bethany in the home of a man known as simon the leper,  a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, which she poured on his head as he was reclining at the table.'when the disciples saw this, they were indignant. "why this waste?" they asked. "this perfume could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor."aware of this, jesus said to them, "why are you bothering this woman? she has done a beautiful thing to me. the poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have me. when she poured this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial. i tell you the truth, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her."then one of the twelve—the one called judas iscariot—went to the chief priests and asked, "what are you willing to give me if i hand him over to you?" so they counted out for him thirty silver coins. from then on judas watched for an opportunity to hand him over.imagine doing an act of kindness which would be remembered for generations to come.  as our lord proclaimed, this story of sacrificial love is a favorite of god's people. many sermons are preached about this mary who used nearly a year's worth of wages on perfumed oil for the body of jesus. while others were worried about money, she was concerned only for her master and his comfort. in spite of troubling comments from the disciples, she continued to perform this beautiful act of love. in the background is judas iscariot, who is also remembered. his betrayal of jesus is human nature at its worst. have you ever met anyone or  read about any other person named judas? i have not.  our world today is full of betrayals, but we are filled with the hope that is in the love and sacrifice of our lord jesus. he will never betray and will always love. we are secure in his love.pb

monday - holy week





matthew 21: 33 - 46"listen to another parable: there was a landowner who planted a vineyard. he put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower. then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and went away on a journey. when the harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit."the tenants seized his servants; they beat one, killed another, and stoned a third. then he sent other servants to them, more than the first time, and the tenants treated them the same way. last of all, he sent his son to them. 'they will respect my son,' he said."but when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other, 'this is the heir. come, let's kill him and take his inheritance.' so they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him."therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?""he will bring those wretches to a wretched end," they replied, "and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants, who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time."jesus said to them, "have you never read in the scriptures:  " 'the stone the builders rejected has become the capstone; the lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?"therefore i tell you that the kingdom of god will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit. he who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed."when the chief priests and the pharisees heard jesus' parables, they knew he was talking about them. they looked for a way to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd because the people held that he was a prophet.could there have been another way to bring enlightenment into the hearts of the religious leaders of that day?  did that way have to be with violent and murderous parables? after all, this parable is pointing to the very first easter and the death and resurrection of jesus. caught in the truths of his confrontations, the pharisees and sadducees sought to have jesus arrested. he would be put to death very soon.i am saddened that jesus’ death came about from opposition to his preaching and teaching and gathering fame. the religious leaders hated him for the things he exposed about them. in hindsight, we can see that these historic events and the first easter were a gift to all of us, bringing us the hope we have because of jesus’ miraculous resurrection and -- the best thing of all -- his holy spirit with us always. we have forgiveness of sin directly through jesus. like saint francis of assisi, we can say:"lord, make me a channel of thy peace--that where there is hatred, i may bring love--that where there is wrong, i may bring the spirit of forgiveness--that where there is discord, i may bring harmony--that where there is error, i may bring truth--that where there is doubt, i may bring faith--that where there is despair, i may bring hope--that where there are shadows, i may bring light--that where there is sadness, i may bring joy.  lord, grant that i may seek rather to comfort than to be comforted--to understand, than to be understood--to love, than to be loved.  for it is by self-forgetting that one finds.  it is by forgiving that one is forgiven.  it is by dying that one awakens to eternal life. amen."

palm sunday





matthew 21: 1 - 11as they approached jerusalem and came to bethphage on the mount of olives, jesus sent two disciples, saying to them, "go to the village ahead of you, and at once you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt by her. untie them and bring them to me. if anyone says anything to you, tell him that the lord needs them, and he will send them right away."this took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet:  "say to the daughter of zion, 'see, your king comes to you,    gentle and riding on a donkey,       on a colt, the foal of a donkey.' "the disciples went and did as jesus had instructed them. they brought the donkey and the colt, placed their cloaks on them, and jesus sat on them. a very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. the crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted,    "hosanna to the son of david!"    "blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord!" "hosanna in the highest!" when jesus entered jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, "who is this?"the crowds answered, "this is jesus, the prophet from nazareth in galilee."
