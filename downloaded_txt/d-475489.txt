dangerous products lawyers

when companies manufacture and market dangerous or defective products, pharmaceutical drugs, or medical devices, consumers pay the price. these products can cause serious injury or illness and, in some cases, death. at estey & bomberger, we believe that companies should be held responsible when their products injure consumers. that those who are injured shouldn’t face financial ruin because they were using a product as directed. however, we understand that without the right legal representation, injured people have very little chance of recovering compensation or securing justice. that’s why we have dedicated our practice to fighting big corporations on behalf of the injured.
estey & bomberger has helped thousands of clients obtain justice after a serious injury or tragic loss.  our award winning trial attorneys have the knowledge, expertise, and tenacity to get results in your case. in the last five years alone, our attorneys have secured over $500,000,000 for clients in settlements and verdicts. we have a 99% success rate for a reason. we are very good at what we do.
