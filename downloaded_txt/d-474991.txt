lifestyle focused care
familiar routines can be reassuring to those experiencing alzheimer’s disease or other memory loss. while certain aspects of daily living, such as dining, fitness or relaxation, occur at roughly at the same time each day, we seek to vary the activities and events within those time periods so each day feels both familiar and fresh.
