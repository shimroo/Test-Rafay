bad-a** of the month, and probably the year!  an icelandic fishing captain, known as "the iceman" for his tough character, grabbed a 660-pound shark with his bare hands as it swam in shallow water toward his crew, a witness said thursday.  the skipper of the trawler "erik the red" was on a beach in kuummiit, east greenland, watching his crew processing a catch when he saw the shark swimming toward the fish blood and guts -- and his men.  captain sigurdur petursson, known to locals as "the iceman," ran into the shallow water and grabbed the shark by its tail. he dragged it off to dry land and killed it with his knife.

casta meretrix  with all the ranting and raving going on about whores here a few weeks ago, i thought it appropriate to give everyone the opportunity to read some theology of whoredom - more specifically "the chaste whore." i know of two fine sources: cardinal biffi's short work on the casta meretrix in the writings of st. ambrose von balthasar's magnificent essay entitled casta meretrix in sponsa verbi gianfranco ravasi, the world's leading scholar on the song of songs, on the topic (ma, in italiano) there seems to be a gothic band with the name casta meretrix

i'm an experimenter  (dominant introvert abstract thinker) like just 4% of the population you are an experimenter (diat). although you're slightly shy (admit it!), you love control. when a problem comes in your way, you stomp on it swiftly and decisively. you are bothered easily by failure in others and failure in yourself. you don't like people that you don't think are intelligent. rather than arguing with them, however, you would just as soon ignore them altogether.  in relationships, you have a strong heart. and because you're introverted, people take you as someone they can trust. but the fact is that in addition to solving problems, you like to create them. so there's a decent chance that you'll cheat on a loved one. if you do, you'll likely get away with it.  you're a good person at heart, but then again, who isn't?

bush to sign partial birth abortion ban    a victory for sure, but the pro-abortionists will not take this one sitting down. to argue in favor of this procedure knowing well what a horror it is clearly reveals the influence moloch has on individuals in our nation.

white cassock  more clerical fashion fun. down in southern louisiana it can get oppressively hot and humid during the summer months. as a result of our tropical climate clergy in the diocese of lafayette have been granted the indult to wear the white soutane. here i am two summers ago doing a blessing while wearing my white cassock.

spanish biretta    since everyone seemed to enjoy the picture of me in the black pianeta and roman biretta, here is one of me from last year sporting a spanish-style biretta. i got it a few years back when i was vacationing in madrid. there are all sorts of hat-shops near the main square and i knew of this style of biretta from images of st. ignatius loyola. although a bit more combersome than the roman-style biretta what it lacks in flexibility it makes up for in style. i have found that nine catholics out of ten prefer the spanish biretta.

irish elk on cardinal ouellet  mark over at irish elk has a post on cardinal ouellet where he mentions me and my biretta towards the end. cardinal ouellet (then father and bishop ouellet) directed my license thesis at the jpii institute in rome. i wrote on "man and woman as the image of god in the thought of john paul ii." i have said it before at this blog, that cardianl ouellet is a true "prince" of the church and the persecutions he has undergone during his priesthood have made him the great man and the great priest that he is. one little note, cardinal ouellet's episcopal motto of ut unum sint was personally given to him by the holy father.

the right to call another to a vocation  while i am not the biggest fr. ronald rohlheiser fan, i believe he is correct in what he writes in this brief column. it is something that i am more and more convinced of everyday - that strategy (as useful as a tool as it can be) is not the solution to the so-called "vocation crisis" but sanctity of life. rohlheiser calls it a deep giving our lives over to christ and cites the example of the witness of mother teresa's life. but i think we must add that a radical orthodoxy and fidelity to the truth must co-exist along with it.

victor lams on "28 days later"  victor and i more or less disagreed on the value of the movie, but i do have to concur with his final analysis drawn from the film. anyway, this movie reinforced one thing for me: for the love of pete, if the human race is to have any hope of future survival, we must exterminate all chimanzees now. from 12 monkeys to sars to aids, chimpanzees spell t-r-o-u-b-l-e for humankind. though i will miss all the times they dress up in diapers and people clothes and stick out their tongues and blow raspberries... those were some funny times. so maybe we don't have to kill them all: just stop eating them and getting bitten by them.

this guy really doesn't like bishop robinson  bishop robinson - lucifer's gay handmaiden gay bishop robinson and the new or nude episcopal church doing the work of beelzebub. his first decree, on the urging of his boss lucifer, is to promote and encourage gay marriage in the "church" which will become a seedy little sex club for pervert & soddomists.

this all souls day    good guys wear black... assuredly it is a wise and most laudable thing to return in spirit and affection to the sources of the sacred liturgy. for research in this field of study, by tracing it back to its origins, contributes valuable assistance towards a more thorough and careful investigation of the significance of feast-days, and of the meaning of the texts and sacred ceremonies employed on their occasion. but it is neither wise nor laudable to reduce everything to antiquity by every possible device. thus, to cite some instances, one would be straying from the straight path were he to wish the altar restored to its primitive tableform; were he to want black excluded as a color for the liturgical vestments; were he to forbid the use of sacred images and statues in churches; were he to order the crucifix so designed that the divine redeemer's body shows no trace of his cruel sufferings; and lastly were he to disdain and reject polyphonic music or singing in parts, even where it conforms to regulations issued by the holy see. - pius xii, mediator dei 62

ok, maybe dracula was a pretty nasty fellow...    many people don’t know that dracula was a real man.  he defended eastern europe against invading turkish muslims in the 15th century.  if it weren’t for warriors like dracula, europe would have been conquered by turkish and moorish muslims. to save their lives, most europeans would have converted to islam, as did many bosnians, albanians and others. many would now be speaking turkish and arabic. the average european today would likely have little need of sun-tan lotion.   from reading the comments, it seems that even though dracula helped fight the mohammedans, he also was somewhat of a psychopath - impaling his own people and generally being a murderous fellow. he has a nice mullet though.

final exit  final exit is a production put on by various evangelical churches around the nature around haloween time to give teens a "reality" check and make them face their own mortality. it is a sort of religious haunted house where they show videos and have abortions and suicides acted out. i haven't been but i know there is a 3 hour wait every day just ot get in. the kids love it, the only down side is they try to prostelytize the catholics at the end.

hell-bound of the month    you want to see uncharitable and judgemental? visit these two sites. first we have this hell-bound of the month from a much larger site. here's what they have to say about july's selection: this selection should come as no surprise.  currently dick campbell’s chances of making it into heaven are at a big fat zero. not just because he cuddles with sodomites and prefers to stand with them rather than those preaching the word of god, but because he neglected to perform his duty.   the next one is yourgoingtohell.com (aka laststophell.com). they  also have their own hellbound of the month. if you look at the left habd frame, you'll see they have something for everybody!

soul therapy    after all the bad karma here over the past three days, i think what we all need is a trip to the omaha soul therapy center. we can meditate in the metatron pyramid. use an etheric weaver (ot sure how you use it though). stare at a tibetan thangka. or read some of the many pages of esoteric babble. i think it would makes us all happier.

the answer to your questions    some of you have been wondering what is with pictures of the behind-kicking tough guys being apparently randomly posted on my blog over the past few days. it has been my attempt to establish equilibrium or balance out the chi or whatever you call it on my blog as a result of all the whining going on over my valtrex advertisement comments - whining even going on in other blogs.  i am usually one to let discussions in the comments area rage without interfering, but the constant harping by certain individuals on this topic and their inability to see what i was really trying to say began to really get on my nerves. i tried banning them, but they have various ip addresses, so they keep coming back. i am going to stick by my policy and not get into any long discussion or interfere, but i will make a brief retort here. i think i have already clarified my statements enough though. but it seems their argument can be summed up in two main points: 1. i am being uncharitable. how is that possible when i was commenting on an advertisement and the way the product was being marketed and not toward a real person? some were offended - well, personal offense does not necessarily equate with uncharity. and since when is it uncharitable to call a spade a spade? was jesus being uncharitable when he called the pharisees "hypocrites"? being charitable is not being "nice." you want charity, go read the letters of st. jerome or the homilies of st. john chrysostom. the church fathers have a lot to teach this milquetoast generation about true charity. 2. i am being judgmental. ah the paradox, isn't it being judgmental to call me uncharitable and judgmental? anyhow, my response to this is the picture of cookie monster. cookie monster with the way he scarfs down those cookies is a glutton and slob. am i being judgmental? of course not - how can i "judge" a fictional character? in the same way how can i "judge" the character on some tv ad played by some anonymous actress in a bathing suit. you can't judge fictional characters. neither can you be uncharitable to them. they aren't real. are they cookie monster?
