	look forward to.
favorite local albums of 2024:

top 35 songs of 2024

here is the too much rock top 35 songs of 2024. compiling
	this is both a fun and stressful exercise for me each
	december. as always, my list is augmented by three bonus
	2023 tracks that i didn't pick up until after last year's
	list was complete.

	35. "rattle the pipes" by karate (numero group)
	the wiry guitar and bold bass line make this post-punk tune feel 
	slinky and smart. welcome back karate.
