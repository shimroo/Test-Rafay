i'd feel safe...


jul. 14th, 2008 at 11:25 pm



 


dfj225i absolutely had to share this, as its probably one of the most absurd things i've seen in a while. who knew segways were the choice of chinese special forces?kind of makes drexel security look not as goofy...chinese segway photo borrowed from here: http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2008/07/antiterrorism_exercises_in_chi.html

cloverfield predictions


jan. 14th, 2008 at 11:34 pm



 


dfj225it looks like i'll be seeing cloverfield on friday. so, i wanted to write my predictions down here before the movie is released.i predict that the movie will be terrible. in fact, imagine godzilla 2000, only shot by a frat boy on his personal camera and uploaded to youtube.i really would like to be proven wrong, in fact, i'm betting the price of an admission ticket that i will be wrong. sadly, i'm really not expecting this to happen.

the bug and ces 2008


jan. 9th, 2008 at 10:40 pm



 


dfj225the consumer electronics show is this week and features most of the gadgets and hardware that will be available soon or is currently in the prototype stage.one of the interesting things i read about from the show is something called the bug from bug labs. basically, it is a small embedded linux device with different attachable modules that can perform various functions. currently modules they have in mind are a screen, gps device, camera, keyboard, plus others. the device is open, meaning anyone is free to develop applications for it (or even hack the hardware if they want). encourage people to hack and develop software for the device is certainly a refreshing approach when contrasted to other portable devices such as cell phones.i'm not sure if this will ever catch on beyond the geek/hacker crowd, but i think its an interesting concept especially for those who have always wanted to create software for a portable device but never could find hardware that really matched what they had in mind.

π


nov. 11th, 2007 at 2:18 pm



 


dfj225i watched π this weekend for the first time. i've enjoyed every aronofsky movie i've seen and π is no exception. i found it disturbing and stylish. also, some sequences reminded me a lot of the fountain. i wonder if the fountain was a conscious effort to build on some of the ideas in π.( possible spoilers inside...collapse )
