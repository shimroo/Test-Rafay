why people believe in us


     


“we used re robertson to do a full rip out and install new plumbing, gas and sewer lines for our home we are remodeling in severna park. we are very pleased with their quality of work and thorough professionalism from phil who priced and managed the job for us from start to finish, and bobby, their lead installer and his apprentices. we could not ask for better guys to work with. thank you phil and bobby!” ★★★★★peggy c.
   


"waking up in a cold house on the sunday before christmas isn’t exactly fun but re robertson’s response time and service certainly made things better for us. after calling four companies who either weren’t available or didn’t reply, re robertson’s after-hours phone service answered quickly and a technician called us back in 10 minutes and was at our house in another 20. he also very clearly explained the after-hours fees so there would be no surprises. the issue was quickly resolved and while the gentleman was at our house, he went ahead and thoroughly tested the system. this is the second time we’ve used them and have found them to be super helpful, knowledgeable, friendly, polite and professional. thank you, re robertson!" ★★★★★ann-marie s.
   


“had a plugged disposal and drain, called a major plumbing company.  they came without proper equipment - did some work, but couldn't complete job.  called robertson plumbing and explained situation.  they were at my door within 45 minutes and fixed the problem to include a leak that was not there before the major company tried to "fix" my problem.  i was very pleased with their work.”  ★★★★★iris e.
