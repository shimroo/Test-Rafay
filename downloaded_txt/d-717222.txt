        frequently asked questions    


the water and sewerage corporation you thought you knew has made some improvements.

in the past few years, we’ve made several improvements to our service to provide you with better water, including:

 reducing non-revenue water so that water pressure could be stronger both at day and at night.
 14,000 service lines have been replaced, over 650 water mains have been repaired and nearly 1,500 system valves have been cleaned.
 extending water to services to more areas than ever before.

we’ve been working very hard to show we’re committed to growth, committed to quality. give us a try; you’ll be glad you did.



where does our water come from?

lots of people are surprised to find out we no longer barge water in to the capital, but instead use a reverse osmosis plant to turn salt water into fresh, potable water for use throughout the capital.
our reverse osmosis plant provides 90% of the water used in new providence and the water meets the world health organization’s guidelines for safe drinking water.



i’ve never had a water connection. how do i apply for one? 

complete an application form, provide proof of ownership of the home (e.g. conveyance or bankletter), and provide identification i.e. passport, driver’s license, and an nib card. call us formore info.



what happens if i don’t pay my bill?

if your account is not paid by the due date, you may receive a courtesy call to advise of the
overdue charges. if you are a tenant then the courtesy call is made to the property owner.

long island
the atlantic coastline of long island is spectacular and provides a wonderful contrast to the more tranquil bays and coves on the west side. being a long thin island with hilly ridges extending from the north all the way to the south, long island is not well endowed with freshwater and consequently the w&sc provides most of the water supplied using a desalination plant located in the mangrove bush area. there is a small groundwater supply in simms but this is due to be replaced by another desalination plant. at present the central long island supply extends from greys down to turtle cove in the south but plans are in place to extend this system to salt pond in the north and to clarence town in the south. the w&sc also provides a tanker service which delivers water to all sectors of the island. because long island has a low rainfall the tanker service is kept very busy for most of the year. customer service is provided from an office in mangrove bush.

cat island
this hilly island includes many miles of infrequently-visited shoreline with beautiful beaches, and reefs. there is also a rich cultural and historical record which makes cat island an interesting place for visitors with both social and environmental interests to explore. at this phase in cat island’s development the w&sc only provides water supplied by tanker but service is made available to all sectors of the island. plans are in place for proper piped supplies to be provided in all the residential communities.

long island
the atlantic coastline of long island is spectacular and provides a wonderful contrast to the more tranquil bays and coves on the west side. being a long thin island with hilly ridges extending from the north all the way to the south, long island is not well endowed with freshwater and consequently the w&sc provides most of the water supplied using a desalination plant located in the mangrove bush area. there is a small groundwater supply in simms but this is due to be replaced by another desalination plant. at present the central long island supply extends from greys down to turtle cove in the south but plans are in place to extend this system to salt pond in the north and to clarence town in the south. the w&sc also provides a tanker service which delivers water to all sectors of the island. because long island has a low rainfall the tanker service is kept very busy for most of the year. customer service is provided from an office in mangrove bush.

san salvador
san salvador is characterized by the hills and lakes that dominate the centre of the island. the shorelines have many picturesque bays with white sandy beaches, and these as well as several features of historical interest, like columbus’ landfall, make the island interesting to visitors. fishing and diving are popular activities, and the gerace research station also brings many students and scientists to the island. water is provided by the w&sc using a desalination plant located near to cockburn town, where there is an office for customer service.

long cay
these pristine islands are very much as they have been for the last two hundred years though their populations are actually now a lot smaller than they were in the 1800s, and in the days of the salt industry, and sponging. they are generally well endowed with coppice forests, and feature many beautiful coves, bays, and headlands. christopher columbus dubbed these islands as “the fragrant islands”. the shallow waters they enclose, known as the bight of acklins, is reportedly one of the best bonefishing locations in the world.  the w&sc provides water to the salina point, and snug corner areas, using reverse osmosis sources, and also operates a small plant on long cay. groundwater resources are used to supply colonel hill, lovely bay, and chesters.

mayaguana
mayaguana remains largely undeveloped though it features miles of white-sand beach, and healthy off-shore coral reefs. a simple well field system provides water to pirates well and betsey bay, and plans are in place to replace this by a reverse osmosis source, which will also supply the community of abrahams bay.

inagua
this large low-lying island is probably the most arid in the bahamas, and as a consequence lacks appreciable water resources, but supports a viable salt harvesting industry based on natural evaporation processes. the island includes the inagua national park which is the home of one of the largest flamingo flocks in the world. other wild life of interest include wild donkeys and boars, and the bahama parrot. the w&sc has to provide water produced by desalination from a plant located in matthew town in the same location as its office.
