opus 61


"it is the end of the end!" said ned land. 
-jules verne, 20,000 leagues under the sea

much in the manner of the ironman triathletes after which this event was named, dan ichov and i, the survivors a larger starting field, now stagger across the finish line, sixty months and close to 200,000 words each from where we started. when we first set out on this little adventure, i (rather arrogantly and smugly) thought this would be easy -- after all, i was a reasonably good writer, and had never had any particular difficulties cranking out term papers and essays in school, or reports at work. how hard could this be, especially with an entire month to prepare?


well, it turns out that this little adventure was a lot more difficult than i had ever realized it would be, mostly because i did not know then the limits of just how far one could go relying on last-minute inspiration and innate talent to reach such a demanding goal -- and not just once, but month after month, for five solid years. i had to teach myself the discipline needed to turn out these articles on time, every month, and i had to develop a technique for writing to a deadline that would work for me for the long haul. although i always paid attention to words and content (i am the only person i know who would write drafts of letters to friends in those bygone days before email, facebook, and twitter made every unpolished passing thought a potential nugget to be cast out into the ether for all and sundry) i never payed much attention to the mechanics of writing. i would soon learn better.

sleight of hand


"oww! damn!"


despite having spent more than a month on board, mike allen still managed to forget just how confined his rack space was. not unlike being on board a submarine, his sleeping compartment was just adequate for his height, and less than three feet from bottom to top. inevitably, each day's wake-up call resulted in mike bumping his head as he sat up too quickly in the still-darkened space.

the greatest

 as the public
penance of tiger woods' mea culpa fills the cable tv channels, a
plethora of talking heads bemoan the ominous fact that all today's
sports "heroes" are flawed.  they say: "look at how they've all let us
down.  woods is an adulterer; mcguire is a druggie; oj is a murderer.
how disappointing! where have all the real heroes gone? 
what is the world coming to?"


for some reason, i don't feel the same disappointment in the humanity
of these sportsmen. maybe it's because of my deeply ingrained love of
tragedy. maybe it's because my adolescent interest is sports began
with jim bouton's ball four. or maybe it's because my catholic
upbringing allows me to understand the idea of perfect god as
imperfect man.  whatever the reason, i've never seen sports figures,
even my personal sports gods, as being anything other than humans.
flawed humans.  limited and finite beings. and that's their biggest
honor, isn't it?  my apologies to yankees fans, but could an
übermench athlete (or a whole team of them in pinstripes)
be deserving of heartfelt cheers? maybe, but not from me.

you pays your money and you takes your choice


throughout time immemorial, human beings have been fascinated with gambling. psychologists have spent countless hours theorizing on what exactly it is that attracts most people to the notion of the big payoff, beating the odds, getting something for nothing more than a lucky toss of the dice or the turn of a card.

avatar


although the mpaa claims that the profitability of the movie business
is being ruined by digital bootlegging, the recently released film
avatar has now become the highest grossing film in cinema
history. that's in un-adjusted dollars.  correcting for inflation,
avatar still ranks high, although it's hard to imagine avatar's box
office take will ever exceed the $6 billion present-day dollars that
gone with the wind has earned since 1939.  nor is james
cameron's latest epic likely to beat the likes of snow white, star
wars, bambi, jaws, or the sound of music; avatar maybe has a shot of
unseating a hundred and one dalmatians to rank number 7 in all-time
constant-dollar world-wide movie earnings, but that's as far as i
expect it will go.

favorite movies 5 and 10 -- base 8


two and a half years ago, i posted my top 8 movie list in this
space. i'm proud to say that nothing in the intervening years has
changed my opinion of any of my all time favorite films. there have
been some good new films, slumdog millionaire was pretty darn
good, but no new film has surpassed any of my old picks. i still stand
by the radix of my list as written in 2007.


over those two and a half years, i have posted essays that explain my
appreciation for most of the films on that list; however, two of the
eight favorite films still have not been covered thus far. the two
films in question are: searching for bobby fischer and oh brother, where art thou?

that i left these two for last should not imply they are of lesser
quality. i feel they are the equal of any other film on the list. in fact,
with the iron writers term drawing to a close, swift action is needed
lest i disparage these excellent films further and leave a critical
life's task undone. thus my aim, today, is to fill the gap in my movie
review list.

lune de miel après vignt ans


more often than not today, marriages are not what they used to be. divorce rates hover near fifty percent, and this trend has only been moving upwards over time. gone are the days when getting married was a more of less ironclad commitment for life, and divorce was looked upon as something somewhat scandalous. changing societal mores (aided by the ready availability in this country of "no-fault" divorce laws) have changed divorce from a somewhat rare event to a condition rapidly approaching the norm.

bad science


no inconvenient questions are asked about william's death. in a world
without evil, instincts toward suspicion once common in the species
have become extinct. no one at the camp gives a second thought to
jaryn's story: he tells anyone who asks that he was mistaken when initially
reporting william wasn't badly hurt.  there is no autopsy; there is no
investigation. who would investigate? there are no police detectives.
everyone mourns the boy's death, new rules are established that
discourage running near the water and the city adds more beach front
caretakers.  otherwise, life goes on.

hail and farewell: part iv


in this age of google, it's fairly hard to stay anonymous and private. buy a house, get a mention in your local newspaper's caption under a photo of the local little league team you coach, get a land line phone, get arrested, have your name mentioned in the meeting minutes of the local garden club's web site, make a posting to a usenet newsgroup, have a child, sue someone (or be sued), or have your obituary published when you die -- it takes remarkably little for the tireless little search bots to cull your name from somewhere, then cross reference it, index it, and make it available to anyone with the time and patience to ferret it out.


some people do manage to do remarkably well at keeping themselves "offline", as it were. they stay off the internet radar, and out of view of the search engines. but sometimes, with a modicum of luck, and by having a more-than-typical level of familiarity with where to mine for data, even someone apparently lost and gone forever will suddenly and unexpectedly turn up.

t plus forty years


it is perhaps a few weeks premature, but an important anniversary is fast coming upon us -- and, as seems to be the trend today, it seems to be being largely overlooked. i ascribe this unfortunate state of affairs to the twenty-four hour news cycle, and the subsequent dulling of our sense of history. when there's a desperate rush to call something (anything) "news", day in and day out, i think we tend to lose our sense of proportion, our feeling for what is (or ought to be) truly memorable.

four pills a day


i was watching a rerun of saturday night live not too long ago, featuring steve martin as the host. one of the sketches had martin playing the title character, "theodoric of york, medieval barber". a parade of people with various maladies were brought to him, and in each case, theodoric impressed the crowd with his advanced knowledge of the healing arts: "once we would have believed that this man's afflictions were caused by being cursed by a troll, or a witch. but now we know that it is instead caused by an imbalance of humors in the blood," for which the inevitable prescription was leeches and bloodletting. the audience roared as each hapless victim was led away to cut and bled.


a funny bit, but one that also got me thinking of the progress in medicine since theodoric's day, and my own interactions with our health care system.

the walking purchase -- curiosity

in school i was a math and science nerd. not that my grades in other
subjects were bad, they were ok. i read a lot (science books and
science fiction) and a beneficial spin off from the incessant reading
was decent language arts skills that buoyed my english grades. the
reading also gave me a passable understanding of the point of
historical research -- or at least "psychohistory" as visualized by
asimov.


regardless of the adequate spin off skills that kept my grades from
being too slanted toward science and math, if you had asked the
16-year-old dan ichov to list school subjects ranked in order of his
enthusiasm and interest, then undoubtedly history would have
been at the bottom of his list, with gym and health being the only
competition for his academic interest cellar.

driving the numbers


because of my geek nature and technical training, i have an
uncontrollable compulsion to check numerical relationships. it makes
no difference if the relationship is obvious or subtle, or if it's
such a platitude that we all have it memorized as axiomatic fact. for
example, if somebody says, "that's six of one, half dozen of the
other", i'll compulsively verify in my mind that the division of 12 by 2 equals 6, exactly.  since this was typically offered as a cliche for
approximate equivalence, i usually quip "maybe more like six of one,
two pi of the other," hinting that the equivalence may not be
precisely exact.


this number checking habit is, no doubt, one of my less endearing
qualities. but, despite the fact that i know i'm being a dork, i can't
help but do it.

more times, but jiabao had been running the winch slower, and fred

ad astra per aspera 


at dinner with my family a while ago, the conversation turned to the subject of hobbies. i was bemoaning the fact that my kids' hobbies seemed to be pretty much limited to things like achieving high scores on the x-box, or serving in a godlike capacity as the master of a group of players in an role playing world. i was gently tweaking them over the fact that these kinds of activities were primarily computer based, involved at best a limited kind of interaction with other people, and kept them glued to the computer screen for hours at a time. while advanced joystick proficiency gained by hours playing halo 3 might make my son a good candidate for piloting a predator done someday, beyond that these activities didn't involve many opportunities for learning much of anything.


my kids, of course, immediately challenged me right back, asking me about my hobbies: what things did i do to occupy what little free time i had?

present at the creation


the year end is a time for looking back as much as for looking forward. people compile their lists of "top ten" movies, music, political events, and the like, for the year just past. others look forward, placing their moistened fingers in the air, and, having discerned the direction of the prevailing winds, more or less confidently prognosticate on what the year to come has in store for us.


i hold no special claim to any abilities in the area of predictions -- if i did possess any, i would undoubtedly be spending more time at the racetrack and the casino than i do now. instead, i use these short days at year's end to look back, not only at the preceding twelve months, but over even longer time frames. having also turned fifty this year, i look back at my life so far, and find myself asking (among other things) about how fortunate i seem to be to have grown up at just the right times to have been in on the start of a true historical era or two.
