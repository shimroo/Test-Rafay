mason-grant concluded operations in 2020from 1986 through 2020 we provided a wide variety of services related to building science for buildings of all types.this website is updated only occasionally. it serves as an archive of pdf files and video clips generated through mason-grant research and consulting. you could think of this archive as the “dusty attic” of a 35-year consulting career. these files could be useful to those who have an interest in building investigations, and those who need to understand humidity and avoid problems of indoor air quality, mold, dampness or energy waste in buildings. we believe these files are useful and are likely to remain so, even if their wording and emphasis may reflect the context and concerns of the years in which they were created.you are welcome to read, enjoy, download, rename and distribute these files in any way you find useful, subject to one condition: to avoid any potential confusion about their origin and original content, please do not modify their contents or appearance in any way. if you have questions about the files or their content you may contact lew harriman.
