my favorite memory from musicfest was having my teacher, family, and fiance there to support me and watch me perform for the competition. the adrenaline was invigorating and my accompanist and i were able to lock in with our interpretation of the music.

musicfest has ties that go far outside those who choose music as a career, and music enhances everything you do.

i participated in multiple competitions, won multiple gold and silver medals, won the young artist competition, and had the incredible honor of performing with the spokane symphony. i remember being in the presence of professional musicians and savoring every minute of such a unique and exciting opportunity.

years in musicfest: 2023-2024
i love the camaraderie of the festival. seeing the same people sprinkled throughout different classes and categories was a unique experience for me. meeting so many new people and building connections with people in similar places as me was invaluable, and an experience unlike any other i’ve had. it’s like a cohort of singers for the week, you all come out at the end feeling like you know each other in some way.

my favorite part of musicfest was performing with the spokane symphony on a piece that used to scare me! musicfest northwest is about people. it was fun to hang out with musicians passionate about their craft!

my favorite memory by far was getting to compete this last year. in the warm up room before the competition i recall feeling extremely nervous and like nothing was happening, but as soon as i got to hear the first trumpet player i was completely taken away by the music. i had a blast. i remember thinking just what an honor it was to be there, sharing and receiving such incredible music.


christopher lee andersoninstruments played: violin, piano
years in musicfest: 2019, 2023, 2024
my favorite memory from musicfest was when i got a perfect score in the violin sonata class. practice makes perfect, and music brings me happiness.


bennett mckellinstrument played: piano
years in musicfest: 2023-2024
last year was my first year participating in musicfest! ! my teacher helped me discover this opportunity and it was such a cool experience. i don’t know a lot of others my age who play at this level so it was fun to meet some.  this event challenged me to improve and strive for a higher level of performance.


dr. denin slage-kochinstrument played: guitar
years in musicfest: 2016-2017
my favorite musicfest memory was performing with the spokane symphony and meeting all of the other young artist winners! musicfest was a wonderful opportunity to prepare music, perform it for an audience, receive feedback from an experienced master of my instrument, and hear other young musicians playing at a really high level. i think of the lessons i learned from that experience often.
