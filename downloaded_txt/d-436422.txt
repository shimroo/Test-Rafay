harm reduction





we formed a partnership and then later acquired the foundation for research on sexually transmitted disease (frostâ€™d). this was done to give chronic substance users, hiv-positive formerly homeless persons, and ymsm2 access to healthcare. specifically, this allowed us to build out our harm reduction services, including syringe exchange, to provide recovery support services to our clients living with addiction and to offer two housing facilities for those in immediate need of shelter.
