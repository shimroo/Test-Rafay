basic information on the nia
the national insulator association (nia) is an organization of collectors and friends interested in electrical insulators and other artifacts connected with the many industries associated with electrical power, such as telephone, telegraph, railroad, power distribution and lightning protection devices.  it is also classified as a âpublic charityâ under irs 501(c)3 regulations.  as such, most donations to the nia are tax deductible.
 
the nia was founded on july 7, 1973 at the national show held in hutchinson, kansas.  in the first year of its operation, more than 800 charter members joined its ranks.  since then, annual paid membership has reached a high of more than 1,700 members.  residents from each of the states of the united states and the provinces of canada have become nia members, as well as from many foreign nations.
 
objectives and purpose
the nia, as stated in its by-laws, is a non-profit                                            
educational and scientific organization; its aim is to encourage insulator collecting and                                            
to protect the interests of its members and collectors, and has established standards and                                            
ethics by which its members may fairly deal with each other.  
 
nia administration
the governing body of the nia is the 9 member board of directors, the core of which                                             
are the elected president and three elected vice-presidents. although the board may poll                                             
the membership to determine the membership's opinion before establishing rules or policy,                                             
a full membership vote is required for: election of officers; approval of salaries for                                             
certain officers; dues amounts; and changes in geography of the three regional divisions.                                             
ballots are mailed directly to the membership with results announced at the general                                             
meeting, held each year at the nia's annual convention. other committee chair people are                                             
often appointed, but do not hold board seats. for more details you can read the complete       
by-laws.

particular region once every three years. two regional shows (western, central and                                             
eastern) are also held annually. the nia supplies advertising subsidies to help promote
