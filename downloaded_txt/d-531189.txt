our products


thanks to our global procurement centre, we are able to provide high quality, high margin inkjet and toner cartridges to our master franchisees, franchisees and our customers. every product goes through a stringent quality control process to ensure the highest quality standards are met. the reuse of empty cartridges is not only cost effective but also reduces the impact on the environment caused by unnecessary wastage.


















cartridge world global procurement center





the establishment of our own cartridge world global procurement center (cw-gpc), located in zhuhai, china, has been a significant investment by sgt.
the cw-gpc ensures our global network receives consistent high-quality printer cartridges at prices that keep our franchise stores competitive and more profitable, as well as intellectual property right compliant. in the imaging aftermarket the cw-gpc is unique, with quality assurance specialists ensuring consistent high quality is maintained through a three-stage quality assurance process to sixth sigma standards, as used by the original equipment manufacturers, or “oems”.”
“cwgpc has a huge benefit over anyone who purchases from chinese factory’s, through sgt’s intimate knowledge of the chinese factories sgt and cwgpc staff have pre-selected vendors that are capable of producing products to the cwgpc specifications.






































triple qc check
factory quality & product line audit by the cwgpc staff.











post-production inspection


once the factory has informed the cwgpc that the products have been produced our cwgpc qc staff will visit the factory to perform post production quality control checks and confirm that the build specification is as stated at component part level.











additional sampling


when a batch has passed the post-production inspection at the factory it is moved to the cwgpc warehouse where the batch is again sampled to ensure the products meet the cartridge world quality standard.
