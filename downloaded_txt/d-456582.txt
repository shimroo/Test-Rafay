mindmyhouse news
mindmyhouse news november 2024
dear mindmyhousies, kia ora (maori for hello and welcome) from aotearoa (new zealand) just before the christmas/holiday rush, but just after halloween. hot on the heels of our last newsletter (which featured lots of new stuff), here comes more!
mindmyhouse news september 2024
dear mindmyhousies, hello on the first week of the southern hemisphere spring time. it is glorious here with wild spring daffodils coming up all over the place. we’ve just dusted our hearth and put away the jute sack full of pine cones, as last night’s woodfire here at our house might just be the last for the year. hoping that the change of season, wherever you are on earth, feels just as mindfully pleasant…
social media update
you won’t find us on social media for a reason! we think that stuff is fluff. our business ethos is about providing our members with an advertising free zone in which to find each other and meet up to do all that adventuring while house sitting worldwide. no sponsorship, or pictures of women laughing at salad on our site! we also believe in humans (no bots or ai).

testimonials


                                thank you for all that you do (
                                owner)

                                we just renewed our membership and i wanted to send you a quick note to tell you how much we appreciate your website and everything you offer to your members. we have had wonderful house sitters for our own kitties and we’d love to do some housesitting ourselves so we are taking advantage of your wonderful combo option. we have been members of other platforms in the past and yours is by far the best. thank you for all that you do!                            

                                kirsten c, united states. jan 2025                            



                                thank you mmh (
                                sitter)

                                my 18-month experience with mmh has been nothing short of exceptional. the service has more than paid for itself, and what's truly unique is the personal touch-it's not just another service, but a team that responds to you as an individual, not with the usual bots or custom service scripts. i've had the pleasure of sitting for delightful and considerate homeowners, and this success was due to the successful rapport we established from the very beginning, discussing each party's needs and expectations explicitly. thank you mmh.                            

                                michael, united kingdom. nov 2024
