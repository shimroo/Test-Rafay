they first come for the youth- the nazis after invading yugoslavia (april 1941) partionioned the country.  crotia was created  as a new puppet state. croatian separtists had sought to create an independent state even before the invasion. they received support from musssolini's fascist government in italy. after the invasion, croatia became the most compliant of all the pro-nazi regimes. a italian prince was installed as king, but the regime was controlled by the ustashi. the croatia utashi launched perhaps the most deadly of all the world war ii holocausts. the ustashi not only targeted jews and gypseys, but also orthodox sebian christians in croatia and bosnia. the nazis included bisnia in the croatia state. we understand that the croatians founded a youth group known as the eagles, but we have not yet been able to find information about the group. we would be very interested in any information about the eagles that hbu readers might be able to provide.  the nazi and the jesuit  to include        the jesuits in this list of groups which influenced the nazis, will be        controversial to some and perhaps even outrage a few. the jesuits however        were greatly influential on the nazis, whether by design or not, or        whether in complicity or not. hitler had at least one reknown jesuit among        his closest advisors. himmler greatly admired jesuit order, and both        believed that the organization and system of the jesuit order were to be        emulated in the nazi party. the order was founded on september 27, 1540 as        the "society of jesus" and sanctioned by pope paul iii in the bull        regimini militantis ecclesiae ignatius of loyola greatly influenced the        church training an elite corp of highly educated priests who were        additionally trained in spiritual exercises. (see basic        jesuit spiritual exercises.) they have had a rocky history even within        the catholic church, and many were kicked out the the fledgling american        colonies, and the order in the 1700s was shut down by the papacy fearing        division and overthrow. the restored jesuit order had re-established        itself by the 1800s. himmler had been raised around jesuits and he admired        their philosophies and orders though by the time he reached power, one        could hardly have called him a believing catholic. still, he found merit        in the order and based some ss training on the principles of the group,        which in the extreme included altered states of consciousness and        meditations including 'mind-over-matter'. there were jesuits advising        hitler and jesuits imprisoned in the lagers, but the relationship to nazi        philosophies appears to be be in methodology and process more than        anything. the jesuits had taken many ideas from the ancient knight        templars, and adapted them, not unlike what himmler sought to do for the        nazis. most central was the idea of a messianic figure, the fuhrer        surrounded by an elite corp. von papen was once quoted as saying that        hitler put the organization of the catholic church to work for him:        himmler narrowed it to the jesuits.the murder of the serbians becauseof they're friendship with juwesduring the forced-labor period, serbs talked to their jewish friends in the streets even in front of the german soldiers and police. during the period when over 300,000 serbs were massacred by the croat utashi in bosnia, herzegovina and lika and some 60,000 shot by germans in serbia, during the period when serbian students and peasants were hung in the main square in belgrade, the serbs of the capital had sufficient courage to protest publicly their indignation at the treatment of the jews."click here for the complete story the ustashi in poland and why.....         the germans conducted the war against the jews with military precision, using an array of weapons like starvation, deliberate cruelty, pervasive terror, dehumanization.  extensive  psychological pressure and deception were used to demoralize the victims, to kill their will to live and change them into an amorphous mass, easily pushed into the gas chambers.  in the warsaw ghetto, for example, volunteers for the "resettlement" were offered 5 kilo of bread and one  kilo of sugar, and people were lining up to get into the death trains.           the war against the jews was very successful.  in poland alone about 98% of the jewish population was executed.  despite their military might and organizational skills, the germans needed help from local population.   the thorough liquidation of the jewry, killing of  millions of people without resistance and disturbances, required strict secrecy.  secrecy was required to keep the german population uninformed about the insane, criminal activities and it was also imperative not to alert the victims about their impending doom. in addition the germans required help in identifying, isolating and demoralizing of the jews.  secrecy  was of the utmost importance, because when in 1939, hitler started to gas the retarded germans, he was stopped by the protests of the population and denunciations by the clergy.  the germans constituted hitler's power base, and there was always a danger that they might raise their voices in defense of their jewish compatriots.  the way of the murders       in rumania, the iron guard,  the local fascists, hung jews from butcher hooks and slaughtered them like animals.  in croatia, the ustashi fascists, beat to death one hundred thousand people.  transporting jews to auschwitz was not necessary.  their barbarism is difficult to imagine.   one ustashi drag around a sack filled with eyes, pulled out from the victims' sockets.           in slovakia, a nationalistic government headed by a roman catholic priest, paid the german for the transporting their jews to auschwitz. even the gentile bulgars resettled thousands of "foreign" jews.  in hungary, in the last phases of the war, local fascist rounded up the jews to be delivered to auschwitz. hitler and ibm    when adolf hitler came to power in 1933, most of the         world saw a menace to humanity. but ibm saw nazi germany         as a lucrative trading partner. its president, thomas j.         watson, engineered a strategic business alliance between         ibm and the reich, beginning in the first days of the         hitler regime and continuing right through world war ii.  this alliance catapulted nazi germany to become ibm's         most important customer outside the u.s. ibm and the         nazis jointly designed, and ibm exclusively produced,         technological solutions that enabled hitler to accelerate         and in many ways automate key aspects of his persecution         of jews, homosexuals, jehovah's witnesses, and others the         nazis considered enemies.  custom-designed, ibm-produced punch cards, sorted by         ibm machines leased to the nazis, helped organize and         manage the initial identification and social expulsion of         jews and others, the confiscation of their property,         their ghettoization, their deportation, and, ultimately,         even their extermination.  recently discovered nazi documents and polish         eyewitness testimony make clear that ibm's alliance with         the third reich went far beyond its german subsidiary. a         key factor in the holocaust in poland was ibm technology         provided directly through a special wartime polish         subsidiary reporting to ibm new york, mainly to its         headquarters at 590 madison avenue.  and that's how the trains to auschwitz ran on time.  thousands of ibm documents reviewed for the first         edition of my book 'ibm and the holocaust,' published         early last year and focused mainly on ibm's german         subsidiary, revealed vigorous efforts to preserve ibm's         monopoly in the nazi market and increase contracts to         meet wartime sales quotas.  since then, continued research and interviews have         uncovered details, described here for the first time, of         ibm's work for the nazis in poland through the separate         subsidiary and of the polish subsidiary's direct contact         with ibm officials on madison avenue.  documents were obtained from ibm files shipped to nyu         for processing and from scores of other archival sources         here and abroad. not a single sentence written by ibm         personnel has been discovered in any of the documents         questioning the morality of automating the third reich,         even when headlines proclaimed the mass murder of jews.  ibm's german subsidiary was deutsche hollerith         maschinen gesellschaft, known by the acronym dehomag. (herman         hollerith was the german american who first automated u.s.         census information in the late 19th century and founded         the company which became ibm. hollerith's name became         synonymous with the machines and the nazi "departments"         that operated them.)  watson tightly managed the lucrative german operation,         traveling to berlin at least twice annually from 1933         until 1939 to personally supervise dehomag. major german         correspondence was translated for review by the new york         office and often for watson's personal comment. before         big new accounts were accepted, watson had to assent. for         deniability, he insisted on making direct verbal         instructions to his german managers the rule rather than         exception-even in place of major contracts. once, when         german managers wanted to paint a corridor, they awaited         his specific permission. watson's auditors continuously         tracked the source and status of every reichsmark and         pfennig-in one typical case, exchanging numerous         transatlantic letters over the disposition of just a few         dollars. not infrequently, dehomag managers objected to         his "domination." understandably, ibm's lawyers         and managers in berlin personally updated watson         constantly, and generally signed their reports, "awaiting         your further instructions."  no machines were sold to the nazis-only leased. ibm         was the sole source of all punch cards and spare parts,         and it serviced the machines on-site-whether at dachau or         in the heart of berlin-either directly or through its         authorized dealer network or field trainees. there were         no universal punch cards. each series was custom-designed         by ibm engineers not only to capture the information         going in, but also to tabulate the information the nazis         wanted to come out.  ibm constantly updated its machinery and applications         for the nazis. for example, one series of punch cards was         designed to record religion, national origin, and mother         tongue, but by creating special columns and rows for jew,         polish language, polish nationality, the fur trade as an         occupation, and then berlin, nazis could quickly cross-tabulate,         at the rate of 25,000 cards per hour, exactly how many         berlin furriers were jews of polish extraction. railroad         cars, which could take two weeks to locate and route,         could be swiftly dispatched in just 48 hours by means of         a vast network of punch-card machines. indeed, ibm         services coursed through the entire german infrastructure         in europe.  the ibm response asked about ibm's polish subsidiary's         involvement with the nazis, ibm spokeswoman carol         makovich in new york repeated the same official statement         she issued more than a year ago: "ibm does not have         much information about this period." asked a dozen         times, makovich simply repeated the phrase.  the war broke out on september 1, 1939, when germany         invaded poland. germany annexed northwestern poland; the         remaining polish territory in nazi hands was treated as         "occupied" and called the "general         government." that annexed northwestern quadrant was         serviced by ibm's german subsidiary, dehomag, mainly to         handle the payrolls of silesian coal mines and heavy         industry. at about that time, ibm new york established a         special subsidiary, watson business machines, to deal         with the general government. it remained completely legal         for ibm to service the third reich until just before         america entered the war in december 1941.  the savaging of poland was no secret to ibm executives.         from the outset, worldwide headlines reported barbarous         massacres, rapes, purposeful starvation, systematic         deportations, and the resulting unchecked epidemics. as         early as september 13, 1939, the new york times reported         the reich's determination to make polish jewry disappear,         a headline declaring, "nazis hint purge of jews in         poland." a subhead added, "3,000,000 population         involved." the article quoted the german         government's plan for the "removal of the polish         jewish population from the european domain." the         times added, "how . . . the 'removal' of jews from         poland [can be achieved] without their extermination . .         . is not explained."  germany had plans. polish jews, during a sequence of         sudden relocations, were to be catalogued for further         action in a massive cascade of repetitive censuses and         registrations with up-to-date information being instantly         available to various nazi planning agencies and         occupation offices. how much usable forced labor for         armament factories could they generate? how many         thousands would die of starvation each month? a spectrum         of nazi census, registration, and statistical tabulation         was performed on custom-designed ibm punch-card programs         and machinery.  on september 9, 1939, dehomag general manager hermann         rottke wrote directly to watson in new york, asking for         advanced equipment. rottke reminded watson, "during         your last visit in berlin at the beginning of july, you         made the kind offer to me that you might be willing to         furnish the german company machines from endicott [an ibm         factory near binghamton] in order to shorten our long         delivery terms. . . . you have complied with this         request, for which i thank you very much, and have added         that in cases of urgent need, i may make use of other         american machines. . . . you will understand that under         today's conditions, a certain need has arisen for such         machines, which we do not build as yet in germany.         therefore, i should like to make use of your kind offer         and ask you to leave with the german company . . . the         alphabetic tabulating machines. . . . "  eighteen days later, a vanquished warsaw formally         capitulated. the next day, september 28, ibm's general         manager in geneva, j.w. schotte, telephoned berlin to         confirm watson's permission for the new equipment.  meanwhile, reinhard heydrich, chief of heinrich         himmler's security service, the sd, had already         circulated a top-secret letter to the chiefs of his         einsatzgruppen, which evolved into mobile killing units.         heydrich's september 21 memo, titled "the jewish         question in the occupied territory," laid out a plan         of population control through a sequence of strategic         censuses and registrations. it began, "i would like         to point out once more that the total measures planned (i.e.,         the final aim) are to be kept strictly secret."         first, jews were to be relocated to so-called         concentration towns at "either railroad junctions or         at least on a railway." addressing the zone from         east of kraków to the former czechoslovakian-polish         border, heydrich directed, "within this territory,         only a temporary census of jews need be taken."         heydrich demanded that "the chiefs of the         einsatzgruppen report to me continually regarding . . .         the census of jews in their districts. . . . "  shortly thereafter, heydrich sent a follow-up cable to         his occupying forces in poland, upper silesia, and         czechoslovakia, outlining how a new december 17 census         would escalate the process from mere identification and         cataloguing to deportation and execution. heydrich's memo         entitled "evacuation of the new eastern provinces"         decreed:  "the evacuation of poles and jews in the new         eastern provinces will be conducted by the security         police. . . . the census documents provide the basis for         the evacuation. all persons in the new provinces possess         a copy. the census form is the temporary identification         card giving permission to stay. therefore, all persons         have to hand over the card before deportation. . . .         anyone caught without this card is subject to possible         execution. . . . "  quantifying and organizing the deportation of millions         of people from various regions across eastern europe         could take years using pencils and paper. relying upon         the lightning speed of hollerith machines, it took just         days. heydrich assured, "that means the large-scale         evacuation can begin no sooner than around january 1,         1940." nazi germany employed only one method for         conducting a census: ibm punch-card processes, each one         designed for the specific census.  in nazi poland, railroads constituted about 95 percent         of the ibm subsidiary's business, using as many as 21         million punch cards annually. watson business machines         was headquartered at kreuz 23 in warsaw. and one of its         important customer sites, newly discovered since the         first edition of my book was published a year ago, was         the hollerith department of polish railways, at 22 pawia         street in kraków. this office kept tabs on all trains in         the general government, including those that sent jews to         their death in auschwitz.  leon krzemieniecki is probably the only man still         living who worked in that hollerith department. it must         be emphasized that krzemieniecki did not understand any         of the details of the genocidal train destinations. his         duties required tabulating information on all trains,         from ordinary passenger to freight trains, but only after         their arrival.  the high-security five-room office, guarded by armed         railway police, was equipped with 15 punchers, two         sorters, and a tabulator "bigger than a sofa."         fifteen polish women punched the cards and loaded the         sorters. three german nationals supervised the office,         overseeing the final tabulations and summary statistics         in great secrecy. handfuls of printouts were reduced to a         small envelope of summary data, which was then delivered         to a secret destination. truckloads of the preliminary         printouts were then regularly burned, along with the         spent cards, krzemieniecki told me in an interview.  as a forced laborer, krzemieniecki was compelled to         work as a "sorter and tabulator" 10 hours per         day for two years. he never realized that his work         involved the transportation of jews to gas chambers.  "i only know that this very modern equipment made         possible the control of all the railway traffic in the         general government," he said.  krzemieniecki recalled that an "outside         technician," who spoke german and polish and "did         not work for the railroad," was almost constantly on-site         to keep the machines running, performing major         maintenance monthly.  ibm's tailored railroad-management programs, several         million custom-designed punch cards printed at ibm's         print shop at 6 rymarska street, across from the warsaw         ghetto, and the railway's leased machines were under the         new york-controlled subsidiary in warsaw, not the german         subsidiary, dehomag. the distinction is important. since         the disclosures about ibm's involvement in the holocaust         first surfaced in february 2001, the company has         continually pointed to supposed lack of control of its         german subsidiary. but watson business machines was         established in poland by ibm new york itself, at the time         of germany's invasion.  "i knew they were not german machines,"         recalled krzemieniecki. "the labels were in english.         . . . the person maintaining and repairing the machines         spread the diagrams out sometimes. the language of the         diagrams of those machines was only in english."  i asked krzemieniecki if the machine logo plates were         in german, polish, or english. he answered, "english.         it said, 'business machines.' " i asked, "do         you mean 'international business machines'?"         krzemieniecki replied, "no, 'watson business         machines.' "  dwarfing the railroad operation in poland described by         krzemieniecki was a massive hollerith statistical center         at 24 murner street in kraków, staffed by more than 500         punching and tabulating employees and equipped with         dozens of machines. new research has uncovered the         existence of a previously unknown berlin agency, the         central office for foreign statistics and foreign country         research, which continuously received detailed data from         the kraków statistical center.  by late 1939, the reich's jewish-population statistics         wizard, fritz arlt, had been appointed head of the         population and welfare administration of the general         government. a hollerith expert and colleague of adolf         eichmann, arlt edited his own statistical publication,         political information service of the general government,         which featured such data as jews per square meter, with         projections of decrease from forced labor and starvation.          "we can count on the mortality of some subjugated         groups," one arlt article asserted. "these         include babies and those over the age of 65, as well as         those who are basically weak and ill in all other age         groups."  the data-hungry nazis created an expanded statistics         office in kraków in 1940. the expansion was dependent on         more leased machines, spare parts, company technicians,         and a guaranteed continued supply of millions of         additional ibm cards. ibm's european general manager,         werner lier, visited berlin in early october 1941 to         oversee ibm new york's deployment of machines in poland         and other countries. in two detailed reports, written         from berlin and sent to watson, as well as to other         senior staff in new york, lier reported moving a small         group of polish machines into romania for the jewish         census there. the polish machines would soon be replaced         by others.  the expanded statistics office assured berlin in a         november 30, 1941, report that its hollerith operation         would employ equipment more modern than the old ibm         machinery found in most pre-war polish data agencies,         thus allowing the nazis to launch a plethora of "large-scale         censuses." also planned was a long list of "continuous         statistical surveys," including those for         population, domestic migration, and causes of death.         moreover, regular surveys of food and agriculture were         "coupled with summary surveys of the population and         ethnic groups." tabulating food supplies against         ethnic numbers allowed the nazis to ration caloric intake         as they subjected the jewish community to starvation.  the statistics office's report concluded, "our         work is just beginning to bear fruit."  once the u.s. entered the war in december 1941,         germany appointed a nazi devoted to ibm, hermann         fellinger, as enemy-property custodian. he maintained the         original staff and managers of watson business machines,         keeping it productive for the reich and profitable for         ibm. the subsidiary now reported to ibm's geneva office,         and from there to new york. the company was not looted,         its leased machines were not seized. "royalties"         were remitted to ibm through geneva. lease payments and         profits were preserved in special accounts. after the         war, ibm recovered all its polish profits and machines.  since the war, ibm, having left madison avenue for new         headquarters in suburban armonk, has obstructed, or         refused to cooperate with, virtually every major         independent author writing about its history, according         to numerous published introductions, prefaces, and         acknowledgments.  but silence cannot alter the historical documentation.         a tangle of subsidiaries throughout europe helped ibm         reap the benefits of its partnership with nazi germany.         after all, "business" was ibm's middle name.  reprinted from village

into his newly created         central intelligence agency. this is discussed in 'worst kept         secrets of a bumbling bear,' by jared israel at http://tenc.net/docs/gehlen2.htm  3. in the early 1990s the nato         countries welcomed a 'new democracy,' the secessionist         state of croatia. in fact, it was modeled on the         independent state of croatia formed under nazi guidance         during world war ii and responsible for creating the         first nazi death camp, at jasenovac, where hundreds of         thousands of human beings, mainly serbian farmers, were         slaughtered in ways that stunned even the nazis. see 'meet the nazis the cia married: the croatian         ustashi,' by petar makara and         jared israel at http://emperors-clothes.com/docs/backin.htm      when adolf hitler came to power in 1933, most of the         world saw a menace to humanity. but ibm saw nazi germany         as a lucrative trading partner. its president, thomas j.         watson, engineered a strategic business alliance between         ibm and the reich, beginning in the first days of the         hitler regime and continuing right through world war ii.  this alliance catapulted nazi germany to become ibm's         most important customer outside the u.s. ibm and the         nazis jointly designed, and ibm exclusively produced,         technological solutions that enabled hitler to accelerate         and in many ways automate key aspects of his persecution         of jews, homosexuals, jehovah's witnesses, and others the         nazis considered enemies.  custom-designed, ibm-produced punch cards, sorted by         ibm machines leased to the nazis, helped organize and         manage the initial identification and social expulsion of         jews and others, the confiscation of their property,         their ghettoization, their deportation, and, ultimately,         even their extermination.  recently discovered nazi documents and polish         eyewitness testimony make clear that ibm's alliance with         the third reich went far beyond its german subsidiary. a         key factor in the holocaust in poland was ibm technology         provided directly through a special wartime polish         subsidiary reporting to ibm new york, mainly to its         headquarters at 590 madison avenue.  and that's how the trains to auschwitz ran on time.  thousands of ibm documents reviewed for the first         edition of my book 'ibm and the holocaust,' published         early last year and focused mainly on ibm's german         subsidiary, revealed vigorous efforts to preserve ibm's         monopoly in the nazi market and increase contracts to         meet wartime sales quotas.  since then, continued research and interviews have         uncovered details, described here for the first time, of         ibm's work for the nazis in poland through the separate         subsidiary and of the polish subsidiary's direct contact         with ibm officials on madison avenue.  documents were obtained from ibm files shipped to nyu         for processing and from scores of other archival sources         here and abroad. not a single sentence written by ibm         personnel has been discovered in any of the documents         questioning the morality of automating the third reich,         even when headlines proclaimed the mass murder of jews.  ibm's german subsidiary was deutsche hollerith         maschinen gesellschaft, known by the acronym dehomag. (herman         hollerith was the german american who first automated u.s.         census information in the late 19th century and founded         the company which became ibm. hollerith's name became         synonymous with the machines and the nazi "departments"         that operated them.)  watson tightly managed the lucrative german operation,         traveling to berlin at least twice annually from 1933         until 1939 to personally supervise dehomag. major german         correspondence was translated for review by the new york         office and often for watson's personal comment. before         big new accounts were accepted, watson had to assent. for         deniability, he insisted on making direct verbal         instructions to his german managers the rule rather than         exception-even in place of major contracts. once, when         german managers wanted to paint a corridor, they awaited         his specific permission. watson's auditors continuously         tracked the source and status of every reichsmark and         pfennig-in one typical case, exchanging numerous         transatlantic letters over the disposition of just a few         dollars. not infrequently, dehomag managers objected to         his "domination." understandably, ibm's lawyers         and managers in berlin personally updated watson         constantly, and generally signed their reports, "awaiting         your further instructions."  no machines were sold to the nazis-only leased. ibm         was the sole source of all punch cards and spare parts,         and it serviced the machines on-site-whether at dachau or         in the heart of berlin-either directly or through its         authorized dealer network or field trainees. there were         no universal punch cards. each series was custom-designed         by ibm engineers not only to capture the information         going in, but also to tabulate the information the nazis         wanted to come out.  ibm constantly updated its machinery and applications         for the nazis. for example, one series of punch cards was         designed to record religion, national origin, and mother         tongue, but by creating special columns and rows for jew,         polish language, polish nationality, the fur trade as an         occupation, and then berlin, nazis could quickly cross-tabulate,         at the rate of 25,000 cards per hour, exactly how many         berlin furriers were jews of polish extraction. railroad         cars, which could take two weeks to locate and route,         could be swiftly dispatched in just 48 hours by means of         a vast network of punch-card machines. indeed, ibm         services coursed through the entire german infrastructure         in europe.  the ibm response asked about ibm's polish subsidiary's         involvement with the nazis, ibm spokeswoman carol         makovich in new york repeated the same official statement         she issued more than a year ago: "ibm does not have         much information about this period." asked a dozen         times, makovich simply repeated the phrase.  the war broke out on september 1, 1939, when germany         invaded poland. germany annexed northwestern poland; the         remaining polish territory in nazi hands was treated as         "occupied" and called the "general         government." that annexed northwestern quadrant was         serviced by ibm's german subsidiary, dehomag, mainly to         handle the payrolls of silesian coal mines and heavy         industry. at about that time, ibm new york established a         special subsidiary, watson business machines, to deal         with the general government. it remained completely legal         for ibm to service the third reich until just before         america entered the war in december 1941.  the savaging of poland was no secret to ibm executives.         from the outset, worldwide headlines reported barbarous         massacres, rapes, purposeful starvation, systematic         deportations, and the resulting unchecked epidemics. as         early as september 13, 1939, the new york times reported         the reich's determination to make polish jewry disappear,         a headline declaring, "nazis hint purge of jews in         poland." a subhead added, "3,000,000 population         involved." the article quoted the german         government's plan for the "removal of the polish         jewish population from the european domain." the         times added, "how . . . the 'removal' of jews from         poland [can be achieved] without their extermination . .         . is not explained."  germany had plans. polish jews, during a sequence of         sudden relocations, were to be catalogued for further         action in a massive cascade of repetitive censuses and         registrations with up-to-date information being instantly         available to various nazi planning agencies and         occupation offices. how much usable forced labor for         armament factories could they generate? how many         thousands would die of starvation each month? a spectrum         of nazi census, registration, and statistical tabulation         was performed on custom-designed ibm punch-card programs         and machinery.  on september 9, 1939, dehomag general manager hermann         rottke wrote directly to watson in new york, asking for         advanced equipment. rottke reminded watson, "during         your last visit in berlin at the beginning of july, you         made the kind offer to me that you might be willing to         furnish the german company machines from endicott [an ibm         factory near binghamton] in order to shorten our long         delivery terms. . . . you have complied with this         request, for which i thank you very much, and have added         that in cases of urgent need, i may make use of other         american machines. . . . you will understand that under         today's conditions, a certain need has arisen for such         machines, which we do not build as yet in germany.         therefore, i should like to make use of your kind offer         and ask you to leave with the german company . . . the         alphabetic tabulating machines. . . . "  eighteen days later, a vanquished warsaw formally         capitulated. the next day, september 28, ibm's general         manager in geneva, j.w. schotte, telephoned berlin to         confirm watson's permission for the new equipment.  meanwhile, reinhard heydrich, chief of heinrich         himmler's security service, the sd, had already         circulated a top-secret letter to the chiefs of his         einsatzgruppen, which evolved into mobile killing units.         heydrich's september 21 memo, titled "the jewish         question in the occupied territory," laid out a plan         of population control through a sequence of strategic         censuses and registrations. it began, "i would like         to point out once more that the total measures planned (i.e.,         the final aim) are to be kept strictly secret."         first, jews were to be relocated to so-called         concentration towns at "either railroad junctions or         at least on a railway." addressing the zone from         east of kraków to the former czechoslovakian-polish         border, heydrich directed, "within this territory,         only a temporary census of jews need be taken."         heydrich demanded that "the chiefs of the         einsatzgruppen report to me continually regarding . . .         the census of jews in their districts. . . . "  shortly thereafter, heydrich sent a follow-up cable to         his occupying forces in poland, upper silesia, and         czechoslovakia, outlining how a new december 17 census         would escalate the process from mere identification and         cataloguing to deportation and execution. heydrich's memo         entitled "evacuation of the new eastern provinces"         decreed:  "the evacuation of poles and jews in the new         eastern provinces will be conducted by the security         police. . . . the census documents provide the basis for         the evacuation. all persons in the new provinces possess         a copy. the census form is the temporary identification         card giving permission to stay. therefore, all persons         have to hand over the card before deportation. . . .         anyone caught without this card is subject to possible         execution. . . . "  quantifying and organizing the deportation of millions         of people from various regions across eastern europe         could take years using pencils and paper. relying upon         the lightning speed of hollerith machines, it took just         days. heydrich assured, "that means the large-scale         evacuation can begin no sooner than around january 1,         1940." nazi germany employed only one method for         conducting a census: ibm punch-card processes, each one         designed for the specific census.  in nazi poland, railroads constituted about 95 percent         of the ibm subsidiary's business, using as many as 21         million punch cards annually. watson business machines         was headquartered at kreuz 23 in warsaw. and one of its         important customer sites, newly discovered since the         first edition of my book was published a year ago, was         the hollerith department of polish railways, at 22 pawia         street in kraków. this office kept tabs on all trains in         the general government, including those that sent jews to         their death in auschwitz.  leon krzemieniecki is probably the only man still         living who worked in that hollerith department. it must         be emphasized that krzemieniecki did not understand any         of the details of the genocidal train destinations. his         duties required tabulating information on all trains,         from ordinary passenger to freight trains, but only after         their arrival.  the high-security five-room office, guarded by armed         railway police, was equipped with 15 punchers, two         sorters, and a tabulator "bigger than a sofa."         fifteen polish women punched the cards and loaded the         sorters. three german nationals supervised the office,         overseeing the final tabulations and summary statistics         in great secrecy. handfuls of printouts were reduced to a         small envelope of summary data, which was then delivered         to a secret destination. truckloads of the preliminary         printouts were then regularly burned, along with the         spent cards, krzemieniecki told me in an interview.  as a forced laborer, krzemieniecki was compelled to         work as a "sorter and tabulator" 10 hours per         day for two years. he never realized that his work         involved the transportation of jews to gas chambers.  "i only know that this very modern equipment made         possible the control of all the railway traffic in the         general government," he said.  krzemieniecki recalled that an "outside         technician," who spoke german and polish and "did         not work for the railroad," was almost constantly on-site         to keep the machines running, performing major         maintenance monthly.  ibm's tailored railroad-management programs, several         million custom-designed punch cards printed at ibm's         print shop at 6 rymarska street, across from the warsaw         ghetto, and the railway's leased machines were under the         new york-controlled subsidiary in warsaw, not the german         subsidiary, dehomag. the distinction is important. since         the disclosures about ibm's involvement in the holocaust         first surfaced in february 2001, the company has         continually pointed to supposed lack of control of its         german subsidiary. but watson business machines was         established in poland by ibm new york itself, at the time         of germany's invasion.  "i knew they were not german machines,"         recalled krzemieniecki. "the labels were in english.         . . . the person maintaining and repairing the machines         spread the diagrams out sometimes. the language of the         diagrams of those machines was only in english."  i asked krzemieniecki if the machine logo plates were         in german, polish, or english. he answered, "english.         it said, 'business machines.' " i asked, "do         you mean 'international business machines'?"         krzemieniecki replied, "no, 'watson business         machines.' "  dwarfing the railroad operation in poland described by         krzemieniecki was a massive hollerith statistical center         at 24 murner street in kraków, staffed by more than 500         punching and tabulating employees and equipped with         dozens of machines. new research has uncovered the         existence of a previously unknown berlin agency, the         central office for foreign statistics and foreign country         research, which continuously received detailed data from         the kraków statistical center.  by late 1939, the reich's jewish-population statistics         wizard, fritz arlt, had been appointed head of the         population and welfare administration of the general         government. a hollerith expert and colleague of adolf         eichmann, arlt edited his own statistical publication,         political information service of the general government,         which featured such data as jews per square meter, with         projections of decrease from forced labor and starvation.          "we can count on the mortality of some subjugated         groups," one arlt article asserted. "these         include babies and those over the age of 65, as well as         those who are basically weak and ill in all other age         groups."  the data-hungry nazis created an expanded statistics         office in kraków in 1940. the expansion was dependent on         more leased machines, spare parts, company technicians,         and a guaranteed continued supply of millions of         additional ibm cards. ibm's european general manager,         werner lier, visited berlin in early october 1941 to         oversee ibm new york's deployment of machines in poland         and other countries. in two detailed reports, written         from berlin and sent to watson, as well as to other         senior staff in new york, lier reported moving a small         group of polish machines into romania for the jewish         census there. the polish machines would soon be replaced         by others.  the expanded statistics office assured berlin in a         november 30, 1941, report that its hollerith operation         would employ equipment more modern than the old ibm         machinery found in most pre-war polish data agencies,         thus allowing the nazis to launch a plethora of "large-scale         censuses." also planned was a long list of "continuous         statistical surveys," including those for         population, domestic migration, and causes of death.         moreover, regular surveys of food and agriculture were         "coupled with summary surveys of the population and         ethnic groups." tabulating food supplies against         ethnic numbers allowed the nazis to ration caloric intake         as they subjected the jewish community to starvation.  the statistics office's report concluded, "our         work is just beginning to bear fruit."  once the u.s. entered the war in december 1941,         germany appointed a nazi devoted to ibm, hermann         fellinger, as enemy-property custodian. he maintained the         original staff and managers of watson business machines,         keeping it productive for the reich and profitable for         ibm. the subsidiary now reported to ibm's geneva office,         and from there to new york. the company was not looted,         its leased machines were not seized. "royalties"         were remitted to ibm through geneva. lease payments and         profits were preserved in special accounts. after the         war, ibm recovered all its polish profits and machines.  since the war, ibm, having left madison avenue for new         headquarters in suburban armonk, has obstructed, or         refused to cooperate with, virtually every major         independent author writing about its history, according         to numerous published introductions, prefaces, and         acknowledgments.  but silence cannot alter the historical documentation.         a tangle of subsidiaries throughout europe helped ibm         reap the benefits of its partnership with nazi germany.         after all, "business" was ibm's middle name.  reprinted from village voice for fair use only http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0213/black.php  edwin black is the author of         "ibm and the holocaust: the strategic alliance         between nazi germany and america's most powerful         corporation" (crown books, 2001, and three rivers         press, 2002), just released in paperback with new         information. it         can be purchased by going to http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/0609808990/qid=1017245312/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_67_1/104-3447553-7176714  *********************** further reading: *********************** 1. on the involvement of prescott bush and george         herbert walker, grandfather and great-grandfather of the         current us president, along with allen and john foster         dulles, in helping finance the nazis and setting up an         intelligence apparatus for them in the us, see 'nazis in         the attic.'        the section dealing specifically with the bush family can         be read at http://emperors-clothes.com/articles/randy/swas5.htm  2. after world war ii, allen dulles saved and         recruited thousands of members of the nazi's european         spying-&-butchery apparatus into his newly created         central intelligence agency. this is discussed in 'worst kept         secrets of a bumbling bear,' by jared israel at http://tenc.net/docs/gehlen2.htm  3. in the early 1990s the nato         countries welcomed a 'new democracy,' the secessionist         state of croatia. in fact, it was modeled on the         independent state of croatia formed under nazi guidance         during world war ii and responsible for creating the         first nazi death camp, at jasenovac, where hundreds of         thousands of human beings, mainly serbian farmers, were         slaughtered in ways that stunned even the nazis. see 'meet the nazis the cia married: the croatian         ustashi,' by petar makara and         jared israel at http://emperors-clothes.com/docs/backin.htm

they first come for the youth- the nazis after invading yugoslavia (april 1941) partionioned the country.  crotia was created  as a new puppet state. croatian separtists had sought to create an independent state even before the invasion. they received support from musssolini's fascist government in italy. after the invasion, croatia became the most compliant of all the pro-nazi regimes. a italian prince was installed as king, but the regime was controlled by the ustashi. the croatia utashi launched perhaps the most deadly of all the world war ii holocausts. the ustashi not only targeted jews and gypseys, but also orthodox sebian christians in croatia and bosnia. the nazis included bisnia in the croatia state. we understand that the croatians founded a youth group known as the eagles, but we have not yet been able to find information about the group. we would be very interested in any information about the eagles that hbu readers might be able to provide.  the nazi and the jesuit  to include        the jesuits in this list of groups which influenced the nazis, will be        controversial to some and perhaps even outrage a few. the jesuits however        were greatly influential on the nazis, whether by design or not, or        whether in complicity or not. hitler had at least one reknown jesuit among        his closest advisors. himmler greatly admired jesuit order, and both        believed that the organization and system of the jesuit order were to be        emulated in the nazi party. the order was founded on september 27, 1540 as        the "society of jesus" and sanctioned by pope paul iii in the bull        regimini militantis ecclesiae ignatius of loyola greatly influenced the        church training an elite corp of highly educated priests who were        additionally trained in spiritual exercises. (see basic        jesuit spiritual exercises.) they have had a rocky history even within        the catholic church, and many were kicked out the the fledgling american        colonies, and the order in the 1700s was shut down by the papacy fearing        division and overthrow. the restored jesuit order had re-established        itself by the 1800s. himmler had been raised around jesuits and he admired        their philosophies and orders though by the time he reached power, one        could hardly have called him a believing catholic. still, he found merit        in the order and based some ss training on the principles of the group,        which in the extreme included altered states of consciousness and        meditations including 'mind-over-matter'. there were jesuits advising        hitler and jesuits imprisoned in the lagers, but the relationship to nazi        philosophies appears to be be in methodology and process more than        anything. the jesuits had taken many ideas from the ancient knight        templars, and adapted them, not unlike what himmler sought to do for the        nazis. most central was the idea of a messianic figure, the fuhrer        surrounded by an elite corp. von papen was once quoted as saying that        hitler put the organization of the catholic church to work for him:        himmler narrowed it to the jesuits.the murder of the serbians becauseof they're friendship with juwesduring the forced-labor period, serbs talked to their jewish friends in the streets even in front of the german soldiers and police. during the period when over 300,000 serbs were massacred by the croat utashi in bosnia, herzegovina and lika and some 60,000 shot by germans in serbia, during the period when serbian students and peasants were hung in the main square in belgrade, the serbs of the capital had sufficient courage to protest publicly their indignation at the treatment of the jews."click here for the complete story the ustashi in poland and why.....         the germans conducted the war against the jews with military precision, using an array of weapons like starvation, deliberate cruelty, pervasive terror, dehumanization.  extensive  psychological pressure and deception were used to demoralize the victims, to kill their will to live and change them into an amorphous mass, easily pushed into the gas chambers.  in the warsaw ghetto, for example, volunteers for the "resettlement" were offered 5 kilo of bread and one  kilo of sugar, and people were lining up to get into the death trains.           the war against the jews was very successful.  in poland alone about 98% of the jewish population was executed.  despite their military might and organizational skills, the germans needed help from local population.   the thorough liquidation of the jewry, killing of  millions of people without resistance and disturbances, required strict secrecy.  secrecy was required to keep the german population uninformed about the insane, criminal activities and it was also imperative not to alert the victims about their impending doom. in addition the germans required help in identifying, isolating and demoralizing of the jews.  secrecy  was of the utmost importance, because when in 1939, hitler started to gas the retarded germans, he was stopped by the protests of the population and denunciations by the clergy.  the germans constituted hitler's power base, and there was always a danger that they might raise their voices in defense of their jewish compatriots.  the way of the murders       in rumania, the iron guard,  the local fascists, hung jews from butcher hooks and slaughtered them like animals.  in croatia, the ustashi fascists, beat to death one hundred thousand people.  transporting jews to auschwitz was not necessary.  their barbarism is difficult to imagine.   one ustashi drag around a sack filled with eyes, pulled out from the victims' sockets.           in slovakia, a nationalistic government headed by a roman catholic priest, paid the german for the transporting their jews to auschwitz. even the gentile bulgars resettled thousands of "foreign" jews.  in hungary, in the last phases of the war, local fascist rounded up the jews to be delivered to auschwitz. hitler and ibm    when adolf hitler came to power in 1933, most of the         world saw a menace to humanity. but ibm saw nazi germany         as a lucrative trading partner. its president, thomas j.         watson, engineered a strategic business alliance between         ibm and the reich, beginning in the first days of the         hitler regime and continuing right through world war ii.  this alliance catapulted nazi germany to become ibm's         most important customer outside the u.s. ibm and the         nazis jointly designed, and ibm exclusively produced,         technological solutions that enabled hitler to accelerate         and in many ways automate key aspects of his persecution         of jews, homosexuals, jehovah's witnesses, and others the         nazis considered enemies.  custom-designed, ibm-produced punch cards, sorted by         ibm machines leased to the nazis, helped organize and         manage the initial identification and social expulsion of         jews and others, the confiscation of their property,         their ghettoization, their deportation, and, ultimately,         even their extermination.  recently discovered nazi documents and polish         eyewitness testimony make clear that ibm's alliance with         the third reich went far beyond its german subsidiary. a         key factor in the holocaust in poland was ibm technology         provided directly through a special wartime polish         subsidiary reporting to ibm new york, mainly to its         headquarters at 590 madison avenue.  and that's how the trains to auschwitz ran on time.  thousands of ibm documents reviewed for the first         edition of my book 'ibm and the holocaust,' published         early last year and focused mainly on ibm's german         subsidiary, revealed vigorous efforts to preserve ibm's         monopoly in the nazi market and increase contracts to         meet wartime sales quotas.  since then, continued research and interviews have         uncovered details, described here for the first time, of         ibm's work for the nazis in poland through the separate         subsidiary and of the polish subsidiary's direct contact         with ibm officials on madison avenue.  documents were obtained from ibm files shipped to nyu         for processing and from scores of other archival sources         here and abroad. not a single sentence written by ibm         personnel has been discovered in any of the documents         questioning the morality of automating the third reich,         even when headlines proclaimed the mass murder of jews.  ibm's german subsidiary was deutsche hollerith         maschinen gesellschaft, known by the acronym dehomag. (herman         hollerith was the german american who first automated u.s.         census information in the late 19th century and founded         the company which became ibm. hollerith's name became         synonymous with the machines and the nazi "departments"         that operated them.)  watson tightly managed the lucrative german operation,         traveling to berlin at least twice annually from 1933         until 1939 to personally supervise dehomag. major german         correspondence was translated for review by the new york         office and often for watson's personal comment. before         big new accounts were accepted, watson had to assent. for         deniability, he insisted on making direct verbal         instructions to his german managers the rule rather than         exception-even in place of major contracts. once, when         german managers wanted to paint a corridor, they awaited         his specific permission. watson's auditors continuously         tracked the source and status of every reichsmark and         pfennig-in one typical case, exchanging numerous         transatlantic letters over the disposition of just a few         dollars. not infrequently, dehomag managers objected to         his "domination." understandably, ibm's lawyers         and managers in berlin personally updated watson         constantly, and generally signed their reports, "awaiting         your further instructions."  no machines were sold to the nazis-only leased. ibm         was the sole source of all punch cards and spare parts,         and it serviced the machines on-site-whether at dachau or         in the heart of berlin-either directly or through its         authorized dealer network or field trainees. there were         no universal punch cards. each series was custom-designed         by ibm engineers not only to capture the information         going in, but also to tabulate the information the nazis         wanted to come out.  ibm constantly updated its machinery and applications         for the nazis. for example, one series of punch cards was         designed to record religion, national origin, and mother         tongue, but by creating special columns and rows for jew,         polish language, polish nationality, the fur trade as an         occupation, and then berlin, nazis could quickly cross-tabulate,         at the rate of 25,000 cards per hour, exactly how many         berlin furriers were jews of polish extraction. railroad         cars, which could take two weeks to locate and route,         could be swiftly dispatched in just 48 hours by means of         a vast network of punch-card machines. indeed, ibm         services coursed through the entire german infrastructure         in europe.  the ibm response asked about ibm's polish subsidiary's         involvement with the nazis, ibm spokeswoman carol         makovich in new york repeated the same official statement         she issued more than a year ago: "ibm does not have         much information about this period." asked a dozen         times, makovich simply repeated the phrase.  the war broke out on september 1, 1939, when germany         invaded poland. germany annexed northwestern poland; the         remaining polish territory in nazi hands was treated as         "occupied" and called the "general         government." that annexed northwestern quadrant was         serviced by ibm's german subsidiary, dehomag, mainly to         handle the payrolls of silesian coal mines and heavy         industry. at about that time, ibm new york established a         special subsidiary, watson business machines, to deal         with the general government. it remained completely legal         for ibm to service the third reich until just before         america entered the war in december 1941.  the savaging of poland was no secret to ibm executives.         from the outset, worldwide headlines reported barbarous         massacres, rapes, purposeful starvation, systematic         deportations, and the resulting unchecked epidemics. as         early as september 13, 1939, the new york times reported         the reich's determination to make polish jewry disappear,         a headline declaring, "nazis hint purge of jews in         poland." a subhead added, "3,000,000 population         involved." the article quoted the german         government's plan for the "removal of the polish         jewish population from the european domain." the         times added, "how . . . the 'removal' of jews from         poland [can be achieved] without their extermination . .         . is not explained."  germany had plans. polish jews, during a sequence of         sudden relocations, were to be catalogued for further         action in a massive cascade of repetitive censuses and         registrations with up-to-date information being instantly         available to various nazi planning agencies and         occupation offices. how much usable forced labor for         armament factories could they generate? how many         thousands would die of starvation each month? a spectrum         of nazi census, registration, and statistical tabulation         was performed on custom-designed ibm punch-card programs         and machinery.  on september 9, 1939, dehomag general manager hermann         rottke wrote directly to watson in new york, asking for         advanced equipment. rottke reminded watson, "during         your last visit in berlin at the beginning of july, you         made the kind offer to me that you might be willing to         furnish the german company machines from endicott [an ibm         factory near binghamton] in order to shorten our long         delivery terms. . . . you have complied with this         request, for which i thank you very much, and have added         that in cases of urgent need, i may make use of other         american machines. . . . you will understand that under         today's conditions, a certain need has arisen for such         machines, which we do not build as yet in germany.         therefore, i should like to make use of your kind offer         and ask you to leave with the german company . . . the         alphabetic tabulating machines. . . . "  eighteen days later, a vanquished warsaw formally         capitulated. the next day, september 28, ibm's general         manager in geneva, j.w. schotte, telephoned berlin to         confirm watson's permission for the new equipment.  meanwhile, reinhard heydrich, chief of heinrich         himmler's security service, the sd, had already         circulated a top-secret letter to the chiefs of his         einsatzgruppen, which evolved into mobile killing units.         heydrich's september 21 memo, titled "the jewish         question in the occupied territory," laid out a plan         of population control through a sequence of strategic         censuses and registrations. it began, "i would like         to point out once more that the total measures planned (i.e.,         the final aim) are to be kept strictly secret."         first, jews were to be relocated to so-called         concentration towns at "either railroad junctions or         at least on a railway." addressing the zone from         east of kraków to the former czechoslovakian-polish         border, heydrich directed, "within this territory,         only a temporary census of jews need be taken."         heydrich demanded that "the chiefs of the         einsatzgruppen report to me continually regarding . . .         the census of jews in their districts. . . . "  shortly thereafter, heydrich sent a follow-up cable to         his occupying forces in poland, upper silesia, and         czechoslovakia, outlining how a new december 17 census         would escalate the process from mere identification and         cataloguing to deportation and execution. heydrich's memo         entitled "evacuation of the new eastern provinces"         decreed:  "the evacuation of poles and jews in the new         eastern provinces will be conducted by the security         police. . . . the census documents provide the basis for         the evacuation. all persons in the new provinces possess         a copy. the census form is the temporary identification         card giving permission to stay. therefore, all persons         have to hand over the card before deportation. . . .         anyone caught without this card is subject to possible         execution. . . . "  quantifying and organizing the deportation of millions         of people from various regions across eastern europe         could take years using pencils and paper. relying upon         the lightning speed of hollerith machines, it took just         days. heydrich assured, "that means the large-scale         evacuation can begin no sooner than around january 1,         1940." nazi germany employed only one method for         conducting a census: ibm punch-card processes, each one         designed for the specific census.  in nazi poland, railroads constituted about 95 percent         of the ibm subsidiary's business, using as many as 21         million punch cards annually. watson business machines         was headquartered at kreuz 23 in warsaw. and one of its         important customer sites, newly discovered since the         first edition of my book was published a year ago, was         the hollerith department of polish railways, at 22 pawia         street in kraków. this office kept tabs on all trains in         the general government, including those that sent jews to         their death in auschwitz.  leon krzemieniecki is probably the only man still         living who worked in that hollerith department. it must         be emphasized that krzemieniecki did not understand any         of the details of the genocidal train destinations. his         duties required tabulating information on all trains,         from ordinary passenger to freight trains, but only after         their arrival.  the high-security five-room office, guarded by armed         railway police, was equipped with 15 punchers, two         sorters, and a tabulator "bigger than a sofa."         fifteen polish women punched the cards and loaded the         sorters. three german nationals supervised the office,         overseeing the final tabulations and summary statistics         in great secrecy. handfuls of printouts were reduced to a         small envelope of summary data, which was then delivered         to a secret destination. truckloads of the preliminary         printouts were then regularly burned, along with the         spent cards, krzemieniecki told me in an interview.  as a forced laborer, krzemieniecki was compelled to         work as a "sorter and tabulator" 10 hours per         day for two years. he never realized that his work         involved the transportation of jews to gas chambers.  "i only know that this very modern equipment made         possible the control of all the railway traffic in the         general government," he said.  krzemieniecki recalled that an "outside         technician," who spoke german and polish and "did         not work for the railroad," was almost constantly on-site         to keep the machines running, performing major         maintenance monthly.  ibm's tailored railroad-management programs, several         million custom-designed punch cards printed at ibm's         print shop at 6 rymarska street, across from the warsaw         ghetto, and the railway's leased machines were under the         new york-controlled subsidiary in warsaw, not the german         subsidiary, dehomag. the distinction is important. since         the disclosures about ibm's involvement in the holocaust         first surfaced in february 2001, the company has         continually pointed to supposed lack of control of its         german subsidiary. but watson business machines was         established in poland by ibm new york itself, at the time         of germany's invasion.  "i knew they were not german machines,"         recalled krzemieniecki. "the labels were in english.         . . . the person maintaining and repairing the machines         spread the diagrams out sometimes. the language of the         diagrams of those machines was only in english."  i asked krzemieniecki if the machine logo plates were         in german, polish, or english. he answered, "english.         it said, 'business machines.' " i asked, "do         you mean 'international business machines'?"         krzemieniecki replied, "no, 'watson business         machines.' "  dwarfing the railroad operation in poland described by         krzemieniecki was a massive hollerith statistical center         at 24 murner street in kraków, staffed by more than 500         punching and tabulating employees and equipped with         dozens of machines. new research has uncovered the         existence of a previously unknown berlin agency, the         central office for foreign statistics and foreign country         research, which continuously received detailed data from         the kraków statistical center.  by late 1939, the reich's jewish-population statistics         wizard, fritz arlt, had been appointed head of the         population and welfare administration of the general         government. a hollerith expert and colleague of adolf         eichmann, arlt edited his own statistical publication,         political information service of the general government,         which featured such data as jews per square meter, with         projections of decrease from forced labor and starvation.          "we can count on the mortality of some subjugated         groups," one arlt article asserted. "these         include babies and those over the age of 65, as well as         those who are basically weak and ill in all other age         groups."  the data-hungry nazis created an expanded statistics         office in kraków in 1940. the expansion was dependent on         more leased machines, spare parts, company technicians,         and a guaranteed continued supply of millions of         additional ibm cards. ibm's european general manager,         werner lier, visited berlin in early october 1941 to         oversee ibm new york's deployment of machines in poland         and other countries. in two detailed reports, written         from berlin and sent to watson, as well as to other         senior staff in new york, lier reported moving a small         group of polish machines into romania for the jewish         census there. the polish machines would soon be replaced         by others.  the expanded statistics office assured berlin in a         november 30, 1941, report that its hollerith operation         would employ equipment more modern than the old ibm         machinery found in most pre-war polish data agencies,         thus allowing the nazis to launch a plethora of "large-scale         censuses." also planned was a long list of "continuous         statistical surveys," including those for         population, domestic migration, and causes of death.         moreover, regular surveys of food and agriculture were         "coupled with summary surveys of the population and         ethnic groups." tabulating food supplies against         ethnic numbers allowed the nazis to ration caloric intake         as they subjected the jewish community to starvation.  the statistics office's report concluded, "our         work is just beginning to bear fruit."  once the u.s. entered the war in december 1941,         germany appointed a nazi devoted to ibm, hermann         fellinger, as enemy-property custodian. he maintained the         original staff and managers of watson business machines,         keeping it productive for the reich and profitable for         ibm. the subsidiary now reported to ibm's geneva office,         and from there to new york. the company was not looted,         its leased machines were not seized. "royalties"         were remitted to ibm through geneva. lease payments and         profits were preserved in special accounts. after the         war, ibm recovered all its polish profits and machines.  since the war, ibm, having left madison avenue for new         headquarters in suburban armonk, has obstructed, or         refused to cooperate with, virtually every major         independent author writing about its history, according         to numerous published introductions, prefaces, and         acknowledgments.  but silence cannot alter the historical documentation.         a tangle of subsidiaries throughout europe helped ibm         reap the benefits of its partnership with nazi germany.         after all, "business" was ibm's middle name.  reprinted from village

      during world war ii and responsible for creating the         first nazi death camp, at jasenovac, where hundreds of         thousands of human beings, mainly serbian farmers, were

(herman         hollerith was the german american who first automated u.s.         census information in the late 19th century and founded         the company which became ibm. hollerith's name became         synonymous with the machines and the nazi "departments"         that operated them.)  watson tightly managed the lucrative german operation,         traveling to berlin at least twice annually from 1933         until 1939 to personally supervise dehomag. major german         correspondence was translated for review by the new york         office and often for watson's personal comment. before         big new accounts were accepted, watson had to assent. for         deniability, he insisted on making direct verbal         instructions to his german managers the rule rather than         exception-even in place of major contracts. once, when         german managers wanted to paint a corridor, they awaited         his specific permission. watson's auditors continuously         tracked the source and status of every reichsmark and         pfennig-in one typical case, exchanging numerous         transatlantic letters over the disposition of just a few         dollars. not infrequently, dehomag managers objected to         his "domination." understandably, ibm's lawyers         and managers in berlin personally updated watson         constantly, and generally signed their reports, "awaiting         your further instructions."  no machines were sold to the nazis-only leased. ibm         was the sole source of all punch cards and spare parts,         and it serviced the machines on-site-whether at dachau or         in the heart of berlin-either directly or through its         authorized dealer network or field trainees. there were         no universal punch cards. each series was custom-designed         by ibm engineers not only to capture the information         going in, but also to tabulate the information the nazis         wanted to come out.  ibm constantly updated its machinery and applications         for the nazis. for example, one series of punch cards was         designed to record religion, national origin, and mother         tongue, but by creating special columns and rows for jew,         polish language, polish nationality, the fur trade as an         occupation, and then berlin, nazis could quickly cross-tabulate,         at the rate of 25,000 cards per hour, exactly how many         berlin furriers were jews of polish extraction. railroad         cars, which could take two weeks to locate and route,         could be swiftly dispatched in just 48 hours by means of         a vast network of punch-card machines. indeed, ibm         services coursed through the entire german infrastructure         in europe.  the ibm response asked about ibm's polish subsidiary's         involvement with the nazis, ibm spokeswoman carol         makovich in new york repeated the same official statement         she issued more than a year ago: "ibm does not have         much information about this period." asked a dozen         times, makovich simply repeated the phrase.  the war broke out on september 1, 1939, when germany         invaded poland. germany annexed northwestern poland; the         remaining polish territory in nazi hands was treated as         "occupied" and called the "general         government." that annexed northwestern quadrant was         serviced by ibm's german subsidiary, dehomag, mainly to         handle the payrolls of silesian coal mines and heavy         industry. at about that time, ibm new york established a         special subsidiary, watson business machines, to deal         with the general government. it remained completely legal         for ibm to service the third reich until just before         america entered the war in december 1941.  the savaging of poland was no secret to ibm executives.         from the outset, worldwide headlines reported barbarous         massacres, rapes, purposeful starvation, systematic         deportations, and the resulting unchecked epidemics. as         early as september 13, 1939, the new york times reported         the reich's determination to make polish jewry disappear,         a headline declaring, "nazis hint purge of jews in         poland." a subhead added, "3,000,000 population         involved." the article quoted the german         government's plan for the "removal of the polish         jewish population from the european domain." the         times added, "how . . . the 'removal' of jews from         poland [can be achieved] without their extermination . .         . is not explained."  germany had plans. polish jews, during a sequence of         sudden relocations, were to be catalogued for further         action in a massive cascade of repetitive censuses and         registrations with up-to-date information being instantly         available to various nazi planning agencies and         occupation offices. how much usable forced labor for         armament factories could they generate? how many         thousands would die of starvation each month? a spectrum         of nazi census, registration, and statistical tabulation         was performed on custom-designed ibm punch-card programs         and machinery.  on september 9, 1939, dehomag general manager hermann         rottke wrote directly to watson in new york, asking for         advanced equipment. rottke reminded watson, "during         your last visit in berlin at the beginning of july, you         made the kind offer to me that you might be willing to         furnish the german company machines from endicott [an ibm         factory near binghamton] in order to shorten our long         delivery terms. . . . you have complied with this         request, for which i thank you very much, and have added         that in cases of urgent need, i may make use of other         american machines. . . . you will understand that under         today's conditions, a certain need has arisen for such         machines, which we do not build as yet in germany.         therefore, i should like to make use of your kind offer         and ask you to leave with the german company . . . the         alphabetic tabulating machines. . . . "  eighteen days later, a vanquished warsaw formally         capitulated. the next day, september 28, ibm's general         manager in geneva, j.w. schotte, telephoned berlin to         confirm watson's permission for the new equipment.  meanwhile, reinhard heydrich, chief of heinrich         himmler's security service, the sd, had already         circulated a top-secret letter to the chiefs of his         einsatzgruppen, which evolved into mobile killing units.         heydrich's september 21 memo, titled "the jewish         question in the occupied territory," laid out a plan         of population control through a sequence of strategic         censuses and registrations. it began, "i would like         to point out once more that the total measures planned (i.e.,         the final aim) are to be kept strictly secret."         first, jews were to be relocated to so-called         concentration towns at "either railroad junctions or         at least on a railway." addressing the zone from         east of kraków to the former czechoslovakian-polish         border, heydrich directed, "within this territory,         only a temporary census of jews need be taken."         heydrich demanded that "the chiefs of the         einsatzgruppen report to me continually regarding . . .         the census of jews in their districts. . . . "  shortly thereafter, heydrich sent a follow-up cable to         his occupying forces in poland, upper silesia, and         czechoslovakia, outlining how a new december 17 census         would escalate the process from mere identification and         cataloguing to deportation and execution. heydrich's memo         entitled "evacuation of the new eastern provinces"         decreed:  "the evacuation of poles and jews in the new         eastern provinces will be conducted by the security         police. . . . the census documents provide the basis for         the evacuation. all persons in the new provinces possess         a copy. the census form is the temporary identification         card giving permission to stay. therefore, all persons         have to hand over the card before deportation. . . .         anyone caught without this card is subject to possible         execution. . . . "  quantifying and organizing the deportation of millions         of people from various regions across eastern europe         could take years using pencils and paper. relying upon         the lightning speed of hollerith machines, it took just         days. heydrich assured, "that means the large-scale         evacuation can begin no sooner than around january 1,         1940." nazi germany employed only one method for         conducting a census: ibm punch-card processes, each one         designed for the specific census.  in nazi poland, railroads constituted about 95 percent         of the ibm subsidiary's business, using as many as 21         million punch cards annually. watson business machines         was headquartered at kreuz 23 in warsaw. and one of its         important customer sites, newly discovered since the         first edition of my book was published a year ago, was         the hollerith department of polish railways, at 22 pawia         street in kraków. this office kept tabs on all trains in         the general government, including those that sent jews to         their death in auschwitz.  leon krzemieniecki is probably the only man still         living who worked in that hollerith department. it must         be emphasized that krzemieniecki did not understand any         of the details of the genocidal train destinations. his         duties required tabulating information on all trains,         from ordinary passenger to freight trains, but only after         their arrival.  the high-security five-room office, guarded by armed         railway police, was equipped with 15 punchers, two         sorters, and a tabulator "bigger than a sofa."         fifteen polish women punched the cards and loaded the         sorters. three german nationals supervised the office,         overseeing the final tabulations and summary statistics         in great secrecy. handfuls of printouts were reduced to a         small envelope of summary data, which was then delivered         to a secret destination. truckloads of the preliminary         printouts were then regularly burned, along with the         spent cards, krzemieniecki told me in an interview.  as a forced laborer, krzemieniecki was compelled to         work as a "sorter and tabulator" 10 hours per         day for two years. he never realized that his work         involved the transportation of jews to gas chambers.  "i only know that this very modern equipment made         possible the control of all the railway traffic in the         general government," he said.  krzemieniecki recalled that an "outside         technician," who spoke german and polish and "did         not work for the railroad," was almost constantly on-site         to keep the machines running, performing major         maintenance monthly.  ibm's tailored railroad-management programs, several         million custom-designed punch cards printed at ibm's         print shop at 6 rymarska street, across from the warsaw         ghetto, and the railway's leased machines were under the         new york-controlled subsidiary in warsaw, not the german         subsidiary, dehomag. the distinction is important. since         the disclosures about ibm's involvement in the holocaust         first surfaced in february 2001, the company has         continually pointed to supposed lack of control of its         german subsidiary. but watson business machines was         established in poland by ibm new york itself, at the time         of germany's invasion.  "i knew they were not german machines,"         recalled krzemieniecki. "the labels were in english.         . . . the person maintaining and repairing the machines         spread the diagrams out sometimes. the language of the         diagrams of those machines was only in english."  i asked krzemieniecki if the machine logo plates were         in german, polish, or english. he answered, "english.         it said, 'business machines.' " i asked, "do         you mean 'international business machines'?"         krzemieniecki replied, "no, 'watson business         machines.' "  dwarfing the railroad operation in poland described by         krzemieniecki was a massive hollerith statistical center         at 24 murner street in kraków, staffed by more than 500         punching and tabulating employees and equipped with         dozens of machines. new research has uncovered the         existence of a previously unknown berlin agency, the         central office for foreign statistics and foreign country         research, which continuously received detailed data from         the kraków statistical center.  by late 1939, the reich's jewish-population statistics         wizard, fritz arlt, had been appointed head of the         population and welfare administration of the general         government. a hollerith expert and colleague of adolf         eichmann, arlt edited his own statistical publication,         political information service of the general government,         which featured such data as jews per square meter, with         projections of decrease from forced labor and starvation.          "we can count on the mortality of some subjugated         groups," one arlt article asserted. "these         include babies and those over the age of 65, as well as         those who are basically weak and ill in all other age         groups."  the data-hungry nazis created an expanded statistics         office in kraków in 1940. the expansion was dependent on         more leased machines, spare parts, company technicians,         and a guaranteed continued supply of millions of         additional ibm cards. ibm's european general manager,         werner lier, visited berlin in early october 1941 to         oversee ibm new york's deployment of machines in poland         and other countries. in two detailed reports, written         from berlin and sent to watson, as well as to other         senior staff in new york, lier reported moving a small         group of polish machines into romania for the jewish         census there. the polish machines would soon be replaced         by others.  the expanded statistics office assured berlin in a         november 30, 1941, report that its hollerith operation         would employ equipment more modern than the old ibm         machinery found in most pre-war polish data agencies,         thus allowing the nazis to launch a plethora of "large-scale         censuses." also planned was a long list of "continuous         statistical surveys," including those for         population, domestic migration, and causes of death.         moreover, regular surveys of food and agriculture were         "coupled with summary surveys of the population and         ethnic groups." tabulating food supplies against         ethnic numbers allowed the nazis to ration caloric intake         as they subjected the jewish community to starvation.  the statistics office's report concluded, "our         work is just beginning to bear fruit."  once the u.s. entered the war in december 1941,         germany appointed a nazi devoted to ibm, hermann         fellinger, as enemy-property custodian. he maintained the         original staff and managers of watson business machines,         keeping it productive for the reich and profitable for         ibm. the subsidiary now reported to ibm's geneva office,         and from there to new york. the company was not looted,         its leased machines were not seized. "royalties"         were remitted to ibm through geneva. lease payments and         profits were preserved in special accounts. after the         war, ibm recovered all its polish profits and machines.  since the war, ibm, having left madison avenue for new         headquarters in suburban armonk, has obstructed, or         refused to cooperate with, virtually every major         independent author writing about its history, according         to numerous published introductions, prefaces, and         acknowledgments.  but silence cannot alter the historical documentation.         a tangle of subsidiaries throughout europe helped ibm         reap the benefits of its partnership with nazi germany.         after all, "business" was ibm's middle name.  reprinted from village voice for fair use only http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0213/black.php  edwin black is the author of         "ibm and the holocaust: the strategic alliance         between nazi germany and america's most powerful         corporation" (crown books, 2001, and three rivers         press, 2002), just released in paperback with new         information. it         can be purchased by going to http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/0609808990/qid=1017245312/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_67_1/104-3447553-7176714  *********************** further reading: *********************** 1. on the involvement of prescott bush and george         herbert walker, grandfather and great-grandfather of the         current us president, along with allen and john foster         dulles, in helping finance the nazis and setting up an         intelligence apparatus for them in the us, see 'nazis in         the attic.'        the section dealing specifically with the bush family can         be read at http://emperors-clothes.com/articles/randy/swas5.htm  2. after world war ii, allen dulles saved and         recruited thousands of members of the nazi's european         spying-&-butchery apparatus into his newly created         central intelligence agency. this is discussed in 'worst kept         secrets of a bumbling bear,' by jared israel at http://tenc.net/docs/gehlen2.htm  3. in the early 1990s the nato         countries welcomed a 'new democracy,' the secessionist         state of croatia. in fact, it was modeled on the         independent state of croatia formed under nazi guidance         during world war ii and responsible for creating the         first nazi death camp, at jasenovac, where hundreds of         thousands of human beings, mainly serbian farmers, were         slaughtered in ways that stunned even the nazis. see 'meet the nazis the cia married: the croatian         ustashi,' by petar makara and         jared israel at http://emperors-clothes.com/docs/backin.htm
