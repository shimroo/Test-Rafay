lres, a member of community associations institute (cai), currently manages over 30 associations ranging in size from 12 units to 500+ units in the brunswick county area. we feel that we have created a niche in our industry serving both large and small communities, as well as both multi-family and single family associations. these include associations that are just getting started, in which we assist in the development of their documents; associations that are well established; master associations and related member associations; and associations that are in their developer transition period.

 are you currently living in one of our communities and want to stay informed on relevant community news and event?  sign up for our association specific mass email updates.  we promise not to spam you.
