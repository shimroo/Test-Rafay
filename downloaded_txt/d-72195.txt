welcome to my personal photography page. as you may have noticed if you have been to my galleries i love a good black & white photo. with the advent of digital the therapy of the red lit darkroom is no more. having sold my durst 4×5 with multigrade head and my little jobo cpe film processor i now spend the time in front of a calibrated screen adjusting contrast, exposure, dodging and burning with the added advantage of selective masking, no more contorting one’s hands to achieve the selective adjustments that my minds eye perceived. 
i hope you enjoy the imagery and pop back again as i slowly add new and rediscovered photographs. 
but what of all those negatives in storage?? well in due time i hope to acquire a suitable high end 35mm scanner and redirect those past images. but alas all the medium format (6×6, 6×7 & 6x8cm) and large format (4×5”) negatives will just have to wait for another decade. 
as some of the imagery within contains the human form without fashion one must be of legal age to partake in its beauty. so by clicking oven enter link below you hereby confirm you are legally allowed to in whatever country/state you reside.
