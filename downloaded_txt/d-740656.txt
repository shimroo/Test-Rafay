the cape town heritage trust is an independent, private-sector, non-profit organisation concerned with the conservation and enhancement of the man-made and natural environment and hence with the socio-economic advancement of the city and its people.the trust was established in 1987 by the cape town city council with the backing of the cape provincial administration. a number of buildings in shortmarket and hout streets, originally acquired for road-widening purposes, were donated to the trust. these properties were sold subject to conditions as to their restoration and conservation. the trust is actively engaged in a partnership scheme with the council and individual property owners for the upgrading of these streets and has already ensured the improvement of certain sections.
