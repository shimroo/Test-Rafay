welcome to eagles disobey



inside, eagles disobey, the only 'official' alternative to all other cash cow websites related to the burisch cult,  you will find heaps of information and links on conspiracies and research in the ufo and blackops community along with a small community of researchers in our forum. this site is mainly a document archive featuring information on; dan burisch, branton aka alan dewalton, and his various documents including the omega file, the dulce book, bob lazar, lear and other related researchers. update: for the next few months the focus will continue to be alleged area 51 whistleblower dr dan catselas burisch (crain) as there appears to be a bit of a buzz being created recently. check out the forum a the man 'dr dan burisch' himself has deigned us with the odd visit or 2 once in a while. i wonder why? click his name above to go to a relevant forum discussion or click here.
this site also intends to provide a more balanced viewpoint of the dan burisch saga. well..... there are so many burisch worshipper's sites out there, that a little site that deals with the odd negative or 2 is useful particularly in an effort to bust these money making scams that are ramping up speed ready to prey on unwary interent traveller..

dan is said to be an ex-area 51 microbiologist who is purported to have met j-rod (a grey ebe) and worked on the lotus project amongst others, to harness the power of the 'ganesh particle'. the j-rods are apparently ourselves from the future who have a genetic defect, which dan burisch claims to have been assisting to find a cure. there is also information pointing to many different timelines being manipulated by 'the people in control' whether they be government, extraterrestrials or secret societies. other claims by dan burisch include having found a cure for cancer, creation of designer viruses for use in biowarfare (iraq 1990) and participation in "project preserve mother', which supposedly was to clear up pollution at cabrillo beach. on this site you will find updates including the current activities of dan burisch and his little group of fans around the internet plus a somewhat biased attempt at sifting through all the material to show up the many inconsistencies and lies that are being sewn into this story as the truth. we are also highlighting the current communications and research from the ufo community dealing with exposing dan burisch as a fraud.please feel free to join us in the forum to ask for more information.this site does not pretend to be the definitive answer to the question of who or what is telling the truth, but can maybe help point the researcher in the right direction. however this is the internet and not everything on the internet is true so it is up to the individual to look at the material on this site and others with a view to making up their own mind about what they believe to be true. xena: site owner

the urantia book on eugenics and more 



dr. william s. sadler circa 1950  
the sadlers and dr john kellogg, like many of their social class, pinned their hopes for mankind on eugenics, the movement founded by francis galton (charles darwin's cousin) in the 19th century to improve the human race by better breeding. eugenic methods included encouraging "better" human specimens to breed more often and with their own kind, and "defective" humans to breed less often or not at all. in 1906 dr kellogg founded the eugenically minded race betterment foundation to "call attention to the dangers which threaten the race", to research the "causes of race deterioration", and to promote "biologic living." william and lena sadler as well were active eugenics crusaders. 

        william sadler authored at least three pro-eugenics books: long heads and round heads, or, what's the matter with germany? (1918), race decadence: an examination of the causes of racial degeneration in the united states (1922) and the truth about heredity (1927). in race decadence, sadler repeated the eugenic gospel that our american genetic 
        heritage is in jeopardy due to the fecundity of blacks and the influx of inferior racial stocks from abroad, concluding that "morality is hereditary" and that "some races are more moral than others." this view was well within the mainstream of the eugenics movement at the time. lena sadler, too, cut a swathe in the eugenics movement, authoring a paper entitled "is the abnormal to become normal?" read at the third international congress of eugenics in 1932. its thesis was that severe eugenic measures are necessary to stem the tide of racial degeneration in america. 

        she pleaded: 

        here we are coddling, feeding, training, and protecting this viper of degeneracy in our midst, all the while laying the flattering unction to our souls that we are a philanthropic, charitable, and thoroughly christianized people. we presume to protect the weak and lavish charity with a free hand upon these defectives, all the while seemingly ignorant and unmindful 
 examples of racist/white supremists teachings within the urantia book:
"civilization is in danger when youth neglect to interest themselves in ethics, sociology, eugenics, philosophy, the fine arts, religion, and cosmology."
        
        p1220:3, 111:4.4 from the urantia book -- part iii. the history of urantia paper 111: section 4.the inner life 

âunrestrained multiplication of inferiors, with decreasing reproduction of superiors, is unfailingly suicidal of cultural civilizationâ 
        the urantia book -- part iii. the history of urantia paper 79: section 2. the andite conquest of india 

âthe indigo [black] race was moving south in africa, there to begin its slow but long-continued racial deterioration.â
        
        the urantia book part iii - the history of urantia , paper 78 - the violet race after the days of adam page 871 

        quote: notwithstanding this obstacle, it seems that you ought to be able to agree upon the biologic disfellowshiping of your more markedly unfit, defective, degenerate, and antisocial stocks. (p.585) 

        quote: having failed to achieve race harmonization by the adamic technique, you must now work out your planetary problem of race improvement by other and largely human methods of adaptation and control. (p.586) 

        770 the subnormal man should be kept under society's control; no more should be produced than are required to administer the lower levels of industry, those tasks requiring intelligence above the animal level but making such low-grade demands as to prove veritable slavery and bondage for the higher types of mankind. 

        793 the survival of large numbers of defectives and degenerates is not because they have any natural right thus to encumber twentieth-century civilization, but simply because the society of the age, the mores, thus decrees. 

        803 â¦ poverty and dependence can never be eliminated if the defective and degenerate stocks are freely supported and permitted to reproduce without restraint. 

        920 the real jeopardy of the human species is to be found in the unrestrained multiplication of the inferior and degenerate strains of the various civilized peoplesâ¦ 

        p1088 false sentimentâ¦ has led to the unwise perpetuation of racially degenerate stocks which have tremendously retarded the progress of civilization.

the dulce book
        what's going on near dulce, new mexico? above top secret military-industrial black projects? headquarters for a bavarian-backed new world order? vanguard for alien infiltration and invasion? massive intelligence agency disinformation? collective mind control or mass hallucination? all of or a combination of the above? the dulce book, by branton, covers the secret underground genetics laboratory beneath dulce, nm.(36 parts)  
 


secrets of the mojave : (or, the conspiracy against reality) [7th edition] compiled by 'the group' -- edited by 'branton' 


the omega file: greys, nazis, underground bases, and the new world order 


project superman a "victim" of the illuminati's super-race projects & montauk experiments speaks out {the andy pero story, aka mr.x... nazi mind control and the montauk projects...}
      rv-ing the grey collective 


project redbook database when probing the depths of the underlying and enigmatic connections between the ufo phenomena, conspiracies, and underground bases, one is likely to encounter various levels of "truth". there are scenarios which hide themselves not only within smokescreens and denial, but also within over-exaggeration... or making the claims sound so preposterous that they are seen as unbelievable. this has been an admitted policy of certain agencies who wish to control the facts behind the ufo phenomena for instance. yet every successful lie is built around a grain of truth. on the other hand however, as someone said, "those conspiracies which are too incredible to be believed are by the same right those which most often succeed." one should not fall into the trap of accepting or rejecting everthing they read right off. on some occasions information might be almost entirely false, on other occasions it may be almost entirely true, and in still other cases both truth and deception might be interwoven together. the key is to train ones conscious discernment to separate the "wheat" from the "chaff". as the good book says: "prove all things, hold fast that which is good." - i thessalonians 5:21



the coscon files 


        crim ram or cosmic conflict series: 
these next twelve files are the crim-ram, or cosmic conflict, series by branton. ancient civilizations, subterranean inhabitants, secret societies, aliens, ufos, the secret government, the assassination of kennedy, fema, the conflict between good and evil, pleiadeans, the serpent race (reptilians), greys... this 'book' covers all these areas and many more and ties it all together.

current discussion on vol 34 


 


the golden thread moved to marci's new forum eagles disobey mark 3 and lasted for 1 volume or 30 pages before she deleted it. mind you not before she builds up to this finale by deleting dan burisch's posts from the forum as a an attempt to prove that vital information was being leaked.
the unedited archive of the forum posts are now housed on the eagles disobey server here for posterity along with everything else . the link to the archive of the shortlived thread on the amusingly nicknamed "eagles obey" forum . this archive is still in process, as i have yet to compare the backups copy with alternative copies, deltions and history rewrites were rampant as usual.   



then along comes the stargate forum around summer 2005. created by bill hamilton as a safer more pleasant alternative to the so called negative small skulled idiots (just read don deppelers words once in a while, lol) who decided to stay here. 6 threads or "timelines" were produced at this forum up until new years eve 2005. the usual games ensued, posters were allowed to bash anyone who satyed here or questioned dan burisch's motives. any new members or old member who chose to think for themselves were banned pretty quickly. much editing of posts occurred, particulalry of note would be the fact that the moderators changed one (to be banned) members posts and mod replies to make it seem as tho the member was at fault. as usual all posts were saved, and in this incidence the banned stargate member also provided a thread here for reference.          new burisch forum edits threads!! dishonest and deceitful!  
many of dan burisch's posts were again deleted by marcia mcdowell but as a rule most of the posts were pretty gossipy, immature and lacking in any hard science. marci also tried to come across as omnipotent using sig lines like i control the vertical etc, but mostly just offended the followers with her antics causing her to :) 
around new year after a group of new posters whose names included, centrist, shawnna and hydden began to dig up information regarding don depellers alleged surveillance by majestic in washington dc amongst other issues. (see the ats forum), dan burisch asked bill hamilton to close the forum 


 


so what's new here at eagles disobey? any rumours? maybe
