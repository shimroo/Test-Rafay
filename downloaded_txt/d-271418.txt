jerry goldsmith online - in memory of jerry goldsmith 1929 - 2004































"the function of a score is to enlarge the scope of a film.
            i try for emotional penetration - not for complementing the action.
            for me, the important thing about music is statement. i can't
            describe how i arrive at the decision to make a statement, i
            simply feel it and react to it."
