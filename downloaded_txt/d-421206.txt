pituitary gonadotropes are immunolabeled fluorescent green for lh (see above banner) and nuclei stain blue with dapi. â however, in â the above view, they are dual labeled for cre-recombinase with dylight 594 (red) in the nuclei and cytoplasm. â this makes the nuclei purple and the cytoplasm yellow.

cell biology and cytochemistry



welcome to our site that celebrates 
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																research, education, and 
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																techniques in cytochemistry and cell biology.â  it was 
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																originally developed to display materials for medical and 
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																graduate student lectures in cell biology.â however, it also 
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																is useful for younger students. it also points 
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																to a web atlas containing histology/microanatomy images 
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																http://microanatomy.netand, it has been expanded to include links to resources used for 
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																teaching, specific  cytochemical techniques and
