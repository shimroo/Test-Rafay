testimonials






being an alma member means that when things go wrong or seem too daunting, alma has my back and can help me out. it means i have the best of both worlds – i’m independent but i’m not alone.
ray, alma member and independent lawn and garden professional




my local gardener is great. i found him after searching for someone on google.
what i liked about alma’s ‘find a professional’ page was i could put in the services i wanted and my postcode to find out who looked after my area. so easy.
nat, melrose park




picked up a new regular gardening job this week, commencing with a blitz… customer said she saw my trailer and the alma sticker, and figured being a member of an association my standard would be high… she is correct !!!
