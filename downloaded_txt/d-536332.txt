about

hi, i am agnieszka, and i am passionate about delicious but healthy food. 
many healthy dishes are bland and uninteresting. i reject this. so i created my blog tastes of health to share my yummy recipes for healthier (often plant-based and gluten-free) versions of family favourites. 
i look forward to receiving your feedback after you try them.   
                                                 delicious food. healthy lifestyle.
