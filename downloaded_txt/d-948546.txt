baadsvik online academy“i’ve made the mistakes so you don’t have to”! i’m joking of course, but during my 40 years playing career, i have made pretty much every single mistake you can make on a brass instrument. thanks to great teachers, my own research, hard work, and perhaps some luck, i have managed to overcome most of these problems. in this course, i go through everything related to the technical aspects of playing the tuba and how to practice it. i will also share my philosophy behind playing more relaxed and more powerful.øystein baadsvik
