we are pleased to feature porfirio didonna (1942-86) on our nielsen 

gallery website, whose work has been central to our gallery and our 

understanding of the basic needs to make art.
a recent biography on didonna, the shape of knowing, examines his 

intense art. didonna had suggested in his later years that he was trying 

to “making a place for my marks.” to the author john baker, didonna 

really meant articulating a place for himself. baker examines didonna’s 

development, from art student to last paintings, in an attempt to discover 

what place meant to him. the didonna “gallery” is organized into four 

major formal “periods” baker identifies as didonna’s response to the basic 

questions of place in his life.
