insurance update
insurance for our members is very important given the work many of them do. weâre continually working to improve the management of insurance claims so that members and their families get the support they need in a timely way. 







cbus super acknowledges that some of our members and claimantsâ areâ experiencing unacceptably long delays in the processing of insurance claims and certain claims communications from us.â 
â 
we are deeply sorry for the stress and anxiety experienced by our members, claimants and their loved ones by these delays. this is not the experience we want for our members, claimants and their loved ones at an already difficult time in their lives.â if you have questions about your claim, please call our specialist insurance team on 1300 722 152 between 9am-5pm (aedt) monday to friday.â 
â 
we are committed to fixing these issues and working through the unresolved claims. we are also working with our administration partners to assign extra resources, improve claims processing and build better, more resilient systems for the future.
â 
we thank our members and their loved ones for their patience and apologise again for any inconvenienceâ we may haveâ caused.
