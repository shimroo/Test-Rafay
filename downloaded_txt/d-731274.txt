“your salad dressings taste like real homemade. i’ve tried several of your dressings and each one is better than the last. there is never any “funky” flavor like you get in any salad dressing off the shelf. we absolutely love it all. my daughter is now hooked on it also! only bad part of that is she takes all my dressings, even 1/2 open from the frig!! thank you and your staff for a fantastic mixing of all the best ingredients! thanks again... i’ll be back online in no time for more!!!”

				thank you for the best dressings i have ever used.  i always made my own dressings but have made a switch to all of yours.  i even take them as gifts to friends and family gatherings.  we eat more salads as a result of your product. each one is special on vegetables as well. a million thanks!!!
