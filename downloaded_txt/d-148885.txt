support the taking care fund!

the taking care fund has been a present and active resource – most especially in recent years – for theatre-makers in our community who find themselves in need of financial support. grants are made on an ongoing monthly cycle to cover emergency medical expenses, car repair, rent, groceries, and other unexpected hardships. a gift to the taking care fund demonstrates to our community of theatre-makers that you will stand behind them when things get tough.
