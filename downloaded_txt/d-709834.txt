 sailtrain.co.uk 

sailtrain.co.uk is designed to assist any candidates for the rya day skipper or yachtmaster coastal and offshore practical and theory courses and exams. the content covers various parts of the syllabus for the different courses. 
the rya training syllabus from competent crew to yachtmaster, is probably the best regarded training for yachtsmen in the world. i regularly teach students who travel to britain to take the rya theory or practical courses because the qualifications are so highly respected in the international yachting community. 
many of my students have found that our book shops have the publications they are interested in, at considerably reduced prices compared to other sources and all ordered through amazon websites.
