	 great passages from wikipedia
	 
    


      from lady randolph churchill:throughout her life and all three marriages, jennie conducted extramarital affairs, initially to strengthen her first husband's social and political position. she supported his causes, and wielded considerable power behind the scenes, even writing many of his speeches. she also stood by him as he was dying of tertiary syphilis.
