 the berkeley hotel


 iconic richmond charm




   

     about the inn

 1988 richmond design


after a major reinvention in the 1970s, the shockoe slip‚Äôs neighborhood movement provided an idyllic location on the corner of 12th and cary streets nw to welcome a boutique-downtown hotel. prior to opening our doors in the historic district of richmond, architectures devoted attention to the era detail of similar surrounding buildings. the inn‚Äôs castle-like inspired detail provides a historic element when visiting. the berkeley hotel sits along the james river and neighboring cobblestone streets.

 ‚Äúsmiles arriving and leaving! chris and raven are awesome. i've stayed six times. clean rooms, historic building perfectly located in the heart of richmond. lovely view and sunsets in the terrace rooms. always a pleasure."
-david


 
 ‚Äúour 1 and only place to stay in town! delightful from pre-trip to after, always personable, and professional and a true treasure in every way. loved the location, loved the service, loved the people and glad chef tony is right next door at sam miller's!! thanks. berkeley!!!
-jen


 
 ‚Äúthis is a great boutique hotel. the location is amazing if you like a nightlife. plenty of places to try and not far from anywhere in the city. the staff is amazing and attentive. it is located within a 15 min walk of the train station. they offer valet parking or there is a parking deck behind the restaurant across the street. i just took the train a then used rideshare. i never waited long, and it saved me from trying to find parking in the city.‚Äù
-foodiein757


 
 "if you are planning a trip to richmond, especially, if it's to be in downtown richmond i highly recommend the berkeley. there is plenty to do nearby, it is close to the highway system and getting around is easy, and there are plenty of great restaurants within walking distance. the berkeley is one of the nicest hotels i've ever stayed in and would definitely stay there again if i am ever in richmond.‚Äù
-robert


 
 ‚Äúwe had an excellent stay at the berkeley hotel this past weekend. we were supposed to go camping but it started storming so we decided to book a hotel room last second. boy did the berkeley hotel help us out! chris from valet was also fantastic and let us know that our car was in safe keeping. we were traveling across country, and we‚Äôre very concerned about our belongings. so, shout out to chris for making us feel at ease.‚Äù
-derek


 
 ‚Äúmy boyfriend & i stayed 2 nights, and we were greeted by the amazing staff at the front desk! they were friendly and made us feel welcomed and at home. we were warned that our room was a dark room because it was nestled above an alley, but we thought it was perfect & romantic. our room was beautiful and clean. everything was in walking distance. i accidentally left my personal items (ipad, money, etc.) when we checked out, i called the front desk, and was happy to find all my stuff waiting for me when i got there. i will also add that their valet was incredibly courteous and timely with our vehicle. if you do use this service, please note that they accept cashapp if you are nice enough to tip. i highly recommend. 10/10. will be back.‚Äù
-marissa


 
 ‚Äúanother great stay. we have stayed at the berkeley quite a few times. the location, accommodations and service are the best. the front desk clerk, alfreda, is a gem! chris and the valets are prompt and always personable. you need to stay here on your next visit to rva!‚Äù
-laredo


 
 ‚Äúrooms were excellent. location is perfect for downtown. close to dining and just a few blocks from the canal walk. staff was friendly and efficient. valet parking was prompt. would choose this hotel again.‚Äù
-jkraunk


 
 ‚Äúchris the valet is wonder an excellent worker very respectful and polite always presentable makes you feel comfortable, and the hotel was very clean and quiet just what me and my husband needed. i love that they had all the restaurants near the hotel nice area also a great price‚Äù
-kuya


 
 ‚Äúsuch a nice, luxurious place. i will definitely be staying again, staff so friendly and helpful, always smiling, love the ambiance of the hotel, beds were so comfortable enjoyed visiting local stores and restaurants‚Äù
-aro


 
 ‚Äúwe needed a last-minute hotel, and the berkeley hotel was everything we needed and then some! the service was outstanding! the valet service was extremely prompt! the room was impeccable. this was an incredible hotel.‚Äù

  last week, our staff made fleece blankets and cards to donate to a local organization for those battling breast cancer as part of our #kalyancares initiative. üíñ

we‚Äôve learned that donating blankets to breast cancer organizations provides comfort and warmth to patients going through treatments like chemotherapy, which can make them feel cold and fatigued. beyond the physical warmth, blankets also offer emotional support, showing patients they are cared for.

  meet the team: savannah smith, our new director of sales! üëã read what she loves about the berkeley hotel below, and drop a comment to help us welcome her to the team! 

‚Äòmy name is savannah and i am the new director of sales at the berkeley hotel! i am very excited to take on the sales logistics and client relations at this unique property. the spirit of the berkeley hotel embodies old virginia with a modern twist! nestled amongst one of rva‚Äôs more notable historic/business districts, the berkeley has its own quirky boutique charm, surrounded by some of richmond‚Äôs most popular culinary, social and historical haunts. i love that it was built in the late 80‚Äôs, but will take any first-time guest back to the time of historic shockoe slip; making them feel like they are immersed in richmond‚Äôs bustling youth when inn-keeping was considered a craft. this property does, and always will have a soft spot in my heart. i cannot wait to see its potential come to fruition and connect with the guests that come through its doors to embrace the character it has to offer!‚Äô

fun fact: she is actually dual director of sales, also serving our sister hotel @courtyardscottsaddition.
