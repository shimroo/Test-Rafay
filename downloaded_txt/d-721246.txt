history

[ archive ]










betterhumans has a long history in the field of transhumanism. it was started as an educational website (www.betterhumans.com) in mid-2001 and evolved to become a popular website presenting ideas and news about exponential technologies. it ceased operating as a website around late 2008, when h+ magazine took over its functions. betterhumans, which then included james clement and dan stoicescu, produced five bi-monthly issues of the transhumanist-tech magazine h+ with ru sirius as editor. 
this new iteration of betterhumans is the most aggressive yet. we will shortly be putting out new information about how ordinary people can modify their diet and lifestyle to take advantage of some of the latest findings in scientific research. our research team is focused on bringing cutting-edge scientific discoveries from the lab to the clinic, so that humanity can take advantage of these breakthroughs in a safe and inexpensive manner, as quickly as possible. 














                        our vision
                    

 

betterhumans inc. is the latest iteration of this concept.â operating as a florida 
                              non-profit corporation, the short-term goals of betterhumans are extending healthy
                              maximum human lifespan andâ greatly reducing the risk of disease.
all discoveries will be offered under a creative commons public patent license, or equivalent.

 in 2015, betterhumans received funding from the methuselah foundation
                            to carry out stem cell research and gene-editing experiments, with the 
                            express intention of delaying aging and rejuvenating vital organs.
