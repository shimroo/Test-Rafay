improving law practice efficiency + law firm business operations




about ron friedmann. prism legal is ron friedmann‘s professional web site. i am a non-practicing lawyer at the intersection of law practice, business management, technology, and alternative legal services delivery. for over three decades i have worked with lawyers, law firms, law departments, and legal market providers to improve law practice efficiency and legal business operations. as of august 2020, i am a full-time analyst in gartner’s legal & compliance practice (see my gartner bio).






thought leadership. my articles and presentations cover topics such as large law firm business models, legal technology, knowledge management (km), alternative legal service providers (alsp, formerly known as legal process outsourcing (lpo)), legal project management (lpm), digital legal services, competitive intelligence, law firm libraries, visualization of legal insight and data, business process outsourcing (bpo), e-discovery (edd), and artificial intelligence. my blog, strategic legal technology, started in 2003, covers similar topics.  my blog was honored in the november 2017 aba journal list, web 100: best law blogs and by inclusion in its blawg 100 hall of fame in 2018.






dolesslaw. in 2013, i started developing the theme of “do less law” (#dolesslaw at twitter). my hypothesis is that the best way to control legal spend and create better value for clients is simply to do less. that means prevention, better risk-adjusted scoping, appropriate delegation to the lowest cost labor possible, and improving practice efficiency. for more: reinvent law video (6 minutes, february 2014) and dolesslaw blog posts.
follow me on twitter.  you can also follow me on twitter, where i tweet curated legal news and comment on legal business and legal technology. (@ronfriedmann).
