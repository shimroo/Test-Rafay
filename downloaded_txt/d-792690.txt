welcome to stratton hometown realty & auction l.l.c. 
 
   we have over 35 years of experience selling real estate in the mercer, boyle, anderson and surrounding counties. we specialize in residential, farm & lots, commercial, and investment properties. we are able to assist buyers find their perfect home, and help sellers get the most for their property when it is time to sell. 'matching people with property' is what we do best! for most people, this is one of the largest investments they will make in their lifetime, and we are honored to be a part of that endeavor by providing the professional expertise and integrity to make your experience pleasurable and stress-free.
   many of our customers return time and time again for their real estate needs, and we love seeing new faces as well. we believe in being fair with everyone, we always treat our clients the way we would like to be treated. we included hometown in our firm's name because that is the type of atmosphere we strive to have, and we couldn't be more happy with the atmosphere we have created.
   we continue to push ourselves to learn more and do better. our agents take college and non-college courses in all fields relating to our business, real estate law, ethics, management, etc. we routinely perform broker's price opinion to keep ourself updated and current on the market of all types of properties so that we can accurately price and sell homes quickly while still getting our customers the money they deserve. we are an independent, non-franchise firm which means our customers get all of our agents' attention and experience. everyone of our agents are members of the lexington board of realtors (lbar), meaning our customers get the extensive network of the majority of the central kentucky area. not only do our listings show up on our personal site, they will be posted on virtually every search engine (including realtor.com, zillow.com, truly.com, etc) so they will get the most exposure possible. 
   we also perform real estate auctions. wether it be and estate, farm, personal or tangible auction, we have the years of experience and tools necessary to successfully auction any property, large or small.
   give us a call, anytime! we are never too busy for our customers and even during non-traditional business hours we love to hear from you. we are in the office monday-friday 9:00am - 5:00pm, but welcome you to call us if those hours aren't convenient for you and we will make an appointment to meet with you. we also know that it can be intimidating when starting out, and we assure you that talking with us does not mean we expect you to move forward with anything you aren't ready for! if you're just testing the waters and seeing your options, we would love to give you some information and help clarify the sometimes-confusing world of real estate.
