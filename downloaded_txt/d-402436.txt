the imaginatorium






























 



about this website -
contact me







the imaginatorium is brian chandler's personal collection of bits and pieces: it is always a "work in progress", though often not much work is done, and even less progress made. actually currently only the jigsaw puzzle shop is getting any attention -- yes, we are operating, and we send puzzles (almost) anywhere in the world!
as well as running the puzzle shop, i'm sometimes active editing at wikipedia: see my user page.

i seem to have no time at all for photography these days, but i have been doing more music, piano and singing with chor ecco, our local mixed voice choir. so most things on this page are historical, but well, they're still here.
meanwhile, i found some old things in the attic: look, you can see the old front page (only dead links removed). this might explain the really old front page at yomogi.

mildred sitting on lucy

news corner!
sorry: no news at present. lucy's happy event was a decade of summers ago now, and last year (2014) the maple tree succumbed to some insect, and is no more.
august 16th (2002?) - lucy leaves home! a couple of weeks ago, we realised that mildred, who is a pigeon, had built her nest right at eye level in the little maple tree in front of our house. with amazing speed, she laid an egg, lucy hatched from it, and in about ten days turned from a tiny ball of fluff into a crop-eating device, and left us. in the photo she was about three days old.

you will need japanese support on your browser to read the japanese pages. there is no guarantee whatsoever that the japanese version says the same thing as the english version.
