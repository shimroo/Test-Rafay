hidden gem! spotless and comfortable!
 rating: 5 out of 5 stars
               this is such a great hotel. i feel like many don't know about it. i've stayed there twice and both times in the congressional suite.
check in is easy, staff is super friendly and the rooms are spotless clean. beds are comfortable. i have nothing to critique other than i wish there was a sister location in other areas of dc that i tend to travel to more.
anytime i'm near the capitol this will be my go to!

i had not known about this hotel until some friends decided to stay there. we joined them for the weekend. the hotel was a pleasure. it was clean and modern and we were able to walk everywhere from there. price seemed reasonable, considering the location.

excellent
 rating: 5 out of 5 stars
well appointed and positioned for union station, also easy access to the city
reviewed by john, gb on january 2025 via booking.com


wonderful people, and wonderful food with excellent service in the restaurant
 rating: 5 out of 5 stars
the restaurant and food service are the best! the staff are extremely friendly! i chose the facility because it was located next to the train station, but since my train was cancelled, i drove instead. given the outrageous room rates in washington, d.c., the cost was more than reasonable!
reviewed by george, us on january 2025 via booking.com


great location and comfort.
 rating: 5 out of 5 stars
the location is perfect for anyone sightseeing. the hotel offers coffee/tea/hot chocolate service for free consumption and this helped a lot in our dynamics. the service from the staff was also very cordial. we loved it, we already told friends and will definitely return when we return to the city!
