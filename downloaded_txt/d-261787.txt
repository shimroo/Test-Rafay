furnaces & boilers
furnaces provide heating to our homes and buildings by pushing heated air through ductwork systems. these systems can be powered with natural gas, oil or electricity and have different levels of efficiency which is determined through afue or annual fuel utilization efficiency. a boiler is an enclosed vessel that transfers heat to water and pushes the hot water through your home or building with circulating pumps. boilers are perfect for radiant heated flooring or radiators throughout the home and can be powered by means of gas, oil, or electricity. there are also steam boilers that don’t need pumps because the steam will naturally rise to the radiators.
service details













heat pumps & air conditioning
heat pumps provide heating or cooling by extracting heat energy from one location and moving it to another. these systems are highly energy efficient since they are using energy to move heat instead of creating it. for cooling purposes, the heat energy is pulled from the inside of the building and pushed outside. for heating, the heat energy is pushed inside the building. since heat pumps use electricity to work and have no combustion, they produce clean heating which doesn’t create pollution. investing in a heat pump is a great way to go green and help save the environment while enjoying better energy savings and comfort.
