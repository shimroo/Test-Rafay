only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. you may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. you may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. the verifiable consumer request must:

provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

we cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. however, we do consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to personal information associated with that specific account. we will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request. response timing and format we endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. if we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. if you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. if you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. the response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. for data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance. we do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. if we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

to receive pre-recorded messages from onsolve and the customer with which such initiator is associated via an automated dialer. initiators further agree that the services are to be used solely as a notification tool and not as a life-saving or property-saving device. initiators are not agents of onsolve nor authorized to bind onsolve to any obligations. all initiators agree that they shall not indicate that onsolve has endorsed the content of any notification sent through any of the services.recipient responsibilities (applicable only to recipients)a recipient is any individual person capable of receiving notifications. recipients include any telephone number, text address, email address, or address which has been registered into any of the services. all recipients who receive text

connected to one or more of onsolve’s customers. if a recipient is added to the service via opt-in or commercially available data sources, and is registered for geo-location notifications, the recipient will be associated with any onsolve customer that has access to the recipient’s geo-located area. each recipient further understands and agrees that initiators and onsolve have the ability to modify and/or remove recipient information from the services. such removal is at the sole discretion of the initiator and onsolve. recipients acknowledge and agree that, by registering with any of the services, they consent to be contacted, using an automated dialer and a pre-recorded message, by onsolve and onsolve’s customers.  recipients may request to stop receiving messages through the services by removing their number through the registration page used to sign up for the service, by contacting the phone number listed in such message, by contacting their local customer, by opting out on this website or by contacting onsolve at 866-939-0911. each recipient understands and agrees that removing the recipient through the registration page may not remove the recipient from all of

telephone service, cellular service and internet service providers which may be necessary for sending messages through the services, and accordingly, not all calls, texts and other notifications may come through when an initiator sends a message through the services, and that such failure shall not be deemed to be the responsibility of onsolve, any onsolve customer or the initiator sending such
