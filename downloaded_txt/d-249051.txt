  how we work

    01.


  year-round comfort with window tinting

by rejecting a large portion of the sun’s heat, you can watch the numbers drop on your cooling costs. a reflective window film can keep out as much as 80% of the sun's heat and dramatically lower air conditioning costs. in winter, the same film will help retain interior heat, reducing heating costs. the return on investment can be quick and impressive. call us today for quality window tinting services in cypress, tx, and nearby areas.



    02.


 impressive energy savings thanks to glass tinting
help regulate the temperature imbalances between the sunny and shady areas of your building. no matter where the sun is, homes and offices stay cooler in summer and warmer in winter thanks to the window film. as a result, occupants are more comfortable and more productive. click here to read testimonials from our satisfied window tinting customers in houston, texas!

"my wife and i had an excellent experience with sun pro glass tinting when we were looking to install uv blocking reflective tint on our sun-facing residential windows. they were very prompt to respond, came out to our home quickly and provided a fair estimate, and installed our tinting quickly and professionally. and of course the tinting they suggested has worked like a charm! our a/c bill has been much lower ever since. we cannot thank them enough."
 - philip m


"i had sun pro install tinting on all my windows when i bought my house in 2000. a few years ago, however, the tinting started peeling. sun pro returned and reinstalled the tinting under warranty. i recently had them come out and replace tinting for two replaced window panes and they did a great job. so, they get five stars for excellent service and for standing behind their product."
