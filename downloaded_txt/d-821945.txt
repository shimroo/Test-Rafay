high yield energy stocks with high dividends









high yield energy stocks:  everyone talks about the lack of yield.  with the 10 year treasury yield 2% why not consider high yield, high divident energy stocks. energy stocks continue to be an excellent way to get high yield.  the screen below lists energy stocks with over 5% yield.  some of my favorites are bpt, line, and pbt.  energy demand will continue to grow.

weight watchers (day 4)










down 2.5 pounds in 4 days.  weight watchers is working.  i have been getting my cardio work outs in at my gym.  i have been a member of bally's fitness for over 20 years.  i hadn't been to bally's in a while since i had my hip replacement back in october.  anyway, i go to bally's and it turns out that they have been bought by la fitness.  this is a good thing the la fitness clubs are all over the place and they are awesome.

ok back to weight watchers, i have been doing good counting my points every day.  below is a list of the food that i ate today and the estimated points.  remember i get 29 points a day.

breakfast

1 piece high fiber toast and peanut butter  - 2 pts
2 oz of orange juice - 2 pts
3 prunes - 1 pt
1 cup bran flakes and 2% milk - 2 pts
coffee with equal and 2 % milk

lunch

turkey sandwich with cheese mayo and mustard - 5 pts  (they key to sandwiches is picking a high fiber bread, my bread is huge and it is only 1 point per slice)
apple - 1 pt
banana - 2 pts
split pea soup - 3 pts  (i was upset when i found out the points on this, it was good but the points were to high, i can eat a hold can of progresso lite soup and it is only 1 pt for the can)
fiber 1 bar - 2 pts
weight watchers yogurt - 1 pt
water

dinner

5 oz of beef tips and gravy and 1 slice of bread - 6 pts (i estimated the meat points)
veggies - 1 pt
water

i still had 2 points left at the end of the day.
