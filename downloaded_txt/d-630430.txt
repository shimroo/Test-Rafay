about usmeet petticrows (video)
for over 30 years, petticrows has built and developed international dragon class keelboats. to date, over 800 dragons have been produced in the yard. petticrows‚Äô dragon production was originally masterminded by double olympic gold medalist poul richard hoj-jensen and has been under the guidance of expert boat builder and former dragon world champion and gold cup winner tim tavinor since 2005.
in 2021, petticrows relocated to cascais, portugal, a village with a rich history in the world of dragon sailing. portugal has a long and successful maritime heritage, the ideal home of a new chapter for petticrows.
being at one of the world‚Äôs best regatta locations allows petticrows to efficiently develop high-performance boats. if you are looking for a winning package, come test your next dragon with us. our team is waiting to welcome you.
it is the unique blend of craftsmanship and cutting-edge technology in design and construction that has kept petticrows at the front of the fleet. constant review and input from some of the world‚Äôs top sailors allow us to continually refine our dragons, now with version v6.1.
