catherine has worked with me for 20+ years, healing and teaching me from life's lessons.  her work is like non other because she has incredible sight, is able to clearly articulate it to me, and heal so that my life has taken a different trajectory.  i have worked with her to improve and learn from relationships at work, romantically, and family - she has even cleared my home. most importantly i have learned about myself and how to use some of her techniques! she is truly amazing. i can't say enough to convey the incredible difference she has made in my life.  thank you catherine!k.m. 

i’d like to share a little of my experience with catherine in hopes it will help others.  i’ve known her for almost 20 years now and, i’m amused to say, my initial contact was actually done on a lark.  i’d had decades long chronic health issues that western medical practitioners couldn’t cure when a friend suggested catherine.  i had absolutely no expectations but decided i had nothing to lose by trying.  in just one session, the conditions cleared…just like that!  to say the least, i was surprised and grateful.over the years, i’ve asked for her help in healing a wide variety of issues both physical and emotional.  her insight has helped me understand difficult relationships, challenging life choices and life purpose.  most recently, she’s been the channel through which my beloved soul mate, whom i lost to cancer, could communicate with me from the other side.  i hope you can imagine what that’s meant to me.  and, not only has she facilitated that precious gift, she’s helped me recover emotionally so that i can go on. catherine is immensely gifted but she’s also a kind and compassionate human being.  i’m grateful beyond words that she’s here and willing to help those of us in need.j.r.
