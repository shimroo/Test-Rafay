welcome to uw-whitewater


at the university of wisconsin-whitewater we invite you to be bold here. you’ll find two campuses with plenty of room to boldly explore as you learn, grow and thrive. warhawks enjoy the bragging rights of paying less — our combined tuition, room/board and fees is the lowest of the four-year campuses in wisconsin. that low cost combined with our stellar outcomes — warhawks graduate career-ready, with 98% employed in their field or in graduate school post-graduation — earned us the affordability badge from the colleges of distinction.
at uw-whitewater, tremendous value comes with a full-on college experience: almost 12,000 students, a complete range of academic programs and caring faculty and staff dedicated to student success. we graduate the most licensed teachers in wisconsin, and our business school is wisconsin’s largest.
we are a college of distinction for our business, education and career development programs as well as our commitment to inclusivity and veterans and members of the military. new majors include legal studies and cybersecurity, and computer science is now a top-10 major.
and do you like to win? our championship tradition extends from our ncaa division iii athletics and the celebrated warhawk marching band to our award-winning american marketing association, enactus, forensics and media arts and game development teams.
do you think you might belong here, too? find out more by visiting our admissions department.
