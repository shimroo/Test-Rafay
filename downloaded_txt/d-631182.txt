welcome to our website! we have maine coon cats -- big, shaggy  tabby 
      cats with sweet, goofy, outgoing personalities.
our cats are primarily our pets, but we also enjoy 
      showing them in
      tica (the international cat association) 
      and are very proud of how well they've done. we are especially proud of 
      our six tica international winners:
      frosty,
      bill,
      torri,
      teddy,
      legolas, 
      and
      ripple; and of our 
      many outstanding sires and outstanding dams.
