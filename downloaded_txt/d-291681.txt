	 are your markers in the mail yet? important!
	 
    


i haven't heard anyone say they didn't recieve theres. i've been emailing people and the responses so far were that they have them but hadn't upload to their blogs yet or some thank you and i forward theat on to the appropreiate people because they didn't have blogs. so don't worry just yet, it's only mid month some went out late i hear and remember this was opened internationally as well. so please allow a bit more time to reach you. some are posting to the knitty thread that can be found here to say thank you but not all poeple are part of knittyheres the link:  http://www.knittyboard.com/viewtopic.php?t=11979 please remember some did say they apologize but they sent theirs out late. please make sure that there all in the mail now! if not get them in the mail now! i'm not going to hold everyone's hand here it's getting to be ridicolous the amount of email that i get. if people aren't recieving there markers by a certian date i will drop them and fill in with replacements and i will post your names with the shipments haven't been received i will not play games. with only a couple exceptions overseas everyone should have there markers long before the end of the month!flakers will not be tolerated at all and it's not fair to all those who do sign up and furfill their obligation and others shouldn't be depreived for those who don't.so far i do have a list  that i'm watching closly and will keep watching. if i don't hear something within a reasonable amount of time then will take action from there. we do have some sweet people who've offered to be an angel and fill in to pick up the slack where others don't . if your thinking or would like to be on the angel list in case of bad swappers/flakers please contact me,remember you know the commitment before you joined and should've of thought about it before signing up so please continue to be responsible it's not much and doesn't take alot of effort here.please contact the proper email account for the swap and not my personal account or you may get lost and not answered. thats why it's set up this wayon a more positive note looks las though things are going along very well for the most part. i do hope everyone is enjoying sending as much as receiving there markers. isnt' mail just fun! don't let the very few people spoil the rest of everyone's fun. by the end you will have at the very least the amount of markers you sign up for or more. can't wait to see people markers at the end the whole stash....lolthank you &much appreicated

	 revieling at the end!? future swaps or not?
	 
    


i don't know what to tell y'all if you don't want to don't! it's very simple no need to stress out. this was meant for a little fun and based on the majority of everyone's responses to early questions reguarding it. it's not a big deal i will however still include everyone that does participate if someone's missing there loss.i will not figure out who didn't participate and not include themselves, that's up to you. i will mail out all those that i recieve only.i am thinking that after this swap is closed that i may reconsider continuing future ones!  i will see this to the end, not to worry.......i will keep a list if someone else wants to take it over. i have everything saved. please contact me private about it.

	 information for reveiling!
	 
    


as promised i have something fun planned but i do need all of your help to do this!everyone should've recived a separte email actually 2 about this already. i need you to send me one self addressed stamped  5x7 or 4x6 envelope and include inside your name, info, blog/page address if you have them.one for each person you send out.  if you send out 1, 2 or 3 packs per month then you have 3, 6, or 9 sps correct so included with a self addressed envelope to me should be your clues or info 3, 6 or 9 times. you'll be recieving back your self addressed envelope with your sp reveiling who they are you'll have 3, 6 or 9 puzzles and/or clues to figure them out... then you can either have 3 clues included, or write your info on paper or cardstock make sure it's big enough to be cut around letters and stuff so it'd be a puzzle that the other person has to put together to reveil yourself or into letters or pieces of info that needs to be descrambled to figure out who you are.keep each separate in little baggies or paper cliped.then i'd separate them into each persons return envelope  of each sender by each month and will mail them out all togetheri've done these things before and it can been lots of fun!  you can send however you want  as easy or hard as you like.please send them by sept.2st for me so i can have the time to separate and match them to each person. if you already sent out your before this  thats ok still please include for this anyway! thanks and be creative and have fun!let me know if you have anymore questions.
