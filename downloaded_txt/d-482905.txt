christ church celebrates diversity sunday
last sunday, february 9th, the christchurch new brighton community  came together to celebrate diversity with a vibrant potluck and talent showcase.  the event was a resounding success, bringing together people from all walks of life  to share food, stories, and talents.
a huge thank you to everyone who contributed to the delicious  potluck! the variety of dishes was incredible, showcasing the diverse culinary backgrounds  within our community. from savory to sweet, there was something for everyone to  enjoy.
the talent showcase was equally impressive, with a wide range  of performers sharing their skills in music, singing, poetry, and more. it was inspiring  to see so much talent within our community, and we thank all the participants for  sharing their gifts with us.
events like these are what make christ church new brighton such  a special place. by coming together to celebrate our differences, we strengthen  our community and create a more inclusive environment for everyone. we look forward  to more opportunities to connect and celebrate diversity in the future!
**a note from wille black, iii
while connie and i were heartbroken to miss the day  we would like to say ..."to everyone who helped make diversity sunday a success  in the absence of connie and myself, we wish to thank you for carrying on our family  tradition (started by my parents) and look forward to continuing it in the future."

did you know?
we're all scaredy-cats in one way or another: whether it's  spiders, heights, clowns, etc., we've all got something that raises the hairs on  the backs of our necks. but how what's the difference between an ordinary fear and  a phobia? "the terms are often used interchangeably, but in truth, phobias  are a more extreme version that affects less than 10% of the population. what sets  phobias apart?
encountering an object or circumstance someone has a phobia  to triggers an intense, emotional, and anxiety-filled fear response that often interferes  with daily life; it can escalate to a panic attack and obsessive avoidance. "it's  all consuming," freeman says. "this is a hallmark of phobias." scroll  down to learn about 3 lesser-known fears.
cyberphobia: fear of computers or technology cyberphobia is an extreme fear of computers. someone with computer  phobia has an intense fear of using a computer or being around computers. they may  avoid going places (like an office or school) where computers might be.
				providers also call this phobia logizomechanophobia. this name  comes from the greek words "log," which means word, and "machano," which means machine.  people with this condition may also feel anxious or worried about using the internet.  in severe cases, cyberphobia can cause people to stop using computers or the internet  completely. they may also avoid smartphones, which are actually mini computers.
				because technology plays a major role in modern life and computers  are everywhere, extreme cyberphobia can cause significant problems. people with  severe cyberphobia may avoid going to work, school or public places â wherever computers  might be. therapy can help people with this disorder manage symptoms and learn to  accept and use this technology.
				this phobia is often experienced by older adults who are having  trouble adapting to using new technologies like computers, tablets, or smartphones.  it is often worsened by feelings of low self-esteem or fears about being judged  harshly.
 lachanophobia: fear of vegetables 				lachanophobia is an unwarranted or an irrational fear of vegetables.  the word originates from greek lachno meaning vegetables and phobos meaning fear  or aversion. many people dislike vegetables and avoid eating them; however, in case  of lachanophobes, the dislike or hatred actually turns into a full blown panic attack  at the mere sight or thought of vegetables.
				lachanophobic individuals naturally try to avoid vegetable aisles  in grocery stores and even refrain from picking up or touching veggies at any cost.  lachanophobia can also be further divided into sub types based on fear of specific  vegetables; for example, the fear of mushrooms is called lachanophobia mycosis etc.
ï»¿
				while the fear of vegetables is one of the strangest fears in  the world; for people suffering from it, it is no laughing matter. their day-to-day  life tends to be affected negatively not to mention the lack of nutrition and ill-health  effects they suffer owing to their fear.
 trypophobia: fear of images with patterns of holes or bumps 
				trypophobia is an intense fear or aversion to clusters of small  holes or bumps. it can cause feelings of disgust or anxiety, and can affect quality  of life. 
triggers 

clusters       of holes in foods, flowers, or everyday items
visual       markings of poisonous fish
water condensation
beehives
sea sponges
seedpods
scabs or       lesions on skin
aluminum       metal foam
pomegranates
pebbled       or graveled roads

disgust or fear when looking at images or objects with irregular  patterns, visual discomfort, anxiety, and discomfort. trypophobia is not clinically  recognized as a mental or emotional disorder, but it may be diagnosed as a specific  phobia
				"this is one of the lesser known phobias but can have a  huge impact on people scrolling through social media feeds, they may be disgusted  by images like honeycomb, seed pods, or bubble wrap."
