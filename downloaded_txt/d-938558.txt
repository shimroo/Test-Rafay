meet dr. clue



dr. clue is the brainchild of dave blum
after a three-year stint teaching english in japan, dave traveled the world and worked in tourism and the non-profit sector before discovering his true destiny as a speaker, treasure hunt master and team-building trainer.
“what makes our hunts different?  it’s the clues!  a great treasure hunt is all about the clues. a great ‘treasure hunt’ takes you into a mysterious, da vinci-code-like world, where the act of puzzle-solving gets you out of trouble.  our clues are the kind of fun, tricky brain-busters you find in an escape room, but extended out into the real world — hence ‘an escape room without walls.’  expect codes, ciphers, picture puzzles, word puzzles, trivia puzzles–the whole kitchen sink. our puzzle-based treasure hunts are for bright people who enjoy lateral thinking and solving problems.  although not easy, our puzzle and code-based clues are eminently fair. solving our puzzles and reaching each location is very satisfying! i sincerely hope you enjoy our treasure hunt adventures, ‘solving the puzzles of teamwork.'”
