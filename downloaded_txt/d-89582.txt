 testimonials“stuart creates a great community of artists that learn and improve their art both from his teachings and from each other. each class is enjoyable because of the camaraderie and low stress supportive environment created. it’s pure enjoyment! “ sally grauer"stuart is a great teacher. he provides the perfect amount of guidance and instruction but encourages you to find your own style and techniques. his virtual classes have been a great lifesaver when in person was no longer an option. it still allowed me a dedicated time and place to interact with other creative individuals and find some fun in such a trying time." lindsey stewart
