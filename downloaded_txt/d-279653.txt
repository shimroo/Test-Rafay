"best hotel"
this was probably the best hotel iâve stayed at. the room was so spacious, great bathroom nice area to hang out and not be in bed the view was amazing. pool hours were pretty long plus pool a great size and so was the hot tub. they even had an arcade, coffee bar and little snack and medicine area. everything was pretty amazing

- ciara
