introduction to travel images photography tours

travel images photography tours is a photography 
tour and photo travel specialist that, since 1988, has been synonymous with guided small 
group photography trips and workshops.

we specialize in domestic and international photo travel, and are a full 
time 'client first', and 'photography first' photo tour entity with group sizes 
ranging in size from 3 to 8 travelers. our slightly larger groups, 8 to 12 
travelers, are confined to south america, asia, or our customized 'by request' photography trips for 
groups of friends, camera clubs and so on.

client review by donna brawner, seguin, texas

for anybody who wants to improve their photography skills at any level, these 
are the photography tours you should take!

i have taken at least six photography tours with travel images, and they just get better 
and better. on every trip i learn new techniques regarding composition, 
exposure, and how to shoot what are new subjects for me.

i taught photography for 34 years in a texas high school, but i never had the time to actually to go out and shoot, say, 
animals in the wild. this is what i love about john bakers tours. i had the 
book knowledge, but john showed me how to go beyond that in practical terms. 
the results over the years have been beyond my wildest expectations, with many 
of my images looking like a pro had shot them!

for those of you who are just starting out in photography, or feel that you 
might ask dumb questions, put those apprehensions aside. most folk on 
photography tours are willing to learn, and john makes it easy to ask questions 
while suggesting practical ways to improve your pictures. also, don't be 
apprehensive about having the latest equipment as youll be treated equally whether you have a point and shoot, pro 
		equipment, or something in-between. 

the locations and subsequent photography are extremely pleasing to me, but the 
camaraderie among the other photo travelers is even better. another great point 
about travel images tours is their willingness to detour. we were in brittany, 
france, and had some extra time. we were close to fontevraud abbey in france, an 
historical location i had wanted to see for decades because eleanor of aquitaine 
was buried there. john willingly added the detour, and i could not get out of 
that van fast enough when we arrived. that was also one of the most memorable 
moments of my tours with him, and the normandy, brittany and loire valley 
photography tour is one everyone should take!

like everyone, the cost of tours always comes into play. this is how i look at 
it. most photography tours are large groups and you don't get to know your 
fellow travelers, much less exchange ideas, whereby travel images averages just 
4 to 7 travelers. also, with larger groups you, don't have as much one-on-one 
mentoring from a professional like john.

		secondly, most tours will strictly adhere to their time schedule, and 
		they might not care if you capture the shot you have dreamed about. one 
often hears its time to get 
back on the bus! they also aren't going to make detours to take advantage of 
any opportunities of light and events that might present themselves.

thirdly, the tours include accommodations, breakfast, lunch on day one and 
dinner on the last evening, plus youre being chauffeured to the best 
locations at the ideal times for awe inspiring images. all that, and your own 
photography teacher.

what else could you ask for from a photography tour? take a tour, and you'll be 
hooked like i am! my next tour with travel images is this coming october, and i 
can't wait!
