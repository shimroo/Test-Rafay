                buchbinder & warren has been associated with residential and commercial properties located in new york city. our long-term commitment to the real estate industry has given us an in-depth knowledge of the marketplace which has been critical to our success. we offer a wealth of experience in apartment rentals, co-op and condo sales, commercial sales and leasing, as well as building management. however, what truly separates us from other firms is our relentless desire to remain personally committed to each and every client. we do not operate with hundreds of employees and brokers; rather, we have chosen to remain smaller, and, as we like to feel, a bit more accessible and attentive.
