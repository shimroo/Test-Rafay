testimonials 















donald
south lyon, mi
my wife and i being recently retired, came down to florida to find
                  a vacation rental home. although our needs seemed a bit much, health concerns, mold, pets, smoking and
                  beach access were definitely a high priority. gulf bay vacations was recommended and their agent, zita
                  kollar guided us through several possibilities and we found our treasure. we have enjoyed our stay and
                  will continue to come back each year. kudo's to gulf bay vacations especially agent zita kollar.






the wheldens
endless summer
well informed, knowledgeable, friendly, accessible, accommodating,
                  supportive, hospitable, obliging, neighborly. gulf bay vacations is always there for us, a phone call
                  away. zita and jesse have become extended family.

i love working with zita and the team at gulf bay
                  vacations. they have been our property managers since we purchased our condo and have always
                  been very responsive, helpful and accommodating. cannot go wrong doing business with gulf
                  bay.

winter haven, fl
gulf bay has extremely professional property management services.
                  they have managed our rental for many years and have always provided courteous and superior service.
                  we have a lot of renters who come back year after year, and that would not happen if gulf bay did not
                  treat them well.
