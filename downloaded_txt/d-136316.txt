what visitors are saying about wolfe's neck oceanfront camping





“we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. the sites were very nice and most had good views. the staff were always helpful. it was certainly a nice bonus to be on a working farm and we enjoyed touring and seeing the animals. everything was very clean. i loved the little special touches like the herb garden where campers were free to help themselves. such a gem… we will recommend it highly.”


                    – c. roberts, ontario, canada                





“we can’t say enough good things about our experience at your campground. we loved the farm activities and the layout of the campground. the facilities are great, and people are friendly and respectful. your location is perfect- near hiking, near the water, but close to amenities in freeport if we need to go in for anything. we will definitely be back.” 


                    – carrie levesque, fort kent, me                





“this camp ground was a dream come true. i loved sitting by the fire at night listening to the ocean waves. the playground location and bathhouse were fantastic for kids. we could sit a the campsite or cook and still keep an eye on them. very friendly staff, kind and accommodating. ice cream and pizza on site were amazing!”


                    – christina croteau, roanoke, va                





“to wake up in my tent between a field of cows and the ocean is one of my favorite maine summer activities!”


                    – emily thomas, providence, ri                





“time spent is like coming home. we always look forward to returning.”


                    – leslie coyle, windsor, ct                





“we have become huge fans of the farm and all its stands for. took a milking tour, love all the activities and educational opportunities for children and families, and we’ve recommended camping here and the farm to friends with kids. thank you for all the good work you are doing for the planet, and for giving us such a beautiful place to stay and play outdoors.”


                    – wende persons, brooklyn, ny                





“every year this is our escape from the city! we love, love, love the rustic feel while knowing that there are amenities like flushing toilets and sinks nearby…but not too nearby! we reserve the same spots year after year and look forward to it all year long. every time we stay we do the same things but find new joys in them. we always kayak for one day, hike for one, and just relax in our hammocks and at the farm. it is always a pleasure to see what the farmers are up to, and just a walk around the main loop is a great evening activity. we look forward to the smiling hill farm chocolate milk and maine ice cream every year.  cheers to you all!”


                    – talia glass, boston, ma                





“i love wolfe’s neck, it is far away enough from the hustle and bustle of freeport but close enough to enjoy the amenities it has to offer. there is so much to do in the area, lots of hiking and exploring and of course beaches! i loved quiet cove! it is the best idea and what i imagined camping to be, getting back to nature!”


                    – nicole kominsky, south easton, ma
