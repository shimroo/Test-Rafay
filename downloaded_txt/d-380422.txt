      professional heating and air conditioning is located in green bay, wisconsin, and has been in business since 1984. the company was founded by jim spiegel, who graduated from technical college in eau claire, wisconsin. with an associate degree in hvac, jim built the company from the ground up.
professional heating and air conditioning started as a single-man operation out of jim’s home. jim’s business had grown so well within two years that he built a shop to house his operation. after several additions and remodels, professional heating and air conditioning resides in that very same building today.






       family-owned and locally operated

as a family business, jim worked with his wife lynn for over 15 years. when lynn left the company to pursue her lifelong dream of becoming a registered nurse, jim was joined by his daughter michelle. michelle graduated from the university of wisconsin green bay with a bachelor’s degree in accounting. jim and michelle worked side by side for over 18 years. in 2016, michelle took the state exam for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning and received her heating license. jim has since retired. 

 



   now, michelle runs the operation with her husband, brian, who has also been with professional heating and air conditioning since 1999. with over 50 years of combined experience, michelle and brian look forward to continued success! with the combined education, experience, and knowledge of our staff, professional heating and air conditioning can offer you products and services like no other.﻿

i contacted professional heating for a vibration problem i had in my 9 year old furnace still under warranty.  this was a difficult problem to resolve as 2 previous contractors couldn’t.  between lucas, chris and owner brian they worked diligently and solved it after a couple of trips.  their enthusiasm in trouble shooting was fantastic.  even though they didn’t install my furnace they honored my 10 year warranty and worked with me so i had minimal cost.  i would highly recommend this company in the future.randy- randall m.

  





 
  
i have worked with professional heating for over 20 years.  they have always provided me with good service.  i recently had to purchase a new furnace and the process, although unexpected, was nothing less than top notch.  i have recommended them before and will continue to recommend them!- sharon k.

  





 
  
i have used this company many times over the years and was shocked when i googled the company for the phone number (for another new job, not a fix) and saw negative reviews.  i have had nothing but positive experiences with them.  installing heating and a/c in our addition, replacing an aging a/c unit for our main house, tweaking our old beast of a furnace to make it work better with our wood heat blower--they do it all, and they do it well.  for those who question the reviews, take note that the negative reviews are anonymous, but the positive reviews are signed.  that says a lot.- dane b.

  





 
  
we had a blower motor on our furnace go out and professional was right there to help us out. the same day i called they had a repair man out to us in just a few hours. the service man was very professional and a pleasure to have in our home for the repairs.thank you professional ! ! !- brian s.
