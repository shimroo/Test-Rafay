happenings  

i am updating the website to create a small speciality bookstore and have been moving things around, looking for old photos, finding old databases ... saving lots of stuff to permanent records
however, i am still doing free genealogy databases and instead of working on my book sales have already added scans of 12 yearbooks (give or take a few) 
i am behind on my coding... and so the next area is still a work in progress.
view the old main webpage with lists of my genealogy research  here
