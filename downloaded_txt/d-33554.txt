recognized as one of canada’s greatest voices, jazz vocalist molly johnson is a mother, singer-songwriter, artist, and philanthropist.



throughout her life-spanning career, she has captivated audiences in canada and europe with her original pieces and interpretations of jazz standards. unsurprisingly, molly is a laureate of multiple notable awards, including two juno awards, the governor general’s award, the order of canada, and the chevalier ordre des arts et des lettres. 



outside her musical endeavors, molly is also an avid supporter and patron of the arts. she launched the kumbaya festival in 1993 benefitting aids hospices and canadians living with aids, contributing directly to the birth of toronto’s casey house. kumbaya remains the largest music fundraiser in canadian history. as the founding artistic director of toronto’s kensington market jazz festival, molly has introduced hundreds of performers and, in her own words, built a “local jazz festival that reflects the cultural depth” of the immediate music community.
