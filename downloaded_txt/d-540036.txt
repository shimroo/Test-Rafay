physical studies institute (psi) was a 501(c)(3) nonprofit scientific and
educational california corporation i founded in 1970 and kept in operation
through 1991. 


from 1980-1986, psi was an independent agency account of the institute for pure
and applied physical sciences (ipaps) at uc san diego. from 1970-1978 i
personally funded and administrated the institute for study of attention (isa)
high school, a subsidiary of psi, developing and publishing an educational
methodology emphasizing restructuring of standard text material to enhance
personal learning strengths. we offered over 30 courses in academics, fine arts
and physical disciplines (karate and t'ai chi). 


in february 2020, i created the oregon llc "physical studies institute llc"; at
the same time i also created the dba/abn "physical studies institute" to this
llc. 


through psi, from 1981-1986 i helped administrate another subsidiary,
conservatory of ballet arts company (cbac), consisting of over 100 students,
and an active dancing group of about 30. cbac was founded by my wife, louise
ingber, an accomplished ballet dancer. since 2005, she has since founded creek
house patisserie llc (chp) which offers online creek house chocolates; see 

https://www.creekhousechocolates.com/about 
louise's book can be downloaded from 
ballet_the_art_defined.pdf
 .

1982 training videos
below are vhs converted tapes of a karate camp with five 1st dan black
      belt students in the summer of 1982, emphasizing sparring exercises which
      were eventually published in elements of advanced karate, karate85_book.html
      below. to make these files reasonable size they were converted to
      320x240. (the files still are quite large at about 200mb each.) the sound
      is quite a bit out of sync with the video a lot of the time due to the
      device used to capture the vhs recording. the sequence of files below
      follows the order of training sessions, each about 1.5 hours, in this
      special camp. 
as in any person-person combat, important intense events can take place
      within what often superficially appears to a non-interacting observer as
      a flow of somewhat ordinary movement. it takes some patience to view
      several hours of actual classes to see and appreciate crucial moments in
      these exercises that reflect the gradual influence of advanced training.
    
these videos can be viewed on my youtube account, where they have been
      cut into playable parts less than 14 minutes each.

asa


asa-code
help with adaptive simulated annealing (asa) optimization
optimization is often required for many systems, ranging from simple to
complex descriptions., e.g., to fit models to data. a general class of
optimization algorithms is included under the heading of importance sampling. a
subset of this class is simulated annealing which, if applied correctly, comes
with a mathematical proof that optimal solutions will be found with some
statistical certainty. 
please read the asa-readme.[] file which is provided with the code and
separately online in pdf, gzip'd ps, txt, and html formats. especially pay
attention to sections "use of documentation for tuning" and "simulated
annealing is not simulated quenching" 
the learning curve for proper use of asa -- and other general
importance-sampling that are useful for many classes of systems -- is quite
steep, and you may require some help getting started. i can consult/contract
with you to get started or even work with you towards completion of your
optimization/importance-sampling project. see ingber_terms.html for more
information on this choice.

three papers from 1983-1986 calculated a contribution to the

          realistic momentum-dependent nucleon-nucleon interactions, enhancing

          (e.g., the 1968 paper nuclear68_forces.pdf above). those calculations
          used such interactions to detail properties of nucleon-nucleon
