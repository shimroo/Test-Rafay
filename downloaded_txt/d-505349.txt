you can join the orlando runners club which serves the central florida running community. the orc is constantly working to provide its members with opportunities to become fit, healthy and active while enjoying the camaraderie and friendship with those who participate in this great sport of running.
the orlando runners club is a non-profit social running club that was established in 1976.  we are managed by a volunteer board of directors who meet monthly to discuss and decide on various matters of club business. throughout the month we have several group runs, ranging from 3 - 5 mile runs during the week to our sunday morning long run. all ages and paces are welcome to our events and gatherings.
