secret witness of northern nevada

too often in the past, vital information on crimes failed to reach the police because the people who held it feared retaliation or did not want to testify in court. secret witness was created to provide an avenue for community members to provide information on a crime, while remaining anonymous.










 donate to secret witness 
since being established in 1979, secret witness has been serving northern nevada for nearly 42 years. this is only possible through the generosity of the people in our community. we are 100% supported by donations from the public and are proud to report that each and every dollar goes towards keeping our community safe.
the bottom line is our success is only possible due to the generosity of our reward sponsors and individual donors that provide the money for rewards to a witness if that information leads to the arrest and prosecution of a crime.
