the take ten 
									suggestion

in the 
									ongoing challenge of teaching photography i 
									have a new idea. as an instructor i have 
									noticed that we teach technique in numbers 
									to get desired results in depth of field, 
									exposure etc. there is nothing wrong with 
									this approach except we don't seem to 
									explain the art and beauty in what we are 
									trying to capture. if a student can see and 
									understand what we see in the scene i think 
									they will better understand our methods. for 
									this reason i am offering "the take 10 
									suggestion". take 10 seconds to 10 minutes 
									to explain exactly what your experienced eye 
									sees in this scene and why you think it 
									needs to be captured in photography. you 
									will be conveying the essence of art that 
									lives within photography. the next time you 
									are in a field workshop and try "the take 
									ten suggestion" i would be interested in 
									your results and suggestions.

									sincerely,
									william e. spruance

												judging photography


i have had the privilege of 
												serving as a photography judge 
												in south florida since 2005. 
												during my experiences i have 
												found several short comings in 
												photography judging methods. 
												let's assume the judge is 
												represented by box a and the 
												photographers image is box b.
												1> never ever try to put box b 
												into box a.
												2> judge the image on it's own 
												merits not what you would have 
												done with it.
												3> photographers try to convey 
												their representation of a 
												subject in an aesthetically 
												pleasing , artistic and accurate 
												image. try to understand the 
												intention of the artist.
												4> basic considerations for 
												judging photographs include 
												sharpness, contrast, brightness, 
												composition, hue, color 
												saturation, impact and many 
												others. these are obvious traits 
												to look for after you have given 
												the image time to make an 
												impression in your mind.
												5> photography is art and all 
												art will not fit in box a unless 
												you look for it and judge it for 
												it's own originality and 
												composition.
												6> after you have made positive 
												comments on the image, make 
												positive suggestions on how to 
												strengthen what you believe to 
												be the artists impression and 
												intended direction of the image. 
												encouragement - the act of 
												giving hope and support to 
												someone.
												7> in order to maintain a 
												current perspective on 
												photography you need to attend 
												exhibitions like the las olas 
												arts fair on a regular basis. 
												here you will learn up and 
												coming trends in all aspects of 
												art including photography. when 
												you view art, listen to what 
												others are saying about what 
												they see and like about others 
												art. it may give you different 
												perspective on the art of 
												seeing!

												your comments are always 
												welcome,
												william spruance
