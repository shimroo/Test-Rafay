chase stories




















daniel elmlinger

âprofessors bring real-world experiences to classrooms, which helps students understand both a legal theory and the application of it. every professorâs enthusiasm for studentsâ success empowers students to ask questions and receive answers, which sharpens critical thinking and analytical skills.â














chris meyer

âhaving an interest in law and a degree in bioengineering, i wondered what a merger of the two might look like. the w. bruce lunsford academy for law, business + technology has introduced me to the interdisciplinary nature of a modern lawyer."














jasmyne shaw

"student organizations provide opportunities to develop leadership skills by planning and leading networking, informational and social events. programs on substantive legal issues allow students to speak with and network with alumni and others from the legal community."
â 














carla saldivar

"working with the kentucky innocence project has taught me to be an advocate. while reviewing a clientâs file, you may find âgoodâ facts and you may find âbadâ facts, but knowing that your client is counting on you to investigate pushes you to be a zealous advocate."
