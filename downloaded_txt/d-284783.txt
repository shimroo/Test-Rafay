lysa recreational youth soccer







lexington's longest-running soccer organization, lysa, began in 1977 with the mission to promote the game of soccer by providing opportunities for youth to learn and participate in soccer.
in 1988, lysa reached an agreement with the city of lexington to develop the soccer complex at masterson station park which is currently the best grass surface for children to learn soccer on in lexington.
lysa is a local soccer organization intended for those who have never played before, or for those who have played for years.  the most important focus for the families and children playing youth soccer at lysa is to have fun!  we want lysa youth to learn the game and love the game as well!  lysa families make life-long friends along the way!
by playing soccer at a young age, children learn to develop good & healthy habits to stay with them their entire lives.  for many years now lysa has been one of the top soccer clubs in the region, and in 2023 is leading the way by partnering with u.s. soccer to develop the best model for learning soccer at a young age.  come join us this spring!
