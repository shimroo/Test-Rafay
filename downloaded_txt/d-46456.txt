hyde park is chicago’s first dementia-friendly neighborhood














in october 2020, hyde park became chicago’s first neighborhood to be a “dementia-friendly neighborhood” by a national movement called dementia friendly america.  hpkcc is one of of the partnering organizations in a collaborative effort led by chicago hyde park village, the memory center, and the share network at the university of chicago medicine.hpkcc’s past president and current board member fylynne crawford recently became a dementia friend, a designation given by dementia friends usa, by viewing a series of videos that create awareness about what it is like living with dementia and turning that into understanding and action when you interact with people living with dementia. the videos portray different areas of everyday life where you might encounter people with dementia. after completing the series of videos you get a certificate naming you a dementia friend. on february 25, 2021, hpkcc and the dementia friendly hyde park initiative held a community dialogue on the initiative. to learn more, please visit the community dialogues page.
