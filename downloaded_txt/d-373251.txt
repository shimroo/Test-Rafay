                        years old, were encapsulated and preserved. the material is humic shale, not bentonite, clay or
                          dried up sea beds which is the most common source of so called

dr. joel wallach - founder of youngevity

                            known to many as the mineral doctor, dr. wallach’s biochemical research has uncovered the importance of minerals for both animals and humans alike. his unique formulas of plant derived mineralsâ¢ are delivered in a colloidal form, which is the most easily absorbed mineral form.


are you getting enough?
because they are inorganic substances, minerals can’t be synthesized by the human body. they have to be obtained from the foods we eat and unfortunately, our modern, unhealthy diets are high in low-quality, processed foods. this poor diet, combined with mineral-depleted topsoil and crops, has made it diï¬cult for most people to get adequate amounts of these essential nutrients. 




depleted soils      when dinosaurs ruled the earth 75 million years ago, they were likely living in an environment abundant with life-supporting minerals. soils were laden with as many as 70 known minerals, which were absorbed through the root systems of plants to become part of a vibrant, life- sustaining food supply. over time, erosion and unwise farming methods have depleted our topsoils of their precious minerals. modern technology has only made this problem worse. today’s farmers are able to produce double or even triple the yields of most major fruits, vegetables, and grains compared to 50 years ago. however, the quantity of food available does not make up for the lack of quality. the nutrient content of crops is lower than ever before.



the mineral mine
minerals do not occur in a uniform blanket on the crust of the earth. we found an area with a rich abundance of plant derived mineralsâ¢ dating back to the days of dinosaurs. this is where we get our unaltered minerals which have been encapsulated in the earth as a pure food since that time.


organic vs. inorganic minerals
a huge argument has always been that minerals, such as lead, aluminum and arsenic, are toxic and should not be consumed. truth be told, any mineral in its inorganic state, even calcium, could be toxic. inorganic means the mineral is derived from rocks, clays or seabed, which the body cannot break down. however, organic minerals, derived from plant sources, are able to metabolize the negative charge from the soil and, through photosynthesis, alter the electrical currency of the mineral and create a natural negative charge. the now natural negative charge of the plant is drawn to the positive electrical charge in the human body; delivering essential minerals safely and eï¬ciently.




benefits of plant derived minerals
liquid colloidal form
plants absorb minerals from soil and then convert those minerals into colloids. colloids are tiny particles that retain their identity even while suspended in liquid. this makes them highly bioavailable,â  or absorbable.
plant derived
our minerals are extracted from humic shale, which is a layer of earth formed from ancient, mineral-laden plants. humic shale is superior to other commonly-used supplement sources such as bentonite (ground up clay) or dried sea beds (ground up rocks).
enhanced bioavailability and detoxification
as in plants, plant derived mineralsâ¢ have a natural negative electrical charge that has two important benefits. first, it may enhance the transport and bioavailability of other nutrients, and second, it may support the body's natural detoxification.
pure and natural
plant derived minerals are extracted from humic shale using cool, clear water and then processed through a complex array of special filters. this leaves only the organic colloidal minerals in the final solution. no preservatives, flavorings or synthetic substances are added.
safer form of minerals
plant derived minerals are well researched to ensure safety.
