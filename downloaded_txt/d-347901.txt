news: arjava retires from the jikiden reiki institute


dear friends!
with deep love and respect i am letting you know of a difficult decision that i had to make. on december 24th 2024, i retired from jikiden reiki and will be following my own reiki path from now on. of course i will still be here for you if you need my help. it has been a pleasure and a privilege working with you and i'd like to thank you for the many years of support. the jikiden reiki institute has grown beautifully and i am convinced that it will continue to do so without me. i would like to spend the remaining time on earth focusing on my own inner development and to help those in need with the same. tadao sensei and i have discussed my decision lovingly and with mutual respect, and are parting as friends. the last jikiden reiki shihan training under my guidance will take place in lesvos next june, with gratitude, your friend,

arjava

welcome to the official homepage of frank arjava petter, international best seller author of "reiki fire", "reiki, the legacy of dr. usui", "the original reiki handbook of dr. mikao usui", co-author of "the spirit of reiki", "reiki best practices", "the hayashi reiki- manual","glücklichsein", "reiki ganz klar", "this is reiki", "one with reiki"  "...is...", "love speaks", "promise me never to get hurt", "still ...here and now".."night walk", "longing for the one" and "tender awareness".

thank you for the many years of support and love that you have showered upon me. i am committed to sharing my research into japanese reiki history and practice as well as new and old ways to expand your heart/mind- and- reiki practice.

reiki, as conceived and taught by usui sensei in the early 1920’s is ultimately a path of enlightened action. always remember that body, heart, mind, soul and universe are one. all it takes is for you to realize the obvious, and be free. in every moment, life gives you another chance to realize your potential. say yes...


reiki, usui sensei's legacy, has spread like a wild fire across the earth. that is one reason i titled my first book on reiki, reiki fire! another reason was that reiki burns all separation. in all continents reiki is practiced regardless of the practitioners religion, creed, race or social status. 

the development of reiki is so far unprecedented in the history of mankind and the power of this enormous energy can be used creatively to raise the level of consciousness on our lovely planet. let's go to work and spread love, compassion and wellbeing, together.

please view my schedule for traditional reiki training, family constellation workshops and meditation retreats.

if you would like to spend some time with me please refer to my schedule below, am very much looking forward to getting to know you! 













about me






i was born on august 24, 1960 at 9:20 am in duesseldorf, germany.  

with eighteen i went to india to live in the spiritual commune/ashram of osho rajneesh for several years. this is where i received my training in meditation and the art of living in the present. 

later on life took me to the usa, where i spent six years doing a thousand and one things. after america i found myself in japan for twelve years. during my stay in japan- in 1992- i embarked on the reiki - journey.  from 1997, after the publication of my first book- i began to travel extenxsively all over the globe teaching reiki. 

in 1998 i began to study family constellations under the guidance of bert hellinger. 

in 2002 i moved back to duesseldorf, my hometown in germany where i lived with bhakti, the love of my life for seven years. 

in 2009 we moved to beautiful lesvos island in greece, with our two kids, christina amrita and alexis mudito. i still travel quite a bit, and while i am not teaching you may find me giving treatments in our dojo in eressos, or having a cup of tea in our small olive plantation or working on another book. come visit... please!
