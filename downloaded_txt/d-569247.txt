topical verapamil

topical verapamil is a compounded medication that is designed to treat most myo-fibrotic conditions. through studies, both placebo controlled and subjective, it has been shown that verapamil is an effective first line treatment for multiple conditions including, peyronieâs disease, dupuytrenâs contracture and ledderhose disease (plantar faciitis). please note that topical verapamil has not, as yet, been fda approved for the treatment of these conditions but is considered an off-label prescription. 
verapamil is a drug that belongs to a group or class of drug referred to as calcium channel blockers. originally designed for high blood pressure it has been determined that the mechanism of action of verapamil, used topically, initiates a reaction that results in a lessening or softening of collagen. 
collagen or scar tissue is usually due to trauma to a specific area in other cases it is due to a genetic predisposition, such as with keloids, dupuytrenâs contracture and peyronieâs disease. topical verapamil has the ability to reduce the size, elasticity and other negative qualities associated with the overproduction of collagen. this is accomplished by getting the drug through the skin with a delivery agent and causing the production of an enzyme which reverses some of the effects of the collagen.

keloids
keloids are raised, reddish nodules that develop at the site of an injury. after a wound has occurred to the skin both skin cells and connective tissue cells (fibroblasts) begin multiplying to repair the damage.




ledderhose
ledderhose disease disorder of unknown etiology characterised by local proliferation of abnormal fibrous tissue in the plantar fascia. this tissue is locally aggressive and progressively replaces the normal plantar aponeurosis.






peyronie's disease
peyronie's disease is a curvature, lump or hard area observed in the penis. painful erections and penile pain are also symptoms of this condition.




trigger finger
trigger finger is caused by a thickening on the tendon catching as it runs in and out of the sheath. the most common cause is tenosynovitis.







dupuytren's contracture
dupuytren's contracture is a thickening of deep tissue (fascia) which passes from the palm into the fingers. shortening of this tissue causes "bands" which pull the fingers into the palm. 




frozen shoulder
frozen shoulder is shoulder joint that is significantly limited in its range of motion in all directions. the range of motion is limited not only when the patient attempts motion, but also when the doctor attempts to move the joint fully while the patient relaxes.






hypertrophic scar
hypertrophic scar looks similar to a keloid. hypertrophic scars are more common. they don't get a big as keloids, and may fade with time. they occur in all racial groups.




 
 
















											topical
drug delivery


one of the functions of the skin is to serve as a protective barrier and prevent the body from being damaged by outside agents. one might consider the skin as a giant sponge that captures unwanted chemicals and prevents their damage from occurring. in order for drugs to be delivered through the skin, reversible methods for altering the skinâs barrier ability must be employed. physical and chemical methods are employed to accomplish this task. without altering the skinâs barrier ability, only a few useful drugs can successfully penetrate the skin well enough to be beneficial.
