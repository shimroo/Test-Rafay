the creators of the one ring role-playing game (tor), have created the first licensed d&d-based middle-earth rpg, "adventures in middle-earth". here is a preview from a decades-long tolkien-based gamer. while i received the pdfs many months ago, i finally received the hard copies of the d20 tolkien rpg system based on the one ring (tor) by cubicle 7: "adventures in middle-earth players guide" for 5th edition dungeons & dragons. definitely plan for this to be at tolkien moot xiii!

we had some technical issues requiring disabling of users creating new accounts. we believe those issues are now resolved. you can now create your own accounts on the website so that you can participate in the forum, comments, uploads, etc. thank you for your patience and support!

after years of the plone developers not resolving the problem with registration spam that i was reporting, one of the developers finally helped me directly, and after several stop-gap attempts, they acknowledged the problem and have finally fixed it. so at long last, the middle-earth role-playing community can try to come back to life. register now!
