why trac-rite productswhat sets us apart from the competitiontrac-rite is part of trachte building systems, one of the world’s largest producers of self-storage buildings. our base model roll up doors offer superior wind ratings and the quality is unmatched with improved springs, felt strips and tension adjustment devices at every spring. 
      trac-rite’s windlock system provides maximum wind resistance. as wind blows against the door, the curtain’s latches engage with the door guide for a strong interlocking grip.
