study japanese












long term
students studying for longer periods usually obtain a student visa (ryuugaku visa in japanese). the procedure is somewhat time consuming so students need to apply well in advance of the date they hope to start classes. 










short term
when studying for just one term, citizens of many countries can easily obtain tourist visas for travel to japan. these are typically three-month visas but this differs depending on your nationality. 










working holiday
we also warmly welcome the working holiday program participants in japan! if you’re just interested in studying for one term or more period, you can study using a working holiday visa. 











intensive japanese
japanese is said by some to be a difficult language to learn, but by coming to tokyo and immersing yourself in japanese culture while studying every day, you’ll find that it can be a very enjoyable experience!










class contents
each class runs for a little over three hours and during that time students work on improving speaking, reading, writing and listening skills.













learning japanese
any japanese word can be written in a way that can be read without having to remember “hmmmm, how is this pronounced?!?”. learn how to read and write the kana on our hiragana and katakana pages. you can also learn kanji.
