5 years





five years ago today, i saw my stepfather for the last time.rick had been ill for years, and towards the end it became easier to list what wasn't failing. he was dying. we knew. he knew.february 23, 2010, was rick's 62nd birthday, and i drove to northwest indiana, to see him in the hospital, and tell him goodbye.in february 2010, i was pregnant and had recently found out our second child would be a boy. rick was excited for us, when he was lucid. we both knew he would not live to meet the baby in person.in april 2010, rick was sent home, for hospice care. he passed within days. he spent those days helping to plan his funeral, when he was aware. i like to think this helped my mom. i don't really know if it did.he had a few requests. rick wanted to be buried in his leather jacket. a smoker most of his life, he wanted a pack of cigarettes and a lighter. he wanted a "big gulp", at the viewing. he also picked some songs. he chose one in particular, to play at the end. that's where mom had a surprise too.at the conclusion of rick's funeral, he requested that "prop me up beside the jukebox" play. and mom unveiled a picture she had commissioned.this one. it definitely captures my stepdad, and his personality. we grieved for him long before he passed. his sickness took him away bit by bit, sometimes literally.usually i try to remember the fun, but his birthday is always a hard one for me. he would have celebrated the twenty-eighth anniversary of his thirty-ninth birthday today.

a little early





a little bit of christmas came early around here. wednesday, james went snooping, and found the present stash. he pulled out his christmas pullover that i made, put it on and refused to take it off.pattern: santa cruz pullover (size 4)credit: mel clark in knit 2 togetheryarn: knitpicks wool of the andes bulky in bluebird (4 skeins)notes: i followed the pattern as written, except for the front pocket. i used the larger needle instead of the smaller as intended.he seems to like it. a lot.since james claimed his gift early, i felt it was only fair to let jess have hers as well.pattern: fairly easy fair isle (size l)credit: kate watson in stitch 'n bitch nationyarn: knitpicks wool of the andes bulky in coal (5 skeins), red (1 skein), and honey (1 skein).notes: i changed the fair isle chart. i had to go up in needle size for gauge, which changed my row gauge, and i had to adjust accordingly. i also reinforced the button holes.she's also pretty darn happy with hers.i have one more thing i plan on making this christmas, and that's a ski bonnet for my mom. i cannot post it until she gets it though.

don't touch me





the last few months have been a little hectic. we started a remodel that keeps getting sidelined. nate's been traveling a lot for work, and it's high season for family social engagements.here we are approaching christmas at an alarming rate, and i just cannot psych myself up for it. when people ask me what i want for christmas, i respond with one of two answers:"a new roof," or, "a day with no one touching me." i'm a joy to be around, what can i say.there has been knitting, but pictures will have to wait until the gifts are received. i broke my own rule of no knitted gifts this year. i thought it might help me enjoy the season, rather then stress through it. it did help. i only made a few things that i'm confident will be well received.most of my shopping is done, but not all, which i'm sure shocks cara the most. usually i have a plan and most of my shopping wrapped up by dec 1st.here's hoping i stumble upon the true joy of the season as i scramble to meet all commitments. being an adult is hard, yo.

unprepared





its been a awhile. sorry.i don't know where to start, so i'm just going to start with today. i started a new project, while i wait for a yarn order to arrive. it's taking longer than i'd like, the drawback of ordering exactly what you want instead of just making due with what you have, so i poked around my ever-shrinking stash, i found some lovely cascade 220 in a heather green, i think it's called turtle, and cast on a cowl.the color s not quite true. it's pretty overcast today, so i needed the flash's assistance. i do love this herringbone stitch though.this week is about getting ready for our thanksgiving trip, then jess' trip to indy the following week.how is it thanksgiving already?!
