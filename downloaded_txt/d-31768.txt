     abstract art is art that is not an accurate
representation of a form or object.  this  representation can
be differed in many ways including the shape, color, and form.  the
artist takes the object and then either simplifies it or exaggerates it
using these things.
     there are many different abstract styles. 
there are three forms of abstraction that really stands out:  cubism,
neoplasticism,
and  abstract expressionism. 
there are many abstract artists who painted in these styles, however there
are some that are more well know in a particular field than the rest. 
for example, the some of the most famous cubist
were pablo picasso and georges
braque. one of the best examples of  neoplasticism 
is  piet mondrian .  two of
the most famous examples of  abstract
expressionism  are mark rothko
and  jackson pollock.
