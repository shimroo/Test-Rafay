guest comments
"true hospitality"
"carole was very hospitable, friendly, and accommodating for our last-minute stay at her beautiful property. returning from our son's college football game, about a 7-hour trip from upstate ny, we needed a place to rest part way home. upon arrival she came out to welcome my wife and me and our 2 friendly dogs. after showing us our very spacious and clean accommodations, she returned with some warm brownies. we will definitely be back when coming to the stockbridge/lenox area again. thanks carole!"
"
carole owens is a very gracious host. we stayed 2 nights in the antique suite which was lovely, clean and had all the comforts of home. the central location is a great starting point for area day trips or a day of hiking, shopping and then dinner (that was our choice). a very nice place for a quiet weekend getaway for two."
"the rooms were large, bright, and stunningly appointed with antiques and artwork. we had everything we needed — a little fridge, coffee maker, and microwave. close to restaurants and attractions, good parking. hostess made us feel warmly welcomed."
"a great moment in great house with a very nice welcome with many advices to site visits in the area."
"the cottage offers comfortable accommodations in a lovely setting which is an easy drive to tanglewood. carole is very friendly and helpful!"
"peaceful spacious setting. gracious helpful hostess. look forward to returning in the future.

"the cottage has 2 suites. my husband and i have stayed in both. we stayed in one suite for our honeymoon and enjoyed it so much we returned the following year and the year after that for our anniversaries. on our honeymoon we stayed in the larger suite and then we had the smaller suite as the larger suite was already rented for part of the days we wanted. we will probably rent smaller suite next year as we found it very comfortable and cozy."
"beautiful grounds, quiet, clean. owner is available at all times. close to all area attractions. great barrington, stockbridge, west stockbridge, lennox are all within a 10 min. car drive."
"stayed one night for weekend to tanglewood festival. at first, it was a bit hard to find the house number accessing from north, but very close to the campus. followed carole's advise to use the lion gate lot parking, absolutely no traffic back from night concert via back road. perfect for a family with yawning small kids. the suite was spacious and cozy. very comfortable and at home feeling."
