buying 
				or selling a used vehicle can be an exciting experience for both 
				the buyer and the seller. for the seller, whether you're parting 
				wayswith a treasured collectible investment car or the 
				'infamous' motorcycle that sits somewhere between âsafe and 
				sensibleâ and âfast and furious,â the outcome of cashing in on a 
				lucrative investment, or abiding by your significant other's 
				solid ask, is not only a financial win but, it is validation 
				that you made a wise decision. for the buyer, whether you're 
				searching for the sentimental 'car of your dreams' or a strictly 
				utilitarian truck to get you from point a to point b, finally 
				finding your ideal vehicle is not only rewarding in a practical 
				sense, i.e. it's necessary for transportation, but it also 
				provides a great sense of relief that all the time you spent 
				searching was well worth it

lawchekâ¢ history



in late 1990 development began on a product designed to answer basic legal questions. thirty-two areas of law (disciplines) were evaluated and twelve disciplines were selected for the initial product. a glossary of terms, a question/answer format and a series of forms for each of the twelve disciplines were created. since the program needed to be user-friendly for a wide range of individuals, including those who lacked computer literacy, the initial interface used simple menus and "point and click" access.

the initial product, lawchek™, was designed to assist law offices and library patrons. it was anticipated that people looking for information would begin in a library. in 1991, a study of reference librarians throughout the united states was commissioned by the american library association for the purpose of determining the most problematic area for the reference desk of a typical library. it was found that approximately seventeen percent of the library patrons encountered difficulty accessing legal information mostly due to the fact that the legal system of reference and information is uniquely designed for attorneys and the judiciary. lawchek™ was clearly a product that could fill a need.
in 1994, lawchekâ¢ was incorporated after most of the design work had 
		been completed. in 1996 lawchekâ¢ legal forms were first distributed by 
		macmillan spectrum publishing and were the first electronic software 
		distributed to libraries across the country with both legal forms and 
		questions and answers to support the legal forms. lawchekâ¢ legal forms 
		were primarily used by library reference centers as the 'go to' resource 
		for librarians when helping patrons with their everyday legal questions 
		before consulting an attorney.
in late 1997, lawchek™ entered into the law office market through the delivery of a
robust array of legal products offered by enlighten technologies, inc.™. presently, enlighten™ operates nine web sites including: www.enlightentech.net, www.lawsonline.com, www.lawchek.com, www.legalconference.com, www.lawyerslistings.com, www.houselist.com, www.homecheck.com, www.medicalonline.com, www.onlineinsurance.com. offering broadband convergence technology, videoconferencing, teleconferencing, legal research, legal directories, legal portals, forms, web development, web hosting and more...find out how partnering with enlighten™ can make your practice more time and cost effective.

 lawchekâ¢ expanded its legal directory service and developed an 
	improved legal rating system. this ratings system is based on interviews 
	with legal professionals and objective feedback on the technological 
	advancements used in their day-to-day practice. up until recently, legal 
	rating systems were provided by competitors, namely peers, rating each other 
	or by comments from the general public; both systems can be biased and 
	emotional. lawchekâ¢ utilizes a more effective way to provide an accurate 
	portrayal of legal professionals. this improved rating system helps the 
	general public quickly determine if a legal professional is best suited for 
	their particular case and is providing the best possible security for there 
	information.


					lawchekâ¢ ratings system

					lawchekâ¢ utilizes a legal ratings system that evaluates 
					legal professionals listed on the site for their internet 
					savvy and technical security as it pertains to the quality 
					of service they offer clients. each requirement that is met 
					merits the law firm one check mark within their listing. a 
					total of five check marks is possible. if a legal 
					organization does not possess any check marks, they may have 
					chosen not to participate in the ratings system, or they may 
					not have been rated yet. a star within any listing denotes 
					membership, and a blue ribbon within any listing denotes 
					honorary membership. a video camera denotes the legal 
					organization utilizes and/or offers videoconferencing, a 
					service lawchekâ¢'s parent company, enlighten 
					technologies incorporatedâ¢, 
					offers.
upon review, if your legal organization qualifies in at 
					least one area, you will receive a check mark. if your law 
					firm meets more than one of the listed criteria, you will 
					receive check marks for each area met. for a key to the 
					ratings system, please see the legend below.
the primary considerations in selecting a legal 
					professional should be whether the client feels comfortable 
					with the professional selected and if he is confident that 
					the professional is competent in his field of expertise. 
					much depends upon an individual's judgment, and many times a 
					legal professional is hired on the basis of referrals from 
					other individuals who have for one reason or another 
					experienced professional relationship as a result of work 
					performed.
