ohlc was formed in 2008
ohlc accomplishments have included advancing clinical best practice through guidance and recommendations to address low value care, substance use disorder and opioid prescribing, and supporting the move toward telehealth. ohlc has also partnered to advance statewide adoption and spread of health technology solutions (edie utility) to reduce avoidable emergency department utilization and hospital readmissions, prescriber access to the prescription drug monitoring program (pdmp), and referral platforms to connect health care and social services organizations.
