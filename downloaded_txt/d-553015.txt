youth are experiencing a disconnection crisis in a world increasingly dominated by screens and digital distractions, genuine human connection has become increasingly scarce. teenagers, navigating the complexities of  identity development,  often turn to technology for solace. our children are turning away from human connection. new studies are released at an alarming rate documenting the damaging isolating effect of lockdown and social media on the emotional development of the youth. child suicide rates are rising globally.  our solution: empowering through connection through our unique training, we empower adult community members to create spaces where teenagers can truly be seen and heard, and authentically express themselves. teens experience emotional safety and growth while learning essential communication & conflict resolution skills.  youth gain confidence in a world that often feels lonely and overwhelming. by participating in teen talking circles, teenagers become equipped to navigate life's interpersonal challenges with skill and confidence. teenagers gain a sense of belonging and develop the ability to forge genuine connections in an increasingly disconnected world.













traininglead a circle, change a life   we offer deeply experiential facilitator trainings to adults so that they may create safe spaces in communities world wide. offered in two formats, in person and online, our trainings are led by a specialized team rich in experience working with youth in multiple settings. we strongly believe that to lead a circle, one must experience being a member of a circle. participants engage in all aspects of a circle following the ttc methodologies and techniques. our training is a wonderful addition to teachers, youth organizations, social workers, pediatric nurses, youth pastors, foster care workers, counselors, wilderness therapists, and anyone looking to support youth in any setting. the techniques learned in our training are very versatile and have been applied outside of youth work to end-of-life care, ptsd support groups, and retirement communities. workshopsaccessible empowerment   not all youth are able to commit to weekly circles. recognizing that, we created accessible workshops that share many of the skills, bond building, and community engagement that our circles provide. our workshops focus on supporting youth in gaining communication skills and self-care techniques that will empower them far into the future. many of our workshops are created for youth to share with family and friends, and some are targeted specifically towards adults and how they can become stronger allies to the youth in their life. circlescommunity support    working directly with our community and partner organizations, we help support circles in the kitsap & king counties of washington state. we also hold monthly support circles for our training alumni, and community circles are open for anyone to join. email us at info@teentalkingcircles.org to learn more.
