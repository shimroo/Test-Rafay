about liz longleynashville-based artist liz longley is set to return with a soon-to-be-announced new album next spring, and in the meantime, she has shared a new single from the upcoming set called "start again." co-written with issac fox, "start again" follows singles "wake you up" and "more than ever," all helmed by 5x grammy award-nominated producer paul moak. the new music reveals a woman embracing a slew of firsts, documenting longley’s transition into motherhood and the dizzying changes in perspective, routine, and peace that followed, all explored through her signature blend of self-aware storytelling and gorgeous melodies. “i feel like my brain split in half when i became a mom,” longley says. “your world gets smaller, and you’re overwhelmed by every little moment. i dealt with a lot of postpartum depression and anxiety, so there was a lot of relearning how to do things with a new human around. a lot of that journey is what fed into these songs.”   several songs on longley's upcoming full-length grapple with the inevitable shifts in relationships that parenthood brings. channeling sultry bossa nova, “start again” captures familiar lovers longing for the fire that first brought them together. longley thinks of it as a sister song to “torture,” the smoldering love song featured on her 2020 lp funeral for my past.longley previously garnered widespread acclaim for funeral for my past, which arrived after an amicable split with her former label, concord / sugar hill records, and a wildly successful crowd-funding campaign that placed her as the fourth most-funded solo female musician ever on kickstarter. the record's warm sound was also produced by moak and brought to life by a cast of esteemed players known for records by sheryl crow, willie nelson, jake bugg, ingrid michaelson, kim richey, cam, and more.  funeral for my past landed on newsweek's "100 albums released in 2020 to put on your radar" with no depression praising, "longley mixes twangy songsand scruffy pop-rock that could soundtrack a major movie (or real-life) moment. it’s the roaring bonfire you throw everything that’s tied to bad memories into, but it’s also the sizzling, smoky embers when the flames die down." billboard lauded the "americana and gospel-flavored soul, shimmering pop anthems and touches of jazz;" while folk alley noted, "longley's incredibly versatile voice feels right at home in this velvet lounge of a sonic setting." american songwriter added, "liz longley is a standout singer in a city that offers no shortage of superb singer/songwriters."  longley will be performing music new and old on a series of tour dates across the u.s. this year.
