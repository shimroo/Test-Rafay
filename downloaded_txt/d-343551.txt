	 the big reveal
	 
    


before i get started with the big announcement, i'd like to thank everyone who stopped by with compliments, wailing, and assorted gnashing of teeth, which, as it turns out, might well be appropriate at this juncture.because you see, dear friends, i've gathered you here tonight for this...the final chapter!that's right, folks:  after almost two and a half years of the best in bear-fighting awesomeness and face-kickery, the time has come to say goodbye to the-isb.blogspot.com......and say hello to the all-new, all-different, all-awesome www.the-isb.com!i mean, come on, folks:  you didn't really think i was leaving, did you?of course, i know this is a little odd, coming hot on the heels of getting blog of note (let alone the increased traffic from chuck norris action jeans and batman: defenders of the night, but just so everyone knows, the move isn't coming out of any dissatisfaction with blogger.  the fine people here do a bang-up job of providing an excellent free service, and i wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone out there who was thinking of spending uncounted man-hours scanning pages of rom: spaceknight for the sole purpose of cracking jokes about his engine block-sized translator.  the fact of the matter is, i've had the domain since christmas--a gift from my pal scott--i've been wanting to move for a while, and with some truly herculean help from kevin church and shane bailey, i was able to hammer out a new look that i liked a lot.so in other words, i'm canceling the isb and relaunching with a new #1!  it's just like marvel comics!but that's enough of that!  like the man says, blogging about blogging is a sin, and there's a bold new era to get cracking on!  now get over there, you cretins!labels: farewell to blogger, master showmanship

"chris works at a comic book shop so he reviews all the latest releases, but the real awesomeness lies in his ability to find obscure or forgotten comic books and write hilariously sarcastic reviews that make fun of them.  they deserve it!"
