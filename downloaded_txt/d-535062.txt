silent victory is the award-winning 
documentary about f/51st
 
 long range 
patrol (airborne) infantry, the most 
successful unit of its kind during the 
vietnam war. u.s. army special-
operations units still operate today using 
lessons learned from f/51st  lrp (abn) 
inf. 
despite what the anti-war activists back 
home in america were saying in protests, 
in the schools, in the media, and before 
congress, the vietnamese people wanted, 
and deserved, a chance to be free from 
communist tyranny. a real chance for life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness was in 
their grasp during the 1968 tet offensive, 
when f/51st
 
 helped show that the 
vietnam war could be wonâ¦
...if only the american
people had the will.

police officer and then later

don and his wife annette co-
wrote i served. his extensive 
collection of documentation 
from the national archives was 
instrumental in making both

victory as accurate as 
possible.

i served, annette r. hall 
designed and produced the 
book, created this web site and 
promotional pieces for their 
projects, and, with the help of 
talented producer-director

silent victory. 
in 2019, annette created the 
streaming version of silent 
victory using video-editing 
and production software that 
wasnât available when the 
documentary was originally
in production and post-
production.
she is also a fine artist.

âwhen the army is committed, the american people are committed. when the american people lose their 
commitment,it is futile to try and keep the army committed. in the final analysis, the american army is 
not so much an arm of the executive branch as it is an arm of the american people. the army cannot, 
therefore, be committed lightly.â
â general frederick c. weyand
(from an interview with colonel harry g. summers, jr.,
in the premier issue of vietnam magazine in 1988)
