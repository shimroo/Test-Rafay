        spider-man, iceman, & firestar: the spider-friends!  the animated television series spider-man and his amazing friends originally aired on
        the nbc network saturday mornings beginning in 1981. though originally proposed as a show similar to the spider-man comic books, the network felt that spidey needed some additional elements to make him accessible
        to a wider audience.  iceman (from marvel comics' x-men) and an original character, firestar, were added as well as <shudder> a cute little dog for comic
        relief.  despite the network's intervention, the creators pulled off a wonderfully charming show that is fondly remembered by children of the 1980s as a classic.
