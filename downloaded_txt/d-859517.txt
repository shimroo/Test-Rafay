		dining diary - tokyo bhavan: tokyo kudanshita





first-rate south indian cuisine is served at this very popular neighborhood shop, with a nice variety of mutton and other curries, griddle-grilled tawa dishes, kebabs and nearly a dozen dosas.  deep-fried pani puri spheres, served here without yogurt, make an excellent amuse-bouche.  drinks include unusual items like beet lassi (sweeter than expected) and buttermilk (refreshingly tangy and....

		rutubo: kyoto gion





this lively dining bar specializes in smoked foods and smoky cocktails, and stocks a good selection of whiskies.   homemade smoked items like bacon, cheese, chicken wings and quail eggs are skillfully prepared in the bar's custom smoker, while zucchini fritters, fries and similar dishes are served with the bar's own smoked mayonnaise and smoked ketchup.
		one standout, though it's not....

the exciting, innovative spice curries at rajkumar push the boundaries of the cuisine.  the chef isn't afraid to experiment with dishes inspired by european cooking, like the eye-opening mediterranean-style seafood tomato curry on the evening menu.  loaded with generous portions of plump shrimp, octopus and clams, it's flavored with white wine and a hefty dose of oregano and other italian....

offering a lovely view of the tosabori river and nakanoshima island, this is a very pleasant space to relax with a cup of coffee and perhaps a pastry.  the shop specializes in light-roast single-origin beans, and offers both hand-drip and espresso-based beverages.  you are encouraged to drink your coffee black, with no milk or sugar, to enjoy the unique characteristics of the beans to the....

		rosemary's: tokyo nishi-shinjuku





our favorite dish at rosemary's is the porchetta - slow-roasted, boneless slabs of premium pork infused with garlic, herbs and spices.  it's properly fatty to bring out the full flavor of the meat, and served with a colorful spread of roast vegetables.  add a couple of seafood appetizers, some fresh-baked foccacia, a bottle of italian red wine, and life is good....

		bancho: fukuoka hakata





momoyaki - kyushu-style charcoal-grilled chicken thigh meat - is the delicious specialty at bancho, and they do an excellent version of it using heirloom-breed kirishima chicken from miyazaki prefecture.
	the lunchtime momoyaki teishoku features a hefty 200g of chicken, served on an iron skillet and still sizzling loudly when it arrives at your table.  the chicken is surprisingly tender,....
