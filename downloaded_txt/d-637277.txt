inspiring public service, democratizing public policy


as a top ranked national program situated within one of the world’s most innovative regions, we are living into our responsibility to strengthen the systems that underpin our democracy. by questioning our democratic systems, innovating new approaches to public policy and administration, and developing what already exists, the evans school – in partnership with our broader community – is addressing the inequities built in our institutions and sparking a shared belief in the sacred work of public service.
