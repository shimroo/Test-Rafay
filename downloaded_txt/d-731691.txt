4-16-00 --added new review of deer hunter ii monster buck 3-pack, you can read about in in the review section. i also am now prepared to start adding the fan site links section.
if you have a site devoted to any outdoor hunting or fishing simulation, and would like to see it here? please email me the correct information.

2-14-00 --hello fellow outdoorsmen and outdoorswomen,

welcome to the virtual outdoorsman, some of you may be familiar with the site, but for the ones who are not i would like to take the time to give you a brief rundown of what the site is about. the original concept was to be a pc game review site; the site still contains reviews of some of the coolest games on the market. the virtual outdoorsman was just another page that contained outdoor hunting and fishing titles. 

now due to the boom in this genre of pc outdoor simulations this section has become very popular, folks really like coming and reading about the latest titles, system requirements and how others found the simulation to run. i will continue to focus highly on this aspect of the site, i am also going to try and make the site more interactive with things such as guest reviews and one of the most intense message boards covering all hunting, fishing and outdoor related simulations and software.

it will take awhile to get things on track and i ask for your patience, the site at present is currently undergoing a face-lift, so to speak. the message board is closed to posting at this time, basically just to give me time to place all the forums into it. 

if any of you have ideas or suggestions on the site, please feel free to contact me, my email address is: arrowslinger@huntcentral.com you also can reach me on icq, my number is: 9533526
2-13-00 -- when i heard steve ellis was going to work for wizard works, one of my first thoughts was "will the virtual outdoorsman site stay up?" i have to tell you i was a bit worried being that i checked in on the site on a daily basis, this fear along with a few others was put aside when i heard tommy shiflet would be taking over. 
then a few days ago i got the information that tommy would be starting work at sunstorm interactive very soon. well needless to say my first fears about the site resurfaced, but at the same time i was truly thrilled to hear about tommys new job. 
just as i thought that this just may be the end of the virtual outdoorsman site, i got some great news, tommy asked if i would be interested in taking over? i was thrilled, here was my chance to work with and add to the best review sites of outdoor simulations on the web. i just hope i can do a good job in keeping what steve and tommy have done up to this point, i have lots of new ideas i am working on. 
in closing let me say welcome to all who visit, and also thanks to tommy for giving me this great opportunity.
