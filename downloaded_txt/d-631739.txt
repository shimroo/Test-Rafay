i just wanted to send a message to thank you all for providing uninterrupted service during these trying times. i'm sure that so  many people working from home at once must put a strain on the system, but i've had no issues. i had reservations about switching from comcast, but you've proved it was a great move. keep up the good work and stay well!!

rob b.i have had port networks internet service for over a year now and it has been amazing. no issues at all with service interruption. they are very quick to address any questions i have had. the install team was extremely professional and friendly. they worked efficiently and were very thorough in explaining the set up. they are a proactive company with a proactive staff. i would highly recommend.
todd c.live in hampden. been with port networks for a year and 1/2 now.  had no real trouble with wifi on my computer, phone or tv.  lost service a couple of times, but just reset the router and everything was fine minutes later (which is not out of the ordinary with any service).  feels good to be supporting an alternative to comcast and encourage others to follow.
steven p.i’m a big fan of you guys. i just talked to you up to my uber driver yesterday.
