what is oa?
overeaters anonymous is a fellowship of men and women from all walks of life who meet in order to help solve a common problem – compulsive overeating. the only requirement for membership is a desire to stop eating compulsively. oa is a non-profit international organization that provides volunteer support groups worldwide. patterned after the twelve-step alcoholics anonymous program, the oa recovery program addresses physical, emotional and spiritual recovery aspects of compulsive overeating. members are encouraged to seek professional help for individual diet/nutrition plans and for any emotional or physical problems.


definitions
abstinence: the act of refraining from compulsiveeating and compulsive food behaviors whileworking towards or maintaining a healthy bodyweight.
recovery: removal of the need to engage incompulsive eating behaviors.spiritual, emotional, and physical recovery isachieved through working and living the overeatersanonymous twelve step program


our approach
to remedy the emotional, physical and spiritual illness of compulsive eating we offer several suggestions, but keep in mind that the basis of the program is spiritual, as evidenced by the twelve steps.
we are not a “diet” club. we do not endorse any particular plan of eating. in oa, abstinence is the action of refraining from compulsive eating and compulsive food behaviors while working towards or maintaining a healthy body weight. once we become abstinent, the preoccupation with food diminishes and in many cases leaves us entirely. we then find that, to deal with our inner turmoil, we have to have a new way of thinking, of acting on life rather than reacting to it — in essence, a new way of living.
from this vantage point, we begin the twelve step program of recovery, moving beyond the food and the emotional havoc to a fuller living experience. as a result of practicing the steps, the symptom of compulsive eating and compulsive food behaviors are removed on a daily basis, achieved through the process of surrendering to something greater than ourselves; the more total our surrender, the more fully realized our freedom from food obsession.
