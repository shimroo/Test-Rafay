adoption link is a leader in open adoption
 we recognize and advocate the many benefits of open adoption to all the parties involved in adoption. open adoption results in less grief and promotes better mental health for birthparents. for some birthparents, open adoption promotes understanding between birthparents and adoptive parents regarding their respective roles — enhancing trust, cooperation and information sharing. open adoption is a blessing to adoptees, who have their important life questions answered. read our guide to open adoption here.
 


“as a single mother, facing an unplanned pregnancy, most of the time i felt alone. when i contacted adoption link, all of that changed. the social worker from adoption link cared about me as well as helped me make a decision regarding my unborn child. adoption link has been available to me whenever i needed help. my adoption plan could not have been better, my son is with a family that loves and cares about him. they have left the doors open so that i can have contact with him. thanks, adoption link!”

the new york times recently ran an article that demonstrates just how good open adoption can be. with a solid relationship established between the birthparents and the adoptive parents, everyone feels good. lauren, the birthmother, observed, “you know how you can have one shining moment when you do something defining? i honestly think it’s the best decision i could have made, and that it’s one of the best decisions i have made in my life.” nate, the baby’s birth father, agreed, affirming that their child’s adoptive parents are “wonderful.” new york times subscribers may see the entire article here.
