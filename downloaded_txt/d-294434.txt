 “...one of the best events there is - decidedly jazz danceworks (djd) black white ball…”
bill brooks| the black & white ball











djd was born in 1984 to keep the spirit of jazz alive.
jazz is born of black american culture and its roots lie in the turbulent history of the african american experience. we acknowledge this history and recognize ourselves as guests in this form. we are inspired by and benefit from traditions born of a culture that is not our own. we strive to be respectful in honouring the roots and history of jazz, we dance with reverence for those who came before us, we dig deep to go forward, we strive to appreciate rather than appropriate.

artistic director’s message 
kimberley cooper
lordy lordy we are 40!
since our humble beginnings in 1984 we have had quite a time.  4 decades, 3 homes, over 100 dancers, countless collaborators, over 70 original performances…  we are thrilled to celebrate our 40th season with you!
we are currently working hard on a new piece entitled call and response that will be presented january 16-26th. featuring the falling bullets jazz band from new orleans.  i heard marla dixon sing and play trumpet last spring at the spotted cat club in new orleans and couldn’t stop thinking about her sound.  i called her up and after a little convincing, she agreed to pull together some of her favourite musicians and come work with us….

“terra, a jazz dance by kimberley cooper, came next; my favourite work of the evening. the quartet of sneaker-clad dancers were captivating, diving in and out of the music and swishing their jewel-toned skirts.” 
penelope ford, the globe & mail



“plenty of ‘wow’ in djd production… djd forges ahead into bold new territory…” 
calgary herald



“i love that djd is not just a studio. it isn't just "a place where i go for dance," but it's a community where i learn about history, immerse myself in jazz culture, and feed off the sensational energy of my peers. what i love is that djd is not about simple movements in space, but it's about the music, passion, and emotion within those movements, which turn them into dance.”
chantel, ytp 



“loved the energy of tonight’s drive in performance! thank you to all the uber-talented djd performers and wickedly creative production and artistic team for continuing to inspire our city, connect us and forge a path forward for the arts despite the challenges!! we love you guys and are so thankful you’re a part of this city. you inspire more than you know! our daughter came home and headed right away to go put on some music and dance! “
