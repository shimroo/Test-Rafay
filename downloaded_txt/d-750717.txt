my name is bob van gelder. in 2016 i retired from making craftsman structure kits for model railroader hobby via my business, south river modelworks.  i am still active in the hobby & this new website replaces my old one, which first i put up in 1998. the links above lead to photo albums showcasing past structure kits and the progress on my model railroad,  "the south river & millville".  these photos in the links represent the majority of the image content on the old website. in the future i hope to add some how to albums and special interest sections...enjoy!i started south river modelworks in 1991 to produce museum quality ho scale craftsman structure kits that everyone from the contest winning model builder to the motivated beginner could enjoy. whether your interest was in the model railroad hobby or just model building for fun, our kits were designed to entertain and provide one with a feeling of accomplishment. srm craftsman structure kits were designed to build into museum quality models without the painstaking and time-consuming process of modeling from scratch. for many modelers, a srm ho building kit was their first serious modeling project. over the years, seeing those efforts by customers come to fruition & often win awards was very satisfying.







the scene above is of  ho kit no. 150, martin machine co. on dick elwell's hoosac valley railroad. dick was a great friend and a major inspiration. in the future i hope to do a special section on dick's layout. questions? email me at: southriv@comcast.net
