 computer graphics research at caltech 

    
    

 
graphics-related research at caltech primarily focuses on
the mathematical foundations of computer graphics.
caltech's research explores and develops
new approaches to modeling, rendering, simulation and scientific
visualization, and is highly connected to our work on
human/computer interaction. new methods are needed to increase
modeling fidelity, ``fluency,'' and interactivity. this is
accomplished using mathematical principles from differential
geometry, constrained optimization, integral equations and piecewise
differential equations, as well as physical principles such as the
mechanics of solids and the physics of light. the caltech computer
graphics research efforts are led by
alan barr,
mathieu desbrun (applied geometry lab),
and peter schröder
(director, multi-res modeling group).
the caltech approach to computer graphics research is unique in its
mathematical rigor. a common theme throughout our work is an emphasis
both on correct underlying mathematical foundations and on careful
realization in efficient, robust algorithms.
