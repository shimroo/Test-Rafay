the most fuel-efficient cars in the philippines





the philippine department of energy (doe), in cooperation with petron, conducted a fuel-efficiency test of cars available in the philippines. i understand the test was an initial effort of the doe's program to beef up its philippine energy standards and labelling program, a very laudable initiative from the doe and a huge help to local consumers shopping for cars.

the test conducted was for highway driving with air con turned on. it was voluntary and the car manufacturer provided the driver, albeit with an independent observer in tow. the results therefore are to be taken with a sizeable degree of caution. for more details on the test look here.

among 38 gas-fed vehicles, the suzuki celerio a/t (php 549,000) was the most fuel efficient car consuming 29.14 kilometers per liter (km/l). among the 32-diesel-fed cars, the winner was isuzu d-max (php 872,000) registering a 38.46 km/l consumption. 

but if fuel economy in pesos is what you want, given the price differential of diesel and gasoline in the philippines, you might want to consider: 1) audi a3 2.0 tdi fwd 6at (diesel) at 28.46km/l; 2) accent sedan 1.6 fwd 6mt (diesel) at 29.41km/l; 3) peugeot 301 1.6 fwd 6mt (diesel) at 29.35km/l; and 4) volkswagen jetta 2.0 tdi fwd 5mt (diesel) at 28.08km/l.

cinematheque centre manila





the film development council of the philippines runs the cinematheque centre manila film theater on 855 t. m. kalaw street, ermita, manila. cinematheque centre manila screens only the best films of philippine cinema and is also a venue for different film festivals in the country, many of which are sponsored by foreign embassies.





the screening schedule is posted on the organization's website here and updates are also posted on cinematheque centre manila's facebook page. the theater seats around a hundred, and charges very minimally, definitely much cheaper than the theaters you find in shopping malls and for far better movies. if you have a lazy afternoon and nothing to do, or if you find yourself tired walking around the rizal park or touring the national museum, the theater would be a good place to rest your feet and watch a movie as it is quite near both sites.

how to reach it

take the lrt 1 city train and get off at united nations (un) avenue station. it is a short walk from there.

is sen. santiago well enough to be president?






there is, i think, serious reason to suspect that she may not be.


in july of 2014, the senator announced she had stage iv lung cancer but that it was not spreading. according to her, her doctors former dswd secretary esperanza cabral and ruth divinagracia had recommended she take pills for "molecular targeting" of cancer cells. now, senator santiago claims she had "licked cancer" and is now ready to run for president.


this is troubling because senator santiago's account of her diagnosis and her now buoyant pronouncement of being finally cured of cancer do not quite add up.

why not?


first, stage 1v cancer precisely means that the cancer has spread from the original site (see this information from cancer research uk on lung cancer number staging system). the senator's previous claim that she had stage iv cancer but that it had not spread was, therefore, oxymoronic and did not make any medical sense. a lung cancer is  declared stage iv precisely because it had spread.


second, senator santiago was probably taking tarceva (erlotinib) tablets in lieu of chemotherapy as her first-line treatment. perusing the prescription sheet of tarceva, you don't get the sense it can magically cure stage iv lung cancer. and cancer could always come back from remission. it would be too early to say that senator santiago is in the clear now.


what does this all mean? the greatest issue that will hound senator santiago's candidacy now will be the same issue that hounded her candidacy in 1992 -- the state of her health. the ruckus about her health in 1992 was probably baseless, fueled by malicious rumour-mongering, but this time it could be quite legitimate.

the mouse that roared





in this 1959 satirical comedy, the fictional smallest country in the world declares war against the united states over a trade disagreement on wine. all the weighty issues are here: trade, international relations realpolitik, nuclear disarmament and deterrence, the geneva conventions, etc. very funny and highly recommended for friends in foreign relations. below is a clip:

heneral luna





many of us, by now, must have seen the sleeper hit of the year, heneral luna. you know those filipino movies that they hype on facebook and then when you bring yourself to the cinema to watch them, you regret being taken by  all the online buzz? well, heneral luna is  not one of them. so if you haven't had the chance to catch it, i recommend you take the time.




it is surprising, but not altogether unwelcome, that the popularity of the movie has turned just about everyone into amateur historians. because our respectful and understandably deferential school education has turned all our heroes into staid historical caricatures, it was refreshing to see something like heneral luna on the big screen transform the national heroes we see on those postcards from national bookstore  into regular men faced with the extraordinarily hard task of securing the independence of the first republic in asia in between the machinations of bigger powers spain and the united states. and it is compelling to watch.

imelda marcos musical





some of you might be interested to check out the songs on the imelda marcos musical "here lies love" by david byrne and fatboy slim. i found out the songs are all freely available on spotify. for those not familiar with the show (which is now currently playing in london), this is the musical for which mark bautista temporarily left philippine show business in order to play ferdinand marcos.

the all-song musical has gotten rather good reviews both in new york and london (read the new york times, the telegraph and the hollywood reporter). check out the songs here lies love, every drop of rain, pretty face, and when she passed by.

the cebu pacific fiasco was partly because of edsa trafiic





that services suffer during the holidays is nothing unusual anywhere in the world. when people shop, dine and travel all at the same time, it is but natural and, quite frankly, to be expected that infrastructure and services  built and maintained to address everyday, normal business become congested and overstretched. still, something has to be said about how bad things have turned out in manila in december 2014.

for example, i was unfortunate to have travelled from legazpi to manila middle week of december. the flight was okay, but upon arriving at the naia 3, i had to spend six long hours just queuing for a taxi. i arrived 3 pm at the airport; it was half past 9 when i got out. the airport guard said that the it was past midnight when the queues let up the night before. one lady beside me who came all the way from davao to give a talk at the university of the philippines missed her talk altogether waiting for a taxi. so her flight all the way from mindanao was for nought. 

i gathered from the driver of the taxi airport that the reason for the interminable queues was that the taxis were all caught up in the traffic on edsa and could not return promptly to the airport to fetch  the more recent arrivals.

now, much has been made about the cebu pacific fiasco at the airport, allegedly with many passengers not being able to get on their flights and losing their purchased seats. i was also on cebu pacific for my return flight to legazpi and i observed some of the heated arguments at the check-in counter. two groups of passengers preceeding me in the line forfeited their seats and had to buy new ( and very expensive ) tickets because they went past the 45-minute cutoff within which to check in before their flight departure. and those passengers were holding the line because naturally they were arguing that since the plane had not yet taken off, the airline should show some leniency because it was the holidays after all, and the edsa traffic was especially horrendous.

the point of this all is that much as we would like to blame an airline, we should not lose sight of the fact that partly to blame for the airport fiasco is the traffic congestion on edsa. it is just that we have gotten so used to that problem, we have ceased viewing it as such.

nelson mandela, 1918-2013





n'kosi sikeleli afrika was the anthem of the then underground  african natl congress (anc) and a song of protest heard all over africa. singing it was illegal in south africa and could land one in prison. when apartheid fell and nelson mandela came to power, it became the national anthem of south africa. in my opinion, it is the best national anthem in the world. here sang by miriam makeba, ladysmith black mambazo, paul simon: http://youtu.be/mfw7845xo3g
