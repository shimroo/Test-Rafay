schindler port
make your building more human, efficient, and sustainable

optimize the way people move around your building. improve efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and create more satisfying experiences. introducing schindler port, a holistic solution to building transit management.














how schindler port can help
the way we use buildings is always changing, but often the infrastructure of these buildings struggles to keep up. you’re probably familiar with the challenges:

congestion: occupants struggle to move freely – with long lines at the elevator causing frustration.
energy waste: elevators and escalators consume an excessive amount of electricity.
repurposing: building use changes over time, resulting in costly and inefficient renovations.

schindler port helps you address these problems. we provide you with the hardware and software to help create more efficient, sustainable, and personalized journeys through your building now and in the future.









































key benefits
























improved efficiency
keep people moving by improving transport capacity and reducing wait times.
















secure access
pre-program and control elevator, floor, and room access rights for tenants and visitors from a central location. 























personalized experiences
customize user journeys based on individual needs and access rights.
















flexibility & scalability
create the precise transit management system you need through plug-and-play modules and integrate new and existing solutions with ease.























sustainable operations
reduce elevator energy and co2 consumption per capita by using elevators more efficiently.
















smarter planning
plan, simulate, and test your transit management system to avoid common and costly mistakes.





















use cases
schindler port can be applied to dynamically improve transit and access management within:
hotelsofficesresidential buildingsretail outletshealthcare facilities
 
























key features
























schindler myport: the power of schindler port on a smartphone
schindler myport simplifies and enriches user journeys by empowering occupants to move through a building seamlessly and securely. our interactive smartphone app doesn’t only double as an access card. you can also call elevators or manage visitors using myport’s menu of features.























schindler colab: integration made easy
we understand that all of the technology in your building needs to work in concert. that’s why we’ve created schindler colab: an open, secure, and modular building integration toolbox that allows you to seamlessly integrate new applications and third-party solutions into your building management system.

schindler metacore: flexible, future-proof buildings
the schindler metacore system enables building functionality to be easily reconfigured, and allows designers to future-proof new buildings. metacore makes it simple to add or switch building applications (such as commercial, residential, or hospitality), while delivering a unique experience for each passenger group. in this way, it makes buildings more able to adapt to changing requirements and extends their useful lifespan. it also saves the resource drain of demolition. this flexibility can be achieved quickly and without major added investment.





























schindler port eco mode: sustainable performance
schindler port eco mode can help you reduce energy consumption by as much as 40%, by adapting service to match traffic requirements. this system is the first of its kind in the industry and can optimize the energy consumption of your entire elevator system.























schindler phased modernization: change without disruption
building transit modernization doesn’t have to mean disruption. with our schindler phased modernization approach, you can upgrade an existing elevator system to schindler port quickly and painlessly by installing new equipment during off-peak hours. we can convert almost any conventional elevator system to provide immediate traffic improvement and passenger benefits.























plug-and-play modules
the way buildings are used is always changing, so we’ve designed schindler port to provide a modular and plug-and-play solution. you can choose from a suite of terminals and applications – including visitor management, destination control and access management solutions – to build the exact system you need.
