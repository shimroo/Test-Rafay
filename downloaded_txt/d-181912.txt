about our store

andean software, based in taos ski valley new mexico, began in 1984 with an artist's love of fine weavings, soft alpaca fibers, rich colors and a fascination that led to chasing high quality textiles all over the world. today, it is an impressive collection of elegant alpaca clothing, fine textiles, ethnic folk art and art from peru and bolivia, and from around the world.owner and author, andrea heckman, phd in cultural anthropology and art history, selects each piece personally as she returns annually to meet with her artisans. during her extensive travels to peru, bolivia, bali, india, ireland, mexico, turkey, and nepal, she is always searching for new art to complement the luscious andean sweaters, scarves, hats, capes, and ruanas made from the softest peruvian alpaca. italian-made pajar après ski boots are not only beautiful and warm, but are as comfortable as slippers while keeping you safe on ice and snow. museum quality textiles are from traditional bolivian and peruvian communities and fair-trade groups as well as contemporary ayacucho fiber artist, paul edmundo huarancca. in addition she has added fine balinese ikats, nepalese bags, irish scarves and hats, and much more. based in taos, nm, the collection includes many local artists.shop online or visit us in taos ski valley for great summer, fall and winter shopping along with some of the rockies' most incredible mountain terrain and southwest culture.
