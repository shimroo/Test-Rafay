work in progress: art park, residency, & studios555 is transforming a once vacant space in east detroit into permanent space for artists to live, work, and grow. the project includes: a large shared space for studio, commercial, and living opportunities; an outdoor foundry and art park for public art and events, and a house for resident artists to make into a home. the impact of the art park will reach into the community, beautifying the area and bringing people together.

over 15 years of impactthe mission of 555 is to provide space for artists to create and make the arts accessible to the community. the organization was founded in ann arbor in 2002 by carl w. goines, jacob "monte" martinez, and andres garces. from its humble beginnings in a dark corridor of a warehouse as a small studio collective to the polished gallery and studios in the old jail cells of the former detroit third police precinct, 555 has created space for the arts on a shoestring budget with artists in residents, volunteerism, sheer tenacity, and the support of the detroit community.
