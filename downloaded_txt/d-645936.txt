welcome to wicomico yacht club


welcome to the wicomico yacht club. our club was founded in 1959 as the molly's point yacht club. we were later renamed to wicomico yacht club after establishing a residence.

we are located at the mouth of wicomico creek where it meets the wicomico river. here we frequently enjoy the beautiful sunsets all year round. the sun sets directly over the wicomico river when seen from our clubhouse.

we have dockage, fuel, a restaurant, tiki bar, and pool. we have events, bands, and other entertainment. we are a private club but would love for you to join us.

come see why we are the “cheers” of the wicomico, where we work like a captain and play like pirate.
