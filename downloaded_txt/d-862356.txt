acknowledging the patwin land and people
“we should take a moment to acknowledge the land on which we are gathered. for thousands of years, this land has been the home of patwin people. today, there are three federally recognized patwin tribes: cahil dehe band of wintun indians of the colusa indian community, kietsel dehe wintun nation, and yocha dehe wintun nation.”
 
“the patwin people have remained committed to the stewardship of this land over many centuries. it has been cherished and protected, as elders have instructed the young through generations. we are honored and grateful to be here today on their traditional lands.”
– chancellor gary s. may and provost and executive vice chancellor mary croughan
