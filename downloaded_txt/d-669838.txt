testimonials







for well over a decade, in my capacity as a researcher, broadcaster, and producer, i have relied heavily on alphagalileo.
   all of my work trips have been planned around stories that i've found on this site.
   the under embargo section allows us to plan ahead and the news releases enable us to find key experts.
   going through the tailored daily updates is the best way to start the day. it's such a critical service for me and many of my colleagues.
koula bouloukos, senior manager, editorial & production underknown









we have used alphagalileo since its foundation but frankly we need it more than ever now to ensure our research news is heard across europe, asia and north america. as one of the uk’s leading research universities we want to continue to work with other outstanding researchers in europe. alphagalileo helps us to continue to bring our research story to them and the rest of the world.
peter dunn, director of press and media relations at the university of warwick









alphagalileo has helped us more than double our reach at scidev.net. the service has enabled our journalists around the world to reach the mainstream media with articles about the impact of science on people in low- and middle-income countries, leading to big increases in the number of scidev.net articles that have been republished.
ben deighton, scidevnet
