anfiteatro pa2, edifício de matemática, instituto superior técnico the mathematics department symposium welcomes pablo pedregal, universidad de castilla-la mancha, who will lecture on a variational interpretation of the banach contraction principle and its surprising consequences for differential equations.
 19/06/2025 — 22/06/2025principia analogiae 2025
alameda campus, instituto superior técnico, lisboa, portugal analogical reasoning is a remarkable human capability, allowing us to adapt to novel situations - an ability that current ai systems still lack.
much research has suggested that analogies are key to non-brittle systems that can adapt to new domains. attempts to attack this problem have been fragmented, with different groups focusing on narrow aspects of the problem, each group using their own separate evaluation metrics. we believe that the lack of unifying foundational mathematical frameworks and evaluation benchmarks has been limiting progress in analogy research.
with this conference we aim to bring together leading experts from various research and applied fields to join forces, share perspectives, and collectively define the research agenda for the immediate future. recognizing the need for foundational work in this area, we seek unifying frameworks, methodologies, and basic principles that will serve as the cornerstone for future advancements.
principia analogiae 2025 will involve keynote presentations, followed by working groups to tackle several challenges related to analogy theory and applications. these will be soon announced.
the conference is free of charge but registration is mandatory and places are limited. see the conference site for instructions.

patrícia gonçalves, a full professor at the ist department of mathematics, was the 2024 schramm lecturer of the institute of mathematical statistics and the bernoulli society at the most important event in the field of probability, the world congress in probability and statistics, held from 12 to 16 august  in bochum, germany.
 

 29/07/2024new erasmus mundus joint masters maths-disc







the maths-disc consortium, consisting of università di verona, bergische universität wuppertal, igor sikorsky polytechnic institute kiev, universidade de lisboa and université grenoble alpes, and the partner university ntnu trondheim, was successful with its proposal for an erasmus mundus joint master (emjm) in mathematical modelling, simulation and data science together with more than 20 partners from leading industry and research centers (e. g. siemens, intel, bosch, bayer, d-fine, uroboptics, vodafone ukraine, idom, engys, otto bock, dlr, terranova, neuronslab, computer solutions sa, royal ihc, …) from different sectors and from all over europe.
this novel emjm will have a total budget of about 5 million euros in funding from the european union over six years. the program is also supported by the european consortium for mathematics in industry (ecmi) and the european network of mathematics for industry and innovation (eu-maths-in) to train the phd students of tomorrow and to establish interdisciplinary networks to share best practices at european level to overcome geographical and scientific fragmentation. 
the program is scheduled to start in the winter semester 2025/26 and applications should be possible from february 2025. for more general information about this emjm, please contact prof. cláudia nunes.
