from the hands that built hearst castle



more than 30 years of rich culinary history in a landmark location…



hearst castle foreman frank souza’s talents can be seen in a few lucky locations throughout the central coast, outside of the famed hearst castle. robin’s restaurant has resided in one of these locations as stewards since 1990. 














over the last 30 years, we’ve upheld the historical footprint of the original adobe home while also building on that tradition through our beautiful outdoor gardens and atrium.
















































the atrium

a beautiful sun-drenched, enclosed space with vibrant tiled tables and cozy seating.











the adobe home

an adobe home built in 1935 that is both quaint and comforting. 











the garden

the  pride and joy of owner shanny covey, the enchanting garden is the place to spot butterflies, hummingbirds and more.
