            inc. when 
            it comes to heat-turbonics 
            has been providing it for 30years! since 1985 turbonics has had test 
            data on our competitors at that time showing that our 4/5 toester 
            delivered approximately the same btuh output as everyone else's 8,500 
            btuh unit, and almost double our competitors' 4,000 btuh units. the 
            same test results show turbonics 11/13 toester 
            delivered approximately 2 to 3 times our competitor's 8,500 btuh units!.

the 
              vertical axis wind turbine (vawt) 
              converts wind energy to electrical power. the vawt 
              is an omni-directional low wind-speed generator that may be easily 
              installed practically anywhere with good wind exposure. this silent 
              generator may be painted to aesthetically blend into its surrounding 
              environment. the vawt is seen as a solid object as the rotational 
              speed increases, making it visible to birds. luminous strips may 
              be installed for night detection. the vawg has a 3-phase a.c electrical 
              power connection and 3-phase rectifier. the system includes a 60 
              amp load diversion controller.
