 julian always assists me when i am in a jam. he seems to be able to handle any problem. the students love working with him because they can relate to him; he keeps things on their level, and explains things so well. julian has helped me refine my assignment, making it better each semester.

thoughts

in the quest to find answers on the internet, it never ceases to amaze me how many people answer a question with "it can't be done."  how is that helpful?
if you can't laugh at yourself, we probably shouldn't be working together.
