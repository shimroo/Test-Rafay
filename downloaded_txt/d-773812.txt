hot food insurance
preparing and selling hot food has risks. there are the usual shop risks; customers having accidents, theft, vandalism; but takeaway shops involve the use of hot overns and sometimes hot oil as well, greatly increasing the possibilities of fire and burns to staff and, occasionally, customers as well. increasingly, though, we have a compensation culture around hot food, ranging from claims of being scalded by hot liquids such as drinks or soups, and there have been numerous cases of people with allergies falling ill through eating food containing possible allergens. insurance has never been so important for food shops and you can get more information from this cheap shop insurance site.
hot food delivery insurance
risks don't end when the food leaves the premises if you have a delivery service; and this is why delivery staff need hot food delivery insurance.unfortunately, people deliving hot food tend to have more accidents than the average. whether they deliver by bike, car, scooter, van or motorbike they are statistically at a higher risk on the road than other road users.this is because hot food needs to be kept that way; and no matter how carefully the food items are packed some cooling is going to happen. also; most delivery drivers have a certain number of deliveries to make in order to earn their keep. these facts mean that there is a tendency for drivers delivering takeaway food to go a bit faster than they really should, which increases the likelihood of accidents.in addition, the greatest demand for food to be delivered is when the weather is bad, and during the evening, and both these conditions make for more difficult driving conditions.motor insurance companies insist that those delivering food are properly insured to do so and without this cover delivery drivers risk heavy fines and other penalties which could lead to losing a driving licence. so, when insuring you shop, don't forget to insure your delivery staff too!
what kind of insurance does a hot fast food shop need?
a business normally requires some, possibly all, of the following:
public liability
employers liability
professional indemnity
buildings and contents cover
bigger companies can also face more complex risks such as terrorism, cyber attacks, defamation, and much more. every business is different and so every business requires protection against different risks.
smaller companies
smaller businesses can be at greater risk than larger ones because they do not have the financial backing to survive compensation claims or other disasters which adversely affect them. a simple slip or trip in the workplace can lead to a court case that can destroy a business; a fire can wipe out years of hard work. managers need to not only concentrate on day-to-day essentials but also consider what happens if things go wrong â and they do so all too readily.
your business is unique and therefore it is highly likely that you need a unique insurance package. it is also easy to look for the cheapest insurance by visiting price comparison websites; but few managers have the time to go into all the small print on innumerable policies. failing to do so however can result in a disaster if something goes wrong that should have been insured, but wasn't, because of an oversight. a professional insurance broker who specialises in business insurance should be able to advise managers on exactly what insurance they need, where to buy it, and how much they really need to pay for it.
majority of brokers will not charge the company they advise a fee, because they will receive commission from the underwriter that they pass the business on to. in the vast majority of cases working through a broker is the only way to buy a lot of insurance products anyway, since few underwriters will deal directly with businesses, except perhaps the very largest ones.
