i started drawing pinup boys back in 2005 or so. it started at a tattoo convention in atlanta. for anyone who probably doesn’t know, when you’re  new and don’t have any clients and you’re  in a strange city, getting someone to sit down for a tattoo at a convention can be hard. so, what we’d do is put out friday deals. i would draw pinup girls. everyone loves pinup girls, and i did well at shows for a while. the problem is, everyone loves pinup girls, everyone drew them. so, i changed it up. i started drawing chubby girls. that worked for a while. then this show in atlanta. it was dead. they had us in a corner across from some sticker booth, i couldn’t pay someone to stop and talk to me. then this trailer park angel stepped through the crowd. she parted the throng like moses, and came up to my booth. with a voice that camel wides had cut from stone she asked “i seen aw’ yer’ nekkid gurls. where’s yer nekkid guys?” the rest is history. you are correct madam, where are all of the naked guys?
