unseen connections: how non-revenue-water is linked to the hidden hazard of sinkholes
 

non-revenue water (nrw) and sinkholes might seem unrelated at first glance. still, a fascinating and crucial link between the two underscores the importance of managing our water resources efficiently. this article explores how nrw can contribute to the formation of sinkholes and why addressing nrw is vital for preventing these potentially dangerous occurrences.
what is non-revenue water?
non-revenue water refers to water that has been produced and is lost before it reaches the customer. these losses can be due to leaks, theft, or inaccurate metering. nrw poses significant challenges for water utilities worldwide, leading to wasted resources, increased operational costs, and the need for unnecessary water extraction from natural sources.
understanding sinkholes
sinkholes are depressions or holes in the ground caused by the collapse of a surface layer. while they can occur naturally due to the dissolution of soluble rocks such as limestone, dolomite, and gypsum, human activities can also trigger their formation. these activities include excessive groundwater pumping and the alteration of water drainage patterns.
the link between non-revenue water and sinkholes
the connection between nrw and sinkholes lies in the water loss caused by leaks in the distribution system. water leaking from pipes can erode the soil and rock beneath the surface, especially in areas with soluble rocks. over time, this erosion can create underground voids. if these voids grow large enough, the land surface above them can collapse, forming a sinkhole.
this process is exacerbated in urban areas with heavily paved ground and limited natural water infiltration. continuous water leakage from aging infrastructure or poorly maintained pipes contributes to underground erosion, increasing the risk of sinkholes.
 
a sinkhole claims a piece of paved road in the cascade mountains.
preventing sinkholes by addressing non-revenue water
mitigating the risk of sinkholes related to nrw requires a multifaceted approach. water utilities must invest in modernizing their infrastructure to reduce leaks and improve water efficiency. this can include adopting innovative water management systems that use sensors and real-time data analytics to detect and address leaks promptly.
furthermore, comprehensive water audits and regular maintenance schedules can help identify at-risk areas and prevent significant water losses. by reducing nrw, we can conserve valuable water resources, save costs, and mitigate the risk of sinkholes, protecting communities and infrastructure.
conclusion
the link between non-revenue water and sinkholes is a stark reminder of the interconnectedness of our water systems and the ground beneath our feet. addressing nrw is not just about water conservation and financial savings; it’s also about preventing the potential hazards of sinkholes. we can safeguard our communities and ensure a sustainable water future through smart investments in water infrastructure and technology.

cryptosporidium

emerging contaminants, uncategorized




 drinking-water systems still haven’t defeated this nasty parasite
introductory note: in 1993, cryptosporidium caused america’s largest waterborne illness outbreak, when more than 400k milwaukee, wisconsin, residents were infected. the cdc estimates the parasite sickens 800k people every year. fewer than 2% of cases are ever reported.

by lou dzierzak edited by sarah lewin frasier

the parasite cryptosporidium was responsible for the largest outbreak of waterborne disease in the u.s., and it still plagues some american drinking water systems today.
 epidemiology
thirty years ago a tiny parasite in the water supply in milwaukee, wis., touched off the largest waterborne disease outbreak in u.s. history. although that city’s water is now renowned for its high quality, public health departments across the country are still battling the same diarrhea-inducing organism. what makes it so tough?
reports of gastrointestinal illnesses throughout the milwaukee area began pouring into the city’s health department in april 1993. a local infectious disease physician eventually identified a case of cryptosporidiosis, an infection with the parasitic protist cryptosporidium. when health officials began testing stool samples for this organism, they found many more cases. the parasite, they realized, was lurking in the pipes: for the past two weeks the milwaukee water works had been receiving dozens of telephone complaints about local tap water appearing cloudy.
at a hastily called late-night meeting on april 7 of that year, milwaukee’s mayor john norquist asked the late jeff b. davis, an epidemiologist at the wisconsin division of public health, “would you drink the water?” davis’s answer, “no, i wouldn’t,” shocked the mayor. within an hour, norquist arranged a press conference and declared milwaukee’s drinking water unsafe for consumption unless it was boiled. television news anchors scrambled to report the mayor’s “boil order” for water, and newspaper editors reworked their front pages.
over the next eight days milwaukee cleaned and disinfected its water treatment plants, state and federal officials declared the supply safe for consumption, and the boil order was rescinded. but by that time more than 400,000 local residents—approximately half of the 800,000 people served by milwaukee’s water-distribution system—had reported cryptosporidiosis symptoms, including diarrhea, vomiting, fever, chills and body aches. pharmacy shelves ran out of over-the-counter gastrointestinal medicines. more than 4,000 people were admitted to local hospitals. by the time the crisis subsided, at least 100 people had died from exposure to the parasite.
cryptosporidium remains a serious health problem today. the centers for disease control and prevention reported 444 outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis in the u.s. between 2009 and 2017, and the number has increased by an average of 13 percent each year. a 2019 cdc report estimates that 823,000 people get the illness each year and that fewer than two percent of cases are reported to the cdc.
these outbreaks occur across the country and beyond. in late september 2023 the baltimore department of public works announced that cryptosporidium had been detected in samples from a large drinking-water reservoir. the city issued a boil-water order for people with health conditions that could make them more vulnerable. recent outbreaks have also been reported in north carolina and oregon. the u.k. and new zealand have also battled severe outbreaks in the last few months.
what makes cryptosporidiosis such a nasty and stubborn health problem?
first reported in humans in 1976, this extremely contagious disease spreads when people drink water contaminated with cryptosporidium. in the water supply the parasite remains in a life stage called an oocyst, which is four to five micrometers in diameter and shielded by a protective outer shell. this helps the organism resist pathogen-killing processes traditionally used by water treatment facilities.
once the oocysts are ingested, the shells crack—releasing cryptosporidium into the host’s intestines, where as few as 10 of the parasites can cause an infection. these parasites reproduce at an incredible speed: just three to four days after infection, a person can shed as many as one billion oocysts in diarrhea in a single day. and this shedding continues for an average of 18 days.
“cryptosporidium has a long incubation period,” says cdc epidemiologist michele hlavsa. “from the point when you’re exposed to the pathogen to the point where you develop symptoms, the time frame could be a week or more. then these people have to be sick enough to see a doctor and get tested.”
cryptosporidiosis can cause one to two weeks of nausea, stomach cramps, vomiting, dehydration and fever, but the most commonly reported symptom is watery diarrhea. although such claims might sound hyperbolic, hlavsa says infected people have reported up to 40 episodes of watery stools per day.
but diarrhea is a symptom of many illnesses, and most laboratories do not routinely test stool samples for cryptosporidium. because cryptosporidium is hard to detect and infected people can be contagious for several weeks, epidemiologists assume that many cases may be unreported and that outbreaks may be more widespread than they appear to be. some experts estimate that only one percent of confirmed cryptosporidium infections are officially documented.
scientists do know how to prevent cryptosporidium outbreaks: kill or filter out the parasites in public drinking water before it gets to the tap. the environmental protection agency’s interim enhanced surface water treatment rule (ieswtr) requires large water systems to remove 99 percent of cryptosporidium from drinking water. in 1998 the epa estimated that implementing this rule would “reduce the likelihood of the occurrence of outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis.”
yet removing these parasites from public drinking water is an extremely challenging process. the hard-shelled oocytes are resistant to the chlorine disinfectants used by many municipal water treatment plants.
fortunately, there are other options.
advanced technologies such as ozonation have proved effective in removing oocysts. in this process a device called an ozone generator runs a stream of oxygen through a high-voltage electric field, which breaks down some of the oxygen molecules, whose atoms combine with other oxygen molecules to produce ozone. the resulting oxygen-ozone mixture is pumped into holding tanks, where the highly corrosive ozone destroys the cell walls of any microorganisms in the water—rendering parasites such as cryptosporidium inert—before breaking down naturally. the water then moves through several more filtration and treatment processes before reaching household taps.
another option is exposing water to ultraviolet (uv) light, which inactivates cryptosporidium oocysts and renders the parasite noninfectious. “uv is an interesting concept—basically irradiating the water as it passes through a uv reactor—but the process doesn’t necessarily destroy the organism. the process just renders it so that the parasite can’t reproduce,” says dan welk, water plants manager at the milwaukee water works.
after milwaukee’s cryptosporidium outbreak, the city invested more than $500 million in upgrading its water treatment plant facilities; it has since garnered industry awards for the quality of its drinking water. milwaukee’s treatment process starts with ozonation and moves through a series of steps designed to remove cryptosporidium. and the city is open to doing more. “we’re always looking to see if there are other treatment techniques that we could potentially add to the plant to address an emerging concern,” welk says.
not every u.s. city tests its drinking water for cryptosporidium, however, and it continues to strike every year. according to the epa’s drinking water infrastructure needs survey and assessment (dwinsa) released in september 2023, the u.s. needs to invest $625 billion over the next 20 years to upgrade its drinking-water infrastructure.
in the meantime public health experts are working to improve diagnostic testing and reporting tools, which help them track outbreaks. but the cdc says accurate cryptosporidium reporting is still several years away—meaning there is still the threat of another widespread outbreak such as the one that occurred in milwaukee. “cryptosporidium isn’t just spreading locally. it’s spreading over multiple jurisdictions—and we might not be picking up these outbreaks,” hlavsa says. “an infection could start in one spot and move quickly to five different states.”

pure water gazette note:
residential protections against cryptosporidium in water
unfortunately, crypto cysts are hard-shelled creatures and regular tap water chlorination is not effective against them.  fortunately, though, they are giants in the micro world so they’re pretty easy to strain out with a filter. conventional wisdom says use a one-micron absolute filter or tighter, although looser filters have been shown to work well. for example, the matrikx pb1 carbon block, a half-micron filter that is a standard filter for our undersink filters and model 77 countertop units, is recommended for crypto removal.  for drinking water, any reverse osmosis unit can be depended upon eliminate cryptosporidium. for whole house treatment, very tight filters work, and ultraviolet is a 99.99% sure thing against crypto.
other treatments to consider are steam distillers, ceramic filters, and ozone generators, though tight filters, reverse osmosis, and uv are the most practical inmost cases.

rising sea levels driven by the climate crisis will overwhelm many of the world’s biggest oil ports
scientists said the threat was ironic as fossil fuel burning causes global heating. they said reducing emissions by moving to renewable energy would halt global heating and deliver more reliable energy. thirteen of the ports with the highest supertanker traffic will be seriously damaged by just 1 metre of sea level rise, the analysis found. the researchers said two low-lying ports in saudi arabia – ras tanura and yanbu – were particularly vulnerable. both are operated by aramco, the saudi state oil firm, and 98% of the country’s oil exports leave via these ports. the oil ports of houston and galveston in the us, the world’s biggest oil producer, are also on the list, as are ports in the united arab emirates, china, singapore and the netherlands. the guardian.
fluorinated drugs, a type of pfas, are widely contaminating us drinking water
new research suggests that fluorinated pharmaceuticals — a category that includes well-known medications such as prozac and flonase — are showing up in the water supply of millions of people. these drugs and their breakdown products are technically classified as being per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (pfas), also known as “forever chemicals,” which as a chemical class is the subject of worldwide health concern. the new lede
 
la firefighting effort harmed by outrageous misinformation about water
a billionaire couple was accused of withholding water that could help stop los angeles’ massive wildfires. democratic leadership was blamed for fire hydrants running dry and for an empty reservoir. firefighters were criticized for allegedly using “women’s handbags” to fight the fires.
those are just a few of the false or misleading claims that have emerged amid general criticism about california’s water management sparked by the fierce los angeles fires. much of the misinformation is being spread “because it offers an opportunity to take potshots at california democratic leadership while simultaneously distracting attention from the real contributing factors, especially the role of climate change,” said peter gleick, senior fellow at the pacific institute, a nonprofit he co-founded that focuses on global water sustainability.
water scarcity is widespread in the us
about 27 million people live in parts of the u.s. where water availability is limited, according to a first-of-its-kind federal assessment reported in politico. 
the analysis from the u.s. geological survey compared water supply and demand from 2010 to 2020. it found “severe” limitations on the amount of available water in groundwater and surface waters in california, the arid southwest, and much of the great planes and texas. other regions facing slightly less severe water constraints include florida and eastern washington state and oregon.
the report is the most comprehensive federal study to date on whether the u.s. has enough water to power the economy, researchers said.
water and ai
we think of ai as being an energy glutton. we fail to consider that it takes a big hit on water resources as well. in 2022 alone, tech giants like google, microsoft, and meta consumed over 2 billion cubic meters of water for server cooling and electricity use, more than double denmark’s annual consumption. water: the unsung hero of the ai boom. 
natural global water cycle is shifting
in a recently published paper, nasa scientists use nearly 20 years of observations to show that the global water cycle is shifting in unprecedented ways. the majority of those shifts are driven by activities such as agriculture and could have impacts on ecosystems and water management, especially in certain regions. technology networks. 
 
pfas and wastewater sludge
us regulators added to growing concerns about the long-standing practice of using sewage sludge to fertilize farmland, releasing a report warning that chemicals contaminating the sludge pose heightened human health risks for cancer and other illnesses.
the environmental protection agency (epa) said two types of hazardous per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (pfas) widely found in sewage sludge, a byproduct of wastewater treatment, can contaminate the milk, eggs and meat that come from farm animals raised on agricultural land where the sludge has been applied. those “exposure pathways” are among multiple ways in which people can be at risk, the epa said.   new lede.
 
the president’s magic water valve
newly sworn president donald trump once again spoke of a mysterious water valve at some unspecified location that will solve california’s water issues if california officials will simply turn it on. according to abc news, “trump claimed los angeles limits residents to just 38 gallons of water a day, and referred to some mythical “valve” that could bring limitless water to l.a., but that officials instead diverted to the ocean.”
“they have a valve, think of a sink but multiply it by many thousands of times the size of it, it’s massive. and you turn it back toward los angeles. why aren’t they doing it? they either have a death wish, they’re stupid or there’s something else going on that we don’t understand,” trump said.
the president has spoken of this valve several times, but he never gives a source for his information or a specific location for the valve. a kind interpretation of his insistence on the big valve is that he is in fact speaking theoretically about some far-fetched scheme he read on a social media post that involves redirecting water from northern california to the la area. people who understand how the laws of nature work have tried to explain that california isn’t like a tall building with northern california being up and la being down.
peter gleick, hydro-climatologist and co-founder of the pacific institute: “[trump’s order on california water policy] is what you get when you mix bluster, ignorance, and disinformation. there are no ‘enormous amounts of water’ that can be redirected legally, economically, or environmentally to different users in california ….”
the president later reported that he had the military enter the state and turn on the water. the presumption is that soldiers at his command simply turned on the big valve giving the state water to fight its wildfires.
“the united states military just entered the great state of california and, under emergency powers, turned on the water flowing abundantly from the pacific northwest, and beyond,” trump wrote on truth social.
“the days of putting a fake environmental argument, over the people, are over. enjoy the water, california!!!” he added.
but the california department of water resources responded that the military never entered the golden state and that the state continues to have plenty of water resources. (fox news.)

how droughts and heavy rainfall degrade water quality

water and climate change






groundwater threatened by droughts and heavy rainfalls
 



extreme climate events endanger groundwater quality and stability, when rain water evades natural purification processes in the soil. this was demonstrated in long-term groundwater analyses using new analytical methods, as described in a recent study in nature communications. as billions of people rely on sufficient and clean groundwater for drinking, understanding the impacts of climate extremes on future water security is crucial.
groundwater-containing rock formations, termed aquifers, are commonly recharged through precipitation seeping through the soil. during this passage, substances taken up at the surface are removed from the water via sorption to soil minerals or they are metabolized by soil microorganisms. this natural filtering process results in highly purified groundwater resources. however, rainfall can sometimes quickly flow into deeper soil layers thereby evading purification and transporting large amounts of dissolved substances from the surface and upper soil layers into groundwater aquifers.
this is particularly true following extreme rainfall and after drought periods. extended droughts induce large cracks in the soil and they also reduce the uptake of rain water in upper soils. under such conditions, water flows more directly into the groundwater, or alternatively runs off into rivers, lakes and oceans. the groundwater is then not sufficiently replenished, but also contaminated with unwanted and potentially harmful substances from the surface and upper soil layers. these may include, e.g., organic matter, herbicides and pesticides, microbial products like antibiotics, as well as any other pollutants.
in a novel experimental approach simon a. schroeter and gerd gleixner from max planck institute for biogeochemistry performed long-term groundwater analyses in germany, together with a large research team. they used detection of dissolved organic matter as a proxy for water contaminants and confirmed fundamental changes in groundwater stability. “our results suggest that climate change-induced extreme weather events are already altering groundwater quality and its recharge dynamics,” says postdoctoral researcher simon schroeter.
the research team studied groundwater and the corresponding hydroclimatic conditions in three geologically distinct research sites in germany between 2014 and 2021. they analyzed water quality by tracking thousands of individual molecular entities on their passage from soil into groundwater. in contrast to standard methods, i.e. targeting the bulk concentration of dissolved organic carbon, their newly developed untargeted approach allowed them to detect any changes in the amount and chemical composition of organic molecules.
during up to 8 years of analysis, the scientists found consistent long-term trends: increasing amounts of surface-derived organic substances accumulating in groundwater, as well as decreasing groundwater levels. in addition, they were able to clearly correlate such increased groundwater contamination with extreme weather events, in particular with the drought in 2018. their results suggest that the new method is significantly more sensitive to detect changes in groundwater quality than the commonly employed carbon measurement. it could therefore serve as a future early indicator of groundwater quality deterioration. while the method relies on organic molecules as indicators of water contamination, the actual contaminants may include any pollutants washed out from the surface.
as climate change continues to intensify, scientists call for increased attention to groundwater management and mitigation strategies towards impacts of hydroclimatic extremes. the decline in the soil’s natural water purification processes amplifies the stress our society already faces due to diminishing groundwater levels. recent investigations warn that the climate-induced decrease in groundwater quality may exceed that of anthropogenic pollution. gerd gleixner, head of the research group, adds, “our method will help us to identify risks for groundwater quality in aquifers that are thought to be clean and safe to use for the future. our research results underscore the urgent need for sustainable water management practices to protect this vital resource.”
the study is part of the german collaborative research center aquadiva, led by kirsten küsel, susan trumbore, and kai totsche, an interdisciplinary initiative focusing on understanding the interactions between surface and subsurface ecosystems and their response to environmental changes. by integrating expertise from biogeochemistry, hydrogeology, and microbiology, aquadiva aims to uncover the complex processes that govern groundwater ecosystems and their resilience to climate change.

drinking water after fires

l.a. officials warn of compromised drinking water in fire-ravaged areas
by hiroko tabuchi
“do not drink” orders have been issued in some areas where damaged pipes that lost pressure might pull in toxic smoke and harmful chemicals that could linger in the system for years.
as fires across los angeles county start to wind down, health officials are warning about risks related to water systems in the area.
municipal water pipes damaged by fire can lose pressure, causing them to suck in smoke and harmful chemicals. those chemicals can make their way through the water system and linger for years. plastic piping, commonly used to carry water in quake-prone states like california, can also release chemicals into drinking water if the piping is heated, melted or burned.
one concern is benzene, which is abundant in wildfire smoke. if inhaled or ingested, benzene can lead to nausea and vomiting in the short term and may cause cancer over time.
after the wildfire that destroyed paradise in 2018, testing found benzene concentrations in drinking water had spiked to more than 80 times levels that california health officials say are dangerous for short-term exposure.
naphthalene and methylene chloride, present in plastic, adhesives and other household materials, can also contaminate drinking water and disperse easily into the air.
local utilities are not taking any chances: “do not drink” notices are in place for parts of los angeles county, including fire-ravaged pacific palisades and altadena.
utilities now face the daunting task of testing the safety of drinking water, as residents seek to return home.
in the meantime, officials’ directions are clear for those under “do not drink” notices: use only bottled water for drinking, brushing teeth and making ice or preparing food, including baby formula; limit the use of hot water, because chemicals can easily vaporize; do not try to treat the water yourself; and keep a close eye on updates.

president jimmy carter and water filters
 
president jimmy carter died in january of 2025 at the age of 100. after he left office and up until his death he devoted his energies to many worthwhile projects. perhaps most frequently mentioned is his untiring support for habitat for humanity. less frequently mentioned is his effort to wipe out the infestation of guinea worm that plagued millions of the poorest of the planet’s residents.
 
one of ex-president jimmy carter’s great contributions to the world was providing, distributing and popularizing water filters.
the parasite guinea worm sounds like something out of a horror movie. people become infected by drinking contaminated water or eating undercooked fish, when the worms are very small. then the worm grows and grows. it sometimes takes a year for the infected person that he or she is infected. that’s when the creature breaks through the skin of the legs or feet, causing extremely painful blisters that can be debilitating.
humans cannot develop resistance to the worms, according to scientific american’s charles schmidt, and the traditional process of removing them is painstaking: gently winding an emerging worm around a stick and pulling it slowly out, usually just an inch or two each day, in a process that can last for weeks. pulling too fast or too hard might cause the worm to break off in the body, leading to secondary infections. when victims suffer from multiple worms—such as a nigerian man who had a record-setting 84 in his body at one time—the excruciating recovery work compounds.
in the mid 1980’s, there were about 3.5 million cases of guinea worm around the world. now, only about 11 people are known to be infected. president carter’s goal was to see the total eradication of the guinea worm problem before his death. he got close.
the near eradication of guinea worm is part of the legacy of jimmy carter, whose work with his carter center targeted overlooked diseases that most often affect poor people in remote areas. the effort didn’t involve drugs, but relied on public education around disease transmission, and providing safe water supplies like filters.
the filters themselves were not high-tech systems developed by massive grants and years of experimentation.  they were simple filter straws that strained out worm-producing organisms from unsafe well or river water, or simple, inexpensive cloth filters that filtered unsafe water as it was poured into a water pot.

 
simple cloth pour-through filters are very effective at preventing guinea worm infestation. 
a typical cloth filter used in ghana is manufactured by the swiss company, vestegaard and it has openings of 100-120 micron pore size.

drinking water direct from a contaminated river through a simple and inexpensive hand-held filtering device.

is the great salt lake being drained by livestock?

shortage, water and climate change





reducing irrigation for livestock feed crops is needed to save great salt lake, study argues



the great salt lake has lost more than 15 billion cubic yards of water over the past three decades, is getting shallower at the rate of 4 inches a year, and an analysis of its water budget suggests reducing irrigation is necessary for saving it.
the study published today in environmental challenges shows that 62% of the river water bound for the lake is diverted for human uses, with agricultural activities responsible for nearly three-quarters of that percentage.
“the research highlights the alarming role of water consumption for feeding livestock in driving the lake’s rapid depletion,” said co-author william ripple, distinguished professor of ecology at oregon state university, who notes that 80% of agricultural water use is for irrigating alfalfa and hay crops.
to stabilize the lake and begin refilling it, the authors propose cutting human water consumption in the great salt lake watershed by 35%, including a reduction in irrigated alfalfa production, a fallowing of much of the region’s irrigated grass hay fields and taxpayer-funded compensation for farmers and ranchers who lose income.
“the lake is of tremendous ecological, economic, cultural and spiritual significance in the region and beyond,” said ripple, a member of osu’s college of forestry. “all of those values are in severe jeopardy because of the lake’s dramatic depletion over the last few decades.”
the authors used data from the utah division of water resources to build a detailed water budget for the great salt lake basin for the years 1989 through 2022. on average, inputs to the lake – river inflows and precipitation – during the study period lagged behind consumption and evaporation at the rate of 500 million cubic yards per year.
the water budget has been in a deficit situation for much of the past 100 years and the numbers have worsened with climate change and drought, the authors say.
“abnormally large snowmelt inflow during the 1980s and 1990s served to temporarily obscure the long-term decline in lake levels, and the lake actually reached its highest level in more than a century in 1987,” ripple said. “but it has been dropping by roughly 4 inches per year on average since then.”
the great salt lake, which has no outlet, is the largest saline lake in the western hemisphere and the eighth largest in the world. its 21,000-square-mile drainage basin includes the wasatch mountains, whose snowfall accounts for much of the basin’s water replenishment.
a biodiversity hotspot, the lake sustains more than 10 million migratory birds and 350 bird species. declining lake levels threaten critical habitats and could disrupt food webs, ripple said.
the lake directly supports 9,000 jobs and annually fuels $2.5 billion in economic activity in the form of recreation, mining and brine shrimp harvesting, the paper points out. it’s the world’s largest supplier of brine shrimp eggs, a food source that underpins global aquaculture, but as the lake shrinks and salinity increases, the shrimp become physiologically stressed and don’t produce as well.
also as the lake gets smaller, human health risk grows in the form of wind-carried dust from the exposed saline lakebed, or playa. five percent of the great salt lake playa is fine particulate matter that can enter the lungs and cause a range of pulmonary problems, and particularly troublesome, the scientists say, is the presence of toxic heavy metals, residues of the region’s history of mining, smelting and oil refining.
depending on which conservation measures are deployed – including crop shifting, reducing municipal and industrial use, and leasing water rights from irrigators – the authors propose that farmers and ranchers who lose income from using less water could be compensated at a cost ranging from $29 to $124 per utah resident per year. the state’s population is 3.4 million.
“revenues from growing both irrigated alfalfa and grass hay cattle feed in the great salt lake basin account for less than 0.1% of utah’s gross domestic product,” ripple said. “but our potential solutions would mean lifestyle changes for as many as 20,000 farmers and ranchers in the basin.”
in that regard, he adds, the great salt lake area exemplifies the socio-cultural changes facing many river basin communities in the west and around the world, where climate change is sending many water budgets into deficit status.
“the economic and cultural adjustments required are significant but not insurmountable,” said ripple. “with the right policies and public support, we can secure a sustainable future for the great salt lake and set a precedent for addressing water scarcity globally.”
collaborating with ripple on the paper was an interdisciplinary team of scientists from northern arizona university, utah state university and virginia tech; the utah agricultural experiment station; and sustainable waters, a new mexico-based nonprofit focusing on global water education.
the national science foundation and the utah agricultural experiment station provided funding.

“forever chemicals” in wastewater far more widespread than previously known, new multi-university study reveals



the “forever chemicals” flowing from u.s. wastewater treatment plants are not only more abundant than previously thought, but also largely consist of pharmaceuticals that have received little scientific or regulatory attention, a new multi-university study reveals.
the research, published in pnas, found that common prescription drugs make up about 75% of the organic fluorine in wastewater entering treatment plants, and 62% in treated water released to the environment.
these findings suggest millions of americans could be exposed to these persistent chemicals through their drinking water.
“we’ve been focused on a small subset of these chemicals, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg,” said bridger j. ruyle, an incoming assistant professor in nyu tandon school of engineering’s civil and urban engineering department and the study’s lead author. “the research shows that even advanced wastewater treatment removes less than 25% of these compounds before they’re discharged into rivers and streams.”
of particular concern is that six forever chemicals recently regulated by the environmental protection agency in drinking water make up only about 8% of the organic fluorine found in wastewater effluent. the remainder consists largely of fluorinated pharmaceuticals and other compounds that aren’t currently regulated.
using a national model that tracks how wastewater moves through u.s. waterways, the researchers estimate that during normal river conditions, about 15 million americans receive drinking water containing levels of these compounds above regulatory limits. during drought conditions, that number could rise to 23 million people.
the study examined eight large wastewater treatment facilities serving metropolitan areas across the united states. these facilities are similar to those serving about 70% of the u.s. population, suggesting the findings have broad national implications.
“what’s particularly troubling is that these fluorinated pharmaceuticals are designed to be biologically active at very low doses,” said ruyle. “we don’t yet understand the public health implications of long-term exposure to these compounds through drinking water.”
the research comes at a critical time, as about 20% of all pharmaceuticals now contain fluorine. while this chemical element makes drugs more effective by helping them persist in the body longer, that same persistence means they don’t break down in the environment.
the findings suggest that current regulatory approaches focusing on individual chemicals may be insufficient to address the complex mixture of fluorinated compounds in wastewater. the study also highlights how water scarcity could exacerbate the problem. in regions experiencing drought or implementing water conservation measures through wastewater reuse, there’s less dilution of these chemicals before they reach drinking water intakes.
“these results emphasize the urgent need to reduce ongoing sources of these chemicals and evaluate the long-term effects of fluorinated pharmaceuticals in our water supply,” said ruyle. “we can’t just focus on the handful of compounds we’ve studied extensively while ignoring the majority of what’s actually out there. we need a more comprehensive approach to regulation and increased attention to the ecological and public health impacts of fluorinated pharmaceuticals.”
the paper’s publication comes on the heels of ruyle’s november 2024 testimony to new york state lawmakers warning about the threats of forever chemicals passing through water treatment plants. the new findings provide detailed evidence supporting his concerns about the potential prevalence of these compounds in downstream drinking water supplies.
in addition to ruyle, the paper’s authors are emily pennoyer, thomas webster, and wendy heiger-bernays from boston university school of public health; simon vojta, jitka becanova, and rainer lohmann from the university of rhode island’s graduate school of oceanography; minhazul islam and paul westerhoff from arizona state university; charles schaefer from cdm smith in new jersey; and elsie sunderland, who holds appointments at harvard’s school of engineering and applied sciences, department of earth and planetary sciences, and school of public health.
financial support for this work was provided by the national institute for environmental health science superfund research program (p42es027706) and the water research foundation (project 5031). this study was also supported by contributions from the anonymous participating wastewater treatment facilities.

effectiveness of antimicrobial shower heads questioned
to guard against harmful waterborne pathogens, many consumers, including managers of health-care facilities, install antimicrobial silver-containing shower heads. but researchers now report that these fixtures are no “silver bullet.” in real-world showering conditions, most microbes aren’t exposed to the silver long enough to be killed. however, the composition of rare microbes in water from these shower heads varied with each type of fixture tested. water online  (gazette note: common sense should tell us that at the flow rate of shower water microbes in water aren’t going to be controlled by the tiny amount of silver in a shower filter. silver in the shower head may slow down the growth of bacteria in other media of the filter, but it isn’t capable of eliminating microbes in contaminated water. )
 
 

 
scientists are still not sure what the fish’s blob is used for
during an expedition in the alto mayo region of peru, part of the amazon rainforest, researchers identified 27 new species, including an amphibious mouse with webbed feet and a unique “blob-headed” fish.
 
water used as weapon in gaza
israel’s restriction of gaza’s water supply to levels below minimum needs amounts to an act of genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity, a report from human rights watch has alleged. it has accused israeli forces of deliberate actions intended to cut the availability of clean water so drastically that the population has been forced to resort to contaminated sources, leading to the outbreak of lethal diseases, especially among children.  the guardian
world’s oldest iceberg is moving
antarctica: the world’s largest and oldest iceberg a23a is on the move. after decades of being grounded on the seafloor and more recently spinning on the spot, the mega-iceberg has broken free from its position north of the south orkney islands and is now drifting in the southern ocean. the colossus a23a, which is double the size of greater london and weighs nearly a trillion tons, calved from antarctica’s filchner ice shelf in 1986, and remained grounded on the seabed in the weddell sea for over 30 years before beginning its slow journey north in 2020.full story from british antarctic survey.
 
study finds that river flow patterns are changing
uc college of engineering and applied science assistant professor dongmei feng and her research partner, colin gleason at the university of massachusetts amherst, mapped the flow of water in nearly 3 million rivers, creeks and streams for the past 35 years and discovered more water flowing in upstream headwaters and decreasing flows downstream where more people live.
the study published in the journal science identified an increase in catastrophic floods known as 100-year floods in upstream waters over the last 35 years.
researchers found significant declines in water flow in 44% of downstream sections of rivers and significant increases in 17% of upstream sections.
these changes can have profound effects on navigability, pollution, potability and even hydroelectric power. more sedimentation can cut off water flow to dams and damage turbines.
 
epa issues complete ban on tce
final epa rules ban all uses of tce. all consumer uses and many commercial uses of pce require worker protections.
on dec. 9, 2024 the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) finalized the latest risk management rules for trichloroethylene (tce) and perchloroethylene (pce) under the bipartisan 2016 toxic substances control act (tsca) amendments, marking another major milestone for chemical safety after decades of inadequate protections and serious delays. these protections align with president biden’s cancer moonshot, a whole-of-government approach to end cancer as we know it.
iowa is “in crisis” due to illegal manure discharges into waterways
iowa regulators are failing to properly penalize iowa factory farms for illegally contaminating state waterways with animal waste, according to an analysis just released by a public health advocacy group. between 2013 and 2023, the iowa department of natural resources (dnr) recorded 179 incidents in which livestock operators discharged manure in violation of the law, fouling creeks and rivers and killing off more than one million fish, according to food & water watch, which based its report on a review of state discharge enforcement reports. the quantities of discharges ranged up to 1 million gallons, the group said.  full story in the new lede.
