suburban motors harley-davidson®




owners wayne and joan houpt started suburban motors as a car dealership in 1968 before expanding to a harley-davidson® dealership in 1975 and have been family owned and operated ever since. in 1968, the business started as 'suburban motors of grafton' selling amc (american motors), jeep, saab and chrysler-plymouth and was located in what is now the verlo store in grafton. the dealership moved to thiensville in 1985 into the old sommer's automotive building where they shared the location with a chrysler dealership. later wayne and joan purchased the entire building and expanded the entire location to what is now suburban motors harley-davidson®. 

through humble beginnings, and together by each other’s side for over 50 years, this husband and wife team succeeded with hard work and dedication to customer service, which is why our business is consistently recognized as a premier harley-davidson® dealership. wayne is an avid rider and his love for racing runs deep into his roots. although our business has been family owned and operated since 1975, the  suburban family does not stop at the bloodline. once you shop at suburban, you become part of that suburban family too! since customer satisfaction is our number one priority, our professional and courteous staff make sure you feel like family; important and taken care of. together as the suburban family, our vision is to guide people to find their freedom on the open road by providing the timeless pursuit of adventure and freedom for the soul through the harley-davidson brand.
