“the longer this lifetime goes, the more convinced i am that our primary responsibility in life is to find a way to make peace with ourselves, our past, and our present—no matter what we face and no matter how often we need to do that.it’s also our job to mindfully practice self-love. every day. for all our lives. it’s not a narcissistic or obnoxiously selfish attitude toward life and our relationships. self-love is a humbler, quieter thing. you’ll get used to it. i like it; you may too.”—from the revised edition of codependent no more
