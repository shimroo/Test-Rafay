we need your help! 

𝐀𝐥𝐮𝐦𝐧𝐢, 𝐒𝐮𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬, 𝐅𝐚𝐦𝐢𝐥𝐲 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐅𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐬!
this past saturday the bombers black side made club history by defeating park city haggis in the northern regional final with an impressive 76-5 score line. with this victory the club qualified for the first time for the usa rugby division 1 final 4 to be held in austin, texas on may 17-18-19 where we will face off against the dallas rugby club in the semi final match up.
the deeper the club goes into the playoffs the more travel we have and the more expenses we incur. with that in mind, we would like to ask all of you to help support the boys on their path to a national championship by making a donation to help defray the substantial cost involved.
please make your donations through the links below and include “national championships 2024” in the subject line. if you wish to pay by check, make them payable to
st louis bombers rugby – and send to:bombers rugby60 webster acresst. louis, mo 63119
venmo-@stlbombersrfcpaypal-2024 d1 nationals
all donations of $150 or greater will receive a special gift to commemorate this historic event.
thank you and 𝐏𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐭 𝐈𝐭 𝐁𝐥𝐚𝐜𝐤!
