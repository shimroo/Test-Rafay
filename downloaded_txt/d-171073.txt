gloves off in 
                  battle for fishing rights


 the 
                    ministry of fisheries is about to commence work on developing 
                    a shared fisheries policy. this process will go directly to 
                    the core issue of defining the rights of recreational fishers 
                    now, and into the future. if you are a recreational fisher 
                    then this is everything. 
there 
                    is only one certainty, if recreational fishers fail to engage 
                    at the highest level possible, they will lose. 



shared fisheries


the 
                    minister urges option4 to work with mfish on the shared fisheries 
                    policy. then he will "consider any need for direct meetings 
                    with stakeholder groups". 



the 
                    ministry is developing a policy to address long-standing concerns 
                    over allocation and management in shared fisheries, where 
                    both commercial and non-commercial fishers have an interest. 
                    option4 will be fully engaged in this process during 2006. 
                    more detail here..........



hokianga accord


 promising 
                    developments are coming from meeting with ngapuhi, ngati wai, 
                    ngati whatua at the recent hui. recreational fishers have 
                    been invited to join the regional customary forum. option4, 
                    nzbgfc and the nzrfc are all keen to participate. find out 
                    how this has come about and the progress that has been made 
                    over the past few months......



fisheries management


proportional 
                    allocations
 
                    it seems the ministry are using the conservation efforts of 
                    non-commercial fishers to supplement over fishing by the commercial 
                    sector. read what option4 have to say about the mfish proportional 
                    proposals for important fisheries.

huge 
                      potential for achieving the goal of "more fish in the

                      tools. exciting progress is being made in discussions between 
                      our team, maori and mfish.

the option4 principles are worth 
                      fighting for!



  





option4 objective


to carry the four principles of option4 all the way through the rights redefinition process and to have those principles enshrined in legislation.





 option4 
                  principles



a priority right 
                  over commercial fishers for free access to a reasonable daily 
                  bag-limit to be written into legislation.



the ability to exclude commercial 
                  methods that deplete recreationally important areas



the ability to devise plans 
                  to ensure future generations enjoy the same or better quality 
                  of rights while preventing fish conserved for recreational use 
                  being given to the commercial sector.



no licensing 
                  of recreational fishers.
