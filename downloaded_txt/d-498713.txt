the key to creating a timeless home is to balance different styles and incorporate your own decorating touch. whether it’s stripes, florals, or geometric patterns, there are some design trends that never go out of style.
minimalism is another timeless style that emphasizes simplicity and clean lines. using raw materials like marble countertops or wood furniture adds an organic element to your space.
1. neutral colours

as any design enthusiast knows, colour can either date a space or make it feel timeless. while no colour is completely timeless (aside from avocado green bathroom fittings, oh my!) neutrals are incredibly versatile and never go out of style.
the beauty of neutrals is that they provide a blank canvas for other colors to pop and act as a background that helps your furniture, art, and accessories stand out. they also help you create a sense of openness and light in a room, which is especially important in large spaces.
when it comes to choosing a neutral shade, stick with one that has warm undertones rather than cool. a warmer neutral will complement a wider range of colours, and will look more timeless than one that has cool undertones. the best way to tell if a neutral is warm or cool is to look at it in natural light. if it looks more yellowish in the sun, then it’s likely warm, and if it leans more toward blue-grey, then it’s cool.
while you can certainly use a neutral as your entire palette, it’s a good idea to add depth with classic color accents. choose rich tones like navy blue, forest green or burgundy that will work well with your neutral base. you can then use these accents in your rugs, throw pillows and artwork to create a cohesive look that won’t date.
in addition, neutrals are great for creating a calming and serene environment, says one interior expert with blokk studio. if you’re concerned about your home feeling too clinical, then you can balance the neutral palette with softer textures and materials like wool rugs, brushed metals and soft shag rugs.
neutrals also work well with natural elements, such as timber and stone, to create a cohesive exterior palette that will last the test of time. when selecting your neutral colour palette, try to draw inspiration from the natural elements in your area, and then use this as a guide for your trim and accent colours.
another advantage of neutrals is that they’re a great choice for exteriors because they pair nicely with traditional architectural features, such as timber windows and leadlights. they also complement a variety of finishes, including brick, slate and stone, making them a versatile option for many homes. you can also introduce an element of warmth into a neutral colour scheme by using deep accent colours, such as navy blue or rich baby seal black 2119-30 on trim.
2. black-and-white
when it comes to interior design, some trends seem to never go out of style. whether it’s a classic little black dress or an enduring architecture style, some aesthetic sensibilities endure because of their quality and timeless beauty.
achieving a timeless look in your home doesn’t have to be difficult. with a little planning, you can incorporate elements that have stood the test of time and create a beautiful, well-designed space without having to continually update your decor.
to make your home feel more timeless, opt for a neutral color palette. white, beige and gray are classic colors that will always be in fashion. the best way to incorporate these colors into your design is through natural materials like wood and stone.
the use of patterned fabrics is another way to add visual interest to a room while still staying true to a timeless design. however, be careful not to overdo it with patterned materials. adding too many patterns or colors can become overwhelming and tiresome quickly. instead, opt for one or two patterned pieces in your space and keep the rest of the design simple.
one of the most important principles of timeless design is to invest in quality craftsmanship. the use of traditional building materials like natural wood and leather provides a sense of warmth and richness that transcends passing fads. also, incorporating architectural details like crown molding, wainscoting and coffered ceilings can instantly elevate your design and add a timeless appeal to your home.
minimalism is another design principle that has become increasingly popular. by stripping away the clutter and focusing on functionality over decoration, minimalism creates a clean, uncluttered look that feels elegant and sophisticated. it also allows for the inclusion of personalized touches, such as family heirlooms or travel souvenirs, which contribute to a well-curated space that feels deeply reflective of the people who live in it.
ultimately, the most important element of timeless design is to follow your instincts. if you see a trend that you love, don’t be afraid to try it! but remember to incorporate it in a small way, such as painting an accent wall or powder room, so you don’t have to repaint your entire home to get the look you want. and if you do decide to go with a trendy color or material, don’t be afraid to replace it once it’s no longer on trend. after all, nothing’s worse than a room full of outdated furniture and decor!
3. natural wood
while some design trends come and go, others are enduring enough to make your home feel beautiful and welcoming for years to come. whether you’re a homeowner who wants to add a touch of timeless elegance or an interior designer looking for inspiration, these classic trends can help you create a stylish and sophisticated space that will never go out of style.
natural wood tones have gained popularity recently, infusing interiors with warmth, style, and comfort. after years of the design pendulum swinging towards cool grays, homeowners have embraced warm tones and organic materials in their homes. natural wood also works well with a variety of design styles, including modern farmhouse and california-cool.
unlike synthetic materials, natural wood is a unique, hand-crafted material that conveys a sense of authenticity and naturalness to rooms. from flooring to cladding, this versatile material enhances spaces with its natural texture and warmth. furthermore, it embodies sustainability and environmental awareness. it’s no wonder why many designers consider it a design trend that never goes out of style!
when choosing natural wood, be sure to consider the type of grain and finish you’d like for your project. the grain pattern defines the look of the final product and can affect its durability, strength, and acoustics. it’s also important to consider the color and texture of the wood as this can influence its visual appeal and ambiance. for example, darker woods tend to have more dramatic grain patterns, while lighter colors have smoother finishes.
the best way to incorporate natural wood into your design is to select a material that compliments your overall vision and matches your home’s architectural style. for example, if you want to achieve a modern, minimalist design, you may choose an oak flooring with a subtle grain and glossy finish. conversely, if you’re aiming for a cottage-style home, you may opt for a more rustic or distressed wood flooring.
another popular use for natural wood is as a focal point or statement piece. this is a great way to bring the beauty of nature into your home, and can be achieved through things such as hardwood floors, natural stone accents, or even a natural wood beam. using these natural elements as statement pieces in your home will create a space that feels both contemporary and classic, making it a design trend that never goes out.

7 benefits of upgrading your mri equipment
june 21, 2024june 8, 2024
 

 

the benefits of medical imaging equipment upgrades are clear. they can boost clinical effectiveness, increase patient satisfaction, and speed up scan times to help you see more patients in a day.
but purchasing mri technology is a major investment. fortunately, there is a way to avoid costly upfront purchases: mri scanner rental.
improved image quality
mri images provide detailed information about organs and tissues inside the body. they are often used by radiologists to diagnose or treat patients with a variety of conditions.
an mri machine uses a large, tube-shaped magnet to create images of internal structures. inside the magnetic field, protons from water in your body line up, and when they do, they send out radio signals that a computer turns into images of your body.
older mri machines are unable to use the same imaging power as newer ones, and this may result in lower quality images. ge’s mr system upgrades are an ideal solution for facilities looking to improve image quality while keeping their existing systems in service.
the ge tim upgrade is designed to help imaging departments improve clinical effectiveness, increase patient throughput, and boost staff morale. this alternative mri upgrade path requires minimal disruption to the workplace, provides rapid returns, and costs less than a new installation.
many hospitals are reluctant to invest in a new mri because it’s expensive, but upgrading an existing system is a more cost-effective option. this can reduce the number of times that your facility needs to purchase and store liquid helium, and can lower maintenance costs as well.
faster scan times
with budget constraints weighing on many facilities, efficiency is the top priority. in addition to boosting clinical effectiveness, faster scan times can help staff meet patient demand by offering more scan slots throughout the day.
when you upgrade your mri system to a siemens magnetom symphony, you can enjoy a range of benefits including better signal-to-noise ratio, increased scan speeds, more standard and optional coils, a new radio-frequency (rf) system with up to 18 or 32 independent channels for improved image quality, audio comfort improvements for quieter examinations, and new computer systems for quicker reconstruction.
the shortened time patients spend in the mri can also make them more relaxed and less anxious, making them more cooperative during the exam. the result is a more accurate diagnosis, and happier patients.
while it’s true that purchasing an mri machine gives you more control over how and when your equipment is upgraded, the upfront investment can be prohibitive for smaller practices. for these, a certified refurbished option is an ideal choice. these models can significantly reduce costs while retaining the functionality of a newer machine, and they allow for future upgrades without the need to replace the entire scanner.
better patient comfort
patients can be anxious or stressed during mri scans, particularly if they’re claustrophobic or have never had one before. a new, high-quality mri can help to alleviate those feelings, resulting in a smoother and more pleasant imaging experience for all involved.
the new mri at intermountain medical center in watertown, co, for example, has a larger scanner core opening that’s ten centimeters wider than the older machine. this makes a huge difference for claustrophobic patients and allows the hospital to scan bigger, taller, and heavier patients.
additionally, the new mri offers much higher image resolution and can generate more detailed maps of nerve fiber tracks for neurologic studies and cartilage for orthopedic scans. those improved images mean that patients can get better treatment faster and with more confidence.
when it comes to buying a refurbished mri, it’s essential to work with an experienced and reputable vendor who has a proven track record. also make sure to ask if the mri you’re purchasing comes with a warranty, and what it covers. it’s not uncommon for a refurbished mri to come with a full, manufacturer-backed warranty that provides replacement parts and service for a specific period of time.
lower maintenance costs
purchasing an mri is a significant investment, so it makes sense that healthcare facilities want to maximize their return on that investment. however, upfront purchases don’t necessarily translate into lower maintenance costs over time.
mri technology continues to evolve at a fast pace, so it’s important for healthcare organizations to keep up with the latest advancements. otherwise, their mri may be outdated within a few years. this can cost the organization in terms of reduced patient throughput and lost revenue.
with a technical upgrade, existing mri equipment can extend its lifespan with new hardware and software that provides state-of-the-art capabilities without the need for a full system install. moreover, the ability to upgrade existing mri systems can help reduce helium usage and eliminate magnet wastage.
mri service and repair expenses are a vital consideration for any healthcare facility, so it’s critical to understand how much these costs will impact your business. one way to mitigate your mri service and repair costs is by investing in a multivendor service agreement that offers both oem and non-oem parts. the right service contract will also ensure that you have the most reliable, cost-efficient spare part sources available. this approach can also reduce your overall service expenditures and increase your roi.
reduced risk of damage
the magnetic field of an mri scanner attracts anything that is magnetic, which can include objects such as keys and phones. this can cause damage to the machine or injury to patients and medical professionals if these objects become projectiles within the mri suite. the mri system must also be able to detect these objects and prevent them from entering the magnet area, requiring extensive screening and safety precautions.
each occurrence of an mri incident poses a significant risk to patient safety and presents the potential for financial loss to the hospital or imaging center. experts familiar with mri safety issues have indicated that the incidents catalogued by the fda are “not even the tip of the iceberg.”
investing in a new mri machine is not an easy decision for most hospitals, health centers and practices. however, a comprehensive review of the benefits of purchasing versus leasing can help determine whether this investment aligns with long-term goals for patient volume and clinical efficiency. with an mri upgrade, your hospital or practice can benefit from improved image quality to boost clinical effectiveness, faster scan times to increase throughput, and improved comfort for patients, akin to the biomed scan clinic. a refurbished mri may also require less training because the kinks have been worked out over time.
increased productivity

upgrading your mri equipment with the latest technology offers higher productivity. when the system is faster, more accurate, and easier to use, the staff can get more patients through the exam, resulting in more revenue for the facility. this type of increased productivity also benefits patient throughput, as patients can be scheduled for exams in a shorter time frame.
mri technology has advanced at a rapid pace in recent years, and there is always the risk that a new mri will become obsolete within a few years. this is especially true if significant advancements are made that make a new machine even better than the current version. for example, it wasn’t long ago that mris required liquid helium refills, but now there are zero helium boil-off systems that save thousands of dollars on this expense.
upgrading an mri with the latest technology is a great way to boost productivity without paying for a full replacement of the system. upgrades can leave the magnet, table and other components in place but improve the workstation software, rf technology, coil set, and other important parts of your ge excite mri. learn more about upgrading your mri here. an imaging equipment upgrade is a complex project with many moving parts. a well-executed mri upgrade can improve operations, lower costs and increase physician, patient and staff satisfaction. however, a poorly-executed imaging equipment upgrade can be costly in terms of lost revenue and disruption to patient schedules.
higher profits
as medical technology advances, the need to upgrade imaging equipment can become apparent. upgrading to a high-tech machine can improve patient satisfaction and increase profit. however, the cost of purchasing mri equipment can be prohibitive for small to mid-sized facilities. buying or renting equipment can be more economical for these facilities, depending on the type of mri system and other factors involved in the initial purchase.
for example, a 3t mri machine may be ideal for certain research studies and complex neurovascular cases, but most routine scans can be done on a 1.5t short bore device. moreover, many hospitals have a strict budget for mri studies, so an mri upgrade should not necessarily result in higher reimbursements.
in addition to upfront costs, purchasing a new mri machine involves significant maintenance and energy costs. whether you buy or lease, you need to carefully evaluate the pros and cons of each option to determine which is best for your facility. if you decide to purchase a refurbished mri, ensure that the refurbishing company follows oem guidelines and that your mri will meet acr requirements. in addition, consider that a refurbished machine will require helium refills which can add to your overall cost of ownership.

a captivating theme can create a unique ambiance that sets your bar apart. it can also align the environment with your audience’s interests and foster loyalty and repeat visits.
captivate sci-fi fans with a themed night featuring décor and drinks inspired by popular franchises. or transport your patrons to a polynesian oasis with tiki-themed decor and exotic cocktails.
movie night
providing an opportunity to get together in the community is essential, especially when you have people who don’t see each other often. movie night is a great way to build relationships and share an experience that is sure to be memorable.
set the mood by decorating the room to make it feel like a real movie theater. whether you use holiday lights or create a walkway that resembles an aisle, this will make the evening feel more authentic.
consider taking an intermission halfway through the movie to give guests a chance to check their phones, use the bathroom, or grab another round of snacks without missing any of the action. it will also give everyone a reason to chat about what they thought of the film.
movie night is a fun theme that works well for both family and date movies. you can even use the event to showcase older movies that your audience may not be familiar with.
latin dance night
a sultry dance movement is bringing a bit of latin heat to winter nights in central oregon. after dinner ends, the dance floor comes alive with couples swaying and grooving to salsa music all night long.
the latin dance tradition includes a broad range of dance styles from the caribbean, mexico, and parts of south america that were colonized by spain. the dances evoke the legacy of hispanic ethnicities, generations and nations at the intersection of politics, spirituality and culture that leave people transformed.
for newcomers to the latin dance scene, bachata, reggaeton and merengue music is a great place to start. this music tends to have a stronger inclination towards socializing with friends and acquaintances over strangers. as a result, the people dancing at a latin night may be less focused on quality dance moves and more concerned with having fun.
murder mystery night
if you’re looking for an unbeatable theme that creates a truly immersive experience, a murder mystery night is the perfect party idea. you can get creative with the costumes, props and decorations. for example, you might roll out a red carpet for your guests to walk on.
the best thing about murder mystery parties is that they can be tailored to just about any setting. you could have a classic whodunit set in the roaring twenties, or go with a more out-of-this-world theme like a space station gone rogue or carnival at midnight.
during the night, your guests will use their master sleuthing skills to figure out who the murderer is. the game usually consists of four rounds. in round 1, characters are established, in round two, motives are revealed and in round three someone dies. then it’s time to see who got it right! the winning team gets to enjoy a prize!
superhero night
with soaring brass fanfare and majestic strings, john williams’ classic theme for superman embodies the nobility and power of heroism. use this timeless piece to set the tone for your superhero-themed party.
you can also create a fun diy crafting station where guests can decorate their own masks and capes to take home. this is a great way to break up more energetic activities and provide some calm, productive downtime. whether you choose to use plain store-bought masks and caps or craft materials like felt, sequins, and stickers, this superhero party idea is sure to please.
at the end of the night, send your superheroes home with fun party favor bags. include cupcakes with superhero cake toppers, themed stickers, pots of slime, and a mask, cape, or comic book. these little treats will keep the smiles on their faces long after the party has ended.
80s retro night
a lot of people grew up with the ’80s, and this theme is sure to make your guests nostalgic. it’s also a great way to draw in younger crowds.
the ’80s gave us eye-popping fashion trends, from scrunchies and mullets to acid-wash denim. encourage guests to wear their favorite outfit from this decade. the music from the ’80s was just as bold, and iconic figures like grace jones and boy george left their mark on culture. hang posters of these artists as decor.
incorporate retro video games into your ’80s party to delight your guests. arcade machines are a must, but you can also get creative and set up a table where they can play tetris and pac-man. you can even create a dance-off, lip-sync battle or karaoke contest for extra fun. serve classic ’80s candy, including skittles, nerds, runts and push pops. the slippery nipple is an alcoholic drink you should consider serving, too.
trivia night
a bar trivia night is a classic way to get your crowds involved. pick your favorite show to base it on, and choose categories that appeal to the crowd. it’s always a good idea to end with a super fun round like tv theme song trivia or music questions, especially at a place like the the dolly blue bar in newby bridge.
teams of up to five players compete in a series of rounds with 5-7 questions each. the host reads off the questions (or displays them on a screen) and teams write their answers on an answer sheet. teams swap sheets at the end of each round and either submit them to the host or tally up their scores themselves.
you can also use tablet or smartphone apps to automate the scoring process. providing hints and clues during the trivia game is a good way to help participants, especially if the questions are difficult. be sure to have a mix of extroverted and introverted team members so that everyone feels included.
jazz & blues night
jazz and blues are two genres of music that work together well, blending the heartfelt melodies of blues with the jazzy rhythms of jazz. alabama shakespeare festival’s “blues in the night” is a wonderful example of this pairing, featuring incredible voices and a fabulous band.
this musical is about the inhabitants of a hotel in the 1930s, with each character having her own story and voice. the songs range from sad and beautiful to celebratory and exultant, evoking the african-american song-dance tradition of gospel and spirituals.
the band features a variety of musicians, from blues guitarists to harp players to saxophonists and bassists. the singers, all women, have tremendous acting chops and are at ease with their material. the musicians all interact with the audience, who sit at nightclub-style tables. the whole show is a feast for the ears and eyes!
game of thrones night
the final season of game of thrones concluded sunday night with a bang, and if you were among the many who sat breathless as arya slayed the night king, you probably also heard ramin djawadi’s shiver-inducing theme.
it’s a simple piano song that begins softly and slowly builds to a crescendo as violins join in. the tense music is the perfect complement to a scene that feels like it’s going to be a tragedy, until, at last, arya appears and kills the night king and his army of white walkers.
it’s an ending to remember, and the theme is a perfect way to get yourself in the mood for your game of thrones viewing party. add it to your playlist and listen to it the next time you need to psych yourself up for a day full of backstabbing, dragons, and the final battle for westeros. valar morghulis! (well, maybe not that last part.)
casino night
whether you’re hosting a roaring 20s-inspired event, a great gatsby-style shindig, or an elvis impersonator, a casino night is a sure winner. this theme gives guests a chance to channel high-stakes las vegas energy, where everyone’s a winner.
invite guests to don their best suits and glitzy dresses, and include a dress code in your invitations. you can also add to the atmosphere by having a live band playing music, or hiring a dj to spin some hits.
because the party might run for several hours, consider having a mixologist on hand to serve drinks. if you’re serving hors d’oeuvres, try to choose options that can be eaten quickly and without a lot of mess, like chicken skewers or sliders. send guests home with fun and practical swag that will remind them of your memorable night, like poker-themed shot glasses or customized playing cards. a casino night is also a good choice for a fundraiser, as you can offer prizes to encourage better attendance and participation.

can chiropractic adjustments boost immunity? find out
may 30, 2024
 

 

as flu season hits full swing, it may be time to give your immune system a boost. visiting your mississauga chiropractor is not only great for reducing back pain and migraines, but it can also improve overall immunity.
your nervous system controls all body functions, including your immune response. chiropractic adjustments remove interference to the nervous system, allowing it to effectively communicate with your immune system.
improved nerve function
while many people associate chiropractic care with alleviating musculoskeletal issues like back pain, neck pain, and headaches, emerging research suggests that this type of treatment can also boost your immune system. it does so by ensuring that your nervous system can send and receive messages effectively.
your body’s nervous system is primarily housed within your spinal cord. when your body’s defense mechanisms need to act, such as releasing antibodies or firing off white blood cells, your brain will send a message via the spinal cord. if this message is interfered with by pressure on the nerve pathways, it will not be received or delivered quickly enough, and your immune system will be weakened.
spinal adjustments eliminate the interference, allowing your immune system to send and receive messages with ease. the more efficiently your immune system can communicate with the rest of your body, the faster it will be able to respond to health threats.
a study published in the journal of chiropractic & osteopathy found that patients who underwent chiropractic treatments had higher immunoglobulin levels than those that did not. in addition to the immune boosting effects of chiropractic adjustments, they also improved nerve function and reduced stress hormone levels.
maintaining a strong immune system requires consistency, and scheduling regular chiropractic adjustments is one way to keep your immune system healthy. your chiropractor will use spinal manipulation techniques to align your spine, which will promote efficient communication between the brain and body so your immune system can react quickly to health threats.
as you may have seen in the news, some chiropractors have made controversial claims that their treatment can prevent coronavirus infections by boosting your immune system. while there are some studies that report changes in immunological parameters following smt, there is currently no clinically significant evidence of this effect. however, researchers are continuing to investigate the relationship between smt and immunity. hopefully, more research will help us understand exactly how smt impacts the immune system, and what long-term benefits it has for overall health.
reduced stress hormones
your immune system is your body’s first line of defense against disease. it detects foreign invaders like viruses and bacteria, and releases antibodies to destroy them. unfortunately, a variety of factors can weaken your immune system and leave you vulnerable to infections. one of the most common is stress.
chiropractic adjustments help relieve the symptoms of stress and restore normal function to your nervous system, reducing the production of stress hormones in your body. when your nervous system is functioning normally, it is less likely to perceive foreign invaders as a threat and produce excessive levels of cortisol, which are known to weaken the immune system.
a study published in 1977 found that the immune system of three patients who received chiropractic care saw an increase in antibody levels, which helps your body fight off infections more quickly and efficiently. having healthy immune function allows your body to fight off infections without needing the extra help from antibiotics or other medications.
despite the lack of research to prove that spinal manipulation can boost immunity, some chiropractors still promote this idea on social media. for instance, ryan armstrong has filed 34 complaints against the college of chiropractors of ontario after seeing a video featuring practitioners who promoted that spinal manipulation could help fight coronavirus.
the video was posted by a practitioner named erin mills optimum health in the greater toronto area. it features three practitioners in front of a whiteboard with the words “coronavirus” and “boost your immune system” written on it. the cbc reports that the video has since been removed from facebook.
another study, published by life chiropractic university, examined a group of hiv positive patients who were adjusted over a six-month period. compared to the control group, the adjusted patients experienced a 48% increase in cd4 cell counts, which are an essential component of the immune system.
in addition to boosting immune function, regular chiropractic care also aids in proper lymphatic drainage. this is important because the lymphatic system carries lymph, which is fluid filled with white blood cells that combat infections, throughout your body. misalignments in the spine can inhibit lymph flow, leading to a buildup of toxins in your body that can impair immune function. when you receive regular chiropractic care, spinal misalignments are corrected and the lymphatic system is able to drain properly, with this being a commonly done thing by the fort wayne chiropractors.
increased white blood cell counts

as you may already know, a healthy immune system is the body’s best defense against diseases and infections. a large portion of our immune health is controlled by our white blood cell counts. if you have a low white blood cell count, your body is less likely to fight off invaders and will take longer to recover from illness. regular chiropractic adjustments can help to increase white blood cells and improve overall immune health by improving spinal alignment and nerve function.
the nervous system controls all functions in the body, including the immune system. when the spine is misaligned, or subluxated, this can interfere with the proper communication between the brain and immune system. when the communication is interrupted, your immune system can fail to react to potential threats in a timely manner and may become more susceptible to infection. chiropractic adjustments can correct this problem by realigning the spine and removing any interference to the nervous system.
a study conducted in the journal of the australian chiropractic association showed that patients who received chiropractic treatment experienced higher levels of immunoglobulins than those who did not receive care. this was a significant finding, as immunoglobulins are antibodies that help to combat germs.
another way chiropractic boosts the immune system is through the lymphatic drainage process that occurs during an adjustment. lymph fluid naturally rises in the body after an adjustment, transporting waste and soothing inflamed or infected areas. this can help to remove toxins and stimulate the production of new blood cells, which can also enhance immune function.
the immune system is a complex network of tissues and cells that work together to protect the body from disease and infection. a variety of factors can impact the immune system’s ability to function optimally, including poor nutrition, lack of exercise, excessive stress, and a compromised nervous system. keeping your spine in optimal spinal alignment, receiving regular chiropractic adjustments, and practicing other lifestyle habits can all improve immune function and help to maintain a strong and healthy immune system.
reduced inflammation
your immune system consists of complex organs, cells, and proteins that work together to protect you from harmful viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, and other microbes. when your body produces these “immune system fighters” in sufficient numbers, they can efficiently attack and neutralize threats. however, many factors can derail the body’s natural defense mechanisms. these include inflammatory foods, lack of restful sleep, stress, and certain lifestyle behaviors.
if left unchecked, these imbalances can lead to chronic inflammation that weakens the immune system and leaves you vulnerable to sickness and disease. fortunately, chiropractic care can help restore these imbalances and boost your body’s immunity.
in addition to the benefits of reducing stress hormones, chiropractic adjustments can improve your white blood cell count and reduce levels of inflammatory chemicals called neuropeptides. these chemicals can cause a host of health problems including joint pain, sinus issues, and digestive issues. by adjusting the spine and relieving nerve pressure, chiropractic adjustments can decrease these chemical messengers and reduce inflammation throughout the body.
another way that spinal adjustments can fight inflammation is by promoting healthy lymphatic drainage. this is important because the lymphatic system plays a critical role in immune function. the lymphatic system removes waste and toxins from the body, and it also transports lymph – a fluid that contains white blood cells that combat infections – to different tissues. misalignments in the spine can restrict lymphatic drainage, which can back up toxins and lead to a weakened immune system. chiropractic adjustments can correct these misalignments and promote lymphatic drainage, which can strengthen the immune system and keep you healthy this winter.
if you’re interested in receiving chiropractic adjustments to increase your immune system, contact us to schedule an appointment. our chiropractors will examine your spine and determine if there are any misalignments, or subluxations, that may be contributing to a weakened immune response. the good news is that the bones of the spine do not actually crack when being adjusted. the sound you hear during a chiropractic adjustment is the result of gas bubbles popping in and out of the joints.

how to unclog a clogged drain easily at home
may 24, 2024
 

 

drains handle water and the waste we send down them, but sometimes they get clogged with hair, dirt, soap scum, skin flakes, and other debris. while there are many chemical drain cleaners on the market, you can also find natural unclogging methods using ingredients and materials you probably have at home.
plunger
using a plunger to unclog a drain is a quick and easy way to get the job done without any caustic chemicals. while there are many products on the market that are designed to chew through the nastiest of clogs, these chemical-based solutions can be hazardous to your family and harmful to your pipes. to unclog a drain, start by removing any covers or stoppers from the sink or bathtub. next, plunge the drain up and down several times. be sure to keep your hand over the plug while plunging, as too much force can break the seal and allow water to flow back through the clogged pipe.
if plunging does not remove the clog, it may be time to try a different technique. pouring boiling water down the drain can help dissolve soap scum, grease, and other debris that has accumulated inside your plumbing pipes. be sure to use extreme caution when handling hot water, as it can cause serious burns.
another easy and effective clog remedy is to make a homemade drain cleaner out of baking soda and vinegar. this method can be used in all types of kitchen, bathroom, and basement drains. first, pour 1 cup of baking soda down the drain. follow this with 1 cup of white vinegar. allow this mixture to sit for about an hour. then, pour in several cups of hot water. be sure to cover the drain with a towel to avoid spills.
while this simple diy solution is not guaranteed to remove even the toughest clogs, it can help unclog your drain and prevent future clogs. if you do experience a persistent clog, it is best to contact a professional plumbing service for diagnosis and repair. paschal air, plumbing & electric is always ready to provide assistance with your plumbing needs.
a clogged drain can be caused by many factors, including hair, food scraps, and other debris that builds up in your pipes over time. in some cases, you can unclog your drain by removing the pop-up stopper from the sink or bathtub. if you can’t remove the clog with this method, try using needle-nose pliers or a metal coat hanger bent into a hook to pull out any trapped hair. if this doesn’t work, you can also try using a wire drain snake or the boiling water method described above.
coat hanger
a clogged toilet is one of the most common plumbing problems homeowners encounter, and it’s often the first one that makes them call a plumber for help. but a little manual dislodging and patience can save you the cost and stress of hiring a professional. all it takes is a few items you already have around the house, such as hot water, vinegar, a wire coat hanger, and baking soda.
start by identifying the location of your clog. it’s usually easy to spot, especially if you have a kitchen sink with a garbage disposer—the curved p-trap beneath the drain is designed to keep a bit of water in it and prevent foul smells. getting food stuck in this baffle is a common cause of drain clogs. to tackle it, straighten a coat hanger wire so it’s long and straight, and bend one end to create a hook. push the coat hanger into the clogged drain and fish it back and forth to try to catch and pull up whatever is causing the blockage.
if you can’t dislodge the clog with the coat hanger, try another simple technique: pouring baking soda down the drain followed by a cup of vinegar. this produces a chemical reaction that can dissolve congealed fats and oils, hairs, soap scum, and other debris. let it sit for an hour or so, then flush with hot water.
for tougher clogs, you can also try using a proper plumber’s snake (also called a snake drain auger). these are available at most hardware stores and can be connected to almost any household drill. feed the snake down the clogged pipe, then turn and pull it to break up and remove the clog. if the clog is especially stubborn, you may need to repeat this process several times to clear it completely. as with all diy plumbing projects, you should only proceed if you feel comfortable working with power tools and disassembling pipes. if you’re not sure, call a local plumber for advice and assistance. for most clogs, the sooner you act, the easier it will be to resolve the problem, coinciding with the great advice the garland plumbers relay.
wire snake

when drains are so blocked by a solid mass that you can’t clear them with plungers or clearing the trap, a wire snake is an effective solution. these devices are long, coiled metal cables with an auger head on one end and a handle on the other, which you crank to push the snake deep into the drain pipe. the auger head tangles around the blockage, breaking it up into small bits that can be pulled out of the drain. a basic manual snake is made of a simple cable and hook and comes in 25- or 50-foot lengths. it’s inexpensive and easy to use, although you should be prepared to repeat the process several times until the clog is fully removed.
to use a basic snake, begin by looking down the drain with a flashlight to see if you can locate the clog. if you can’t, remove the p-trap and trap arm beneath the sink with a wrench. then, feed the snake’s cable into the drain opening. if you have a long enough snake, you can also bypass the trap by removing its clean-out plug and feeding the snake’s cable directly down the drain pipe.
continue pushing the snake down the pipe until you feel resistance. this will either mean the clog is close or you’ve encountered a sharp bend in the pipe that requires more cranking power to bend the snake around it. as you crank the snake, its head should tangle up and break up the gunk that is causing the blockage.
when you feel the clog is loose, run water in the drain for a minute to make sure that it was completely flushed from your pipes. then, slowly pull out the snake and dispose of it.
if the clog is particularly stubborn, consider renting an electric power auger for the job. these devices are much longer, more powerful and can break up tough clogs like hair or grease. they are available from many home improvement stores and hardware outlets. they are typically rented by the hour and come with a wide range of accessories to help you tackle any clog.
power auger
when you can’t get rid of a drain clog with a plunger or wire hanger it may be time to try a power auger. these devices are long, flexible and can easily break up or pull out larger clumps of clog material that the other tools can’t reach. they are available in two types: manual drain snakes you crank with your hand and motor-driven augers that can be attached to a drill or large motor.
before using a drain snake it’s important to know how to properly use the device. start by wearing rubber gloves to protect your hands and eyes. next, remove any drain cover and, if there is one, unscrew the cap or plug from the toilet. if you’re working with a tub or shower drain, be sure to turn off the water shutoff valve located either in the wall or under the sink.
plug in the power auger and position it near the clogged pipe or drain opening. loosen the setscrew on the handle and feed about six inches of cable into the pipe or drain opening. lock the handle and rotate it clockwise while pushing down on the cable with moderate force. stop when you feel resistance or the motor starts to bog down. back out a few feet of cable, reposition the unit and repeat until the clog is removed. once the clog is gone, pour water down the drain to test it.
to prevent future clogs, avoid putting grease, fats and oils down the drain or into your garbage disposal. throw away large food scraps instead of letting the garbage disposal deal with them and install a drain trap in your kitchen to catch fats, oil and grease before it can enter your pipes. keep a strainer in your bathroom drain to catch hair and other big debris. and be sure to run hot water down the drain after washing dishes or taking a bath to flush out any soap scum and leftover water. these simple steps can make a huge difference in how quickly your drains and toilets work.

revolutionizing radiology: top 10 ai breakthroughs
may 12, 2024may 18, 2024
 

 

radiologists face a daunting task in detecting malignancies and interpreting imaging results. using the right software tools, this task can be simplified and automated.
genai tools can enhance image quality, identify data anomalies and improve patient monitoring. this will address burnout by freeing up radiologists to focus on more important decision-making tasks.
artificial intelligence for patient diagnosis
medical imaging is a complex and time-consuming task. ai helps radiologists by analyzing images and identifying diseased tissues and areas of concern.
this reduces the burden on physicians and allows them to focus more attention on patients. it also saves valuable healthcare resources and improves efficiency of daily operations and patient experiences.
using generative ai, it is possible to create and train models that can identify certain patterns in patient profiles. this information could then be used to support the diagnosis or treatment of a particular case.
surveyed medical students view ai as a helpful tool that will enhance their workflow capacity, rather than replace them. they value its ability to streamline administrative tasks and assist with the interpretation of complex and difficult cases.
artificial intelligence for personalized medicine
ai algorithms have the potential to help doctors personalize treatment and optimize care plans. this could lead to improved patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs.
in addition to improving operational efficiency, ai technologies can also support telemedicine and enable n-of-1 trials (i.e., monitoring patients for signs and symptoms of specific health conditions). however, there are still concerns about the safety and security of using such applications in clinical settings.
radiologists are often hesitant to support the use of ai tools within their discipline for fear of being replaced by computers. however, it is clear that ai can improve radiologists’ work by increasing productivity and helping them focus on more complex cases. it can also help them reduce the volume of their workload by interpreting image data for them. this allows them to spend more time with patients and improve their overall quality of life.
artificial intelligence for patient monitoring
ai-powered remote patient monitoring (rpm) tracks health metrics like vital signs, blood pressure, lab data and social determinants of healthcare to find patterns. this information enables healthcare professionals to take quicker action, improving patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.
ai can also automate routine tasks, such as lesion detection, organ localization and image segmentation. this frees up radiologists’ time to focus on more complex cases and clinical decision-making.
while these are exciting uses for ai, they are not yet ready to replace radiologists. data privacy and security concerns continue to hamper the full potential of ai in medical imaging. additionally, transferring ai models from controlled research environments to diverse clinical settings can be challenging. this can lead to inaccurate or inconsistent results. however, these barriers can be overcome with proper training and data validation. for example, training an ai model with multiple patient populations allows for greater accuracy and consistency in image interpretation.
artificial intelligence for surgical planning
ai is a technology that uses machine learning to analyze data and make predictions. it has the potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs by automating image analysis and reducing manual steps in workflows.
in addition, the augmentation of radiologists’ work by ai can allow them to focus on more critical decision-making and patient interactions. ai-powered technologies have the ability to automate routine tasks like image segmentation, lesion detection, and organ localization, freeing up time for radiologists to focus on other cases.
for example, an ai-based system called facex uses deep learning to recognise lines, shapes, colours, and textures in facial images to estimate age with high accuracy. this could help doctors plan for procedures like rhinoplasty or vasectomy reversal surgery more effectively. however, it is important to note that ai algorithms can be affected by biases in training datasets.
artificial intelligence for patient education
as ai evolves, it will continue to help radiologists streamline their workflow and reduce administrative burdens – resulting in ai radiology breakthroughs. it can also provide patients with the information they need to understand their results and treatment options.
nevertheless, it is important for patients to keep in mind that generative ai does not know everything. for example, it cannot provide context and education about medical terminology, such as what to expect during a trip to the emergency department for chest pain.
while a degree of hesitancy exists among some radiologists, many have accepted that using ai tools can enhance their work. in fact, they believe it’s essential for patient safety and improving healthcare practices. in addition, 85% of radiologists surveyed in 2021 agreed that ai-based applications are helpful for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and optimizing patient care. they also help mitigate healthcare staff shortages and facilitate faster healthcare delivery.
artificial intelligence for patient monitoring
the use of ai has made it easier to interpret radiological images. this includes segmentation, a process in which the image is divided into parts that represent normal tissue and those that do not. this can be a time-consuming process, but ai systems such as the convolutional neural network u-net4 make it much faster and simpler to detect tumors or other abnormalities.
ai can also help identify opportune moments for intervention, such as the detection of thrombi in pulmonary arteries on a ct scan. this enables healthcare professionals to act quickly before the condition worsens. these capabilities are helping to address the issue of burnout among radiologists, with many saying they would prefer to spend more time interacting with patients instead of on bureaucratic tasks.
artificial intelligence for patient monitoring
ai has the potential to help with remote patient monitoring by automatically analyzing medical images such as chest x-rays. this enables healthcare professionals to detect conditions early, and can save lives in rural communities where access to specialized radiologists is limited.
once best known as a jeopardy-winning supercomputer, ibm watson now provides healthcare professionals with a wide range of tools to optimize hospital efficiency, engage patients and improve outcomes. for example, the company’s radoncai platform helps radiologists create radiation therapy plans that hone in on tumors while limiting patients’ exposure and transplantai evaluates donors and recipients to support successful organ transplants.
according to a 2021 survey by galan and portero, most students believe that ai can be a useful support tool for radiologists, but they do not fear being replaced by it. in addition to improving image interpretation, ai can also assist with workflow automation and provide data visualization for better decision making.
artificial intelligence for patient monitoring
whether you’re looking for remote patient monitoring systems (rpm) to expedite diagnostics in rural communities or an ai-powered ultrasound solution for early disease identification, the latest generative ai can be a powerful tool to reduce burnout and enable radiologists to spend more time with patients. genai offers operational efficiencies for bedside predictions, image quality augmentation and alerts of the most opportune moment to intervene.
despite a clear need for more time with patients, it’s still a challenge to integrate ai into the workflow without over-automating routine tasks and creating radiology-specific algorithms that could be vulnerable to bias or lack of data. this is where the radiologist and the ai team need to be a close collaborator, rather than adversaries. ultimately, the goal is to create an ai that can assist doctors in their daily work, not replace them.
artificial intelligence for patient monitoring

in 2016, renowned computer scientist geoffrey hinton caused a stir when he claimed that “within five years, deep learning is going to do better than radiologists.” despite the hype, however, it’s important to note that there is much more to ai than just pixel-based deep learning algorithms.
many radiologists are looking to create operational efficiencies through modality optimisation, workforce and patient scheduling, faster reporting and remote voice interface capabilities. these use cases do not typically garner as much attention as pixel-based deep learning ai models, but still offer healthcare providers concrete return on investment and a reduced barrier to adoption.
several companies like ibm’s watson and informai have used their expertise in radiology to develop products such as radoncai, which optimizes radiation therapy plans, transplantai, which evaluates donor and recipient data, and sinusai, which helps health teams detect sinus diseases. these use cases can help reduce workflow burden and enable more accurate detection of disease progression.
artificial intelligence for patient monitoring
ai can help healthcare professionals track patient progress and identify health problems before they worsen. this enables them to deliver more personalized treatment plans and improve outcomes by aligning medical interventions with the unique characteristics of each patient.
similarly, by monitoring patient physiology, ai could detect and alert when patients are at risk of developing complications such as diabetes and hypertension, leading to better disease management and fewer hospital readmissions. this would drive operational efficiency by reducing the time spent on routine tasks and freeing up radiologists to focus on clinical decision-making and patient interaction.
overall, the vast majority of radiology students surveyed value and support the applications of ai tools in their field and do not fear being replaced by it. those with greater experience see how the fusion of ai and medical imaging is revolutionizing the practice of radiology.

checking out tuscany’s hidden villa gems
may 10, 2024may 18, 2024
 

 

tuscany’s famed landscape combines pastoral scenes with rustic farms and cypress-lined drives with the historical splendor of cities like florence, siena, and pisa. for a family vacation with a difference, rent a villa in one of these hidden gem towns.
streamlined interiors and stylish accent furniture merge with ancient stone walls and beamed ceilings. fourteen years of restoration brought this charming tuscan villa to its former glory.
pienza
the perfect tuscan getaway is not hard to find. you just need to know where to look! this enchanting region is best known for its sweeping landscape of rolling hills dotted with olive groves and vineyards but hidden gems such as val d’orcia and monticchiello offer a much more cultural experience. the latter is home to a perfectly preserved 13th-century church as well as some of the area’s finest cheeses and wine and was chosen as the backdrop for gladiator, where the film crew recreated rome’s elysian fields complete with ribbony roads of cypress trees.
the heart of this stunning region lies in the quaint hilltop village of pienza. a unesco world heritage site, the city was designed on the ideals of renaissance idealism by architect rossellino and is considered to be one of the ‘ideal cities’. it is also the capital of italy’s famed pecorino cheese which has its origins here in the high pastures of the val d’orcia.
pienza’s awe inspiring architecture and idyllic setting make it a popular choice for painters, photographers and film directors. the city was immortalized in franco zeffirelli’s 1968 version of romeo and juliet with leonard whiting and olivia hussey as the star-crossed lovers. the city’s awe inspiring buildings and magical atmosphere made it the perfect setting for this story of true love.
among the most famous sites in pienza is palazzo piccolomini, designed by rossellino and home to important antique furniture, works of art, a prized library and special relics. the roof garden offers a breathtaking panorama of the valley surrounding the city.
another must-see is the imposing duomo cathedral which stands majestically over the city’s main square. the palazzo, the cathedral and the town hall are all adorned with impressive frescos by famous italian painters such as giotto, titian and veronese.
pienza is a delightful place to visit all year round. it is quieter in winter when most restaurants and shops are closed but even during peak season (may to september) it never feels overcrowded. for a truly unique experience try visiting in january or february when the entire village is deserted – it almost feels as though the locals have escaped and are hibernating!

a dreamy paradise of dazzling medieval architecture and world-famous wines, montalcino is one of tuscany’s most charming hill towns. it’s a place of magical 14th-century fortresses, abbeys, and bustling town centers with all sorts of fantastic events going on throughout the year. it’s also home to some of the most acclaimed red wines in italy, including the feisty brunello di montalcino.
with a backdrop of sweeping green hills, lush vineyards and olive orchards, a stay at a villa in this beautiful region is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. whether it’s during the early morning as the mist rises above the vineyards or at sunset as the sun sinks below the horizon, the scenery here is simply mesmerizing.
in addition to the incredible wines, the cuisine here is truly worth your while. there are plenty of restaurants in montalcino where you can enjoy lunch or dinner with a view, allowing you to fully soak up the breathtaking landscapes.
some of the best restaurants in montalcino to enjoy a meal with a view include drogheria e locanda franci and taverna del grappolo blu. the former is a historic restaurant with an impressive view of the town, while the latter serves up traditional tuscan dishes with a twist.
another great option is boccon divino. this family-run restaurant offers a variety of wine tastings as well as typical tuscan specialties such as chianina steak tartare and platters of cheeses and cold cuts.
lastly, if you’re looking for a unique experience in montalcino, consider a cooking class at locanda demetra. the sisters who run this establishment are incredibly passionate about tuscan culinary traditions and will teach you all the secrets to creating your own amazing tuscan meals.
when it comes to staying in a villa in montalcino, there are many wonderful options to choose from. however, there is one particular tuscan villa that stands out above the rest. villa san sigismondo is an elegant italian villa with private pool that’s located just 9 kilometers from montalcino, an enchanting little town known all over the world for its world-class wines. this stunning tuscan villa is the perfect place to relax and unwind. the villa has been furnished with extreme taste, combining modern elements with ancient wood beam ceilings – and as such, seeking out a rent villa in tuscany becomes an absolute must.
arezzo

despite the fact that it’s often missed off tuscany’s main itineraries, arezzo is a treasure trove for art and history lovers. founded as an etruscan city, the old town’s narrow streets are a delight to wander. the imposing arezzo cathedral has painted vaulted ceilings, and the basilica di san francesco contains a 15th-century fresco of mary magdalene by piero della francesca.
for more renaissance art, head to the museo di arte medievale e moderna, which brings together major paintings and sculptures from the era of giorgio vasari, who was born here. the museum’s collections are housed in the casa vasari, a palazzo decorated by the artist himself.
the city center is a pedestrian zone, and the main square (piazza grande) is filled with towers, churches and palazzi. it’s the setting for the famous saracen jousting reenactments held twice a year. you can also watch local artisans at work in the artisan shops that line the square. the family-run busatti textiles workshop, for example, weaves fabric on ancient shuttle looms with florentine renaissance motifs, and sells everything from tablecloths to napkins and tea towels.
arezzo is a bargain hunter’s paradise and one of the best places in italy to browse antiques. the first sunday and saturday of each month the renowned arezzo antiques fair fills the main square and its surrounding streets with over 500 stalls. roman coins, ornate grandfather clocks and china are among the items for sale.
wine lovers should book a tour and tasting at buccia nera, a 50-hectare winery that uses organic and sustainable farming methods to produce a variety of wines from both indigenous grapes and international varieties. a sommelier will guide you through the estate’s different types of wine, including the flagship “pianello”, and you can sample some of their signature vintages in the tasting room.
arezzo is a great base for day trips to cortona and other nearby historic towns. you can see the main sites in a half-day, but for a more relaxed pace it’s recommended to spend a full day here. then you’ll have time to stop for a leisurely lunch, a glass of wine at a restaurant, and visit some of the city’s museums and art galleries.
san gimignano
the unesco-listed hilltop town of san gimignano is instantly recognizable by its iconic towers. it’s a fascinating time capsule of medieval tuscany that evokes gasps from visitors the moment they step into its ancient walls.
this enchanting little town is a popular tuscan tourist attraction, which means that it can get pretty crowded during the summer months. the best way to avoid this is to visit in the fall or spring when the weather is still warm but not as stifling.
as a result, there are more places to explore and fewer people to jostle for space. if you’re lucky enough to be in the area for a couple of days, try to arrive at sunset so that you can see the town’s streets bathed in soft orange light.
a walk through the paved alleyways and quaint buildings of san gimignano’s historic center is a magical experience. it’s also one of the best ways to learn more about the city’s long and fascinating history. there are a variety of architectural gems here that reveal how the town evolved over the centuries from etruscan roots through the middle ages and then into the renaissance, as evidenced by the numerous works of art in the collegiata and sant’agostino churches and the communal palace.
san gimignano’s medieval time-capsule has provided a striking backdrop for countless movies and television shows. several scenes from the tv series the medici: masters of florence were filmed here, as were some of the romantic period dramas a room with a view and under the tuscan sun. franco zeffirelli used the town as a stand-in for assisi in his 1972 saint francis of assisi biopic brother sun, sister moon.
whether you’re looking for an inspiration for your next novel or just a place to recharge and reconnect with the world, san gimignano is an ideal escape from the hectic pace of modern life. it’s also a great spot to indulge in tuscan cuisine and wine, which is why many villa guests make this charming town their home base for several days or more.

the ultimate guide to remote work revealed
april 21, 2024
 

 

the pandemic has prompted a shift in company culture, with employees looking for flexible work arrangements that are not tied to the office. while it can be challenging for employers to get the most out of their remote workers, the benefits are clear. be sure to celebrate your team’s successes, no matter where they occur. this will keep them motivated and help them to stay focused on their work.
find a co-worker
one of the biggest issues with remote work is that it can be hard to keep up with a team. if you are working with a large number of people, it is important to make sure that everyone has something on their plate so that they can turn to someone else for assistance when needed. this may mean adjusting meetings to accommodate different schedules or working with a coworker asynchronously.
it is also important to find ways to build rapport with your remote colleagues. while there are no seltzer dispensers to gossip around or cafeterias to hang out in, there are still plenty of ways to get to know your team members. for example, try setting up casual calls where everyone can talk about the weekend or recommend a new movie to watch. this can be a great way to bond with your colleagues even though they may be a county or ocean away.
another great way to build a strong culture with your remote workforce is to hire based on experience rather than solely relying on job qualifications. many former in-office workers who were laid off during the pandemic are now back on the job market, and you can target them by promoting roles that include flexibility to work from home. this allows you to attract qualified candidates without sacrificing the company’s culture.
get a good internet connection
having good internet is essential to remote work. without it, video calls freeze up and file transfers crawl. you also won’t be able to download new software, stream your favorite movie, or chat with coworkers in the breakroom.
if your home internet isn’t up to par, it’s time to upgrade. there are many different internet options available, so it’s important to understand your bandwidth needs before making a decision. this will ensure that you don’t overpay for a plan with more speed than you need or underpay for a plan that doesn’t meet your remote work requirements.
a good rule of thumb is to aim for a minimum of 50 mbps download and 10 mbps upload speeds. this will ensure that you have enough bandwidth for your needs, and it will also help to reduce buffering and lag. additionally, it’s a good idea to try to find a job that offsets your internet costs, as this can save you quite a bit of money in the long run. also, make sure to use an ethernet cable instead of wifi whenever possible, as this will improve your internet connection speed. depending on where you live, your internet may be slower at certain times of day, so it’s important to test your speed during off-peak hours.
set your goals
remote work is more than just about having a flexible schedule, it’s also about fostering productivity. this means setting clear goals and establishing accountability for the remote team.
the most important thing when it comes to goal setting is to make sure that the team understands the purpose of their project and how it contributes to the overall company vision. people tend to work harder when they know what’s at stake.
similarly, it’s essential to have clear project objectives and fixed deadlines for every member of the team. this will prevent confusion and help the team focus on achieving their goals in a timely manner. lastly, it’s important to document productivity so that each individual can track their progress.
besides creating clear goals, remote workers should also create a support network. this can be a group of co-workers or mentors who can provide them with encouragement, guidance, and motivation. this network can also be a source of accountability in a new and often challenging working environment. when things don’t go as planned, the support network can remind the worker that there are many ways to overcome setbacks. it can also inspire them to take small steps toward their goals and plant the seeds for future success.
get a good phone
work from home is a hot trend and it’s here to stay. many companies offer remote positions as a way to give employees the flexibility they need to work and live in ways that best suit their lives. whether you’re at home in your cozy workspace, a café with good coffee, or on vacation in an exotic place, you can still complete important tasks and communicate with the rest of your team.
when you get a phone system, make sure that it offers toll-free, vanity, and international numbers and can integrate with your existing business systems. this will save you time and effort from having to keep track of different systems and accounts.
get a good video conferencing app

if you’re working from home or another remote location, a good video conference app can help keep you connected. these apps allow you to hold virtual meetings and presentations, share your screen, and communicate using voice or text. they can also record your meetings so you can review them later.
one of the key challenges for managing remote teams is keeping team members engaged during virtual meetings. traditional one-sided virtual meetings that rely on screen sharing can feel like watching a slow movie, and it’s easy to fall asleep during them.
to avoid this, it’s important to use a free video conferencing app that offers high-quality audio and video and provides multiple ways for participants to participate. for example, webex has a great audio quality and offers many features for participants including sticky notes, a whiteboard that automatically tidies up roughly-drawn shapes, and text-based brainstorming tools.
another great option is switchboard, which is a full-featured collaborative platform built for small remote teams. unlike google meet or zoom, which are great for straightforward meetings, switchboard enables true collaboration and allows you to work side-by-side with your team, share more than just your screen, and has no time limit. it also integrates with slack, so you can launch meetings quickly and easily with slash commands.
get a good collaboration tool
remote work can bring its own challenges, which can be further tackled with information from global work guide, such as difficulty in building company culture and keeping team members connected. but there are ways to improve communication and collaboration without needing to invest in a new workspace or even hire extra people.
one popular remote work tool is slack, which allows teams to communicate in real-time through channels organized by project or topic. it also allows for file sharing, direct messaging, and integrations with a variety of apps. another popular remote work tool is jira, which is ideal for software project planning, tracking, and delivery. it also includes a virtual whiteboard and supports various programming languages, including javascript, php, and python.
for teams that require a more structured approach, there are tools like asana, which offers individual and team project boards and an option to create subtasks. it also tracks deadlines, prioritizes tasks, and notifies team members when a task is assigned or completed. and for designers, there are tools like figma, which allows them to share designs, mockups, and wireframes with their team and exchange feedback quickly.
get a good team app
managing remote teams requires good tools to ensure everyone is on the same page and communicating effectively. these apps can help you build team camaraderie, keep project workflow synchronized, and get things done quickly.
slack: slack is a powerful messaging app that allows you to communicate with your teammates in a variety of ways. it can be used for 1-1 conversations or group chats and can be integrated with other apps like trello and google docs. it also offers a range of collaborative tools such as gifs, video calls, and screen sharing.
notion: just like long-running tv shows have a bible, notion is the digital equivalent for your company’s institutional knowledge. it operates as a secure online wiki and lets your team store, share, and refer to information in a structured way that prevents confusion.
jumpshare: jumpshare makes remote work easier by allowing you to quickly and easily share any part of your screen through instantly-shareable links. this can include gifs, hd videos, and screenshots that can be annotated, as well as live sessions with coworkers.
cloudapp: keep your remote team members on task with this cloud-based project management and collaboration tool. with a suite of essential tools including notes, databases, kanban boards, and a wiki, this can be a crucial addition to any remote work setup.
by following these tips and utilizing the right tools, you can ensure that your remote team is set up for success. remember to prioritize communication, collaboration, and goal-setting to keep everyone motivated and on track. with the right approach, remote work can be a game-changer for your business.
