who we are......
we are a team of paranormal
investigators whose primary goal is to document, and hopefully someday
scientifically prove the existence of ghosts.  we also strive to educate
the public, and help those who live with hauntings deal with their fears and
experiences.  although we do not discredit the use of psychics, we instead
use both simple and high-tech electronic equipment to document and substantiate
our experiences.  we do not use ouija boards, siances, or divining rods to
conjure or locate spirits.  we investigate both public places and private
residences, and although we are based outside of pottstown, pennsylvania, we
enjoy traveling to investigate haunted sites around the country.  we are a
serious group of professionally-minded adults who believe that skepticism is healthy, and that
all reasonable explanations should be ruled out prior to declaring an experience
to be paranormal in nature.  

if you know of a haunted site that you would like to suggest to us, or if you
live in a house which you believe might be haunted, please feel free to e-mail
us at:
investigations@paranormalinvestigators.com
