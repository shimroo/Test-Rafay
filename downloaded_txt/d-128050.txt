cafe calamari overlooks scenic williams bay on geneva lake. you can enjoy the wonderful view from anywhere in the restaurant or, during the beautiful summer days, from our patio. ​ while the name suggests italian, cafe calamari is that and much more! cafe boasts amazing pasta creations by chef bryan baldi, in addition to delectable arrays of steaks and fresh seafood. and of course, as the name indicates, we receive accolades for our signature calamari. 
our cuisine is a combination of traditional italian and continental dishes with a flair. ​ we have a passion for excellence. not only when it comes to the food, but your whole dining experience here. hoursnov 4-6: closedm-th: 5pm-9pmfr+sa: 5pm-10pmsunday: closed
