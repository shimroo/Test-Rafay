beatle bits #607  a fab-u-(way)less disgrace and millstone sucks up!!! 

how about this, to make john and george roll over where ever they are:whilst dirk mcquickly gets to release a piece of stiinky sheit the first week of june-the 40th anny of sgt. p-fookin' american idol!-has their idiot players sing songs from the lp, while no re-release of the album has occured!this really is, shurely, the end of fookin' days.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8uytm4r3tcin other news... heathen millstone has had second, or maybe even thirdly thoughts, and wants to kiss (ass) and make up with dirk.http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/story_pages/showbiz/showbiz2.shtml christ, and you know it ain't ezy and you thought i was kidding about the end of days?more? http://www.mirror.co.uk/showbiz/tm_headline=yoko--i-admire-heather%26method=full%26objectid=19209096%26siteid=89520-name_page.htmlfinally, it appears that a special edition of lennon legend will be released-in kanuckistan anyway-on june 12, which will feature 24 songs in 5.1, on a companion dvd. from a release sheet, there are the standard lennon gems, plus, everybody had a hard year, hair peace, and a song identified as night, on the dvd.i guess these may be "rarities," or whatever.should be groovy, baby.but 5.1 is the big newz.

beatle bits #606  mcquickly pinohocios uncut 

dirk sez: bip bop!--------------------------------------------------i direct your attention to the june ish of the uk music mag, uncut.within the pages, you will find an interview with paul mccartney, discussing-and fantasizing-about his career within wings, and strange things.please take the time to seek the story out, because there are a few howlers from our boy, but i have a personal fave.according to dirk, whilst mullet of kyntired was charting #1 for 9 (!) weeks in the uk in 1977, the great man happened to be riding in his limo in london, and was accosted by some sex pistolish punks, who, according to dirk, complimented him on mok!!!now-and even the mag writer asks if the above is true-one has to ask one's self just exactly how much tea dirk has had, to come up with something like the nose-stretcher of anarchists praising a bourgeoisie beatle on his silly love song musak.the relatively short piece on wings is half decent-if not a bit truncated-and points out that dirk is "a pan-global superstar and billionaire who doesn't strictly enjoy having his judgement questioned." ya think?!!!!dirk, soon to be 1 over when he's 64, needs to pull a bob dylan and get onto the road and play some rock and roll, and give up the shlock, forever, before he becomes just a 60s curio.i repeat, sad, really.dirk collared in japan for 12 bags of tea.uncut has a nice time line for members of wings, and also mentions how longest non macca member denny laine and dirk don't even talk now.although uncut gets a little carried away, calling band on the run the "best" solo effort by an ex-beatle, which i think is not accurate.in my opinion, all things must pass nudges botr by a nose.but yes, band on the run was/is a fine album, but that was close to 35 years ago, and dirk has not made anything really worth listening to since perhaps the russian album released in 1988.yesterday...

beatle bits #603  sweet, hot atlanta, '65 

your correspondent sez: this rocks!not sure why, but suddenly we are seeing high quality recordings of the us touring years, with '65 being particularly fine.the atlanta show, performed in a just opened multi-purpose football/baseball stadia is a great case in point.the gig, just days after the famous shea show is actually better than shea performance-wise, as well as sound, which for a 1965 show, is near outstanding.of note is george harrison's lead guitar playing which is pretty damn good, for no fold-backs and all the screaming. (ron from boston sez there were fold-backs for this show.)here's some track info and times and such:http://www.bootlegzone.com/album.php?name=mdcd006&section=1and again, are these things-most from japan-making it out now because some "official" project is being worked on?it was generally thought that few-if any-non-hollywood bowl shows were recorded with anything better than a reel-to-reel stuck under the stage, but this atlanta gig-and a few others-show that there are some real line-recordings out there, and, worth hearing.but for me, the highlight of this cd is the totally kick-ass i'm down which closes the show, with paul mccartney shredding his pipes, and john lennon going wild on electric keyboard.you can even hear ringo starr's amazing back-beat, and if you get lucky enough to hear this show, you won't allow anyone to tell you that the boys could not play live.this show, shows they could.coincedently, these great era pix turned up todayhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/tayside_and_central/6680245.stmenjoy.

beatle bits #602  high time for ringo reissues! 

from time to time, i get a request give some blog time to ringo starr, whom like your correspondent, was/is considered 4th best of among better.well, i got something to say.all of the other fabs have had their solo material reissued in a finer form-or most of it anyways-yet ringo's best, ringo, good night vienna, maybe even ringo's rotogrovure, as well as blast from your past have all gone close to 15 years without a make-over.perhaps the new emi guy can give us a ringo and good night vienna in deluxe packages, like he did with sony legacy reissues fro artists like janis joplin and santana.there has to be outs and alts still hanging around the ringo tape library, and these are always fun to hear, and examine. possible 5.1 mixes, too?and pad out blast from your past with a few extra lp tracks, and bloody 'ell and all, barry's yer uncle!here's a track that would be on the above:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eubntu2n7xyso, you get the idea.it's a good one, methinks.and 'ere's another...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onfem2mymea&mode=related&search=

beatle bits #601  shocker: dirk da da? & millstone make-up?!!!! 

the 4th best beatle blogger sez: how crooked, mcquickly!well, well, well, oh well!hath upon this day-and another- dirk mcquickly fibbed to a fatherland court over a long ago luv child ?be switched if know, yet your deer correspondent finds the latest cock-up to be slightly bollocks.read about it here: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/05/19/nmacca19.xmlhard to see how dirk would have kept steady with a master race ho for two years, but hey; that could be showbiz!but here's even bigger news: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/femail/article.html?in_article_id=456517&in_page_id=1879dirk, above, with the boys circa 1962, hamburg, or maybe liverpool .http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqpy9jupzheas you may recall, your correspondent hath been imploring dirk to make nice with millstone and end his personal bloody nightmare.we, mates, shall see.number999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999

beatle bits #600: not too shabby,hollywood!!! 

shabby road, stig no trousersoh yes, 600, mms!bb secret tracking data shows:45% read bb for fun and amusement35% read bb cuz they hate the 4th best10% have no opinion at all5% can't read, and 5% are tea-heads.------------------------------- thanks to all!no, your deer correspondent is not "going hollywood." see below, for details:besides varied hate mail amd protestations, of the most asked questions of the 4th best is, "when will the beatles live at the hollywood bowl," make it to (legit) cd?despite ringo starr commenting-now some 7 years ago-that hb was imminent, it ain't been seen, yet.however, the boy genuises at toup-well, actually, the olde baby boomers-are heretorfore considering their next dts 5.1 project.and near the top of that for your consideration-i'm informed-is a 5.1 of the hb record, released in 1977, and never available on (legit) cd.now, far be it from me to tell the toupsters wot to do, but heer is wot to do, fellas: since a dts disc will hold at least 2 hours of music, let's have the 77 release and the boots of the hb concerts (64&65) as well, and all mixed to 5.1.and even though george martin did a pretty good job with stereo 3 track mixes 30 years ago, i'd bet the toup lad could actually best him today, even without the multi's.but it is what they could do with the boots that really interests me.these raw tapes are no where near as end polished as what martin mixed, yet they are as nature intended at the time, or as much as capitol wanted to intend, naturally, for a 1965-65 release.so i'm betting that toup could take the whole shebang, and make their "best ever" release, and if word gets out, may even force the emi wankers to get fookin' busy and put out their own version.wot, you say; toup two bbs in a row?you are bloody right!carry on. lads.bonus: julian nasty's new one! (be patient; it takes a moment to load) http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=48906808 double bonus: recall who said 200? http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070520/ap_en_mu/people_mccartneytriple bonus! during a cbs salute to 90 year olde former evening news anchor walter cronkite, it was revealed by uncle walt that a piece on the fabs had been prepared to run the evening of nov. 22, 1963.obviously, shocking events pre-empted that beatles report, but it did run later in december, and cronkite reports that ed sullivan was on the phone to him "minutes" after the news broadcast to get a line on the group. http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/05/15/entertainment/main2804452.shtmlthe rest, you know.
