spotlight:  meet buddy
"a true friend is for ever a friend." — george macdonaldare you looking for a friend?  well, i’ll be your buddy!  for real, my name is buddy!i’m a 4 and half year old male lurcher.  i love people.  i’m energetic and i love to go on daily walks.  i’m a gentleman on lead and i do not pull.   i’m food motivated and i like to learn new tricks when treats are involved!i get along with dogs of all sizes, currently i’m the only dog in my foster home, but i’ve been in homes with other greyhounds and a mid-sized terrier and i’ve been just fine.  initially muzzled while meeting dogs and playing is recommended. (but that’s a best practice for any type of dog introduction).i don’t show any separation anxiety being alone.  i am not cat safe and i need a home without children.  currently, i have access to a backyard through a dog door, and i love being outside.  an apartment or condo would not be ideal for me.  a single family home, townhome, or patio home with access to a yard would be perfect.  buddy was relinquished back to cga for a bite incident in his previous home.  buddy was seen by a behaviorist and determined that he has the potential to really thrive in the right setting.  his love of people and friendliness are definitely pros.  he has had no other signs or incidents of aggression in his foster home since coming back to cga in october 2023.if you are looking for a dog who will join you on adventures, explore the city or mountains, love you unconditionally, then i’ll be your best buddy!if you are interested in meeting buddy, let your adoption counselor know or if you don’t have an adoption counselor, fill out our online adoption application!  let us know if you have any questions about this handsome boy!





urgent - we need fosters!!!













we have greyhounds coming in!
we have retired racers coming in november and december and we need foster families. without foster families, we cannot bring in greyhounds for adoption! just imagine not being able to adopt one of these wonderful greyhounds because there are no foster families?fostering greyhounds plays a crucial role in helping these retired racing dogs transition into family pets, acclimating the hounds to home life.  so what does it take  become a foster family? you must complete a foster application, followed by a home visit from a cga representative. once approved, cga provides necessary supplies and vet care--you provide the love, care, and home.you will work with a dedicated foster coordinator, who will help answer questions, along with access to a google group made up with other foster families.    questions?  contact info@greyhoundadoption.comready to foster, click the link below to go directly to the foster application!

donate food for fosters!
now you can help cga in a different way!  with all of the greyhounds coming in to cga, our foster hounds need food!  donating foster food is fast (like a greyhound) and easy.  click on the button below to see cga’s amazon wish list.  select the food you’d like to donate from our list.  it will be shipped to one of our coordinators.  we all know how sensitive greyhound tummies can be, so we’ve made it easy by limiting the number of options.  please donate now!at checkout you will see a shipping address option listed as "morgan fields' gift registry address".  please select that one.
