 welcome to spectrum headquarters, the unofficial website for fans of 
			  all ages of "captain scarlet and the mysterons".
this british television series was created and produced in 1967, by 
		  gerry and sylvia anderson, the same genius minds behind the worldwide 
		  success of "thunderbirds", the direct predecessor of "captain 
		  scarlet", in a long line of supermarionation shows - which also 
		  included "supercar", "fireball xl5" and "stingray" (all created by the 
		  andersons).
"captain scarlet" was very different from these other series. it was the 
		  first to use the real proportions of the human body, instead of the 
		  caricatured proportions and features used by its predecessors. its 
		  gloomy atmosphere was also a far cry from the lighter and often 
		  humorous tone generally displayed in the other shows (such as in 
		  "thunderbirds"). "captain scarletâ was a more serious show - humour, 
		  although present in some episodes, was rare.

	  those two aspects served to give more much depths and realism to the 
	  series - something that was somewhat lacking in other supermarionation 
	  series.  the models and special effects used in this series were now even 
	  better than those which had already made "thunderbirds" famous - and which 
	  were created by the same man: derek meddings, whose wonderful craft would 
	  become famous worldwide in a series of james bond's movies and in 
	  christopher reeve's superman films. 

      the subject of "captain scarlet" - a secret organisation's fight against 
	  the attack of enemies from another world - would be used again, some years 
	  later by gerry anderson in another of his famous shows - but this time 
	  using real actors. "ufo", which starred the late ed bishop, who provided 
	  the voice of captain blue in the original "captain scarlet" series.
	  
      there's already a great number of websites dedicated to gerry anderson and 
	  the many series and worlds he created, and a lot of those sites have full 
	  pages featuring "captain scarlet". my goal with this site: to give fans 
	  all kinds of information about the series, such as its history, the people 
	  who where behind it, episodes guide, characters, voices-over work, craft, 
	  vehicles, merchandising, etc.   you can also find, on the links 
	  page, a number of links to other websites which provide lots of 
	  interesting stuff about the "captain scarlet" series, or other series from 
	  gerry anderson. if you feel there's an interesting link that should be 
	  added to this page, you're welcomed to contact me.

      the "skybase central" section is totally dedicated to the "new captain 
	  scarlet" series. at the moment, this section is constantly in 
	  construction, and already offers much information about the new show - 
	  including a list of available merchandising - with more data to be added 
	  in the following months.

      the popular fan fiction pages will bring you the further adventures of 
	  captain scarlet, and other spectrum agents.  many authors have joined 
	  me and have sent stories for you to read, and enjoy, and, hopefully, make 
	  comments about!  a lot of interesting stories have been posted over the 
	  years - with different views from each author of how the series might have 
	  evolved. links to other such stories, on other sites, have also been 
	  added. please take note that those authors are only writing these stories 
	  for the fun of it, and, we believe, out of respect for the creators of 
	  this series and its wonderful world and characters. no copyright 
	  infringement is meant to the rightful owners of "captain scarlet and the 
	  mysterons", or any other series, or other copyrighted and trademarked 
	  material (see the disclaimer at the bottom of this page.)

      also please take note that i am only working on this website for personal 
	  fun. i'm not a professional of any kind, i'm just somebody who wants to do 
	  something special about a series that i liked very much, and still do 
	  after all these years. i'm trying to do it with all due respect to the 
	  show, and to all the talented people responsible for its long time 
	  success.

      this site is dedicated to them.
