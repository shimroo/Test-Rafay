reach consumer testimonials 










						"as one might imagine, moving to a state and city that one has never been to could be rather intimidating [and] exhaustive. add to this mix the feature of total blindness. again, i reiterate, reach has been and continues to be an important aspect in my life, increasing my abilities in achieving independence."					





v.b., reach denton consumer 






						"i spent 14 months in a nursing home. with the help of reach, i was able to move out on my own. i have been independent living for almost two years now. i have been in various workshops as well. i would recommend reach to anyone who needs their services."					





l.o., reach plano consumer 






						"reach provides us with resources that help us to be more independent. the staff is supportive and encouraging to everyone. through the weekly social activities we have fun, meet others and get out in the community. we are glad to have joined reach and have made lifelong friends."
