makoto cole


i really appreciate the daily updates on progress completed. i also feel confident with his/their skills as it appears a entire team is working on my progress. i have been working with them for almost a year now on some very ambitious projects and they have never disappointed. i am really happy that they are helping my project come alive. on to the technicals, when it comes to shopify they are absolute pro's. i will design my vision of what i want in photoshop and they can accurately re-create it in html/css/liquid. with the daily updates and quick responses to emails i am never left wondering with this team. i highly recommend!






argentina moise


synapseindia is a serious company, compared to some of their competition. the marketplace integration software was built exceptionally well. all deliverables were on time and working properly, and their commitment to the project showed in their careful approach. in one instance, synapse went the extra mile by spending an entire week to conduct more research free of charge.






matt harrison


i have been working with synapseindia and this is my fourth company right now. they were able to take on and tackle just about any project i go through with them. we just had a development group that i had left, kind of us high and dried. i was able to give all the information to synapseindia team and within two weeks they had everything back on track. we were able to meet all our deadlines and everything else and i was able to get them other projects. it had been an absolute instrumental part of the growth of the different businesses i worked for.






mark harris


all of the developers have always been available there. they've been brilliant. after the site launched, there were slight improvements across the analytics board, from page views to user signups. furthermore, the site was newly accessible to its mobile users. synapse's continuous reporting and constant accessibility made it easy to make adjustments during the process.






anne shingleton


i had no it experience, and they guided me through the entire project. they used the paper tool developed in the client's dissertation to build and design the app, leaving the client satisfied with the product. they're very professional, knowledgeable about both ios and android, and respond quickly to any issues that emerge.






eric matas


we're proudly recommend synapseindia because they have been our trusting partners for design and development work for nearly 10 years. for us, it was not about just a great value although synapseindia does provide a very high quality work at a very good price. for us, it was more finding a partner so that we can collaborate to create the best products for our users. synapseindia certainly provides their partnership and collaboration because they communicate very clearly and they truly care about our success.






tyrone taborn


nearly 15 years ago, we started this journey with synapse in order to reduce our cost and increase our efficiency and productivity. its been a real pleasure to work with synapse. they are responsive, more than professional and i have taken a lot of joy in watching this company grow over 15 years. i have the good fortune to build a early on with the founders of the company in india and i have to tell you the same core values, the same commitments to customer service, the same commitment to value. they existed 15 years ago continued to exist today.






mona overturf


i have been working with synapseindia for over 5 years now and have found them to be easy to work with. they have always been fast and resilient at addressing things that we needed. they have a well-defined process in place, and are good at communicating. they've been really good at setting up times that are convenient for both of us and we appreciated their constant availability, quick responses to emails, and regular updates on project status so we know exactly where they are. any new projects i go to them first because i know they'll do a great job. i would definitely recommend synapseindia.






josh c. irons


we had a situation not too long ago where we had an overflow of projects and we needed help immediately to meet deadlines. we had heard some great things about synapseindia, we reached out, had a great conversation with them. yes, we had some concerns upfront, these concerns were related to the difference in time zones, communication, language barrier. but as soon as we started working with synapseindia, all those concerns were alleviated.






maia morgan


we are extremely satisfied with synapseindia's delivery of the product. they were able to build, test and help roll out a completely custom database within a matter of months and that has allowed us to retire our old system completely and that means that our team is working way more efficiently and we have streamlined and automated several processes that previously required manual efforts. they were also very-very flexible to our needs and receptive and worked with our ideas and visions and that allowed us to have this great workable end-product. it's just been a real pleasure working with synapseindia.
