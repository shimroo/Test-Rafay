welcome to bell road toyota
the toyota brand is constantly evolving, with exciting new additions like the corolla cross and the grand highlander hybrid. you can find both of these standout models on our lot at bell road toyota, along with classic vehicles like the corolla, the prius, the tundra, and more. we also have a used inventory that you can explore, as well as a certified pre-owned selection. once you have your next model, our service department can help you keep it in great shape.
explore new toyota models for sale near phoenix
some brands only offer a handful of models, but there’s something for everyone in the new toyota line-up. if you’re looking for a sedan, then your options range from the incredibly efficient prius to the performance-focused gr86. you’ll also find other comfortable options like the camry, the crown, and the sienna. our suvs are just as diverse, as we offer off-roading-focused models like the rav4, the 4runner, and the land cruiser along with family favorite options like the grand highlander and sienna. if you’d rather look for a truck, then we have both the tundra and the tacoma. both of these models can be equipped with a hybrid powertrain so that you stay efficient on the road. we also have plenty of evs for you to explore once you arrive. if you’re near glendale, phoenix, or gilbert, then you can take a closer look at your favorite models today at bell road toyota.
browse our used inventory today
while we’re excited to show drivers our latest toyota models, we understand that a lot of people prefer to browse our used vehicles instead. our used inventory is packed with all kinds of vehicles ranging from small suvs to massive trucks. unlike our new selection, this inventory isn’t limited to any one brand in particular, so you may run into ford, dodge, or even chevrolet models depending on availability. if you’re not interested in other brands and you’re looking for a high-quality toyota model, then there’s also our toyota certified used vehicles. this inventory is held to a different standard, as gold level models have to be no more than 6 model years old and have to have less than 85,000 miles. they also go through a quality assurance inspection, so you can be confident in their health.
keep your toyota model healthy with routine service
it’s generally recommended that you take care of your oil change and your tire rotation every few thousand miles, but these aren’t your only routine services. other services include things like your regularly scheduled brake or battery inspection. you’ll also need to balance and align your tires routinely. this can be a lot to keep track of, but our mechanics can make sure that your vehicle is healthy today at bell road toyota. we understand that some people have incredibly busy schedules, which is why you can choose to schedule your service online. you might not always have time to call us, but you can fill out this form anywhere at any time. once you arrive, our service center will be able to help you with your routine service, or with any issues that you might be experiencing. if you do need to replace anything, then you can order parts through us in person or online.
 
      






don't settle for less. insist on toyota genuine parts. toyota owners can depend on your vehicle for many miles to come.
