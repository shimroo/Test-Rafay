asia pacific language school (apls) is a private school certified by the washington state board of education; and, its learning center is a childcare center licensed by the department of early learning. apls was established in 1995 to provide chinese and japanese language classes for children. our goal is to create a continuous learning environment in which children of all ages can explore and learn the chinese or japanese language. at apls, we believe that each child can learn and master a second language. the gift of a second language will give our children an advantage for future opportunities in the globalized society. starting from preschool age, children can continue learning the target language up to high school age, and may receive high school credit or get assistance with preparing for the ap exam. our dual-language kindergarten and first grade classes provide accredited courses for children to pursue academic success along with a second language (chinese or japanese). we are located in bellevue and within minutes from newcastle, issaquah, redmond, kirkland, and mercer island.
