the bulldog interviews

        who wouldn’t want to get into the mind of the bulldog community?  
        well we are super jacked to bring you the bulldog interviews.  
        
        since i picked up my first bulldog in 1996 i have been part of 
        the bulldog community and established a ton of connections.  
        gleaning morsels of knowledge at almost every interaction with 
        others in this great community.  running bullynet.com since 2001, 
        i have been exposed to so many question from other bulldoggers 
        that i did not have the answers for.  so, i turn to the people 
        that have the answers.  now i’m bringing to you interviews from 
        people who have the best interest of the bulldogs at heart, from 
        veterinarians, rescue, breeders, handlers, club officers, great 
        pet owners, bulldog products, celebs with bulldogs, pretty much 
        anyone who can assist the bulldog community we will be interviewing 
        and bringing that info to you.
    

are you an awesome bulldog breeder?

    you've put your heart and soul into your bulldogs, now let the world see it.  some of you have your own website and that’s great, but so many are out of date and you can’t get ahold of the kid who put it together.  plus no one finds your site unless they already know who you are.  
    


    on bullynet, you can enter 
        your own dogs, pictures and pedigrees, allowing you to add your dog’s latest win photos or puppy pics.  and we know what google likes, and get our site listed at the top for a ton of bulldog related search terms.  
    



    but at the same time we do not run any google ads on our site, as there is too great of a chance that puppy mills may show up in their ads and trick people into supporting that repulsive group of inhuman people.
    


    so as long as you're a bca member in good standing you can sign up now at topk9s.com
