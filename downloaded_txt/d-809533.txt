testimonials



“thru almost the 54 years that summa & iezzi has been in business, we have worked hand in hand on countless commercial projects with bricks and stones supply (then dba wilkes barre clay products) and to say that it has been nothing less than a total pleasure would be remiss. from sales staff to delivery personnel and all of their “behind the scenes” office personnel, this company is top notch in the masonry supply field. if given the opportunity to work w/ bricks & stones on your next project, do not pass up on the chance. “
