annette's reviewsour experiences
with annette were outstanding! her expertise and professionalism sets her apart
from many other real estate agents. she assisted us with buying our home in
pennsylvania about 15 years ago. when we requested her services again to sell
our home she was ready. she provided us with detailed information that helped us
price our home correctly for the market. initially, we thought they price
should be higher, but she explained the reasons for her price recommendation.
she left the decision entirely up to us. once she put our house on the market
within 24 hours we had a request for a home showing. the first prospective
buyer made an offer immediately. we went through a few counteroffers and then
settled on an amount. we had a contract for the sale within 48 hours. annette
helped us with everything from beginning to end. she went beyond what we
expected. we highly recommend her.  — sonia
d.if you are
looking for a true professional realtor, look no more. annette nelson is just
the best. she smoothed out the complicated corporate relocation process for us.
she truly knows the ins and outs of real estate at every level.  she is very patient and knowledgeable. i
would recommend her to anyone wanting a positive experience with selling or
buying a new home. thank you annette.  —margie
d.my husband and
i actually worked with annette when we bought, and then later sold, our first
house. annette is fantastic at helping first time home-buyers navigate their
options and will give honest feedback about particular properties. thanks to
annette, we knew exactly what we'd need to bring to closing, how to secure a loan, etc.
she is incredibly knowledgeable, and i strongly recommend her. we would have
worked with her to find and purchase our next home, but we moved out of her
area! — hillary h.annette is truly a professional in terms of
her real estate knowledge, familiarity with the area, and her focus on client
satisfaction. what really separates annette is how complete and thorough she
is; truly a pleasure to have worked with her! — william w.our experience
with annette was just superb!!!!!! she really knows everything about real
estate. she helped guide my husband and i through a very important life
decision and with much patience!!! this was the 2nd time we used annette as our
agent and we would highly recommend her again to anyone wanting a true professional.
thank you annette!!! — user3239654annette is truly a professional in terms of her real estate knowledge, familiarity with the area, and her focus on client satisfaction. what really separates annette is how complete and thorough she is; truly a pleasure to have worked with herannette did a
great job helping us find our home. she understood what we were looking for and
sent new listings via e-mail every few days. she knew it was the one before we
even looked at it! she is very knowledgeable about the entire process and was a
huge help to us as first-time home buyers. i would recommend annette to anybody! —
james r.annette worked
with us on the purchase of our first home. we had a lot of questions related to
every step of the home buying process and annette did a great job of answering
all our questions and clearly explaining all aspects of the process to us. when
it came to house hunting, annette found a lot of great houses and helped us
identify and focus in on our greatest needs and expectations of a house. when
looking at properties and preparing offers, we always asked for annette's
professional opinion and she was happy to offer it, but we never felt
pressured. during the negotiation process and interactions with sellers' agents,
annette was clearly working on our behalf and in our best interest. she let us
know when something didn't seem right and offered suggestions on how to
proceed. she never hesitated to contact the seller's agent with questions,
concerns, requests, even when the agent was (in our opinion) less than ideal to
work with. annette was absolutely fantastic to work with and we fully intend to
work with her again on future home sales and purchases.  — sarah f.annette saved
my sale when the buyers agent totally messed up the buyers mortgage. because
annette has a lot of experience, both as a buyers and sellers agent, she was
able to write documents that should have been written by the buyers agent in
order to satisfy the buyers mortgage company. in  addition, her attention to detail
made sure i was totally covered in all situations. if you want the best, you
need annette. — corrine c.truly a
professional! annette helped us buy our first home. as first time home buyers,
we must have been a real pain to deal with i presume. what with the hundreds of
questions we had, the numerous homes we looked at without having a clue what
our "must-have" list was until we were a good year into  the process. but annette was
extremely patient with us, always around to answer any questions we had. she
would always take her time to make sure we understood something completely
before we proceeded to make a decision, which really helped - because, as we
learned along the way, sometimes there are things that look straight-forward
enough to you but are not always. she made the entire home buying process very
easy on us just by being her professional self - no thrusting of opinions on
us, she just let us aware of all the facts before letting us make our own
decision. made us feel like we owned the entire process and made the decision
to buy our home that much sweeter. you just cannot go wrong with annette! i
would recommend her to anyone, without a second thought. — bala b.annette helped
us purchase our first home in lansdale pa in 2001. the process was very smooth
and professional. she helped us when our first choice property had two other
biders. we bid over asking price and landed the house which we have resided in
for 15 years. she gave very good advice. now we are searching for a larger home
and she has supplied us with up to date information on what to expect with
different properties. thanks annette! —
