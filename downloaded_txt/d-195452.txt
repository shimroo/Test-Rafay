“at first, the [covid-19] restrictions made it more challenging to volunteer and it interrupted the “habit” i had established. the hands on atlanta team kept me in the know on existing and emerging needs in atlanta, so i was able to serve in a way that worked for me. in a time where many of us felt helpless with little control of the situation, serving provided an outlet and opportunity to put that energy into action.””

— michelle signorelli, hands on atlanta civic leader
