due to illness, this 
		site is no longer being actively updated but will remain online for 
		reference purposes.   the sister-site, earlyblues.org, will 
		continue to be updated periodically.   thanks to everybody for 
		your support and interest over the last 22 years.  i've met so many 
		wonderful people through the blues and through this site and i hope 
		you've found it helpful and interesting.

alan white

a warm welcome to the original earlyblues.com. now in its 
		22nd year this is 
		believed to be the longest running and largest continuously updated blues 
		music website on the 
		internet. the blues is alive and well here! browse the site for a vast range of blues material: the 'uk & european blues 
		festival 
		guide', uk/european/us blues festival photographs and reviews, blues tours/gigs, 
		artist/band interviews, the history of the blues in essays and articles, 
		research projects, reference lists, 
		recommended blues books/cds/dvds/radio stations, travelogues, 
		general blues news items, a blues shopping mall, blues recipes, blues 
		resting places, links to other blues sites, social media and discussion 
		forums. 

with the re-created and 
		extensively expanded blues history section (see details below) 
		'earlyblues.com' now runs as two interlinked websites ('earlyblues.com' 
		and 'earlyblues.org'). there are well over 1,600 web pages, over 11,000 images, over 
		120 interviews, over 120 essays and articles (mostly exclusive to earlyblues.com) 
		so be sure to visit often as these sites are updated very frequently. 

		please remember this original earlyblues.com website is over 20 years old and technology has 
		moved on a bit since then - whilst the website is quite antiquated in 
		structure it has a wealth 
		of blues in its heart - and it's still beating strongly! earlyblues.org (the extended 
		blues history website) however is 
		quite a youngster being just a 
		few years old.
looking for a specific blues 
		artist or band, check this out first:
		

blues artists & bands index - indexing artists & bands 
		featured on the 'earlyblues.com' website,
		or try blues festival photos for a 
		list of past blues festivals, or try 
 the newsstand - 
		all sorts of snippets from the blues world.
		otherwise browse the main noticeboards listed below - each giving the latest 
		updates by category or the 'early 
		blues treasure trove' of 
		miscellaneous links to all other (older) sections of the website. i've provided 
		regular visitors with the 
		five key links above and four below. 
		


happy browsing! 


if your interest is in the history of blues 
		music :   





					"today it's no longer possible to hear the history of the 
					blues from the mouths of many of those that shaped it. the 
					survivors of the first decades are few; memories are dimmed 
					by age and scared by experience. time and pride have 
					coloured some recollections, distrust and envy may have 
					distorted others. fingers are no longer nimble when old men 
					are asked to play; blues that were sung in youth may have 
					little meaning when the heat of the moment has been long 
					forgotten. the problems of piecing together the story of the 
					blues are many."
					- paul oliver, the story of the blues, penguin, london 1969




check out 
www.earlyblues.org a separate website 
		which is dedicated to the history of the blues, effectively replacing 
		the history section of this website. you can find more details below (click 
		here).

if your interest is in the history of gospel music :   





"the half ain't never been told"
					"the story of the blues is a story that has been told a 
					number of times ... as far as black music as a whole is 
					concerned it is a half-story. this emphasis has drawn 
					attention away from other important vocal traditions, 
					particularly the sacred vocal traditions, from the 
					song-sermons of the baptist and sanctified preachers to the 
					gospel songs of the church congregations and of the 
					'jack-leg' preachers and evangelists".
 - paul oliver, songsters and saints - vocal 
					traditions on race records, cambridge university press, 
					1984.

"crazy blues" written by perry bradford. 
					mamie smith and her jazz hounds recorded it on august 10, 
					1920, which was released that year by okeh records. within a 
					month of release, it had sold 75,000 copies. although there 
					were many recordings made of songs with blues in the title 
					during the previous decade, this recording is considered a 
					landmark as the first blues record ever issued.

blues history 
 noticeboard: essays, articles, 
		poetry, art,  
				tribute projects and talks









					re-formatted history section :

the original history section 
					of earlyblues.com has been re-created in a more 
					manageable and easier to browse format together with 
					extended content, especially on the history of british blues.

the new 
					format has been developed on a separate website
					
					www.earlyblues.org 

and will replace the original history 
					section of 
www.earlyblues.com, being entirely dedicated to the history and 
					evolution of the blues in essays and articles, cultural 
					aspects, exhibitions, presentations, courses, talks, 
					research projects, reference lists, recommended blues books, 
					blues resting places, and links to other blues sites. all 
					other content of 
www.earlyblues.com will 
					remain the same.

so 'earlyblues.com' 
					now runs as two separate but interlinked websites: 

www.earlyblues.com 
					(with the original history section) and 

www.earlyblues.org 
					(as the expanded and re-formatted history section).



					click here to go to the original history section or 
					
					click here to see the new history section, 
					remembering that you can return to the full
					
					www.earlyblues.com 
					website any time by 
					clicking the link on the new home page.

please 
					remember this original website is over 20 years old and 
					technology has moved on a bit since then - whilst it's quite 
					antiquated in structure it has a wealth of blues in its heart 
					- and it's still beating!
