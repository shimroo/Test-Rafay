hi my name is machozi and  i’m addicted to limewire (downloading software) i don’t know how or when its started but now i’m just hooked, i have to check on it constantly see what’s downloading,watch the speeds,see which ones are almost done , sometimes i’ll even watch the countdown as it completes the download… if u dint know any better someone would think i’m monitoring kengen stock or a life support machine … my computer has not been turned off in a week…it used to be jus polite downloading maybe once or twice a week….u know, a  new episode of  lost a new song u heard on tv or an old favourite  that u had 4gotten about…. anyway it was moderate  here and there…but now i cant go a day without it for the past two weeks i’ve been downloading stuff anything and everything searching us websites for the latest jams and even gone to us channel sites trying to figure out what new shows have come out…so i can download them…..  downloaded about 5 movies that i have not even begun to watch….. i first finished the 1st season of weeds…which rocks! cant wait for season 2… then went on to gilmore girls (i had missed that show so much, as at home me and my mom used to enjoy watching it.. i know my mom and i secretly wanted our relationship to be like the gilmore girls) the show does not disappoint season 5 & 6 is great after that i finally finished lost season 2.. it got a bit boring in the middle but the end is a kicker and a half! then alias… yea so now i’ve found this new show to download its called entourage…its quite cool not so long though its average running time for each episode is about 25 mins so i got thru season one in a day…(yes i have nothing better to do) got the second season now and taking it slow but soon it will be done and then i’ll be in trouble …..so yup i need to break free…is there a limewire or a downloader’s anonymous somewhere out there?… i need help!

he finally came down and he was okay, not as scary as i thought he would be..i dressed up he dressed down, i was in black trousers and heels he was in black long shorts and these horrid converse hightop pin striped shoes… somehow i assumed he’d be in his work clothes so we were a terrible miss match it kinda felt like roles were reversed i ‘m a total sneaker casual type of gal and he’s more a suit and sweater type of guy.. anyway, it was wow! just as he said it would be and i was not as wow as i thought i could be but either way it was gotten out of the way in a very very fun way.. we talked about everything and anything and even went to the subject of  the best way to cook rice!!! it went well… at least i thought it did, talked to him the day after and everything was cool… so now two unanswered texts and one unanswered phone call and almost two weeks of silence from his end and i decided to delete his number…so that done i now have to slowly weed him out of my life text by text …the number was easy… menu, contacts, name, delete! but the texts hmm those are a bit harder coz u have to open every single msg in order to delete it… all the “hey beautiful texts” and drunken 3am texts, the special little now insignificant things he said that i saved jus to make me smile…i don’t want to do to it, i don’t not want him in my life its jus that….. two unanswered texts and one unanswered phone call and almost two weeks of silence jus screams out its over!!!!!!!… reality = guys are big wimps! they’d rather ignore a girl then jus tell them its not working…so now my plan is every morning delete one or two texts if i’m in a good mood and the sun is shinning and soon enough there wont be anymore left to delete and i can move on with my life! moving out of my house in a weeks time…mann the year has gone so fast… i’m gonna miss my double bed! really dreading the single campus bed awaiting me next year anyway …up north i go cant wait for the next chapter of this year to begin!

	 another midnight newspaper session!
	 
    


i've been recently taking breaks in between my reading/study sessions to read the daily nation..i wasn't an avid reader of the paper but now that i've started i cant stop as everyday this week i've been thoroughly entertained... jus read this article and i thought it was hilarious.... the end bit i've posted had me cracking up ..though the reality is that poverty makes us do crazy things and although the story is funny its quite sad....we are all privileged to be able to afford to sit in front of these computer screens ... for the full article:  http://www.nationmedia.com the sex bill made simple story by peter kimani /monday mix publication date: 05/01/2006 prisoner of his own imagination some bloke in nyeri was so broke that he decided to fake his own abduction and claim the ransom. how imaginative can some people get! the man is said be a freelance photographer. but things do get a bit hard (like when tea bonuses are not paid for years, and the 36-exposure film lasts 24 months due to scarce orders). so the man decided to test his parents' love for him, and whether they would part with all their earthly possessions to redeem him. the plot was easy: a bus ride to kakamega, a few hours' practice speaking like most people there do ã‚– which means replacing letter 'd' with 't' and 'b' with 'p', then placing a call home with words like: "ile mchamaa ya kwenyu iko mparoni. yeye takula ukali mpila mpoka..." which means the man in question is in serious trouble and the relatives had better come to his rescue before things got elephant. after a series of urgent meetings, the family manages to raise enough cash. they deposit it at a local bank, as instructed. (it is evident the man did not wish to pay more fare to a distant location). and bingo! the man takes the next bus home, smiling all the way to the bank. the policemen waiting for him smile, too. this is one story with a happy ending, and a clean solution. the man is cooling off in jail, as he possibly contemplates his next escapade.jus had to share wit the non nation readers!

i was reading the nation last night as i have moved my study sessions to the early am's in the library  and i was in shock as to the things mps ask for... to add insult to injury.. ati the mps want a lump sum of i dont know how much at the end of their term i.e a gratuity for services rendered to the kenyan public!!!! what services???? i dint know theft was a govt appointed service!whats the point of getting a university education these days while u can be a form 4 drop out and become an mp who makes himself self tons money from the govt and as if that money is not enough engages shady deals that steal more money from the kenyan  people! the worst thing though has to be that all this money is tax free! yup clean no tax man on your back! so from the govt straight to their already fat pockets! yurk!
