our purpose: wisdom and morality











god created man to marvel at and live by truths concerning him, creation, others and ourselves.
 
we must study god's instruction about what he is, what is idolatrous or fallacy, we must study nature, psychology, philosophy and morality. this draws us closer to god and he to us, and creates societal harmony which fosters greater torah for all.

kindness:  as equals, all humans must treat others as we wish to be treated. charity, kindness and justice demand we rise above personal and selfish emotions and recognize that god made others as he made ourselves. doing so creates harmony, and earns his kindness.
 
racism: a lie:  man descends from adam. black/white twins unveil the lie of racism. bible denounces it: mosesâ wife was black, our kings married egyptians and messiah descends from moabites. âbetter is the day of death than the day of birthâ (eccl. 7:1). birth doesnât define us; how we live does.
 
insecurity:  man's insecurities can be false, but reality is greater, as it is truth. man seeks security about his future, accepting fallacies like astrology, amulets, omens, horoscopes and others. god prohibited such practices precisely because they are false. god is all-powerful; imagination is  not. rely on him alone.
 
happiness:  many think wealth and success secure happiness. but torah teaches happiness stems from wisdom and though. when pursuing wisdom, one is most happy as torah offers childlike amazement at every turn. study offers the daily novelty necessary to retain interest, and the depth that offers amazement.
 
pleasing others:  donât seek approval over truth. torah says, âwhat can man do to me?â (psalms 56:5). âdon't fear manâ (deut. 1:17). âdesist from man whose soul is in his nostrils, for what is he considered?â (isaiah 2:22). mortal attention is irrelevant. following god earns all goodness.
