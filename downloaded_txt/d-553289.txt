about whole lifeat whole life, our goal is to make yoga available and accessible to all people who could benefit from it. we focus on yoga as a way to serve an individual's unique condition and not as a means of achieving the "perfect" body or posture. in our classes, you'll find an opportunity to develop your mind and body, connect to your heart and a community of support for healing and growth.our approach to yoga is highly adaptable, meditative, and Â breath centric. this approach is uniquely healing and can be used by people of all levels and physical abilities, creating a practice that is sustainable for a lifetime. yoga is not however just about the body. in our classes you will encounter a range of yoga tools, to help you find balance and integration in the whole of your experience, physical, mental, emotional, spiritual. yoga is a practice to help you have a direct, lived experience of your own wholeness!what began as a neighborhood studio over 20 years ago has continued to adapt and grow into what we hope will be your go to for mindful yoga online!
