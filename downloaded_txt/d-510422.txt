lusciniaecantuscredit for fo banner goes to _lostjunkie.this journal is friendlocked.(90% of it at least.  excludes fic and some memes.)i like to keep track of who reads my journal, because  a) i do post personal matters here and b) i don't want certain people to stumble across my lj accidentally (ie. teachers, parents etc)i really don't have any rules other than that you can't be any of the aforementioned people, so comment if you'd like to be added.  i like people, i really do.  xd  shared interests are great, but not necessary and same goes for commenting.  heaven knows i'm not the best at keeping with comments myself.

turn the tables


jun. 22nd, 2006 at 9:48 pm



 


lusciniaecantuslove meme from sesame_seed here.  put into the subject line of a comment the name or lj username of someone (not me! i assume you all adore me by default :d) that you think highly of - yourself or someone else - and then put into the comment itself something nice about that person. check whether there's a thread for that person already or not, but otherwise go for it! even if you've never talked to this person and just want to fangirl them for a moment, go for it! we all need to be fangirled sometimes.if you put this on your own journal, please link back so that we can follow the chain o' niceness around.anonymous posts are welcome, because let's face it: declaring our love for someone can be embarassing.  this is only partially because i don't wanna study xylems and phloems anyways, and more so because i think it's a sweet meme idea and just wanted to spread the love and happy.  ^^look i'll even start!  :dflist.  i ♥ you lots and lots, and what would i do without you for finals week?edit: gah, forgot to turn off ip logging.  just did so.  sorry!

request fic for londaily


jun. 17th, 2006 at 6:49 pm



 


lusciniaecantuslisa, know that i blame you completely for this.  (omg, i'm sorry- the characterizations, the plot (what plot???), and aaaah.  but hey, it's done.  ^^;;)  i told you i couldn't write smut.  not even semi-pseudo-smut (which is what this tries to be, but watch it faaaaaaail miserably.)oh yeah, the quote ... didn't fit as well as i'd have liked.  disclaimer: i don't own tsubasa r.c.  clamp does.  ( kurogane/fai. pg-13. prompt: “anything goes.”collapse )i'm sorry?  i liked it all the way up 'til the ending, where it kinda... disintegrated.  ;___;good luck studying for your exams!!  ♥  :d
