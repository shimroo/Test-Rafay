ducatimeccanica.com - for vintage and classic ducati motorcycle enthusiasts


















a website for enthusiasts of classic ducati motorcycles




if you own a beveldrive ducati there should be something here for you

this site includes resources, information, manuals, and photographs of 
all vintage ducati motorcycles with bevel gear driven cams, produced 
between 1954 and 1985. ducatimeccanica is not a business no money is made from this site, no ads 
are sold, we are just a husband and wife who love and enjoy old bevel drive ducati motorcycles. there is a lot of information for free, and there are links to
 useful services and vendors...  enjoy it... 

please note: sue and i have retired. i will be keeping the ducatimeccanica website up and running, but i am no longer accepting restoration or repair projects... 


if anyone needs to get hold of me, my email address is  tv(at)renewaters.ca


i hope people continue to enjoy and benefit from the site.


scroll down (warning its a long way) or jump to... 

resourses:
articles, manuals, and suppliers that we have found and collected over the years, hopefully others will find the materials ans links useful. this is not all of the suppliers that are out there, just ones i have used and found reliable and helpful...
parts 
manuals rebuild carburation suspension literature


bikes:  these are by no means definitive examples of the models, merely the bikes that we own, ride and enjoy...

welcome to ducatimeccanica.com








sue's bike, leathers and memorabilia from her bonneville escapade on display in the "speed style and art" exhibition at the esplanade museum. the bike was there for 3 months, all summer, she was not best pleased.




below: the new home of ducatimeccanica, a little bit smaller, but now the workshop area and the bike areas are separate, and the workshop area is finally sorted enough to actually do something in... but seemingly still always a mess.

1966 250 mach 1  - ignore the "desmo" on the tank, that's a hold over from it's earlier life when it was raced with a desmo head. the engine now is the original m1 designated motor, with 40mm inlet and 36mm exhaust valves and a green/white cam. the carb is a 34mm mikuni. the exhaust is an f3 type megaphone. suspension is via 32mm marzocchi forks with race tech gold valve emulators and works performance shocks. lights are original first series marchal. thanks go to phil hitchcock at road and race in australia, nigel lacey at lacey ducati uk, malcolme tunstall at syd's cycle in florida, and joe hasloh at rpm services in canada, for their invaluable help and advice with tuning.

1966 ducati 250 diana mark 3 - sold in the us market under name diana mark 3. in europe this model was simply called the mark 3, with a narrowcase motor, and 5 speed transmission. the mark 3 was essentially a us export model of the european mach 1 (of which version very few arrived in north america). this particular diana mark 3 has the red mach 1 type frame and sporting seat, with the earlier 4 speed diana paint scheme, also in red.

1966 ducati 350 "sebring"  - this bike is a bit of a puzzle. it is registered as a '66 sebring but obviously its not. based on walker and faloon's books i believe its a second series 1965 sebring, but i've only ever seen a drawing of one in mick walker's and ian falloon's books, so i'm not sure. the tank is the same style as the mach1 and mark 3 tanks, but bigger. i fitted the clip-ons and triple clamp, the seat is from an earlier 200, i have the big "bread box" seat that it came with, and i put on the conti silencer from a 900 twin, just because i think it looks and sounds great. i have the original silentium also. time will tell if the amal carb stays or gets replaced.



the page on the left is from falloon's 2016 book "ducati overhead camshaft singles" and describes the second series '65 sebring as having a 17lt diana/daytona tank. while in mick walkers 1985 book "ducati singles", he describes the '65 sebring second series as having the tank from the 250 mark 3 (image on right). i have a mark 3 and in comparison the tank on this sebring is much larger. possibly there is an added layer of confusion in that the later mark 3 5 speed was sold in the us as a "diana" mark 3, whereas the diana in europe was only the '61-'64 4 speed version.

sue at the 2017 rocky mountain motogiro - "fastest woman"







ok technically only woman... but she did win the prize for fastest 
woman, and that made her the first woman to complete the two day event, and this was on the bike before it got its restored 175 sport motor.
the motogiro is comprised of a day 1 330km endurance stage and day 2 
closed course mountain time trial. i didn't get the motor in her 200 
rebuilt in time for the event, so she rode the 175 instead. it was a 
fantastic time again, well organized, brilliant volunteers, great 
competitors, altogether too much fun. next year she assures me she will 
be on her 200... but the 175 made it through the 
mountains with flying colours so i was well pleased.

1978 ducati 900 "sport"



the 2009 version of my yellow bike met an unfortunate end in october of 
2011. the insurance company wrote-off the bike, which led to the dmv 
decommissioning the frame. as a result i had to build a new bike with a 
replacement frame and a lot of other bits too... here's the result... 
longer, lower, better looking and altogether more user friendly... note 
side-stand and all new for 2012... electric start. (hey, i'm getting 
old.) you may recognize some of the salvaged parts from the old bike, 
but there were woefully few of them. i did however manage to save the 
colour :-)

dot-5 brake fluid in brembo brake systems: tsw vehicle concepts


important: all brembo braking products use natural-rubber base seals, and
therefore are incompatible with dot-5 silicone-based brake fluids. 


dot-5 silicone-based fluids react with natural-rubber seals to swell them
which can cause severe piston retraction problems.  there is no cure for
problems caused by dot- 5 use other than complete seals replacement -
use only dot-3/4 non-silicone type fluids in your brembo components.


(yes, we know the cap on the rectangular master
cylinders says dot 3 - 5 fluids - but please note: silicone
dot- 5 fluids are not generally in use in europe, but glycol-based
dot-5.1 fluids are. hence, the dot-5 cap designation) 


for best braking performance, they recommend changing brake fluid twice a
 year. if the machine is to be stored in a damp environment (over the 
winter,
say), they recommend installing fresh fluid before and after the storage
period. at minimum service levels, glycol brake fluids must be
completely changed at intervals not to exceed a period of 18 months.

change oil every 1000 miles
 - the end to the dreaded "oil thread" - and not just because it says to

question - motorcycle consumer news


some more words regarding oil - james deraeve


 fork oil see owners manuals above for volumes for specific models. - 
oil weight can and will vary with personal preference in terms of 
stiffness vs. ride comfort. simply put lighter oils produce a softer 
ride, thicker increase stiffness.  thicker, heavier weight oil, 
increases dampening, slowing fork compression. suspension travel is 
usually not changed, but the time it takes to move that distance is 
increased with thicker oils. therefore heavier weight oils will reduce 
the tendency for the front end to dive under braking, but at the cost of
 ride comfort. you will feel the bumps. personal choice thing. typical 
fork oil weights are 5w - 25w. many bikes including bevels (see owners 
manuals) are spec'd for atf (transmission fluid) in the forks, generally
 accepted to be equivalent to 15w

some authentic italian recipes
translations by luca guala 






this was an idea of luca's to share some authentic italian recipes with 
some authentic italian bike nuts. he's translating and sending me 
recipes that his girlfriend antonia makes, sue and i are trying them, 
and then posting them here. the ones we have tried so far are excellent,
 there are perks to doing this website.
 
i am presenting the recipes exactly as luca sends them, try them just 
the way he describes, his english is great, and some of the subtle 
nuances in his translations are delightful, thank you so much luca. what
 a great idea.



pasta alla bolognese - wonderful, this is the real thing from bologna, try it, it's great


pasta al pesto genovese - a real treat and luca says a typical recipe from genoa


tiramisu - if you've never had real tiramisu you don't know what you've been missing...


hiroshi made tiramisu - 'it's very sweet and nice but a little bitter like bevel driven ducati'
