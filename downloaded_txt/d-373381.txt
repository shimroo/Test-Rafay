“students that usually come across as indifferent stood out as leaders, students that do not like to speak up asked if they could do the zip line, students encouraged each other by clapping when another reached a new height or gave a ‘you can do it’ when another felt like stopping, others owned their fears and either worked to overcome or assisted others from the ground. i left the building yesterday with a smile on my face recalling the gains i witnessed.”~kelly k., special education teacher“having students be responsible to help support staff and peers on the ropes is something that is hard to duplicate in another setting. i am so happy that we were able to experience this and look forward to continuing next year!”~ shawn h., high school adjustment counselor“i was floored by how interactive, fun, and valuable this online workshop was. i had yet to experience a zoom-style workshop, meeting, or webinar that was useful before pa. this workshop was engaging and informative, and i walked away with so much new knowledge and inspiration as a teacher.”— pe/health teacher online workshop participant
