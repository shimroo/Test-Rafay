books read, 2024

after years of having it recommended to me, i finally read the lies of locke lamora, which was — as promised — one of my favorite fantasy novels of all time.
unfortunately for locke lamora, i also read the bright sword in 2025, which is easily one of the best books i’ve ever read. an astonishingly good book and, like lonesome dove, a book that transcends its genre (in this case, arthurian fantasy). i cannot recommend it highly enough.

oct. 23: mexican gothic
nov. 30: absolution

continued on my second lap through terry pratchett’s discworld books, which is both comfort food and interesting to watch his dramatic improvements as a writer and, in the future, the beginning of alzheimer’s impacting his work. the last book i read this year, his novel the truth, is a high water mark in both his writing ability and also a really great book about the newspaper business and the act of journalism. even for people who don’t like fantasy novels, it’s a good book to pick up. (his earlier book, small gods, is also an excellent standalone book on religion.)
