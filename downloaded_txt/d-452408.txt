what’s hot?
declaring war now a security council function (by william norman grigg)
during testimony before the senate foreign relations committee last october, secretary of state condoleezza rice was asked whether the president would circumvent congressional authorization if the white house chose military action against iran or syria, noted the april 21 issue of the nation.
beltway conservatives love the un! (by william norman grigg)
“do the democracies of europe have a problem with u.s. goals of spreading democracy around the world?” asked heritage foundation official helle dale in a may 3 washington times op-ed column.
nra warns of the conspiracy behind the un’s global gun ban treaty
the nra has established a dedicated website to “stop the u.n. gun ban.” one of the main goals of this website is to warn americans about the global gun ban conspiracy behind the un’s upcoming “2006 small arms review conference,” june 26-july 7, 2006.
new call for un-administered world disarmament (by william norman grigg)
the new american has frequently described the origins and significance of state department document 7277, entitled freedom from war: the united states program for general and complete disarmament in a peaceful world.
“grass-roots” global warming campaign and un mega-bucks (by william norman grigg)
according to rep. bob inglis (r-s.c.), once an outspoken critic of those warning of a major global warming threat, “more and more republicans [are] willing to stop laughing at climate change [and] are ready to get serious about reclaiming their heritage as conservationists.”
how you can help!
1. circulate the petition
the petition serves a double purpose. the principal purpose, of course, is to demonstrate to the recipients (your us representative and senators) the growing demand to get us out! but you can also use the petition as a door-opener for introducing the subject to others and for finding out whether or not they are interested.
as soon as petitions are completed, they should be mailed to washington, per the instructions on the petition itself. please feel free to make as many copies of the petition as you need.
2. contact your us representatives and senators
congress has the power to end us membership in the un. but most representatives and senators will not oppose us membership in the un unless they are pressured to do so by a sufficient number of informed americans in their districts and states. to learn how you can add your own voice to this growing demand, see “how to communicate with your congressmen,” which appears in the centerfold of restoration of america.
3. use the campaign tools to involve others
the button and bumper sticker are excellent conversation starters. it will cause some to ask you about the un, giving you a splendid opportunity to hand them one of the united nations wants pamphlets and introduce them to the campaign.
by displaying our message, you will be helping to demonstrate the growing popular support to get us out! the more often americans see this message, the more receptive they will be to information explaining why so many want to get us out! therefore, we encourage you to place the enclosed bumper sticker on your car and use the envelope stickers to brighten your outgoing mail. these individual efforts will reinforce our overall publicity efforts, which include advertising in the print and electronic media, yard signs, billboards, etc.
we designed the united nations wants pamphlet series to capture busy americans’ attention, alert them to the un threat, and encourage them to learn more and become involved. these pamphlets are short, easy-to-read, and inexpensively priced for wide distribution.
each pamphlet in the series focuses on a separate hot-button issue. the “starter kit” contains six copies each of three of these pamphlets—so you can immediately use them to involve others. one copy of each of the three other pamphlets in the series is also enclosed.
we recommend carrying copies of one or more of the pamphlets with you so they’ll be available whenever an opportunity arises to discuss the un threat. one way of generating opportunities is to wear the lapel button. whenever possible, ask each person who accepts a pamphlet to read it. shortly after that, follow up for a reaction. depending on the reaction, ask them to sign the petition, learn more, and become involved. please encourage them to order the materials recommended on the back panel of the pamphlet. better yet, please use the website to order extra copies of these materials and have them available for sale.
generally speaking, each pamphlet recommends the special “united nations” issue of the new american magazine and the “starter kit.” one exception: the united nations wants to take your gun! pamphlet recommends the pocketbook global gun grab by william norman grigg in lieu of the magazine. each pamphlet also directs readers to our website (www.getusout.org) for more information.
4. read the united nations exposed—and encourage others to do the same
the better informed you are, the more effective and motivated you will be. ditto for the people you are enlisting in the campaign. the most comprehensive expos available on the un is the united nations exposed by william f. jasper. please take the time to read it. when others appear to be seriously concerned about the un threat—concerned enough that they might be willing to read an in-depth study on the subject—ask them to buy a copy of the united nations exposed. also, you can use the information in this book as a basis for letters to the editor.
5. subscribe to the new american magazine
second to none in its extensive coverage of the united nations, the new american is the source for up-to-date and accurate reporting on the un. every issue has at least one news item about the moves of this organization and the threat it poses to american freedoms.
6. write a letter to the editor
your letter should be typed, double-spaced, and no longer than what the newspaper generally accepts. if your letter is published, you will reach an audience potentially as large as the newspaper’s circulation. not bad for a forum requiring no expense!
these groups can be large or small, governmental or private, local affiliates of a national organization, or itself. examples include businessmen’s clubs, veterans’ groups, state legislatures, city councils, etc. the “sample resolution,” like the petition, urges congress to support legislation to get the us out!
7. promote www.getusout.org
our campaign website is designed to inform and motivate and activate. many good americans who may not initially be interested in attending a meeting or reading or ordering materials might be interested in taking a cursory look at our website. that cursory look, of course, may well whet their appetite for more!
8. work with others—join a local get us out! committee
by doing so, you will be able to increase your effectiveness. for example, you will be able to accomplish projects you probably could not do alone, such as erecting a large commercial billboard or hosting a speaker. you will receive encouragement from the activity of others, just as others will receive sustained motivation from your activity. you will be able to exchange ideas on what tactics are the most effective.
and most importantly, you will be able to help get more people involved since the committees exist to provide leadership for an organized plan to reach out, inform, and involve others.
