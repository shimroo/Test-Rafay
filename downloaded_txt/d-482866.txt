to our valued clients…
given the increased demand for veterinary care and the nationwide shortage of veterinary professionals, we are working very hard to accommodate everyone. we are accepting new clients with the understanding we are scheduling 3-4 weeks out for routine wellness exams.
to our current clients, we remain committed to providing you and your pets with compassionate and quality care. we do however ask for your patience as we are navigating a very heavy caseload. for routine and annual exams, we are currently booking out 3-4 weeks, so please allow time for us to schedule. we make every effort to set aside appointments for sick visits daily and in some cases offer drop-offs.
emergency facilities throughout the state are also experiencing an increased volume of patients resulting in long wait times. please give us a call and we can help direct you as to if the condition can wait to be seen here, be seen at an urgent care or if you should proceed directly to an emergency facility.
thank you for your continued support and understanding.
