    about sjmv
  














“for years, we've aspired to provide our children with a faith-based education. financial constraints initially seemed to hinder this goal. however, thanks to the guidance of st. joseph school’s staff, we discovered opportunities that were previously unknown to us. it's an honor to be a part of the st. joseph mountain view community. the first time we set foot in the gated school campus, we knew it was the perfect place. we noticed the staff calling the students by name, smaller class sizes, and plenty of interactive school events listed on the calendar. since enrolling our children, we've been consistently impressed by the positive and supportive learning environment. they have flourished academically and socially, participating in sports and deepening their faith through baptism and first communion at st. joseph parish. we are truly grateful for the nurturing and inspiring community that st. joseph school provides. we couldn't have chosen a better school.” - the collins family



“god has blessed us with three beautiful children: jeremy, isaac, and our little mateo. as parents, we made the decision four years ago for our children to receive an education rooted in our catholic faith. we are aware that in today’s reality, where faith and christian values are increasingly being lost, it is essential to teach and guide our children. together with st. joseph school, we are confident that we are making that happen. as parents, we feel very happy and grateful to be part of this beautiful st. joseph community, which has become our family. seeing our children happy, receiving an excellent education, and growing in our faith is our greatest reward as parents. may god bless you all.”-the mendoza family


























god loves a cheerful giver. thank you for supporting our school with your time, talents, and treasure.
