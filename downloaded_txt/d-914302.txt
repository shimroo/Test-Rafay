a proud past



an exciting future


today, plumbers union local 75 enjoys a reputation of credibility and strength in the building trades. but such a reputation didn’t happen overnight. it was established over a century through the struggles, hard work and foresight of its members.
in 1890, plumbers called an organizational meeting and sought to petition the american federation of labor for affiliation. their request was granted, resulting in the establishment of plumbers union #5145.
as a result of its tradition of compassion and dedication, local 75 has grown to a current membership of approximately 2000.
