what our clients say
see what some of our clients have to say about renascent.










coming to renascent has been an enlightening and powerful experience
“admittedly, prior to may 2023, i had not given submitting myself to treatment much thought. in fact, i had no idea what renascent was. it was the same old story of “i can do it myself.” in retrospect, coming to renascent has been an enlightening and powerful experience. the time to contemplate my life and situation and the feedback from staff has opened my eyes to my honest situation. my sincere thanks to everyone at renascent who has helped me change my life for the better.
”

– scott l.
renascent alumni












“thank you” isn’t enough – you saved me
“i wish i could find the words to say because ‘thank you’ isn’t enough. i came into this program broken and didn’t think i could make it, but here we are 35 days later with a new confidence and attitude to continue this sobriety journey. to the staff, you are incredible and are doing god’s work saving lives every day – you saved me. this place will always hold a special place in my heart and i am proud to be an alumni.”

– michael v.
renascent alumni












i get to go back to my daughter the changed man and father that this 6-year old little girl deserves
“i would like to thank renascent and their counsellors. they gave me so much to go back home with – the love, the support, the knowledge and spirituality i can share with others. i am grateful that renascent was chosen for me and that i no longer need to walk alone. i get to go back to my daughter the changed man and father that this 6-year old little girl deserves. i recommend this treatment centre to anyone who wishes to change and that has lost touch with god. i will never forget my experience and i am proud to be an alumni of the renascent family. thank you for everything!
”

– remi
renascent alumni












thank you so very much for the past 28 days of treatment
“dear every counsellor, client, and instructor at renascent; thank you so very much for the past 28 days of treatment. it truly changed my life for the better! is this goodbye? absolutely not! truly, i sincerely will forever appreciate the life and positive path you have shown me. i’ll be back soon to say ‘hi’ as an alumni; never again hopefully as a client.
”

– anonymous
renascent alumni












renascent helped me through the first and hardest steps of abstinence-based living
“renascent has helped me grow and grow into the man i wanted to be all my life. they’ve given me all the tools i need to succeed going forward and helped me through the first and hardest steps of abstinence-based living. all the people who work here are incredible and very nice. thank you! i came and i listened to everything they said and now i can go live a happy life.

we are proudly accredited.
we are proudly accredited and in good standing with the canadian centre for accreditation. this means that we routinely undergo an extensive review of our practices and procedures to ensure they meet the rigorous standards for quality of care, organizational performance. in the current unregulated marketplace of addiction treatment providers, accreditation is how we set ourselves apart from the less reputable providers who can make some of the same claims as we do, but do not provide the quality of care necessary to fulfill those claims.

we are proudly accredited and in good standing with the canadian centre for accreditation. this means that we routinely undergo an extensive review of our practices and procedures to ensure they meet the rigorous standards for quality of care, and organizational performance. in the current unregulated marketplace of addiction treatment providers, accreditation is how we set ourselves apart from the less reputable providers who can make some of the same claims as we do, but do not provide the quality of care necessary to fulfill those claims.
 
as part of this intensive process, independent third-party accreditation specialists regularly spend months reviewing and evaluating every aspect of our organization, from our policies and procedures to our facilities. all staff are interviewed to ensure that they are properly certified for the work they do, and that we are routinely receiving the most up-to-date training in areas such as non-violent crisis prevention and first aid and cpr. in this way, the accreditation specialists can determine that staff at all levels of our organization are meeting their obligations both to our clients and within the organization, with integrity. the renewal process occurs every four years, which means we are consistently upgrading to meet the canadian centre for accreditation’s standards.
 
there are three accrediting bodies that are recognized by ontario:
 

accreditation canada, which specializes in hospitals and offers a primer course for organizations considering accreditation;
canadian centre for accreditation (cca), which is ontario-based (but operates country-wide) and specializes in community-based agencies;
commission on accreditation of rehabilitation facilities (carf), which is an american firm.

 
we chose to undergo the canadian centre for accreditation’s process because of their community-based specialty, their ontario/canadian foundation, and their philosophy, which is that they are partners with agencies and not only provide peer review audit/surveys, but also provide support to agencies in developing their protocols in order to achieve accreditation.
