we’re here to help. check out our list of faqs, and if we haven’t addressed your concerns, don’t hesitate to  contact us .






what is flexcare?




flexcare is our global brand for vehicle service contracts and other vehicle protection products. it replaced mopar vehicle protection in january 2025. all faqs apply to both flexcare and mopar vehicle protection.






does flexcare offer the same coverage as mopar® vehicle protection?




whether you purchased flexcare or mopar® vehicle protection, you’ll continue to receive the same great factory backed coverage and customer service.






which vehicle makes and models are eligible for mopar®vehicle protection or flexcare?




all chrysler, dodge, jeep®, ram, fiat® and alfa romeo vehicles, and most - but not all - competitive make vehicles are eligible for genuine mopar® vehicle protection or flexcare. you may purchase a plan for your vehicle by visiting an authorized dealer or calling 1-866-818-9929. if you are interested in mopar® vehicle protection or flexcare for a competitive make, please visit your authorized dealer to inquire about eligibility.






when can i purchase mopar® vehicle protection or flexcare?




new vehicle plans can be purchased anytime within 3 years and 36,000 miles  of the vehicle's warranty start date (the date the vehicle was delivered to its original owner). surcharges may apply after 1 year or 12,000 miles. 
certified pre-owned plans can be purchased on chrysler, dodge, jeep®, ram, fiat® or alfa romeo vehicles with an active, certified pre-owned limited warranty and an odometer that reads less than 75,000 miles. 
traditional pre-owned vehicle plans can be purchased on vehicles that are no more than 10 model years old and with an odometer that reads less than 150,000 miles, or less than 125,000 miles for vehicles with a 5-year/60,000-mile powertrain limited warranty provided by the manufacturer. your dealer will complete a vehicle inspection to ensure the vehicle is eligible for coverage. convenience and maintenance (non-mechanical) plans have specific enrollment rules. please visit your local dealer for details.






what is the length of a mopar® vehicle protection plan or flexcare?




mopar® vehicle protection or flexcare is offered with a wide variety of time and mileage terms, up to 8 years and 125,000 miles. 
new vehicle plan coverage and certified pre-owned vehicle plan coverage begin on the vehicle's warranty start date (the date the vehicle was delivered to its original owner) and at zero miles. this coverage does not begin upon expiration of the new vehicle warranty.
for example: your vehicle's warranty start date is july 1, 2019 and the odometer reads 10,000 miles. you purchase a 5-year / 100,000-mile maximum care℠ plan on november 1, 2019. your coverage starts on july 1, 2019 and expires on july 1, 2024 or when your odometer reads 100,000 miles, whichever occurs first.
traditional pre-owned vehicle plan coverage and most - but not all - convenience and maintenance (non-mechanical) coverage begin on the date and mileage when you purchase the plan.
for example: you purchase a pre-owned 2018 chrysler vehicle on august 1, 2019 and the odometer reads 50,000 miles. on the same day, you purchase a 2-year / unlimited mileage traditional pre-owned plan. your coverage starts on august 1, 2019 and expires on august 1, 2021.
