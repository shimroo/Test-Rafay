mini efis (generation ii) is now in productionjune 5, 2024

the mini efis (generation ii) is now in production and units will begin shipping soon. unlike the previous mini, this version mounts in a 3-1/8″ hole and has a number of refinements which include a high resolution display, optional touchscreen, up to 6 serial ports and an analog port.
our “only pay for the features you need” pricing model used on the sport ex has been highly popular, so we have chosen to apply this to the new mini pricing as well. the base model mini includes a full featured pfd, autopilot control (full lateral/altitude hold), and engine display (eis required).
available options include touch screen, moving map, synthetic vision, vertical autopilot commands, additional serial ports, internal backup battery, and angle of attack.
we have created two packages that include features commonly ordered together which provide a discount over purchasing them separately.  the “basic package” adds the moving map and synthetic vision options to the base model.  the “advanced package” adds the moving map, synthetic vision, additional serial ports and vertical autopilot command options to the base model.

new mini efis on display at sun ‘n fun!april 9, 2024a prototype of the new version of our mini efis is currently on display in our booth at sun ‘n fun, with units going into production soon!
 
re-designed mini efis expected to become available spring 2024november 21, 2023although the mini-x and mini-ap were highly popular, there were a few feature requests that we kept hearing over and over again. “please make it so that it mounts in a standard 3-1/8″ hole” and “more serial ports please” to name a couple. in response to customer request, we have been in the process of re-designing the mini to incorporate these changes as well as a few other refinements:

mounts in a 3-1/8″ hole
6 serial ports
2 diode isolated power inputs
internal backup battery option which much greater capacity and estimated lifespan
25 pin d-sub connector. pinout is mostly the same as our other efis displays.
usb type a connector for updates/saving flight data

while the new mini efis will mount in a 3-1/8″ hole, the bezel and screen size will remain unchanged.  an thin adapter plate will be used so that installation may be completed without drilling or cutting the panel.

the price is yet to be determined, but like all of our products, the new mini will be a great value for the price.

the new mini is expected to become available spring of 2024.
