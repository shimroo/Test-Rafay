i recently had the pleasure to work with atty marianna seiler at tripp scott as i navigated the sale of my small business to a much larger firm.  marianna guided me every step of the way, protected my interests, and took the time to explain some of the more complicated details of the transaction to me in such a way that i felt very comfortable. the transaction completed on-schedule and i couldn't be happier that i chose tripp scott to represent me with this sale.

i've been working with tripp scott for over a year now. tanya bower supported us in updating our corporate documents and creating a partnership agreement. after interviewing several attorneys, i'm so happy i made the choice to go with tripp scott.
