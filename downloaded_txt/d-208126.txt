most important variable


leave a reply 


“but, shouldn’t we start with the great management books in the literature?” leonard questioned. “i mean the great management books, not the mediocre, not the lousy ones. those people have tried and failed, tried again and finally succeeded. shouldn’t i pay attention to how they did it?”
“how they did it, might be instructive,” i replied. “if you were in those exact circumstances, at that exact time and if you were who they were. but you’re not. you expect all things to be equal. your circumstances are different, your time is different. most importantly, you are different. the cogent variable is not the step-by-step instructions. the most important variable is you.”

the way it works


leave a reply 


“so you are not so high on reading books about leadership?” leonard pushed back. “you read books on leadership. are you saying that i shouldn’t listen to you. after all, you are the teacher.”
i smiled. “yes, i read books. and, you choose whether to listen to me or not, it’s your choice. i know for a fact that i cannot teach leadership or management. it doesn’t happen that way. i also know, for a fact, that leadership or management can be learned. that’s the way it works.”

real life


leave a reply 


“i just read this great new book on leadership,” leonard reported.
“great,” i replied. “it’s always good to feed your head with new ideas.”
“no, i mean, this guy really hit the head of the nail. i think this will help me get the to root of some of the problems i experience with my team,” leonard said. “do you want me to tell you the ideas?”
“nope,” i smiled. “information on how to do something may be helpful, but it’s the application, the implementation that is more important. rather than you tell me the great ideas in the book, go back to your team and apply those ideas. next week, you can tell me how the ideas worked in real life.”

watch what they do


leave a reply 


“i’m not sure i get it,” said rolando. “i talked to my team, asked them to explain how they would solve the problem. they gave me really good answers. almost perfect. i left and came back. they were still struggling with the problem, trying to fix it the old way.”
“if we really want to understand someone,” i replied, “as the leader of the pack, can sit down and have a conversation. we can go really deep. a conversation is very expedient. but, if you really want to understand someone, watch what they do. often, we can talk a good game, execution is a different story. the best measure of performance is performance.”**

long term consequence


leave a reply 


“clarity, competence, habits, conscientiousness. there’s more?” mariana asked.
“i told you that making performance necessary was not a simple sleight of hand, or even a hat trick of three,” i said.  “the most powerful element of necessity is consequences. and, i am not talking about pizza for the team for a job well done. necessity becomes a part of a person’s life.  long term consequences. over a decade, the difference in a person’s life has to do with clarity of aim, competence to perform, positive habits that build momentum and conscientiousness to persist toward the goal, in spite of obstacles. that difference is the consequence that matters in our quality of life.
“for you, as a leader, you must surround yourself, build your team with people who see performance as necessary. not only for your goals, but for their own personal aspirations.”

conscientiousness


leave a reply 


mariana counted on her fingers. “necessity requires clarity, competence and habits,” she nodded.
i smiled. “did i mention conscientiousness?.** it’s a mental state related to personal responsibility. you would observe conscientiousness in the things a person feels obligated to do, in their persistence to complete a task, to maintain necessary standards.”
“how will i know, if a person is conscientious or not?” mariana asked.
“it’s there in front of you to observe. given a task, the person may have a few questions, but they do not procrastinate. they get right to it and work to the end. they will never ask – is that good enough? if you were clear in the standard, they will know what is good enough.”
“we started this discussion,” mariana said, “because you told me the reason my team underperformed is because i had not made the performance standard necessary. making performance necessary must be my accountability.”
i nodded in agreement, before i added one more thing.

necessary habits


leave a reply 


“more?” mariana repeated.
“yes, understanding necessity is not a simple salvo,” i replied. “it’s more complex with several factors. we have talked about clarity. you, as the manager, cannot make something necessary unless its standard is clear. the second element of necessity is competence. you cannot make something necessary for a team unless the team has the requisite competence to meet the standard. the third element is habits.
“for something to be necessary, there can be no choice. yoda says there is no try, there is only do. the team cannot choose to perform to a standard that it necessary, they must be in the habit of performing to that standard, because it is necessary.
“habits are routine, grooved behaviors in pursuit of the goal. we have good habits and bad habits. good habits support our pursuit toward the goal. bad habits support our travel away from the goal. even habits are a part of necessity. we do not choose our habits, our habits choose us. movement toward the goal requires a set of necessary habits. your choice is only whether to move toward the goal or away from the goal. aim high.”

necessity requires?


leave a reply 


“if i want to make high performance necessary, i have to be clear,” mariana repeated.  “and, i have to make that clarity understood.  not what i understand, but what my team understands.”
i smiled. “and there is more.”
“more?”
“more.  you can make the performance standard clear, but the team may not have the competence to make it happen.  necessity requires competence.  a team without competence, in spite of necessity, will never perform at standard.  necessity requires both clarity and competence.”
mariana nodded.  “and, if they are not competent?”
“you are the manager,” i replied. “if the team members are not competent, why did you pick them?”
“at the time, i didn’t know if they were competent.  they looked competent, sounded competent.  i thought they had potential, that’s why i picked them.”
“competence starts with potential.  you assembled the team.  then, what did you do?”
“well, we started with training,” she explained.
“you described, you demonstrated, they tried, you coached, they tried again, they practiced, you tested, they practiced more.  you put them through drills, pace and quality.  pace and quality, until you, as the manager were satisfied at their level of competence. necessity requires both clarity and competence.”
mariana sighed acceptance.
“and, there’s more.”

more powerful than yelling


leave a reply 


“we missed our target,” mariana complained. “again, we missed our target.”
“how so?” i asked.
“there are just so many hours in the day, so many minutes in the hour. i just can’t get the results we hoped for,” she explained.
“you are not getting the performance you want because you have not made it necessary,” i said.
“what do you mean?” mariana wanted to know.
“raise your hand,” i continued. “raise your hand as high as you can.”
mariana was puzzled but complied.
“now, raise it higher,” i smiled.
her head dropped, but she raised her hand higher.
“so, why didn’t you raise your hand as high as you could, when i first asked?”
“i don’t know,” mariana replied, still puzzled.
“you didn’t do it, because it was not necessary. i did not make it necessary for you to perform at that higher level.”
“so, to make performance necessary, high performance necessary, as a manager, what do i do? yell at the team?”
“yelling only works in the short term and is only practiced by parents who have no children. parents who have children know that yelling does not work. yelling does not create necessity. necessity is much more powerful than yelling.” i nodded.
“so, how?” mariana was curious. “if necessity is so powerful, how do we create necessity?”
“there are many ways,” i continued to nod. “let me ask again. when i first asked you to raise your hand as high as possible, you thought you did, but you didn’t. why not?”
“well,” mariana thought harder, “i thought you just wanted me to raise my hand high.  i didn’t know you wanted me to stretch.”
“part of necessity is clarity.  not clarity in my mind, but clarity in your mind.  clarity in the mind of the team.  we cannot make something necessary unless the standards of performance are clearly perceived by the team.”

perfectly in flow


leave a reply 


“my team struggled with this problem all last week,” regina was almost giddy.  “i took one look at it and knew exactly what to do.  like a pop up fly right into my glove.  it’s really satisfying to solve a problem, almost by instinct.”
“you seem pleased,” i responded.
“perfectly in flow,” she replied.  “athletes get like that sometimes, where the world slows down, they are one with the motion that perfectly connects.”
“and, your team?  what of your team?”
“they were relieved.  it was a really hard problem.  they discovered the cause, and generated some alternative solutions.  it was actually staring them in the face, but the real solution, the one that saved the day was the first part of one alternative connected with the back end of another.  honestly, i don’t know why they didn’t see it.”
“and, you, in flow, took their discovery away?”
regina’s delight turned cold.  “it’s not like i took candy from a baby,” she defended.  “i solved a problem for them.”
“so, the next time your team struggles with a problem, what are they going to do?  who are they going to call on?”
