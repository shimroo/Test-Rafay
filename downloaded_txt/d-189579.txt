piper’s story
meet piper – a teenager whose love for life and self-expression has given the therapeutic experts in kidspeace’s intensive behavioral health services a new perspective on what it means to be “helping kids live their best lives.”

kayla’s story
the video, kayla’s story, is told through the kidspeace “lending my voice” technique – which captures the essence of the family’s inspirational journey while protecting them from the re-traumatizing effects of the continuing stigma surrounding mental health issues in our society.

margie’s story
meet margie – a woman who came to kidspeace residential treatment as a teenager with a history of trauma and self-harming – and the belief that none of the authority figures in her life cared about her safety.  but at kidspeace, she says, she found caring staff that could help provide a safe place for her to work through her challenges.
