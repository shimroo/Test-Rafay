client’s testimonals
our notable reputation speaks for itself.





 
"clarity and accuracy of information is important to the work we do - we rely on schreiber to prepare translations that make our work easier. we recommend them to our clients above other agencies because of their quick turn-around time, friendly customer service, and excellent work."
kenneth w., a not-for-profit educational evaluation service



 
"our translators/interpreters were excellent. in addition to translating several nasa presentations from english text to russian and delivering multiple copies to meeting attendees in moscow, they supported two full days of discussions with excellent interpretation. i can highly recommend these services for future nasa needs."
neal n., national aeronautics & space administration







 
"i would like to express my appreciation for your recent service. we were faced with an urgent deadline and required a number of pages of technical language translated from english to portuguese for filing in the brazilian patent office. this translation was provided within 24 hours via e-mail, and we were able to forward this to our associates in brazil in time to meet our deadline. thanks again for your wonderful service, we will be sure to contact you in the future with our translation needs."
susan c., major law firm in dc metro area
