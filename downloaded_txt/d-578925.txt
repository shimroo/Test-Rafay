lakidaai got assassin's creed. i think i need a controller, i keep stabbing people on accident when all i wanted to do was gently shove them out the way. this is why he took your badge and your gun. well that and not following the, y'know, assassin's creed.

practically amazing

lakidaalj friends: what is your opinion on a warhammer 40k rp. on a space station for ease of mashing things together. meddling adeptus mechanicus sociologists making you do stuff. psykers! possibly orks! come on you totally wanna play a ig joe stranded on the station thanks to a night in the drunk-tank.e: there will totally be the shortest app known to man and i will personally write how does mine 40k because it is a ridic setting that is literally the cover to a metal album half the time.
