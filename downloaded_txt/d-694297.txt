tod christie 



					i highly recommend horizontes when booking your vacation in costa rica. i have organized many international vacations, and horizontes put together an exceptional itinerary and greatly simplified the process at little cost. also, they provided support throughout the trip, so we never thought we had to figure things out on our own.				












 










dana blumenfeld levine 



					horizontes and josé huertas worked very patiently with me for quite some time, on a personalized two-week trip. we were able to get to all the destinations we wanted, and in all the places we enjoyed the kindest, most affable and patient guides, plus they were very knowledgeable. the transfers were very punctual and everything went very well. i realized that we only saw a fraction of beautiful costa rica, and i can't wait to go back and see more!				












 










paul piergross 



					based on previous reviews, i chose horizontes for my itinerary that included 5 cities around costa rica, and they did not disappoint. the guides were more than helpful and knowledgeable, making the trip very rewarding. the hotels offered clean rooms with wonderful views. the overall trip was a great experience and has become one of my favorites.				












 










jack brown 



					the trip was more than we imagined! horizontes selections and services were excellent. when they picked us up at the airport everything went perfectly. grano de oro was excellent; the superior room was magnificent. the drivers were always on time, pleasant, and efficient, and the transportation was modern and comfortable. dantica lodge is lovely, the food is very good.				












 










norine wilson 



					we had an amazing trip to costa rica. we really enjoyed the different areas of your country and definitely look forward to coming back.
the guides were extremely good and personable as well as passionate about all the nature we saw.
the drivers sent to pick us up were always on time and their vehicles were well maintained.
the accommodation was comfortable and the staff helpful and very welcoming. we ate at each other's restaurants. the food and the atmosphere were wonderful. they all served local foods, which is what i want when visiting another country.
they have a wonderful country. i hope we can visit again.
