what do pro divers think about sea bees?
 sea bees diving is my first choice!







even though living in thailand and being part of the scuba diving industry, i don`t get to dive as often as i wish. but if i have the chance to go out on a dive trip, sea bees diving is my first choice. the boats, the scuba equipment, the staff, the food and the drinks, everything is just as it should be!
