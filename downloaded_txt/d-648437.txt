international year of microcredit 2005





































 





microcredit has been changing people's lives and revitalizing
    communities since the beginning of trade. currently microentrepreneurs use
    loans as small as $100 to grow thriving business and, in turn, provide their
    families, leading to strong and flourishing local economies. the year of
    microcredit 2005 calls for building inclusive financial sectors and strengthening
    the powerful, but often untapped, entrepreneurial spirit existing in communities
    around the world.

"the great challenge before us is to address the constraints
            that exclude people from full participation in the financial sector.
            together, we can and must build inclusive financial sectors that
            help people improve their lives."
