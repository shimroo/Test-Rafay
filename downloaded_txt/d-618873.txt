vitality program
a framework for longevity/health
what makes a centenarian? a plan for a healthy lifestyle! the human genome of our ancestral hunter-gatherer was not intended for our contemporary toxic built environment where our genes no longer match the environment.
therefore, we must be cunning with our tactics to adapt & thrive in this new & hazardous environment.
the approach includes optimizing lifestyle behaviours (exercise, nutritional biochemistry, sleep, stress management)

there is no one-size-fits-all solution; the prescription is individualized
create a performance longevity playbook (you eat what you kill)
empowering your performance
take action: it's not easy to change habits. we can show you how!
allow for some tinkering, discovery & experimentation, so that optimal, individualized solutions can become a way of life

the vitality membership gives you a specific individualized program based off of our comprehensive assessment that is sustainable and allows you to keep doing the things you love to do for a very long time!

pursuit program
the pursuit for longevity -
exercise is the most powerful longevity drug!

how can we prepare for being a ‘centenarian olympian’? the pursuit membership will show you how!
the logical first step in our quest to defy time is to get our metabolic house in order and exercise is the medicine!
understand your nutritional biochemistry, which explains the complex, intertwined processes of nutrients and metabolism.
learning other key recovery tools to help your pursuit for longevity

physical fitness and nutritional biochemistry is the key to healthspan. the physical outcome of regular exercise is improved muscle mass - the engine of metabolism - learn how to keep your engine running at full capacity for increased longevity and reduce the risk of chronic disease outcomes through our comprehensive plan and discover the pursuit for longevity!

our philosophy – pillars of longevity:
laugh often, love yourself
eat for fuel
