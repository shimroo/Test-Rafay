seed seminar

seed (seeking educational equity and diversity)

redwood day is one of a growing number of schools across the globe participating in the 35 year old seed project, founded by peggy mcintosh, at the wellesley centers for women. seed participants seek to examine our own lives/backgrounds and to learn about others in order to create a community where all members are supported and valued. participants engage in activities, readings, and films that focus on diversity and connection. learning more about ourselves and listening to each other helps create and support a more balanced, equitable, inclusive and understanding community. seed is open to all redwood day faculty/staff and is co-facilitated by ash black and jodi freedman.

                        this past sunday, september 8th, the redwood day community came out in full force as an official contingent of the oakland pride parade. as i arrived in downtown oakland at 10:00 a.m., the crowds were already gathering, and i was curious about how many people from our school community would show up. as soon as that thought crossed my mind, i immediately began seeing our familiar redwood day oakland pride t-shirts attached to smiling faces from a bunch of our rd fam from a wide array of ages and backgrounds.
