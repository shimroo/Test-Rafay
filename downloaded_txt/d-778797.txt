welcome to rockford bell credit union

rockford bell credit union was first organized in 1935 by a group of rockford employees of illinois bell telephone company and their families. the credit union prospered for many years as an employee credit union for the local telephone company. the early history of this credit union is marked by commitment to a concept of community and mutual support.
