 sunday the 16th of january 2025 
welcome to dandelion botanical company!
announcing community acupuncture at dandelion botanical company!

what is community acupuncture?

community acupuncture is the practice of treating patients with acupuncture
and east asian medicine in a protected communal space. we mainly utilize a protocol called nada. nada 
involves the gentle placement of up to five small, sterilized disposable needles into specific sites
on each ear. the recipients sit quietly in a group setting for 20-30+ minutes, allowing the treatment
to take effect. nada ear acupuncture is an adjunct therapy which is clinically effective, cost-efficient,
drugfree and compatible cross-culturally.

healing center acupuncture services will be provided by theresa churchill.
