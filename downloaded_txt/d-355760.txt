 dream  puppetswelcome to dream puppets australiatbrilliant black light and imaginative puppet theatreby richard hart and julia davisdream puppets was founded in melbourne by richard hart in 1996, but relocated to south australia in 2024.   the company   has performed its brilliantly visual and distinctive style of productions to audiences of all ages in australia and around the world continuously for over a quarter of a century. the purpose of dream puppets is to stimulate and nourish the imagination, one of the most important and useful faculties human beings possess. not surprisingly, to do so, also results in entertainment, and the company has been excelling in these areas by exploring the boundless magic of puppetry. the most recent productions have made extensive use of blacklight, a style in which the puppeteer is dressed in black velvet against a black velvet backdrop. all the puppets and props in black light puppet theatre are painted in special fluorescent colours and the lighting is specially designed to make the puppeteer invisible. the result is truly magical. richard and julia create and design their own shows and construct all the puppets.â¨the dreamer  productions use the blacklight style fully. these shows have been performed all over australia, including the outback, and have been performed internationally to great acclaim at festivals in israel, japan, korea, singapore , argentina, china  and italyâs largest children's theatre festival, i teatri del mondo.  the shakespeare in schools series (not blacklight) is designed to engage students (primary and secondary) with shakespeareâs plays through a combination  of original language, modern text,  puppetry, live  music and student participation. dream puppets have explored and presented puppet theatre in a range of styles and mediums and have worked as artists in residence in many melbourne schools and art venues.enter text
