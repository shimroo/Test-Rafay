airpot corporation company







it was the early 1950’s when an ingenious industrialist by the name of arthur cohen invented the airpot dashpot.
a graduate of the massachusetts institute of technology and subsequent founder of the electric regulator corporation in 1945, mr. cohen invented, manufactured and successfully marketed a line of electromechanical voltage regulators which he named reghom.
the unique design of the regulators required a dashpot with low friction, long life, and high reliability. since no such device was commercially available at the time, mr. cohen designed one himself. to meet the demanding performance requirements of the reghom, he employed a unique combination of materials for the dashpot: graphite and glass.

wire flexure rod assemblies
in an earlier blog, we looked at some ways to connect the airpot piston to a rod. we looked at a rigid rod connection that is rarely used but good to know about and also briefly touched on our standard...

using liquids in airpot air dashpots
occasionally we get asked if liquids can be used in place of air in our dashpots. let’s talk about some of the issues. because liquids are essentially incompressible, a liquid-filled dashpot wouldn’t suffer from the “air spring” effect that all...

using airpot’s piston-cylinders as sliding linear bearings?
we use our graphite pistons and glass cylinders as the core technology to make our air dashpots and low friction air cylinders. some customers go in a different direction and use the piston-cylinders to make sliding linear bearings. let’s talk...
