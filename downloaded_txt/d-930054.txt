our purpose 

the purpose of this site is to provide investors with a place where they can obtain truthful, non biased, factual information about the financial markets. my primary focus is on the stock market, specifically the dow jones industrial average, the s&p 500, the gold market, the dollar, t-bonds and even oil. the information presented in this site is based on technical analysis.  it is not based on the hope and hype heard by the so-called mainstream "analysts."
