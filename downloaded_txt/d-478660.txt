recent reviewseducating rita
“amazing production. thank you so much! i haven’t enjoyed a play at the theatre this much in years.” – joanne horrocks
 “a fantastic production, superb acting from both actors. i thoroughly enjoyed it. well done to all!” – anna maria vesey
dark sublime
 “i was there as an audience member last night!  wow!… love… love… loved dark sublime.  outstanding performance by all the cast.  ‘performance’ undersells each and every one playing their believable character; they didn’t ‘perform’, they were their character!” – sam

waiting for godot
“it could be seen as a bold, even reckless, thing for amateurs to stage this piece.  your production was a triumph.  the clear and consistent characterisations from the actors; the maturity of performance from each one: these raised the level to something above the amateur level.” – greg wright
