due 
	to the covid-19 virus, i will not be teaching in my 



	park ridge, new jersey studio until further notice. 



	all lessons will be 


	virtual, with 


	zoom, which is a free program.
the lessons will be of 
	the same fine quality, with the convenience of 

staying in your home, 
	and keeping everyone safe at this time. 




 






directions for scheduling lessons:
download and install zoom. (free) 
https://zoom.us/download
call me to 
	set up a weekly lesson time. 
201 707-9203
($40 for 45 minutes)

the day before the lesson, 


	(you will need to have a free paypal account)
send $40 via paypal to
	leezak69@verizon.net  i will 
	reply that the lesson is paid for.


	  open zoom 10 minutes before the lesson, 
	and at the time of the lesson, i will connect 
	with you using your email address. 




	it is best to have a decent microphone & speakers. lessons will work with any 
	computer, smartphone or tablet, but the quality will depend upon your setup.
