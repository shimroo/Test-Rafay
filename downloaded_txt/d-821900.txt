our story
richland carrousel park opened in 1991 as the first new, hand-carved carrousel to be built and operated in the united states since the 1930s. the carrousel figures were carved in the style of g.a. dentzel, one of the most revered carvers of the early 1900s.
the richland carrousel is home to 30 horses and 22 menagerie figures, including 4 bears, 4 ostriches, 4 cats, 4 rabbits, a goat, giraffe, lion, tiger, zebra and a mythical hippocampus. all 52 figures were designed, carved and painted by carrousel works in mansfield, ohio.
