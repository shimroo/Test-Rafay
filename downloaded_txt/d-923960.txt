	 sniffin' the ether v2.0
	 



a long time ago i wrote the first incarnation of this document. i was aiming at something that would  explain sniffers and sniffer technology to people who are not all that familiar with security (i.e. newbies) as well as providing a accessible reference to more experienced individuals. i think that i've stricken a good balance judging from all of the emails that i received (including a few from some kiddies that were clearly running sniffers on networks other than theirs). as time went on, more and more unique and interesting things were being done with sniffers. i intended on revising this document to reflect these new changes but i have used every excuse in the book to put off this revision. a quick note: you (the reader) will no doubtfully realize that there is no flow to this article. the reason for this is because like i stated in the above that one of the goals is to also act as a reference for a more experienced person so by keeping it modular provides the reader with the ability to read a specific section without having to refer to another for background reference.

	 cracking windows vista beta 2 local passwords (sam and syskey)
	 



cracking windows vista beta 2 local passwords (sam and syskey)  while i was playing around with windows vista beta 2 i decided to see if some of the old tools for cracking local account password still worked. it would seem that microsoft has changed how the sam file and syskey work in vista so none of my old tricks that use to work with nt 4/2000/xp functioned anymore. i quickly found that most of the current tools as of this writing(ophcrack 2.3, cain 2.9, saminside 2.5.7.0, pwdump3) no longer work, which i have mixed feelings about. it's nice to see the extra level of security, but cracking local passwords was always sort of fun as well as useful from time to time. link http://irongeek.com/i.php?page=security/vistasamcrack added by dancho danchev 25.07.2006

	 email obfuscation tool
	 



email obfuscation tool  unfortunately, including a mailto link on your page is like rolling out the welcome mat for spambots.the following script scrambles the given email address, and then encodes the appropriate unscrambling algorithm in hex. it offers quite a bit more obscurity than the standard techniques, because the unencoded text contains no semblance of an email address, and will most likely be ignored by most harvesters, although i make no guarantees. link http://www.nerdparadise.com/index.php?content_id=95 added by dancho danchev 20.07.2006
