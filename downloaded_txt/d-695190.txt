attention students!
as of february 1st, student laptops are no longer be able to access portable flash drives. there have been a number of security issues impacting users in all areas of the district, students and staff included. the function of reading a flash drive has been disabled on all student laptop computers there are a number of methods available to share files and continue to collaborate with peers in classrooms. the district has developed a quick reference illustrating how to share files in microsoft onedrive, canvas, and through student’s pcsb e-mail. student e-mail accounts are unable to receive messages from outside of the district, only internally. visit https://tinyurl.com/pcsbfiletransfermethods to view and download this reference sheet.
 
vision - 100% student success
mission - the community of east lake high school will develop productive and responsible students who are prepared for post-secondary education, the workforce and citizenship.
