headquarters

































































































 











the universal life church has no traditional
                    doctrine. we as an organization believe in that which is right.
                    each individual has the privilege and responsibility to determine
                    what is right for themselves, as long as it does not infringe
                    on the rights of others. we do not stand between you and your
                    god. we are active advocates of the first amendment of the
                    constitution of the united states of america.
we are advocates of the good life! we want
                    to be competent, to be proficient, to be cooperative, to love
                    our fellow man, to appreciate, to be humble, to be honest,
                    to be moral, to live positively, to be what we profess.
