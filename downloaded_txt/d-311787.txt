          conservation and research          

          our mission is the conservation of birds of prey. the simplicity of this statement belies the complexity of the tasks it requires and the long-term commitment and investment. the threats facing bird of prey populations around the world are numerous. a majority of bird of prey species are under pressure to a lesser or greater extent and the conservation actions used to defend against these threats are varied and often innovative. as a result, our operational philosophy is one of evidence-based conservation management. our conservation and research work takes place in the uk and overseas.

          education          

          education is a key part of conservation and is a fundamental element of everything we do. the more people know about the work we do and the importance of looking after birds of prey, then the greater chance we have of protecting them.

          rehabilitation          

          our national bird of prey hospital™ can receive and treat more than 200 sick, injured or orphaned birds of prey each year. our hospital also acts as the base for our research projects that benefit wild, injured and rehabilitated, birds of prey.
