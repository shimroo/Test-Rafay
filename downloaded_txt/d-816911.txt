the network for championing global citizenship education in scotland














the international development education association of scotland (ideas) is a network of organisations and individuals across scotland involved in global citizenship education.we believe that young people gain important skills, values and understanding through good global citizenship education (gce). and we believe that a well networked gce sector can support teachers and policy makers to deliver the best possible gce in our schools and youth services, growing globally minded, informed and active citizens and communities. our role as a network is to enable relationships, share learning and advocate for best practice.
























what is global citizenship?
ideas sees global citizenship as a way of living that recognises our world as an increasingly complex web of connections and interdependencies. a world in which our choices and actions may have repercussions for people and communities locally, nationally or internationally.

global citizenship in the curriculum
gce is embedded within scotland’s curriculum for excellence, as a part of the ‘learning for sustainability’ framework. this framework encompasses a wide range of interconnected themes and approaches across sustainable development education, outdoor learning and global citizenship.
