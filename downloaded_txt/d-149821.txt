tribute to jimmy seals




jimmy grew up in poor, bleak areas of west texas, mastered several instruments, and became a gifted spiritually-themed songwriter when he studied the sacred writings of the baha’i faith. in conversation, jimmy was always searching and espousing themes of unity, justice, and world peace. his musical style went far beyond the soft rock label. he could play old-time fiddle tunes, sing with soul, spin coltrane-inspired solos on the sax, and nail down a hard rock groove on electric guitar as well. he experimented with two-toned throat singing. but it was his songwriting, acoustic guitar work, and elaborate collaborations with the voice and mandolin of dash crofts that took flight. jimmy was a humble humanitarian, helping countless families in costa rica when he moved there to establish a coffee farm. most of all, he was kind-hearted and a father figure to many.   (see jimmy seals’ obituary in rolling stone)
