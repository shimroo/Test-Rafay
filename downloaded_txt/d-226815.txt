why we say “to the max”
we want to encourage development and economic growth in nevada. we also want people to experience all of the beauty and fun the desert has to offer. but only to the point it doesnât harm desert creatures like mojave max. so letâs learn, explore, shred, and buildâ¦to the max!

mojave max is here for the students of ccsd and the youth of southern nevada. the desert tortoise and desert ecosystem are fascinating and exciting things to explore and protect for the future enjoyment of the next generation of nevadans.

hikers, bikers, climbers, shooters and outdoors enthusiasts unite! this is your playground, filled with breathtaking trails, parks and outdoor spaces. the multiple species habitat conservation plan (mshcp) is working for you, and everyone who enjoys the outdoors.

southern nevada off highway vehicle (ohv) enthusiasts have access to an astonishing amount of public landsâsome 11,000 square miles! but the desert is more delicate than it appears. stay on trails, avoid sensitive areas and preserve your right to ride.

weâre here to help. if it werenât for the folks at the dcp, you may not be able to get your projects off the ground. let us help you streamline your approval process by resolving the issue of desert tortoise mitigation. letâs partner and keep southern nevada thriving together.
