beyond confined space





as i mentioned in last week's farewell post (here, if you missed it), i will try to keep you up to date on places you can go to find similar information and analysis. here's the first installment:workplace health and safety newsthe pump handle is an excellent blog that covers regulatory issues. to fill some of the gap left by the termination of confined space, the pump handle has launched a new feature, confined space@tph, that will keep up on workplace safety and health news.starting next week, tammy miser will continue the misnamed the weekly tollevery two weeks on its own page.you should also bookmark the award-winning hazards magazine, run by the intrepid rory o'neill and friends. hazards has health and safety news and a toolbox of indepth information about every conceivable health and safety issue.the labor news service, labourstart runs a health and safety page. if you have a webpage, you can also set up a health and safety feed (check out the right-hand column of confined space)the calosha reporter offers a free daily news digest. despite its name, it covers more than just california news.  you read the on-line version here or subscribe to the daily e-mail.for immigrant issues, you can't go wrong with working immigrantsfor workers compensation news, check out workers comp insider.for general public health news and commentary (as well as excellent writing), there's no better place to go than effect measure.labor newslabourstart also runs an excellent labor news service, sorted by country. us labor news is here. if you have a webpage, you can run the labourstart newsfeed.rawblogxport runs a labor news blog as well, with short excerpts for labor articles.mick arran has resurrected dispatch from the trenches, a labor commentary blog, and, in honor of the demise of confined space, has added a feature called trenchnews, "a round-up of some of the news stories on unions and labor issues that the msm either buries in the business pages or doesn’t cover at all."well, that should do it for now. i'll continue to keep you updated as new workplace safety resources come on line.

goodbye: the final curtain comes down






as i mentioned last night, this will be my last confined space post. next week i start work at the house education and labor committee. if you're on line now (9:00 - 11:00 pm est), welcome. please use the comments all the way down at the bottom of this post (below the last song) and "refresh" occasionally to keep up to date. (of course, some people decided to start the party early. check out the comments under last night's post.)

over the past four years, i’ve written more than 2,800 posts here at confined space. my original goal was not just to educate people about what is happening in american workplaces, but also to put workplace safety and health into a political context. you won't read in any newspapers that if the 12 deaths at sago last year, or the 15 deaths at the bp texas city refinery the year before had been the only workplace fatalities on those days, those would have been good days in the american workplace. more than 15 workers are killed every day on the job in this country and a worker becomes injured or ill on the job every 2.5 seconds. the overwhelming majority of deaths, injuries and illnesses could have been easily prevented had the employers simply provided a safe workplace and complied with well-recognized osha regulations or other safe practices.

and you'll never learn from the evening news that we have more fish and wildlife inspectors than osha inspectors, or that the penalties from a chemical release that kills fish is higher than a chemical release that kills a worker. not many are aware that workers are often afraid to complain about health and safety hazards or file a complaint with osha. almost no one understands that osha inspections are so infrequent and penalties for endangering workers are so insignificant that there is almost no disincentive for employers to break the law. employers are almost never criminally prosecuted for killing workers even when they knew they were violating osha standards.

you know these things. but most americans – including our political leaders -- don’t have a clue. and most of this nation’s newspapers and other media aren’t helping.

and there are still far too many health and safety professionals that don’t understand that to a very great extent, who lives and who dies in the workplace is determined by politics – both power relationships in the workplace, and traditional politics that determines who controls our government. what that means is that organizing unions and electing politicians who will fight against unlimited corporate control over our regulatory agencies, our workplaces and the environment are of vital importance to protecting the health and safety of american workers.

two events inspired me to launch this blog in march 2003. following the deaths of the columbia astronauts in 2002, i woke up one morning realizing that while a few workers killed in a workplace accident sometimes receive enormous media attention, most workers die alone and unnoticed by anyone except their immediate families and friends. something had to be done to ensure that these thousands aren’t dying in vain.

the second event was the repeal of the osha ergonomics standard by the republican congress and the bush white house. that travesty of justice taught me that if we’re going to make – and sustain -- any progress on workplace safety in this country, many more people have to understand what’s happening in american workplaces, the political context in which these tragedies occur, and the need to organize on a local and national level. or, as michael silverstein wrote in his recent paper discussing the future of osha, "political change must precede policy change.”

when i started confined space in march 2003, it was all about me – a way to vent, which i needed (thanks to our president and his cronies), a reason to write (or rant) -- which i enjoy (and will miss) -- and a way to keep in touch with friends and colleagues who i was afraid i’d lose track of.

but based on the mail i get from people, confined space became much more – a source of much-needed news about what’s happening in our workplaces and government agencies and a voice for those feeling politically frustrated. but most important – and most unexpected -- it became a way for family members and loved ones of those lost to the workplace to find meaning in the death of their loved ones, a voice for their anger and a constructive direction to fight the system that took their loved ones away.  and perhaps it even provided some ideas and tools that they could use to wage their struggle.

writing this blog became a learning experience for me as well. not just that it forced me to keep up with what was happening in the world of workplace safety, but the weekly toll (thanks tammy) and the thoughtful and angry notes and comments i received from the families and friends of those killed in the workplace, brought me closer to the human tragedies faced by thousands of american families every year. confined space provided a place for them to tell their stories, stories that are almost never heard in our newspapers, magazines, radio or tv. and with that came a renewed sense of meaning and inspiration -- raw energy – to challenge the low priority that the politicians and media in this country give to workplace safety and workers’ health and lives.

but at the same time, i’m tired -- bone tired – not just from lack of sleep (i didn’t have the luxury that some bloggers enjoy -- being able to blog at work), but also from writing the same sad stories – with different names and details – over and over again. more and more frequently i’ve gotten the sense that i’m repeating myself; i’m not sure i have anything new to say anymore. and maybe there isn’t really anything new to say; maybe it’s always the same basic story; only the names and dates change. and so, although it’s incredibly hard to think about leaving this behind, this is an opportunity to move beyond writing to facilitate change.

before i go, there are a few people i need to thank. actually, there are hundreds that i need to thank, but a few require special mention – particularly jonathan bennett at nycosh, rory o’neill at hazards and tony oppegard for keeping me supplied with news and perspective that i might otherwise have missed. journalists ken ward at the charleston gazette, andrew schneider at the baltimore sun, steve franklin at the chicago tribune and david barstow at the ny times deserve lots of credit for going the extra miles to dig out the stories behind the stories and setting a standard that every journalist should strive to live up to.

but most of all i want to thank the families -- the wives, husbands, daughters, sons, brothers, sisters, fathers and mothers of those chewed up and spit out by the system of work in this country. the courage, creativity and resolve displayed by tammy miser, coit smith, mary vivenzi, irene warnock, misty plante, michelle marts, becky foster, barb parker, holly shaw, sharon nichols, kelly heilert, michelle lewis, robin harpster, adam turem, donna puleio spadaro, patience buck-clarry, melissa king, phyllis oliver and betsy shonkwiler to name just a very few who have shared their sorrow, their anger and their energy, have nourished me with the inspiration and fuel to carry on through the late nights and early mornings.

and, of course, i need to thank my wife, jessie, and the kids (nicole, madeleine and william) for giving me a far longer leave of absence from many familial duties than anyone really deserves.

finally, i'd be remiss is i didn't thank the bush administration appointees, many congresspersons and senators, and scores of negligent employers for ensuring that there wasn't a single day over the past four years that i didn't have plenty to write about.

i do have one major disappointment, though – that this blog is going out childless, without issue. i had hoped for some offspring. you know, a few similarly crazy people out there who would say “hey, this is a good idea, but he’s missing a bunch of stuff,” or “what a clutz. i can say this better,” or “he’s full of shit. listen to me."  so that when i passed on, there would be two, five, a dozen workplace safety blogs to carry on.

but don’t despair. i’ve been having conversations with people about continuing some parts of confined space, and tammy will continue the weekly toll from another (to be announced) location. the pump handle will be carrying on with some of the more newsy parts of confined space. to the extent other blogs start picking up some of this work, i’ll announce it here and in mailings to my list. and the archives will remain as a resource.

so, has this blog had any impact on improving the conditions for workplace safety in this country? maybe. enough? not nearly. since i started this blog, the afl-cio has dismantled its safety and health department, osha has issued only one new, weak standard (under court order) and expanded its voluntary programs at the expense of enforcement. immigrant fatalities continue to grow, coal mine fatalities more than doubled last year, the bush administration continues to appoint political cronies and union busters to agencies entrusted with ensuring workers lives and well-being and congressional oversight became a thing of the past -- until now. (on the other hand, when i started this blog, president bush’s favorable ratings were in the 70’s and republicans held both houses of congress. now he’s in the low 30’s, the dems have taken charge of congress, and they’ve hired me.) the real test of success is how many more workplace safety activists exist today than existed four years ago.

what comes next? i know what comes next for me. but what about you? what needs to be done and how are we going to do it? chew on that for a while.

as journalist bill moyers wrote in a recent must-read article in the nation, 

the eight-hour day, the minimum wage, the conservation of natural resources, free trade unions, old-age pensions, clean air and water, safe food--all these began with citizens and won the endorsement of the political class only after long struggles and bitter attacks. democracy works when people claim it as their own.
and that goes for workplace safety as well.

in 1970, congress passed, and president nixon signed a radical new law promising 

to assure safe and healthful working conditions for working men and women 
in other words, a safe workplace became a right, not a privilege to be enjoyed only when a company is making a good profit. thirty-five years later, that promise not only remains unfulfilled, but has taken several major steps backward over the past several years.

and to quote myself at the 2004 apha occupational health section awards luncheon: 

we need to make it clear that the right to a safe workplace wasn’t bestowed upon us by concerned politicians or employers who were finally convinced that “safety pays.” the right to a safe workplace was won only after a long and bitter fight by workers, unions and public health advocates. it was soaked in the blood of hundreds of thousands of coal miners, factory and construction workers. and the current movement to transform the agency into nothing but a coordinator of voluntary alliances is a betrayal of that promise and those lives.
hopefully in my new job, i can help to restore the system of checks and balances that our constitution provides to make sure that our government does what it’s supposed to do.

anyway, as i said. i’m not disappearing, just moving into a different dimension. but before going, i have a couple of favors to ask. please stay in touch. save my e-mail address jbarab@gmail.com. i’ll need your information and inspiration more than ever.

do me just one more big favor: keep informed, stay angry and keep raising hell.

ok, i’m out of here. it’s your turn now. hasta la vista, baby. flights of angels sing me to my rest. and don't be sad. we’ll always have paris.

p.s. like any good union meeting, this blog shouldn’t end without a song. so, everyone, let’s all join hands, click once or twice on the picture below and sing along with pete and the weavers. after all, when you really think about it, what force on earth is weaker than the feeble strength of one?

a son, a father, 911 and the president





guests at last night's state of the union address didn't just include basketball players and iraq war veterans. one guest -- who has the most gripping story to tell -- was ignored by the president and the media last night. his name was ceasar borja and he was a guest of ny senator hillary rodman clinton. just two hour before the president began speaking, borja received nows that his father had died.borja's dad, cesar, 52, was a filipino immigrant, a former army paratrooper and an nypd cop who never missed a day of work in 20 years.he volunteered for months of 16-hour shifts at ground zero so he could make overtime for his wife, eva, and their three children: ceasar, whom he called "kuya," the filipino word for older brother; son evan, 16, and daughter nhia, 12.he retired in 2003. he started coughing soon after. by the time he was properly diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis last fall, he could barely walk and his lungs were filled with scar tissue.he checked into mount sinai medical center on dec. 19. he died there at 6 p.m. last night. instead of returning immediately to new york, borja decided to attend the speech.the 21-year-old promised his family that he was going to sit in front of president bush, exactly as planned, to bear witness to the suffering of thousands of others like his dad."he passed away right when i'm down here fighting for him. this is the most i've ever done for dad," he told his mom. "mommy, you know i'm strong, mom. you were with him, though, right? good. that's all that matters to me. comfortably and no pain."borja was shivering as he talked on a dark sidewalk outside a capitol hill restaurant. other ground zero victims and staffers from sen. hillary clinton's office wrapped him in their arms and sat him down at an empty table. tears started to fall."dad always knew the man i could become, and i love him for that," borja said. "dad didn't go down without a fight, mom. you know that."borja is on a mission:  “i want a meeting with the president to make the case directly about how important these health programs are,” borja told the associated press.“i want him to hear from me, how my father died a hero last night, and there are many heroes that will and are continuing to die because they’re not given the proper medical attention or not given enough help from the federal government,” said the 21-year-old college student, his voice breaking with emotion.

what's in a name? (part ii)





william safire in the ny times magazine last sunday has more to say about the name change at my future employer, the house education and labor committee: who says the 110th house of representatives, with democrats in the majority, will be no different from the g.o.p.-dominated 109th? the names, they are a-changin’: the word labor is back, with a capital l. in 1995, when the republicans took over after 40 years — 14,610 interminable days — in the minority wilderness, they changed the name of the education and labor committee to “the committee on education and the workforce.”why? because the word labor, capitalized, was taken to be “big labor” — unions almost monolithically support democrats — and here was a way to go over the union bosses’ heads. the idea was to spread the committee’s jurisdiction over the needs of all workers, especially the majority, who are not union members. (a bit of history: when president nixon accepted george meany’s invitation to attend the annual a.f.l.-c.i.o. convention in bal harbour, fla., meany sat the president in the third row on the platform — an unprecedented snub. charles colson, the white house counsel, came up with a fighting slogan afterward: “remember bal harbour!”)if labor was to be replaced, then with what? not workers; that word is associated with socialism (international workers of the world (sic), or “wobblies”) and communism (in its manifesto, “workers of the world — unite”). but there was another term, coined in 1931, during what revisionist republicans considered the unfairly maligned hoover administration: workforce. most dictionaries gave it two senses (and make it two words): “all employees collectively, or those doing work in a particular firm or industry.”therefore, one of the first actions in what speaker nancy pelosi dubbed “the first 100 hours” of the newly democratic house was to vote that “clause 1(e) of rule 10 is amended by striking ‘committee on education and the workforce’ and inserting ‘committee on education and labor.’ ”

moving on: closing up shop





this is incredibly hard for me, but tomorrow night will be my last blog post on confined space. after much deliberation, i’ve decided to take a new job that makes it impossible to continue.starting next week, i’ll be heading to the house of representatives committee on education and labor, working on osha-related legislation, oversight hearings, investigations, etc. in other words, instead of just writing about what congress and this administration needs to be doing to protect workers, i’ll hopefully be able to directly affect some of those things.if you’re around, stop by here tomorrow (wednesday) night to say goodbye.  i’m inviting you all over to an on-line goodbye party from 9:00 to 11:00 pm est. i’ll take some time to reflect on the past four years, and i’ll be on line, so you can use the comments at the bottom of the last post to wish me well, blast me for leaving, speculate about the future of workplace safety in this country, or predict the next american idol winner.and it’s byob. lots of it.see you tomorrow.update: you can view the wreckage of the party here, and in the comments below this entry and tomorrow's.

libby asbestos activist dies; residents consider buyout





les skramstad died sunday. he was 70.i often complain about how workplace fatalities get very little press. every couple of weeks, tammy and i publish the weekly toll, a partial list of workers killed in the workplace. but that list includes only those workers killed in traumatic accidents -- falls, trench collapses, traffic accidents, etc. it almost never includes the almost 1000 les skramstads who die of workplace related disease, like mesothelioma, every week.but les skramstad was more than just another occupational disease fatality.skramstad had been diagnosed with mesothelioma _ a rare, fast-moving cancer that attacks the lining of the lungs _ about a month ago, his son said. he had several tumors in his stomach and had been previously diagnosed with asbestosis, which has been compared to a slow, constant suffocation.he was best known as a voice for many of libby's sickened residents. he lobbied congress for financial relief for those who could not pay their many medical bills.the vermiculite, used in a variety of household products, contained tremolite asbestos that was released into the air and carried home on miners' clothing. it is blamed by some health authorities for killing about 200 people and sickening one of every eight libby residents. skramstad worked at the mine in the late 1950s and early 1960s.brent skramstad said that he has also developed asbestos-related disease, as did his sister and his mother, norita."hopefully there's somebody who will take his place now," skramstad said of his father. "because this is something you never want to be dropped. you want people to be held accountable for it."in 2005, the justice department indicted the w.r. grace & co. and seven of its current or former executives and department heads for conspiring to conceal information about the hazardous nature of the company’s asbestos contaminated vermiculite products, obstructing the government’s clean-up efforts, and wire fraud. approximately 1,200 residents of libby have been identified as suffering from some kind of asbestos-related disease and over 400 have died.meanwhile, the baltimore sun's andrew schneider, who originally broke the libby story, reports that despite the tens of millions of dollars spent by the enfironmental protection agency to clean up the town, there no one is sure if the town can really be cleaned up enough to be safe. some residents are now suggesting that the epa or grace buy them out so that they can move to a safer location.talk of a buyout took hold after the epa's inspector general said in a report last month that, because the agency has not determined the safe level of human exposure to the asbestos in grace's vermiculite, the "epa cannot be sure that the ongoing libby cleanup is sufficient to prevent humans from contracting asbestos-related diseases."the ig report also said the epa must "fund and execute a comprehensive study to determine the effectiveness of the libby cleanup" with special attention on the effects of asbestos exposure on children.paul peronard, the epa emergency coordinator who has been involved in the cleanup since the beginning in 1999, said, "the epa has no plans for a mass relocation or buyout, although the concept is not off the table. right now the judgment is the community would be better served by fixing the problem in place."however, he added, "there is a possibility that our analytical methods are not sensitive enough to measure down low enough to say there is no risk, and with this type of asbestos we cannot say that we ultimately will know what level will be deemed acceptable."meanwhile, grace, which declared bankruptcy in 2001, has been studying the costs and benefits of a buyout.related storiesin a "go to jail issue" asbestos manufacturers fight to stay free, april 22, 2006hallelujah: grace miraculously cures asbestos victims, november 4th, 2005grace's deadly asbestos tentacles continue to reach across the country, october 2, 2005lessons of hamilton, new jersey, june 29, 2005grace knew about asbestos contamination of nj plant, june 28, 2005 attorney for grace to head epa enforcement, june 27, 2005w.r. grace: did these guys ever tell the truth?, march 4, 2005 asbestos: cruel, deadly and uncompensated, february 19, 2005 libby montana and tort deform: what's wrong with this picture?: february 15, 2005 they were killing us, they were killing our wives and children: february 12, 2005 w.r. grace goes to jail: "why not all the others?": february 10, 2005 w.r. grace execs indicted for asbestos coverup, february 8, 2005

hazardous trenches, good luck and bad journalism






eric moreno is an extremely lucky guy. he was running some sewer pipe down in an unshored 7-8 foot deep trench last week when it collapsed on top of him. he could  only breathe because the brim of his hard hat created a small pocket of air that separated his face from the dirt.

but even a breathing pocket often isn't enough to save the life of a trench collapse victim.  a cubic yard of soil weights about 2700 pounds, the weight of a mid-sized automobile. a trench collapse may contain three to five cubic yards of soil. do the math. even if you're only buried up to your waist, successful rescue is unlikely; you're probably going to die.  i've written before about workers, like mike morrison and willie hodge who both died as a result of trench collapses, even though they were only buried up to their waists.

my beef here is with the articles about moreno's lucky escape. not one of them (here, here, here, and here) mentioned that there is an osha standard that requires trenches deeper than 5 feet to be shored.

as i've written before, it wouldn't have taken the reporter too much time to add some valuable information to this article that might have gone beyond the human interest/shit happens/what-a-lucky-guy focus. if she couldn't spend 15 minutes on the web, she might have even called osha for some general information about trench collapses.

and then the readers (and construction workers) would have known that:

a) this tragedy was preventable
b) the employer was probably breaking the law.
c) trench collapses are not to be taken lightly; most workers don't come out alive.

but moreno's a tough guy: 

despite what was clearly a traumatic experience, moreno said he is not afraid to continue working, and intends to return to work next week. 
moreno works for gregg electric inc. of ontario, a subcontractor for oltmans construction co. of whittier, a general contractor. 
"i don't think i'd hesitate to get right back in," moreno said. "i don't think i have any fears about that."
but if he's being sent down into unprotected 8-foot deep trenches, maybe he should have some fears. maybe he and others working in unsafe workplaces should have been trained about the hazards of trenches and the laws that are meant to control those hazards.

nothing new about trench collapses





check out the weekly toll below and you'll find a familiar entry at the top: a worker crushed to death in a trench collapse. but how could employers know that a trench would collapse? osha's trenching standard for starters.but  dr. michael silverstein also reminds us in his paper, osha at 35, the the hazards of trenching -- and how to prevent trenching casualties --  were well known even before osha issued its standard -- like somewhere around 2300 years before osha. just ask heroditus. all the other nations, therefore, except the phoenicians, had double labour; for the sides of the trench fell in continually, as could not but happen, since they made the width no greater at the top than it was required to be at the bottom. but the phoenicians showed in this the skill which they are wont to exhibit in all their undertakings. for in the portion of the work which was allotted to them they began by making the trench at the top twice as wide as the prescribed measure, and then as they dug downwards approached the sides nearer and nearer together, so that when they reached the bottom their part of the work was of the same width as the rest.-- the histories of herodotus, the persian wars, book 7 polymnia, c. 484 - 425 bc

chilling reading





julie ferguson at workers comp insider has a very nice piece on our weekly toll: every other week, our blog neighbor tammy at confined space compiles a list of news stories about workers who have lost their lives at work. we've linked to it before. despite its length, it's only a partial list at best- whatever manages to turn up in the search engines. the roster makes for some chilling reading. no matter how many times i've read these lists before, i am almost always jarred to see how many deaths occurred in my state - sometimes, just a town or two away. i am also struck by how pedestrian the circumstances sound - on a golf course, in a restaurant, at a market, on a farm. i guess it's the human tendency to think these things occur in far away places, at different kinds of work sites.***in story after story, the reports from co-workers are heart-wrenching - witnesses to the carnage, some after having frantically fought to save a colleague. it must be terrible to have to return to a job after having witnessed a beloved coworker die. it must be a heavy burden for coworkers and supervisors, and should they actually bear some negligence in the events, it could be soul crushing. indeed, a year or two ago we noted the deaths of roofing workers on a construction site in florida. there had been numerous safety violations, and in following up to see the criminal disposition, we learned the owner of the contracting company had taken his own life - no doubt, the horrible events played a role in his death, too. he and others paid a steep price for whatever corners were cut in shortchanging safety.

to sit or not to sit....





it hadn't really occurred to me until i read this article, but cashiers at the little grocery store across from our apartment in paris last christmas did something almost unheard of in american grocery stores: they sat down.the question of why american grocery store workers usually stand, rather than sit, was the subject of a washington post column today by marc fischer who tells the story of a customer, deana jordan sullivan, who went out and bought stools for safeway checkers to sit on.safeway officals said "thanks, but no thanks.""we do appreciate the customer's thoughtfulness and generosity," he says. "but sitting on a chair could potentially expose employees to injury. part of their job requires them to lift heavy objects -- laundry detergent, frozen or fresh turkeys, cat or dog food. their checkstands are designed to be conducive to standing."actually, although you wouldn't think the seating of supermarket cashiers would be an earth-splitting issue, the planet is indeed divided over this: in most european countries and in australia, grocery checkout clerks routinely do their job perched on stools. in the united states, the tradition has been that they stand all day. and it turns out that this has more to do with image and notions of customer service than with worker health.the british government's occupational health department issued guidelines in 2005 strongly recommending that supermarket cashiers be given sit-stand stools so clerks could sit when not lifting those heavy items. "a seat should be provided enabling operators to have a choice," the british study concluded.a report by the u.s. occupational safety and health administration says that thousands of grocery store workers are injured each year by repetitive motions and awkward posture while scanning items and "standing for most of the shift." but americans take a milder approach to solving the problem. osha recommends using anti-fatigue floor mats, which safeway does provide.the feds add only that grocery stores should "consider using checkstands designed with an adjustable sit-stand" stool.muckle says safeway's checkstands are not designed to permit stools. anyway, "culturally, i don't know of any american supermarket where checkers sit down," he says. "that is prevalent in europe, but in our culture, if people saw that, a lot of people would wonder, 'are these people really working?' "yes, traditional culture is always a good reason to keep subjecting workers to workplace health and safety problems.fischer notes, however, that the safeway workers union, the united food and commercial workers, aren't advocating for stools either.interestingly, the union that represents safeway checkers is pretty much in accord with the company. "safeway designs checkstands to be as ergonomically beneficial as possible," says union spokeswoman jill cashen. "sitting may actually make the work more difficult."the cashiers seemed perplexed, but not too upset about the prospect of sitting, however.at her safeway, sullivan found the cashiers to be grateful but a bit wary when she delivered the stools. "they looked at me like i was a crazy white woman," she says, "and that's a reasonable reaction. it sounds like i'm obsessed with this, but i'm really not: i'm a busy working mom with two kids, but i just thought this was stupid. i didn't want to just whine about it, so i did something."sullivan, an executive at discovery networks, isn't done rocking the boat. she's rallying support from neighborhood online bulletin boards. and even though her stools remain in storage, she's found herself shopping at the safeway more often: "ironically, it's making me more loyal to the store and to the people who work there."cashiers at the store told me they weren't allowed to talk about the stools. but they smiled broadly at the mention of the seats and the woman who donated them. "tell her to come in and see us," one clerk said.another added: "we'll be here -- standing right here."update: hazards magazine has much more on the hazards of standing.
