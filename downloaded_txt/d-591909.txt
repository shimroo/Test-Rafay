campbellsport awarded $1 million grant for road projects


july 31, 2024


campbellsport, wi (july 29th, 2024) – the village of campbellsport is excited to announce that our community has been awarded a $1,000,000 grant towards the 2025 and 2026 cherry street and martin street total reconstruction projects through the state of wisconsin’s community development block grant program.
 


cherry street and martin streets, installed as part of the original plat of village of campbellsport, were last resurfaced in the late 1970’s and still have their original water and sewer utilities from the 1930’s.


from a road condition standpoint, both roadways and utility systems are in dire need of replacement, due to pavement age, alligator cracking, surface separation from the binder course, sub-grade failure, along with water and sewer utilities that are over 85 years old.
 


cherry street and martin streets were identified for total reconstruction and replacement as part of the village of campbellsport 2023-2032 roadway improvement plan, approved by the village board in september of 2022. in may 2024, the village board approved the application to be submitted by administrator kudy and msa professional services to the community development block grant program and requested funds to help the village tackle this $1.7 million project.
 


this grant will pay for 56.87% of the roadway, reducing the potential tax burden by $1 million in required debt. cherry street and martin streets will receive all new municipal utilities, pavement, along with replaced and enhanced curbs, gutters and sidewalks.
 


any inquiries about the campbellsport 2023-2032 roadway improvement plan can be directed to village administrator charlie kudy at charlie.kudy@cportvill.com.
