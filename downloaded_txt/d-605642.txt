“fran and pj are the best! they helped my wife and i pick out tile and added all the details to the order form so that we knew what grout went with what tile. very helpful when explaining to the contractor later on. speaking of contractor i hired the wrong one. i had to rip out 1/2 the tile that was installed and was pretty bummed out about my mistake. pj and fran to our rescue. not only did they refer me to a new installer that was great (bryson cummings) but they gave me a discount on all the tile i had to repurchase. we highly recommend pacific tile.” – john l.
