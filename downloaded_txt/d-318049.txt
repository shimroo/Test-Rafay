dmc: devil may cry reviews summary








a gothic hack and slash developed by ninja theory for ps3, xbox 360 and microsoft windows.  set in an alternative reality to the devil may cry series.

plot:
born of a demon father and an angel mother, you play  dante (sporting a black haired alternative reality hairdo) as he makes his way through the demon infested limbo, aided by enigmatic guide kat. an astonishing 5 levels of difficulty, upgradable weapons and powers, new air combos and two new combat modifiers (angel mode and devil mode) add to the button mashing goodliness.

what it says on the tin:
join dante in this stylish action experience; chain together multiple combos with flair and send the demonic spawn back to hell – reveal the truth behind the lies

reception:
reviewers had little to gripe about, but a number drew attention to the shortness (10 hours give or take secret areas), minor glitches, poor storyline, and some tut tutting on less refined combat mechanics and game style from series purists.  still the game earned a rather handsome 86% from 53 critic reviews on metacritic.

quote of the bunch:
the combat system is deep, satisfying, and just welcoming enough to let you in, before losing the smile, slapping your face and making you pay attention. official xbox magazine uk

reviews summary:
fast, robust action, marvelous visual style, and a tremendous sense of attitude
this is not a classic devil may cry game
a phenomenal action game in its own right, a blistering start to 2013
offers deep and flexible combat but in a more accessible and approachable form
manages to make dante look like the epitome of cool with every move
a robust, deep and brilliantly executed action game
dmc is played for the action, and the stylish, beautiful action alone.
it's the art direction and technical problems that let the package down.
dmc is intense, but a bit slow for the seasoned player.

alf the helper: all these "cry" games... i think it's a conspiracy..
elderly: oh sweet... conspiracy!? how do you mean?
alf the helper: it's a little odd, devil may cry, far cry 3, and february's crysis 3.. it's a pattern!
elderly: crysis 3? are you... no your right, they went to great lengths to ensure you'd spot the pattern and get a chance to talk about it right here on this blog.. 
alf the helper: they did!? wow!! they did all that just for me?
elderly: sure did...
alf the helper: wow!! i mean that's incredible...
elderly: yep your right again.. absolutely incredible..
alf the helper: wow!!

xbox 360 "vault" console stand mod











elderly: okay alf on my signal.. this has got to be done in one take.. remember now enthusiasm..

hi, this is alf the helper here with another extraordinary console thingy available for purchase.. whilst stocks last of the... vault.

the vault is a three dimensional lightweight casing for your cherished xbox 360 in specially chosen spring colours featuring gundam white, vampire red, urban blue and the much sought after nuclear green.  

each vault provides that much needed increased airflow, beloved of professional gamers throughout the galaxy.  the vault delivers better console stability and solves the perennial problem of where exactly do i leave my xbox 360 controller when i'm finished playing.  yes finally your controller has a home.

elderly: okay well done.. now we just need to wrap it up.. something short and snappy
alf the helper: i dunno i don't like selling stuff plus i't a stand.....why are they calling it a vault...
elderly: i dunno.. i'd call it a housing... okay ready.. now with emotion...

as the manufacturers care as much about your beloved xbox 360 as you do, they've made what can only be described as a humanitarian gesture by dropping their price by a whopping 40% making it theeeee most affordable xbox 360 ..erm.. modification available... 

you know..... your console needs this.

elderly: excellent right that's a wrap...
alf the helper: i hate myself.. can i go back to making wallpaper now!?
elderly: yes yes of course...

okami hd review summary ps3











 
okami hd is an action adventure released via playstation network in october 2012.  essentially the ummph version (supporting playstation's move) of the critically acclaimed (ign's game of the year 2006) but poorly selling ps2 game developed by the now defunct clover studio  and published by capcom. 

the game draws on japanese myths to tell the story of how the land was saved from darkness by the sun goddess, taking the physical form of a white wolf. the environment is an animated watercolor and ink styled, cel-shaded delight for the eyes and the gameplay a mix of action, platform, and puzzle gaming genres.

for a re-release, the hd version scored an extraordinary 90% from 39 critic reviews on metacritic.  

quote of the bunch:
okami hd is a great example of what games can accomplish outside the realm of guns and gore, and i love it for that.  machinima

reviews summary.
an experience that should not be missed, ahead of its time with its initial release.
a timeless classic, full of charm, subtle ingenuity, and beauty, remade in stunning hd.
sad to see that after six years it is still one of the best examples of its genre.
the true vision of the creators has seemingly been realized, in glorious 1080p high definition.
just as good of a game today as it was six years ago.
an essential part of any collection, especially in this flawless, gorgeous reissue. 
shows some signs of aging, it remains an awe-inspiring experience like no other.
even more potent today than it was in 2006, okami is zelda's one and only match 

official website

alf the helper: so your telling me that the original developers created a timeless classic, a jewel in the crown of video games, ... and yet because of poor sales of this veritable masterpiece, they went out of business?
elderly: essentially .... yes
alf the helper: but that... that... that just makes me sad.... :(
elderly: and so it should...
alf the helper: well...in the words of carly rae jepsen.. a change is going to come..
elderly: .....that would be sam cooke...
alf the helper: where?
elderly: .. no alf... the lyrics.... that would be sam cooke... a change is goin to come...
alf the helper: not carly.. !? ...i was so sure, you could have called me maybel...
elderly: no that's ....call me maybe .. sigh.... alf take a lie down.... please
