welcome to our website!
the only site you will need for all your batmobile needs.
        
    this site was started in 2004 as a premiere site dedicated to all things 1989 batmobile also known as keaton car from 1989 batman movie and 1992 batman returns movie.
    here you will find everything you need to know about the real life replica of keaton batmobile.
       
    since then the site has grown exponentially to cover all movies batmobiles: batman forever batmobile (1995 batmobile) , batman and robin roadster (1997 batmobile), batman begins tumbler, and the batpod featured in the dark knight movie.
    
    not only that, this website is given special credit at the end of the dark knight rises bluray batmobile documentary( scroll down to see the credit ).
        
    so sit back and use the left navigational bar to read through everything you need on obtaining your dream batmobile replicas.
        
















the signatures are from the actual 'batmobile build' team of john evans including terry aukland-snow the art director (on the se dvd) but missing andy smith (far right).
check the special featurette of the batman se dvd or blu-ray to see interviews with above team members

hi,   i have just bought a batmobile suitable for a chid or adult. it is the keaton shape. it is in a bad way and i am getting it restored. it was apparently on display in harrods when it was new, and raffled off by a newspaper company. can anyone else give me any more information on it please.                                 regards robert.
