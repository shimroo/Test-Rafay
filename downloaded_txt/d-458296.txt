liquid nitrogen lab grade
 nitrogen is a colorless and odorless gas. this gas is chemically inert, non-flammable and repels oxygen. nitrogen is present in the air with 78.1 vol.
in liquid and refrigerated form, nitrogen is used as a means of freezing in the food industry and during transport with refrigerated trucks. as it is an inert gas, odorless and tasteless, it is also often used as an atmosphere for packaging food products.
