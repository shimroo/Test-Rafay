	 a few thought about "resolutions"
	 
    


"for though a righteous man falls seven times, he rises again" - proverbs 24:16if you make a new year's resolution chances are the resolution will fall by the wayside in a few weeks. we tend to have the attitude that once we fail at our "resolution" it's all over. one strike, then you're out.one problem is our definition for resolution. the root word for "resolution" is not resolute (firmly determined in purpose or staunch) but rather the definition is to resolve (the act or process of resolving, or solving by breaking up into small parts to analyze).i'm not saying never make resolutions, they can be a good thing. just make them wisely, understanding that your goal is a life change attitude that comes from inside; not seeing how long you can carry out a new activity.spend some time in quiet meditation and ask yourself if you are satisfied with where you are in the lord. are you comfortable with how often you pray or read the word? i hope not. i believe every one of us has room to improve and deepen our relationship with our lord and savior. the day we quit growing is the day we start dying. the lord is always ready to show us something new and fresh."delight yourself in the lord and he will give you the desires of your heart." - psalm 37:4by cheri thomasfrom www.witandwisdom.orgused with permissionplay musicpraying with the psalmsby eugene h. peterson; price: $10.01 (-23%)customer review: if you're familiar with "the message" by eugene peterson, you will enjoy this daily devotional. i love what he says in his introduction, "we are most ourselves when we pray" and "when that deep, deep center of our lives is exposed -- our core humanity, which biblical writers so vigorously designate as "heart" -- [read more]categories: daily-thoughts perspective resolution faith

	 thank you, father
	 
    


thank you, father, for all you have given me, much more than i could even count. for sunlight that streams into my window and warms my weary heart. for moonlight on the nights i called out to you and let you wash away my tears. for people who love me when i seem most unlovable but when i need their love the most. for giving them the grace. for holding my heart when it is trembling. for being that guiding light when i am lost in the dark, with nowhere to go. for caring enough to send the very best. for the peace that my prayers are answered. for the power you give to such a weak soul as mine when i reach out and touch you. when i say "dear god..." and you flow through me and suddenly everything makes sense again. for taking away the confusion when my heart is aching and when i do not understand. for soothing the fears that plague me so i can hardly move. for putting a smile on my face and laughter in my heart at the strangest times. for music which causes my very soul to sing and soar on the clouds towards you. for eyes to see the beauty of your world, each towering tree and misty sunset, each smiling face. for voices which communicate love. to a heart so dry and hungering, they are like water. for being the foremost of those voices, lord, and the one who causes the rest to sing. for the thrill of a new idea. for the sweet serenity of a prayer answered, a sweetness i hold close to me like a treasure, and i say "my god loves me." for loving me enough to not answer all my prayers. for wisdom to know what's best for me, and the never-ending love to always dispose it. for miracles, and the joy of knowing you ever deeper. for loving me in the midst of my sin and bestowing blessings i could never deserve. for the peace that enfolds me with the simple knowledge that "jesus cares." for having the awesome power to move even the most formidable mountains. mountains against which i struggle and rage and cry, they are too big for me and i stand defeated. but you who made the stars and the earth and all the heavens can move them with the snap of a finger. and leave me awe-struck with nothing to do but bow down to you majesty with "praise the lord!" on my lips. and you say, "i'm not through with you yet, my child. show me the next mountain..." for the great adventure of a life lived with you! thank you for being there when my spirit cries for wiping the tears away from my eyes for holding my heart close for loving me when i need it the most for touching me with moonlight when i call out to you in the empty night for the stars and the peace and for my tears and the feeling of you that surrounds me, soothing my fears for the times when you have sustained me and i didn't even know it was you, too blind to see that over all i do is the guiding touch of your hand jesus, thank you for allowing me to understand author unknownplay musicpraying with the psalmsby eugene h. peterson; price: $10.01 (-23%)customer review: if you're familiar with "the message" by eugene peterson, you will enjoy this daily devotional. i love what he says in his introduction, "we are most ourselves when we pray" and "when that deep, deep center of our lives is exposed -- our core humanity, which biblical writers so vigorously designate as "heart" -- [read more]categories: daily-thoughts perspective gratitude faith

	 just pedal ...
	 
    


at first i saw god as my observer, my judge, keeping track of thethings i did wrong, so as to know whether i merited heaven or hell wheni die. he was out there sort of like a president. i recognized hispicture when i saw it, but i really didn't know him. but later on, when i met god, it seemed as though life were rather likea bike ride, but it was a tandem bike, and i noticed that god was atthe back, helping me pedal. i don't know when it was that he suggested that we change places, butlife has not been the same since. when i had control i knew the way. itwas rather boring, but predictable. it was the shortest distance betweentwo points. but when he took the lead, he knew delightful long cuts, upmountains, and through rocky places at breakneck speeds. it was all icould do to hang on! even though it looked like madness, he said, "pedal!" i worried and wasanxious and asked, "where are you taking me?" he laughed and didn'tanswer! and i started to learn to trust. i forgot my boring life andentered into the adventure. and when i'd say "i'm scared," he'd leanback and touch my hand. he took me to people with gifts that i needed; gifts of healing,acceptance and joy. they gave me gifts to take on my journey. and wewere off again. he said, 'give the gifts away; they're extra baggage,too much weight.' so i did, to the people we met, and i found that ingiving i received, and still our burden was light. i did not trust him, at first, in control of my life. i thought he'dwreck it; but he knows bike secrets, knows how to make it bend to takesharp corners, knows how to jump to clear high rocks, knows how to flyto shorten scary passages. and i am learning to shut up and pedal in thestrangest places, and i'm beginning to enjoy the view and the coolbreeze on my face with god as my delightful constant companion. and when i'm sure i just can't do anymore, he just smiles and says, "just pedal!" author unknown play musicpraying with the psalmsby eugene h. peterson; price: $10.01 (-23%)customer review: if you're familiar with "the message" by eugene peterson, you will enjoy this daily devotional. i love what he says in his introduction, "we are most ourselves when we pray" and "when that deep, deep center of our lives is exposed -- our core humanity, which biblical writers so vigorously designate as "heart" -- [read more]categories: daily-thoughts perspective god faith

	 remember the duck?
	 
    


there was a little boy visiting his grandparents on their farm.he was given a slingshot to play with,but only in the woods.he practiced in the woods,but he could never hit the target.getting a little discouraged, he headed back to dinner.as he was walking back, he saw grandma's pet duck. just out of impulse, he let it fly, and hit the duck square in the head and killed it.he was shocked and grieved.in a panic, he hid the dead duck in a woodpileonly to see his sister watching. sally had seen it all, but said nothing. after lunch that day grandma said,"sally, let's wash the dishes." but sally said, "grandma, johnny told me he wanted to helpin the kitchen today didn't you johnny?" and then she whispered to him, "remember the duck?" so johnny did the dishes. later, grandpa asked if the children wanted to go fishing,and grandma said, "i'm sorry, but i need sally to help make supper." but sally smiled and said, "well, that's all right because johnny told me he wanted to help."and she whispered again, "remember the duck?" so sally went fishing and johnny stayed home.after several days of johnny doing both his chores and sally's, he finally couldn't stand it any longer. he came to grandma and confessed that he killed the duck. she knelt down, gave him a hug, and said,"sweetheart, i know that. but because i love you, i forgive you. but i was wondering just how long would you let sally make a slave of you."i'll bet jesus sometimes wonders the same thing! how often we allow ourselves to be enslaved by our unwillingness to confess our sins. we just go on living and sacrifice allof the peace and forgiveness that god wants to give us. it leaves us so that we cannot even enjoy the good that is in our lives.god knows how we have fallen short of his glorious perfectionand has sent his son to die for our sins. if we confess them and turn to him,we will be washed clean and set free from guilt. but as long as we claim we haven't sinnedthere can only be bondage to our pastand our need to cover it up from ourselves.he is waiting to hear from you.."if we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. if we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word has no place in our lives."1 john 1:8-10. play musicpraying with the psalmsby eugene h. peterson; price: $10.01 (-23%)customer review: if you're familiar with "the message" by eugene peterson, you will enjoy this daily devotional. i love what he says in his introduction, "we are most ourselves when we pray" and "when that deep, deep center of our lives is exposed -- our core humanity, which biblical writers so vigorously designate as "heart" -- [read more]categories: daily-thoughts perspective sin grace faith

	 food for thought
	 
    


god didn't promise days without pain,laughter without sorrow, sun without rain,but he did promise strength for the day,comfort for the tears, and light for the way.disappointments are like road humps,they slow you down a bit but you enjoy the smooth road afterwards.don't stay on the humps too long. move on!when you feel down because you didn't get what you want, just sit tight and be happy,because god is thinking of something better to give you. when something happens to you, good or bad, consider what it means.there's a purpose to life's events, to teach you how to laugh more or not to cry too hard.you can't make someone love you, all you can do is be someone who can be loved,the rest is up to the person to realize your worth.what the heart gives away is never gone... it is kept in the hearts of others.remember that great love and great achievements involve great risks.secure a special place in your heart. a certain place only you can enter.for there will come a time when you need to find yourself and onlyyour heart will show you the way.the measure of love is when you love without measure.in life there are very rare chances that you'll meet the person youlove and loves you in return.so once you have it don't ever let go, the chance might never comeyour way again.it's better to lose your pride to the one you love, than to lose theone you love because of pride.we spend so much time looking for the right person to love orfinding fault with those we already love,when instead we should be perfecting the love we give.when you truly care for someone, you don't look for faults, you don't look for answers, you don't look for mistakes. instead, you fight the mistakes,you accept the faults, and you overlook excuses.never abandon an old friend. you will never find one who can take his place.friendship is like wine, it gets better as it grows older.author unknown  play how great thou arttotal forgivenessby r. t. kendall; price: $10.77(23% off)customer review: this book has totally changed my life. rt kendall offers an amazing piece of work that, as you discover from the book, was born out of his own personal experience. the book is full of practical teaching about what our misconceptions of forgiveness are and what true godly forgiveness is.....

	 the auction
	 
    


a wealthy man and his son loved to collect rare works of art.  they had everything in their collection imaginable, from picasso to raphael.  they would often sit together and admire the great works of art. when the viet nam conflict broke out, the son went to war.  he was very courageous and died in battle while rescuing another soldier. the father was notified and grieved deeply for his only son. about a month later, just before christmas, there was a knock at the door.  a young man stood at the door with a large package in his hands.  he said, “sir, you don’t know me, but i am the soldier for whom your son gave his life.  he saved many lives that day, and he was carrying me to safety when a bullet struck him in the heart and he died instantly.  he often talked about you, and your love for art.”  the young man held out his package.  “i know this isn’t much.  i’m not really a great artist, but i think your son would have wanted you to have this.” the father opened the package.  it was a portrait of his son, painted by the young man.  he stared in awe at the way the soldier had captured the personality of his son in the painting.  the father was so drawn to the eyes in the portrait that were so like his sons that his own eyes now welled up with tears.  he thanked the young man and offered to pay him for the picture.  “oh, no sir, i could never repay what your son did.” the father hung the portrait over his mantle. every time visitors came to his home he took them to see the portrait of his son before he showed them any of the other great works he had collected. the man died a few months later. there was to be a great auction of his paintings.  many influential people gathered, excited over seeing the great paintings and having an opportunity to purchase one for their own collection.  on the platform sat the painting of the son. the auctioneer pounded his gavel.  “we will start the bidding with this picture of the son.  who will bid for this picture?”  there was silence. then a voice in the back of the room shouted.  “we want to see the famous paintings.  skip this one.”  but the auctioneer persisted.  “will someone bid for this painting?  who will start the bidding? $100, $200?”  another voice shouted angrily.  “we didn’t come to see this painting ...   we came to see the van goghs, the rembrandts.  get on with the real bids!” but still the auctioneer continued.  “the son! the son! who’ll take the son?” finally, a voice came from the very back of the room.  it was the longtime gardener of the man and his son. “i’ll give $10 for the painting.”  being a poor man, it was all he could afford. “we have $10, who will bid $20?” “give it to him for $10. let’s see the masters.” “$10 is the bid, won’t someone bid $20?” the crowd was becoming angry.  they didn’t want the picture of the son. they wanted the more worthy investments for their collections. the auctioneer pounded the gavel.  “going once ..., twice ..., sold for $10!” a man sitting on the second row shouted.  “now let’s get on with the collection!” the auctioneer laid down his gavel.  “my apologies, the auction is over.” “what about the paintings?” “i am sorry.  when i was called to conduct this auction, i was told of a secret stipulation in the will.  i was not allowed to reveal that stipulation until after the auction was concluded.  only the painting of the son would be auctioned.  whoever bought that painting would inherit the entire estate, including the paintings. the man who took the son gets everything!” god gave his son 2,000 years ago to die on a cruel cross. much like the auctioneer, his message today is, “the son, the son, who’ll take the son?” because you see, whoever takes the son gets everything.  when there is nothing left but god, that is when you find out god is all you need . . . author unknown play amazing graceprecious memoriesby alan jackson; price: $9.76 (49% off)customer review: a few decades ago nearly every country singer had at least one--often more--gospel albums in their catalog. today, aside from gospel veteran amy grant, who balances the sacred and secular, and randy travis, that concept has long faded. for alan jackson, however, treating the musical past as present has been a way of life, as it is with these 15 tim...

somtimes when all life's lessons have been learned and sun and stars forever more have setthe things which our weak judgements here have spurned the things o'er which we grieved with lashes wet will flash before us out of life's dark night as stars shine most in deeper tints of blue, and we shall see how all god's plans were right and how what seemed reproof was love most true. then be content, poor heart god's plans, like lilies pure and white unfold we must not tear the close-shut leaves apart time will reveal the chalices of gold and if, through patient toil we reach the land where tired feet with sandals loose may rest where we shall clearly see and understand i think that we will say "god knew the best" by may riley smith  wishing you a joyful christmas celebrating jesus, our saviour's birth, and a blessed new year.play musicpraying with the psalmsby eugene h. peterson; price: $10.01 (-23%)customer review: if you're familiar with "the message" by eugene peterson, you will enjoy this daily devotional. i love what he says in his introduction, "we are most ourselves when we pray" and "when that deep, deep center of our lives is exposed -- our core humanity, which biblical writers so vigorously designate as "heart" -- [read more]categories: daily-thoughts perspective faith attitude
