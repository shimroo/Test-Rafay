    the book
  




“i was nineteen years old when we embarked on the cinematic journey of wonderland. as i immersed myself in the depths of this film, i began to realize we were not only retelling a story filled with incomprehensible evil, but one of hope, of overcoming the darkest of circumstances and surviving. dawn, i thank you for sharing your story not only with me, but with the many people who will now take strength from your honesty. and who will be encouraged to not only survive but, like you, to thrive.”

— kate bosworth, actress
