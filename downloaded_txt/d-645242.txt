my home library



























access to books in the home is linked to improved academic performance, better writing skills, reduced dropout rates, increased income levels, and time spent reading for enjoyment. yet, 61% of low-income children are not book owners. we are making strides to close the gap in book access for our youngest and most vulnerable children and their families.research shows that one of the single most impactful and actionable things we can do to boost achievement levels and foster a love of reading is to increase the availability of books in the homes of underserved children. in fact, children growing up in homes without books are, on average, three years behind academically than children in homes with lots of books.














about my home library



the barbara bush houston literacy foundation is making strides to close the gap in book access for our youngest and most vulnerable children and their families through our my home library program. through my home library, children in title i elementary schools and early childhood education centers located in high-need communities are gifted six brand new books to read, share, and love.



you can sponsor a my home library for a child



through partnerships with scholastic and first book, we secure books at an affordable cost. members of the community may sponsor a home library for a child in need with a $30, tax-deductible donation, and companies may sponsor a grade level or school.

what the research says



29% of hisd students in third through eighth grades did not meet reading standards in 2023, making them four times more likely to drop out.children living in poverty hear 30 million fewer words by age three than their affluent peers, resulting in not being reading-ready by kindergarten.79% of houston school children are economically disadvantaged, meaning books are a luxury their families cannot afford.there is one book for every 200 low-income households, which contributes to the achievement gap.

thank you!

















in 2020, the children’s learning institute conducted a survey of students participating in the my home library program. key findings from the study include:approximately 30% of students surveyed indicated that they had five or fewer books at home.students who have more books at home spend more time reading.students who spend more time reading are more motivated to read.students who own more books and girls select more challenging levels of books to add to their home libraries to read. note: full evaluation of the program was unable to be completed due to school closures resulting from covid-19 pandemic.
