watchtower bridger - hybrid precision technology calls to mountain men and adventure.
a nod to the story of american frontiersman jim bridger, the bridger bolt-action rifle features a hand-painted cerakote finish stock with laser-engraved map design of the bridger trail between the recoil pad and near vertical grip design. the trail represents his charting of the west used to guide pioneers along the oregon trail. the remainder of the carbon-fiber mcmillan elite hunter stock forward of the grip to the forend wears a clean tri-color camouflage pattern. the stock incorporates socket sling cup attachment points at the forend and under the heel of the stock. set into the stock is a defiance action with a barrel chambered in 7mm prc. the bottom metal is made by hawkins and the trigger is timney's elite hunter trigger, which is adjustable by factory set at 2 pounds, 8 ounces. the barrel is what makes the bridger bolt-action distinctive. the stainless steel core of the barrel features a proprietary pattern for rigidity that is chemically welded to the titanium sleeve for reduced weight of more than 2 ounces. this rifle was introduced at the 2025 nssf shot show by chief growth officer jordan davis of watchtower.
