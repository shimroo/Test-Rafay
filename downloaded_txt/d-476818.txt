i’m joanne gordon, a writer who elevates the voices of leaders and creative thinkers to inform and inspire.



for three decades—as a best-selling author, ghostwriter, forbes journalist and corporate communications advisor—i’ve helped executives, editors and marketing professionals share experiences, expertise and insights with the world.
i excel at drawing out people’s stories, connecting disparate ideas, capturing distinct voices, and writing memoirs with purpose. i’m especially intrigued by leaders of character who succeed despite tremendous odds, and whose bold visions and creative processes have lasting impact.
when ideas are worth spreading, i consider it a privilege to be part of that journey.
