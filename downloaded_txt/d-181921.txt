 credit cards








	one significant way to save money at the pump is with the gas rebate credit card. fuelmeup has researched several different card offers and even interviewed card holders. one of the best gas saving credit cards is the discover® open roadsm card. you can save 5-7% per fill up. right now that savings is about 18 cents per gallon of gas you purchase. another great card that you need to apply for is the american express simply cash card. this card gives you 5% cash back on all gasoline purchases. fuelmeup suggests that you apply for both cards because the acceptance rate is closely monitored for both programs. (free to do, so you have nothing to loose)
