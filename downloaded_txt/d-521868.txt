midwest staffing has truly exceeded all my expectations. as a recruiting manager in this difficult labor market, i need partners i can trust and rely on. midwest is that type of partner. from the very first meeting with jaci and haley, i knew that this was going to be an excellent fit. they both were so personable, passionate, knowledgeable, and eager. the attention to detail, responsiveness, and the personal touch that the midwest team provides is literally second-to-none. i consider them a valued member of my talent acquisition team, right alongside my coworkers. haley and the team do an incredible job of finding the right fit for our organization rather than throwing candidates our way—hoping that they stick. i know that they have other clients, but i honestly feel like i am their only one. no other agency seems as genuinely invested in our success. thank you midwest!recruiting manager – national steel supplier

our organization has and continues to have the privilege to work with the midwest staffing group. our partnership started 6 years ago after i tried and fired 3 other temporary labor services. the midwest team came in and from day one was fair and honest.  over the last 6 years, the midwest team has maintained their consistent approach with open, honest, and fair communication and deliverables. i trust the midwest team to have my back and when we are extremely busy, they deliver. what makes midwest stand out above the rest is their willingness to be completely transparent. they have a desire to serve us and make sure we are always getting the service and quality that we have come to expect. we staff millions of dollars in temporary labor a year and due to midwest's great service, we only use then as our staffing source. i have really enjoyed the last 6 years and look forward to what the future has in store. i've really come to appreciate midwest and value our partnershipdirector of operationsplastic manufacturing company in chanhassen
