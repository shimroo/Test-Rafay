atlanta - prestigious
atlanta is home to more than 300 fortune 500 companies. the corporate executives and their families who live, work and play in metro atlanta make up some of the nation's most luxurious communities.
this is especially true in the north atlanta market area where cities such as alpharetta, milton, johns creek, cumming, marietta, sandy springs, dunwoody, peachtree corners, buford, suwanee, sugar hill, canton, woodstock, gainesville and roswell offer superior schools from pre-k to advanced higher education. and the luxury executive homes found here serve as suitable rewards for career achievements and elegant expressions of success.
known for rich craftsmanship, these homes feature award-winning architecture, designs and options — including championship golf, country clubs and gated and guarded entrances — that provide a lifestyle befitting the executive's daily routine. all of these upscale communities offer an easy commute to business centers and the financial district, plus quick access to quality shopping, varied entertainment and fine dining, as well as to the nation's #1 airport, atlanta's hartsfield-jackson international.

buyer protection unmatched
whatever your reason for buying north atlanta real estate — if you recently sold a home on which you lost money, understandably one of your primary concerns today is how to protect your equity dollar this time around.
after more than two decades of buying and selling atlanta real estate, over 90% of my business comes from past and present clients' referrals and repeat business. this is because they know me to be as concerned with their protection — financial, negotiation and other — as they are. and they trust me to protect the interests of their co-workers, family members and friends. this trust is the very foundation of my real estate practice.
what every luxury homebuyer needs to know
my professional buyer services and exclusive representation of your financial, negotiation and other buyer interests cost you nothing. a portion of the fee paid to the listing agent by the seller serves as my compensation.
this is really good news because when buying an executive home in north atlanta communities like alpharetta, cumming or marietta, you're probably thinking of things other than water drainage and traffic flow. your home brings quality of life. and with it, you're creating something special — a wonderful reward for you and your family — that expresses your career and personal triumphs in life.
meanwhile, the home you choose also comes with mundane details such as possible inadequate heat and air conditioning per square foot and negative impacts of traffic flow such as noise and air pollution. and what about drainage? who's thinking of that when the home you love is near the subdivision's retention pond for surface water known as a drainage pit?
but when you have me — ed thomasson — as your professional buyer's broker, you'll have your interests exclusively represented and protected. after more than two decades of representing clients buying and selling atlanta real estate, i know the obstacles, challenges and pitfalls to look for when buying a home. they're in the forefront of my mind, and i will not knowingly let you make a mistake. you may review further information regarding ed thomasson's professional real estate services on linkedin and google my business.
buyer benefits
as an atlanta homebuyer interested in protecting your equity investment dollar, you need a buying strategy that assures you of purchasing a home that will hold its value over the coming years. and you need a buyer's agent who has such a strategy and whose primary goal is to protect your interests.
as a homebuyer, you must always know precisely who is or is not representing you. and when you choose me as your buyer's broker, i practice three important rules...

i will make no effort to increase your purchase price upon determining your purchase budget.
i will not rush you to make a buying decision.
i will not endorse a home to you unless i would buy the same home myself given your circumstances and preferences.

the strategies above may save you thousands of dollars when the time comes to sell.
when you have me as your buyer's broker, you get the benefit of my objective overview of each home you seriously consider. if i see problems — such as a miniscule drainage issue with the potential to become big — i'll recommend having the seller correct it before closing.
i'll make sure you're aware of issues that could reduce a home's future salability. for instance, a steep driveway or all second-floor bedrooms will bring automatic rejection by baby boomers thinking of their possible health and physical decline over the coming years. when a buyer mistake today eliminates such a large segment of the population, you've seriously cut your future market of potential buyers and limited your home's resale value.
i'll also point out neighborhood concerns that could cost you money later on — concerns such as an inferior school district or proximity to a waste treatment plant. my kind of farsighted vision frees you to focus on quality-of-life amenities such as the championship golf course or beautiful lake ideal for family canoeing.
so, if you're relocating to alpharetta, cumming, marietta or another north atlanta community, or you'd like to move up, email or call me at 404-805-0484. i will protect your financial, negotiation and other buyer interests as though they were my own.


selling your north atlanta real estate
statistics show that homeowners stay in their homes an average of seven years. so if you bought your home approximately seven years ago, you bought when the alpharetta, cumming and marietta real estate markets were at their peak. now, after the nation's worst recession in decades and the downward spiral of the housing market, you need to sell. this means it's time for a possibly painful but very necessary reality check.
i understand your concern for getting the highest dollar for your home. you've invested a lot. you've lovingly cared for it and it holds your most cherished memories.
but to avoid a crushing disappointment down the road, you must take your listing agent's professional advice and price your home in keeping with today's market. why is this so important? because, even if you get an offer for the highest dollar, your home must appraise for that amount — at least — or the buyer won't get the loan. and believe me, the home appraiser will definitely appraise your home according to today's market.
what it takes to sell your north atlanta home today
no real estate agent — regardless of experience, knowledge or marketing plan — can overcome the free-market laws of supply and demand or a seller's refusal to accept market conditions as they truly exist. your listing agent's performance is limited by your willingness to listen to the professional advice offered and to take three critical steps in the journey to a successful home sale...

price your alpharetta, cumming or marietta home carefully, consistent with local market conditions. real estate agents simply do not waste their qualified buyers' time by showing them a home that's overpriced. it's a real estate fact: the more showings your home gets, the greater your chance of receiving an offer, even multiple offers.
get your home market ready with any touchups or updates suggested. not only must a buyer qualify for a mortgage loan, but also your home must qualify by meeting certain standards. this is in addition to its appraised value. and pay attention to your home's curb appeal for that all-important first impression imprinted upon each buyer's memory.
seek professional advice on staging your home. de-clutter to expand space and depersonalize to make it appeal to the most buyers. and remember a buyer must be able to visualize their things in your home to "buy it" emotionally and ever make an offer.

seller benefits
after working with so many homebuyers over the last 25 years, i know with certainty what buyers are looking for and what they want. and when you're totally realistic about today's market conditions and what it takes to sell a home, my experience with buyers is a huge benefit.
when i accept your listing, i won't rush back to my office and enter your home into the mls database and then wait for the phone to ring. instead, your home's marketing presentation will be professionally prepared and then splashed heavily across the world wide web.
why is this so important? because reports show that today nearly all homebuyers (93%) begin their home search on the internet. and i ensure that ready buyers from across the nation and across the glob who are searching for north atlanta real estate will see your listing.
in other words, i do everything needed to present and sell your home in the least time at the highest yield that i would do if it were my own.
so, if you're ready to sell your north atlanta home, email or call me at 404-805-0484 and let's get acquainted.
