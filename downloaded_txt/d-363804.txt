presented by partners in palo duro canyon foundation











readily accessible by car, motorhome, or fifth wheel and only 25 miles from downtown amarillo and 14 miles from the mainstreet town of canyon, palo duro canyon is the most spectacular and scenic landscape feature in the texas panhandle. it was formed by millions of years of water erosion by the prairie dog town fork of the red river and the west texas wind.
with a descent of some 800 feet to the canyon floor and more than 16 miles of paved road, palo duro canyon state park offers fantastic scenic views, historical sites and markers, picnic tables, public restrooms and showers, miles and miles of hiking and biking trails, horseback riding, a souvenir shop with grill, and a variety of camping & parking areas suitable for day trips, overnight tent camping, or extended stays in the largest of campers and motorhomes.

the canyon gallery
operated by the partners in palo duro canyon foundation, one of the canyon’s most impressive man-made attractions is “the canyon gallery.”
built of native stone near the top of the canyon in 1933 by the civilian conservation corps, its large windows overlook the canyon, providing a spectacular view of its splendor. the gallery boasts historical video productions, archeological and nature exhibits, and is beautifully arranged with southwest art for sale, handmade native american pottery, handmade navajo, zuni and santo domingo silver and turquoise jewelry, handmade hunting knives, and a large selection of hard to find regional tools that are comanche and kiowa beaded, t-shirts and hats.
