made from scrtach! “scratch” is a dirty word to most bakeries, but it’s just how we operate. every birthday cake, wedding cake, pie, and cookie is made from scratch. scratch bakeries are hard to come by in a world where cutting corners to save time and money reigns supreme. our philosophy has always been that taste and the quality of ingredients we serve our customers should not be sacrificed for any reason. be sure to visit the cafe frequently as we are always testing out new tasty scratch-made treats.our products:
