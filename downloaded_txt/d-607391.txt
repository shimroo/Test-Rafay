watchdog indiana provides information about the revenues, spending, and long-term debt
assumption of indiana local and state governments. an online community is
established where hoosiers come together voluntarily to help encourage our state
      and local governments better respond to the needs of working families. 

watchdog indiana is a
      non-profit, non-connected, and non-party advocate for good government that focuses on the
      state and local tax burden of hoosier working families.

05/06/2017:
there is one pertinent taxpayer friendly question for
      every 2018 general assembly candidate  do you support or
      oppose the transportation infrastructure funding provisions included in
      indiana house bill 1002? there is one pertinent taxpayer
      friendly question for each 2020 governor candidate  do you
      support more toll roads in indiana?
the 2017 indiana general assembly addressed the topic of transportation
      infrastructure funding with hb 1002: see http://iga.in.gov/legislative/2017/bills/house/1002.
      hb 1002 is overall taxpayer unfriendly because
      too much money is unnecessarily taken from vulnerable low-income and
      fixed-income hoosiers.
voters can occasionally use a single general assembly bill to identify
      taxpayer friends who are fiscally responsible pragmatists  and to
      identify taxpayer foes who unnecessarily shove the fist of government deep
      into the pockets of taxpayers. hb 1002 is one such bill that can be used
      to identify taxpayer friends and taxpayer foes. 
hb 1002 votes combined with the 2016 build indiana political action
      committee (bipac) campaign contributions can also be used to identify
      egregious taxpayer foes who are ethically challenged. bipac is the build
      indiana councils collective method of supporting the campaigns of
      candidates who support our industry. the build indiana council consists
      of contractors and consultants who will directly profit from more public
      spending on the highways and bridges throughout our state. ethical elected
      officials refrain from accepting campaign contributions from vested
      interests who will directly profit from decisions made by the elected
      officials.
the identified egregious taxpayer foes, other taxpayer foes, and
      taxpayer friends are listed next.

did not vote  the following 3 indiana general
      assembly members did not vote on the taxpayer unfriendly hb 1002:
      state senator phil boots (r, crawfordsville) ($500 from bipac)
      state representative steve davisson (r, salem)
      state representative david a. wolkins (r, winona lake) ($1,000 from bipac)
note: the 2016 itemized campaign contributions
      from bipac included (a) $15,000 to the indiana republican state committee;
      (b) $38,000 to the house republican campaign committee; (c) $10,000 to the
      senate majority campaign committee; and (d) a total of $176,131.76 to
      governor holcomb, 55 indiana state representatives, and 32 indiana state
      senators. bipac got a great return for their money because governor
      holcomb, 53 of the 55 state representatives, and 28 of the 32 state
      senators who received bipac campaign contributions supported the taxpayer
      unfriendly hb 1002.


did
you know?  
05/06/2017: the 2017
      indiana general assembly addressed the topic of transportation
      infrastructure funding with indiana house bill 1002: see http://iga.in.gov/legislative/2017/bills/house/1002.
      the indiana house of representatives passed hb 1002 by a 69-29 vote on
      april 21, 2017. the indiana senate passed hb 1002 by a 37-12 vote on april
      22, 2017. governor eric holcomb signed hb 1002 into law on april 27, 2017.
it has been reported that hb 1002 will provide in fiscal year
      2018 an additional $357 million in state funding and $260 million in local
      funding to maintain and improve the state's roads and bridges. this
      funding will apparently continue to increase year-over-year, reaching $1.2
      billion by 2024 - with about $850 million for state transportation
      infrastructure and $350 million for local transportation infrastructure.
the sixty major provisions of hb 1002 are summarized online
      at http://www.finplaneducation.net/transportation_infrastructure_outcome.htm.
      twenty-seven of the hb 1002 provisions are taxpayer
      unfriendly  these provisions represent an unnecessary
      elephantine grab of money out of the pockets of individual hoosier
      taxpayers. twenty-six of the hb 1002 provisions are taxpayer
      neutral, while only seven hb 1002 provisions are considered taxpayer
      friendly because they are results-oriented, compassionate,
      and fiscally responsible. 
hb 1002 is overall taxpayer
      unfriendly because too much money is unnecessarily taken from vulnerable
      low-income and fixed-income hoosiers.
