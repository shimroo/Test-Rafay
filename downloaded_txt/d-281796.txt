            inspector general robert p. storch announced today that the department of defense office of inspector general (dod oig) released the “audit of the dod government travel charge card program: the visa intellilink compliance management system.” the dod oig found that the dod’s government travel charge card (gtcc) program officials did not effectively use policies, procedures, or the visa intellilink compliance management data mining system (vicm system) to identify misuse, abuse, or potential fraud. the defense travel management office’s (dtmo) implementation and management of the vicm system limited the system’s effectiveness in identifying and assisting reviewers in investigating high-risk gtcc transactions where misuse, abuse, and fraud were more likely.
