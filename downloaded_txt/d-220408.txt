perspective on knowledge


links conquer the universe

                we can talk about these relationships as links. they're not expressed in blue underlined text, and you can't click on them. but they are the relationships among words that matter in any particular circumstance. they are the relationships that give words meaning. and as in life, those meanings are multiple and contextual. without those relationships, there is no language.
