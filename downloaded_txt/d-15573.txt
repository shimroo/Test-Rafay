recommendations


st pancras champagne bar, london

europe's longest champagne bar, and you've got a unique view of the trains! i had a great time here although admittedly i only stopped for drinks. there's a discretionary 8% service charge added to the bill, though staff deserved it, quickly finding a space for me (in my wheelchair) and friend on a busy weekday evening...

most popular


people most commonly find this website by searching for egg fried
rice recipe or fried bananas. my recipes are only beaten by
glastonbury festival
and electricity pylon sections.

many people have benefitted from my 
free deed poll information, although it's questionable whether they
appreciated my terrible jokes collection
quite as much!

however you came here, please stick around and have a rummage!


my favourites


i like to reminisce over my 
travelogue of iceland where i spent a wonderful
honeymoon...
my visits to disused underground stations...
i check my greyhound adoption pages for reference,
and i often turn to my gift ideas for people who've got
everything section for inspiration.

as a huge fan, i also maintain a 
small section of photos and info about nine inch nails.

and of course, i'd love it if you bought me something from my
wishlist!
