why use bonderite®?





our comprehensive bonderite portfolio emerges as a frontrunner in crafting supremely efficient cleaning and machining solutions that provide effective safeguarding against deterioration.

lubricants





bonderite lubricants offer excellent results for a wide range of metal forming applications. engineered for efficiency, our lubricant range ensures robust processes with swift cycles. furthermore, our revolutionary puls technology reduces processing time, eliminates hazardous materials, and enhances tool longevity – a trifecta that drives down processing costs.














































machining fluids and cleaners





developed with cutting-edge innovation, our bonderite machining fluids offer a 70% reduction in coolant consumption, elevated tool lifespan, and impeccable part cleanliness. sustainability takes center stage with henkel's coolant lineup, featuring boron-free alternatives that align with rigorous environmental benchmarks. while our neutral and alkaline cleaners provide corrosion protection, lasting biostability, impeccable performance, and low foaming converge – even amid high-pressure conditions.














































surface treatments





from zinc phosphate to thin film conversion coatings, our broad surface treatment portfolio provides effective protection against corrosion and deterioration. witness the efficiency of our thin film process that not only consumes less energy but also reduces waste and water usage and is suitable for all metals. our specialized light metal pretreatment solutions offer passivation and enhance various light-metal components. to seal anodized aluminum, our highly effective, two-step anodizing sealing solution improves anti-corrosion performance and doesn’t impact the thickness of the anodizing oxide. ideal for fully assembled components, our mpp process solutions use a autophoretic coating that provides a flexible and impact-resistant coating.




















































alongside creating the new production line, we looked for partners who could provide valuable support and help to take our company to the next level.





harmen ijdema, director of jonkman coating













the advantage of working with henkel is that we partner with a true market leader that has great products, and that trains us on how to best help our customers with those products.





keith mensing, technical service manager & sales support at rudolph bros & co.
























































lineguardx: smart monitoring and process control





designed for remote monitoring and predictive maintenance, bonderite lineguardx is an innovative manufacturing execution system (mes) that offers enhanced control and continuous monitoring of coating systems. there are many benefits to detecting potential risks early, such as improving quality standards, reducing scrap rates, and minimizing unnecessary downtimes.
