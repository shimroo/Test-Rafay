boundary stones

in the late 1950s, d.c.'s curtis brothers furniture store partnered with bassett furniture, which built the world's largest chair – a 19.5 foot tall, 4600 pound duncan phyfe -- and installed it outside their showroom in anacostia. then, they built a glass apartment atop the chair and convinced 19-year-old lynn arnold to live there in plain view, 24-7.
