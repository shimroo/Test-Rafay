founders & farmers

living harvest conscious nutrition was founded by charles holmes in 2000. in 2008 living harvest rebranded as living harvest tempt.  
charles managed to overcome debilitating allergies, digestive disorders, ibs and an ulcerated/bleeding colon that the doctors only solution was a colostomy (removal of damaged large intestine).   
in the year 2000, after years of searching for the ultimate food source for the human body, charles and his father ken discovered hemp seeds to be the optimal protein and good fat source. "living harvest foods" became pioneers in the hemp industry and produced the first hemp seed protein powder and oil among other food products like hemp milk, non soy tofu and yogurt.
