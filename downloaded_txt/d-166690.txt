						"we bought our first copier from absolute business solutions in 2006.  they are very responsive to our inquiries and repair needs. our work comes to a standstill without our copier so their quick response time is much appreciated. we have found their staff to be pleasant, dependable and knowledgeable. they stick with the job until problems are resolved. i have shared our success story with two other departments in our organization and they have both purchased copiers from abs as well. thank you for some great years.."

						" i recommend that anyone shopping for business equipment stop by absolute business solutions. “big box” stores are not always the best option. as a result of the years of business, and the friendship and confidence that has developed with that, i find it very easy to recommend and refer abs. i know they will be pleased with the quality of the products and services that abs will provide. abs will continue to be part of our business family.."

						"the service we get from scott and his team is outstanding and it has not diminished one bit since the first time we met. this is why we have been doing business with scott gary and absolute business solutions for over ten years.."					


glen f.owner/agent 






						excellent customer service and so far the machine far exceeds our previous equipment.  we definitely made the right decision in switching our services.
