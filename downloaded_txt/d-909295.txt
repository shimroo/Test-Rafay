diesel equipment company
recognizing a need for diesel fuel injection service in the triad area, diesel equipment company was established march 1st, 1967, in a 3200 square foot building at 212 atwell avenue, greensboro, north carolina. we started with just three employees including myself.  we were then recognized as an authorized service dealer for all of the fuel injection manufacturers.  after a few years all of the diesel fuel injection manufacturers selected diesel equipment company to represent them in a six-state area which included north carolina, south carolina, virginia, west virginia, maryland and delaware as a central distributor supplying parts, technical information and training to 31 service dealers in these states. we then expanded our business to include heavy duty electrical products and many other related items.
