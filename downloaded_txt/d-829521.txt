let me see



well, it's aeons since i blogged. i'm all excited about the music season this year. to know more about the concert schedule, hit this link - concert schedule(courtesy:http://ramsabode.wordpress.com). let's see what we've got new this season.

apart from that, facebook's somehow eating my time, rather i'm letting it eat my time. i guess i need to get back to writing some serious stuff, not just stop with changing my status messages and "liking" stuff that's being posted. 

so, let me see how far this goes. 
signing off!

tortures that are both physical and mental is dental.



title :  shamelessly quoting nash.

been creating a lot of ruckus of late about my "wisdom" (ahem) teeth. yes. the phase has come in my life, where i was advised to get it removed. all the w's crossed my mind. but this time i wasn't bestowed with much of a choice since the tooth was hurting apart from displaying its affection for my cheek walls. 


the first step of the onerous regime was visiting the dentist.(am sure you understand what i meant by ruckus). the classical steps followed, like getting the scans done. the best part was, i'd undergone the scans part of it (for a different problem, of course) a few years back and the recommendations provided freaked me out, which was to get the molars surgically removed. so you can guess what followed. an act of disappearance! :-) i vowed never to step into that place again. but i guess the teeth be"spoke" my destiny this time, and it all came back to me with a big bang (on a side note, fascinated by the tv series :-d).


this time there was no eschewing because of the superiority exercised by the "wisdom" teeth on me. acquiescence was the only word. :-( i decided to take the first brave?! step by fixing an appointment to get one of the tooth extracted. 


after the wait, when it was my turn to be seated on the chair, i was a little tensed (that's putting it mildly). when i was been given a shot of local anesthetic, my dentist just said one word - this is going to hurt just a little. my head started reeling and i was reminded of ogden nash's poem "this is going to hurt just a little bit". i was restless. there were a lot of dentures and teeth models lying around. it looked like all of those were laughing at me. 
but when the process of extraction started, i didn't realize the start or the end of it. it was over in a jiffy. pretty unbelievable! all it takes is less than 30 secs to "pull" out the "wisdom". 


well, its not over yet. there's one more round of extraction. the day will come soon when i'll be devoid of all the "wisdom" teeth. it's not too far. that will indicate the time for my next post. 

 just a note of advice - don't be callous towards this calcareous structure. there's no gain without pain!

a pandemonium?



what's happening? 
why such tumult? 
why such uproar? 
why? why? 


i am terribly disturbed by whatever has been happening. what is the cause for all this? daily life has become a battle. the number of offences committed everyday is exponentially increasing! but what compels one to perpetrate? 
the least i can hope is that the word peace remains in one piece. let that not be massacred too. 


do i hear myself listening to "we didn't start the fire" ?

la vie en rose



been wanting to write about a movie for quite sometime. finally decided to. but, the unique aspect, (well, that's how i would like to christen it) is that, this is  written in french! i thought my blog was a good arena to portray the little french that i've learnt! without any disclaimers, here i narrate - 




j'ai vu un fil qui s'appelle la vie en rose. ce film est sorti en février 2007. j'ai vu le bande-annonce du film à l'avance. il était trés intéressant et j'ai decidé de le voir. le genre est musical. l'actrice marion cotillard joue un rôle édith piaf , la chanteuse dans le film. elle a gagné 'le premier actrice' à l'oscar.


l'histoire du film est "la vie à édith piaf", et il présente la view de l'enfance à la mort. toutes les chansons du film sont trop belle. et mon chanson favorite est non, regrette rien. la mise en scène est trés riche!


les dialogues du film sont trés émouvants. j'ai pleuré finalement. vous ne manquez pas ce film. à voir absolument!

december season 2008



after a long hiatus... here i come. well, this ain't one of my new year resolutions ;)
so, let me dive directly into the details about the concerts that i attended - 
the first kutcheri that i attended this year was shri.sanjay subramanyam @ infosys hall. i really liked the krithi that he rendered shulini. the interesting part of the concert was the rtp in madhuvanti with the pallavi "kuzhal inidhu yaazh inidhu". was extremely interesting!he also gave us a glimpse into the raga priyadarshini. the performance was, i would say, profound.
 the next concert was shri.u.srinivas @ vani mahal. well, the surprise element for me was the swarajathi that was rendered, which is composed by syama shastri that goes like "kamakshi amba anudinamu mara vakane". apart from that, there was mohana kalyani, nalinakanthi, kapi narayani and tarangini, etc., overall, it was a good performance. 
next in the list was ranjani and gayathri @ the music academy. they started off with a varnam in todi. followed by sri saraswathi in arabhi. tiruvadi sharanam in khamboji was the main piece. i wasn't completely impressed by the choice of the krithis and the alapana.
 on the same day, i caught shri.t.n.seshagopalan @ mylapore fine arts. i would say this was easily one of the best concerts that i've attended in this season. he started with saveri "sri rajagopala". followed by marivere in shanmukhapriya. there was a thiruppavai in shankarabharanam "pulum silambina kaan". he also rendered a krithi in todi - dachukovalena in misra jampa! trust me...he started singing an rtp at 9.00 pm! and it was mind blowing. it was in poorvikalyani, bhagesri and sri! the pallavi being "veena gana dasa gamadakriye" from meenakshi me mudam. he aslo rendered revathi and a thillana in the end. it was an eclectic concert, i would say! 
 also attended shri.t.n.krishan sir's concert @ mfa. he strung together suruti, behag, kharaharapriya, sindhubhairavi, shanmukhapriya, etc., in his concerts. he was accompanied by smt. viji krishan and shri.sriram kirshnan. the whole concert was mellifluous. . 

 the only disappointing thing was, i couldn't get to hear shri. t.n.sankaranarayanan's kutcheir this year. hoping to catch one soon!

will i ever feel like going to the beach?




are we going to the beach today? 
if it's the only place we can reach 
such lessons does life teach 
am going to screech..... 
if you stick to me like a leech 
i practice, not merely preach 
instead it tastes like a peach 
just one cheek or each? 
so that you don't teach 
are you going to beseech? 
now you are at a loss for speech 
i wonder how this state i did reach 
from...beach is the only place that we could reach...... 

trust me...this is one of the conversation(??!!) i had with,whom i would rather call an ally!! by this time you would've guessed the league to which we belong. :-)

yamakasi




had an opportunity to watch this movie yamakasi-les samouraïs des temps modernes, meaning, yamakasi, the samurai(s) of the modern times. thanks to the little bit of french that i've been learning so far.

the plot of this movie is pretty simple, am not elaborating it here, since i am not sure about the nuances to be kept in mind while writing a review for a movie. so who do you think are these yamakasi? they are basically french practitioners who practise acrobatics. so how different is this from parkour or free running? the aim of yamakasi is to reach point b from point a aesthetically providing complete freedom of movement. what parkour does is, it focuses on how efficiently you can reach point b from point a. (pretty much similar to a tsp!).


about the word origin, it sounded very japanese, apparently it's a word from lingala meaning strong spirit,strong energy. 

 
feel drained out? i would definitely suggest this movie! the music + the tactics + good dialogues (i watched it in french!)make this a wonderful movie to watch!!!! it truly lives up to its name...high energy. 

so isn't it time that you aesthetically plunge into this?
