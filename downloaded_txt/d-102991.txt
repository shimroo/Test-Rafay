putting old wood to work
reclaimed wood used for conservatories combine traditional craftsmanship with the most up to date and efficient techniques to create unique and beautiful conservatories tailored towards your specific needs. 
traditionally, conservatories have been associated with summer, but as we provide double glazed windows fitted with toughened safety glass, and the conservatory is heated, it will be a permanent asset to the house throughout the whole year. 
reclaimed wood conservatory is designed and created  especially for you,  there are virtually no restrictions on size or shape as they are made to measure and can be designed to fit any space, wall or corner.

iâ have recently been introduced to goji berries, which have   apparently beome all the rage as the latest super food. they are   delicious, i think-nice and chewy, with quite a distinct flavour-just   the job for scattering on your breakfast cereal. 
the very day afterâ i   had eaten my first handful of these berries, there was an article all   about them in the daily telegraph. there i discovered thatâ they areâ the   fruits of a shrub called lycium barbarum, the duke of argyll’s tea   tree. moreâ

every consumer decision we make has an impact on the  environment this is an ecological fact of life. every time we go shopping, use  public or private transport, or choose a place to live in our choices have an  effect, for better or worse, on the quality of the air we breathe and the water  we drink â on the world we experience with our eyes and ears and noses:

	  it is not always easy to see the connections, but we are  getting better at recognizing them. clearly, the paper we buy as packaging and  then throw away was once a tree, and the elect& 'power that flows from the  wall sockets comes from a -fossil fuel plant nuclear reactor, or hydroâs.

hampton court flower show 
i went along to the hampton court flower show this year and was stunned to discover that a visit there could make the sick well again. well, maybe not. however, i did see people, who had spent all day being pushed around in a wheelchair, up walking and pushing their own wheelchairs.          
the impetus for this was, of course, the great sell off at the close of the show. father was walking through the show ground cradling his baby in his arms, whilst mother followed with the pushchair laden with plants. granny, who had benefited from resting in her wheelchair as she moved around the show, found it was an ideal way to get her lilies and agapanthus back to the carpark.
            
          once out of the showground the sights were enough to make a gardener cringe, trees, agapanthus, eremurus and lilies sticking out of the sun roofs of dozens of cars on their way to the m3. 
other had folded up plants as best they could so that they would travel on the bus and underground. then there is the safe bet that many of the plants acquired will not have been planted for several days, nor watered, nor put out of the sun.
            
            when will people learn that a bargain is only a bargain if you can get the plant home alive and in one piece... otherwise it is just so much compost.
