 madonna contessa ilaria veltri degli ansari 

 i have been an active member of the society for creative anachronism since 1982, in that time i have made much clothing and other items and generally tried my hand at many types of arts and sciences.
i have been active in the sca equestrian community for 20 years, in both caid and antir.  during this time i have designed and built a variety of tack, saddles, and both full coverage and open decorative trappings.
i have written various how-to articles, some of which i am proud to bring to this venue.
