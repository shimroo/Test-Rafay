all nabea members must
          graduate nabea certification training classes. if you are a member in
          good standing, you 
          may attend our classes at no charge. 
          all classes are taught by experienced professional active
          bail enforcement agents, who are part of the nabea.
          while training manuals are issued to each participating
          student, very little material is read from a book.
          the training manual is for the student to refer to
          outside the class.
          nabea membership is restricted to those who complete
          the nabea certification course.  


**disclaimer: there are those impostors
          advertising that the nabea 
          has sanctioned their training. this
          is not true. nabea and it's staff 
          present training classes and we at the association do not recognize
          nor do 
          we allow individuals or so called "recovery groups" to present
          our classes. 
          our classes use the official nabea manual that is not for public
          sale.
