the widow's mite pendant





in the english new testament in both mark and luke there are stories told about the widow giving her ‘mites’. although there is much controversy as to which actual coins these referred to it is more than likely that the coins were those of the jewish king alexander jannaeus in 103-76 bc.one of these coins is the prutah, a particularly ugly coin as demonstrated in my coin r105/6087/04/16.in victorian times it was fashionable to make pendants of these coins and an example is shown here under the number r244/s6089/6/12

minor into what is now pakistan. the most important seleucid kings were seleucus i, antiochus i, antiochus ii, seleucus ii, antiochus iii, and antiochus iv, whose reigns spanned the period between 312 bc and 163 bc with brief interruptions.the seleucid kingdom had two capitals: antioch in syria (now antakya, turkey) and seleucia on the tigris in mesopotamia. the seleucids were greeks in language and culture, and they encouraged greek colonists to settle in their domains. nevertheless, in their autocratic rule they followed the example of their syrian, mesopotamian, and persian predecessors. beginning with antiochus ii, they were worshipped as gods. they were frequently involved in wars with the ptolemies, a macedonian dynasty that had established itself in egypt.after 250 bc the

defeat and death of king antigonus i of macedonia, obtained the largest share of the spoils, including the whole of syria and a great part of asia minor. he built numerous cities, including antioch and several named after him, including seleucia on the tigris, seleucia pieria, and seleucia tracheotis. he proclaimed himself king of macedonia but was assassinated soon after. seleucus ii, called callinicus (c. 265-226 bc), ruler (247-226 bc) of the seleucid kingdom, the son of antiochus ii theos. seleucus ii was unable to prevent ptolemy iii of egypt from invading syria and mesopotamia during

when i first bought this coin, the dealer explained that because the edges of the coin were thin it might appear at first sight to have been a contemporary forgery. he also offered to buy it back at any time if it's provenance was questioned.since then i have had it fully "accepted" by several experts.

adopted heir of tiberiussuetonius tells us that because caligula was self conscious about being bald and hairy he announced that it was a capital offence for anyone to either look down on him as he passed or to mention goats in any context.amongst the many horror stories told about him (by suetonius) is that he made parents attend their son’s executions and when one father excused himself on the grounds of ill-health he provided a litter for him.this was the first coin in my collection and was authenticated by the british museum

moneyers were private individuals, members of prominent families, who were licensed to mint silver or gold but not bronze which was limited to the state.the interesting point of the coin shown is the serrated edge, a precursor of the modern one pound coin with it’s milled edge.note the biga (two horsed chariot) one sees other coins with trigas (three horses) and quadrigass (four horses).

my top 20:  coin no.2:   athenian tetradrachma 393-300 bc





one of the most famous series of ancient coins ever minted and known colloquially as athenian owls. used widely and initially well trusted in the mediterranean in the 5th & 4th centuries bc. widely copied, often debased, easily forged.first coin of this type about 510 bc when athenian democracy was established.  the early coinage, known as archaic, shows the eye ‘egyptian’ style, whilst later coins showed the eye facing forward.on the obverse athena, patron goddess, on the reverse her owl who flew about the world every evening and returned with news of what had happened the previous day. the sprig of olive pays tribute to the vast trade in olive oil & the pots which held the oil.the long drawn out peloponnesian war drained athens of her wealth & importance and ended with the capture of the city by the spartans.when athens was cut off from the silver mines at laurian c 406 bc it was forced to produce silver plated (fourree) type coins that it originally intended to replace with pure silver after the war.currency values & weightsdeka-drachm=10 dr=43.9 gmtetradrachm=4 dr=17.29 gmdidrachm=2 dr=8.69 gmdrachma=6 obols=4.39 gmhemidrachm=1/2 dr=2.15 gn

my first ancient coin





how it all startedin 1979, my wife and i had a holiday in greece and the first week was based in athens. it was a good holiday and one couldn’t help being caught up in the sense of the wonder of the past. what better way to remember some of this, i thought, than by buying a coin of the period and what better place to buy it than in the plaka area around the acropolis.i found a suitable small shop that actually had a tray of coins in the window and we entered. the proprietor asked me what i was looking for and when i told him he sent his wife to get us some coffee and a tray of coins.when she returned he proudly showed us a small velvet lined tray with various silver type coins. i looked, and then handled a few of the coins and then i said “i’m sorry but these are fakes”. you now have to appreciate the fact that at that time i knew absolutely nothing about coins and particularly nothing about ancient coins and yet i here i had just told this heavy looking greek gentleman, that these coins were fakes. this begs the question : how did i know they were fakes, well, for a start for coins that were supposed to have been around for about 2000 years old they looked too pristine. they also looked, to my admittedly inexperienced eye as though they had just been minted and in addition they felt too light.to my astonishment the proprietor made no attempt to remonstrate with me but spun round and let loose some pretty strong greek words at his wife, none of which appeared to be in my greek phrase book he then immediately translated what he had just said as “the silly woman has brought the wrong tray, these are just souvenirs for tourists “.having now lost confidence in the whole establishment we left the un-drunk coffees behind us and beat a hasty retreat.i still wanted a coin to take home so on the way back to the hotel i found another shop, this one slightly larger and in a main shopping street.this time the shop owner spoke little english but when i showed him a modern coin and said that i wanted to buy some ‘old’ ones he got the message. he produced a dusty tray of coins that he said were roman, greek coins being apparently out of stock at that moment the short story is that i bought two and he gave me a third for nothing and these looked genuine.when we got back home i phoned the british museum, said i had some unidentified roman coins and could they help me with their identification.come along, they said, (in 1979 you could do this!) and within a week of my holiday i now knew that amongst the coins i had bought in athens was one minted in corinth during the reign of the emperor caligula , ad 27-41.i did some research and learned that he was the youngest son of germanicus the adopted heir of tiberius. he was born in 12 ad and was murdered in 41 ad. the obverse side portrayed caligula himself, on the reverse side of the coin was pegasus, flying right, as the terminology went. the coin is graded g for good, although i would refer to it as g for grotty..... never mind....i was now a numismatist !

the fake judaea capta coin i bought in jerusalem





not many numismatists can put their hand on their heart and say "i've never bought a fake". let me tell you about my first such buy. it happened more than fifteen years ago whilst on a walking tour of jerusalem.my wife and i were about to enter a church (we were with a non-denominational group of tourists) when i spotted a young arab lad selling coins from a tobacco tin. i asked the israeli guide if he minded us skipping out of visiting the interior whilst i attempted to do a deal with the young trader. the guide said to me “be warned, they sell lots of fakes to the tourists here”.i pulled myself up to my full 5ft 5 and replied rather huffily “i’ve been collecting coins for quite a few years and should be able to spot a fake by now !”.the guide shrugged his shoulders and left me to do my own thing.the coin i finally bought from the trader was a bronze sestertius of the judaea capta series and i remember paying 36shekels, then the equivalent of about sixteen pounds sterling. i was delighted with my buy and when we rejoined the group i made a point of telling the guide of what a good deal i had made.back in london some months later i had occasion to show the coin to an ex-curator from the british museum. he said to me “you are not going to like what i am about to tell you” i knew immediately what he was about to say but i had to hear it from his own lips. “not only is this a a modern counterfeit ” he continued “but it’s the worse fake i’ve seen in years and to make matters worse they’ve used an old english penny for the flan (that’s the blank piece of metal from which a coin is made).in hindsight i have no complaints. i was well and truly conned and whenever i talk about my collection i make a point of showing this blatant forgery as an example of what to look out for when buying coins, but there is a moral to this tale and it’s quite simple.if you are ever offered a coin by a young arab lad outside a church in jerusalem say “not today thank you ” and rejoin your fellow tourists immediately.
