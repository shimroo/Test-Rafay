attack in liege, belgium by immigrant killer





there are more and more incidents in europe with a multicultural background.

belgian gangster of immigrant background

there was an attack today on a court of justice in belgium today. four people were killed and more than sixty were wounded. the attack took place at 12:30 local time, in the city of liege, in french speaking belgium. the gunman threw concussion grenades (flash bangs) and shot around him with an ak-47 assault rifle. the gunman is around thirty years old and his name is nordine amrani. he is a immigrant from morrocco and has been convicted previously for possessing a large number of guns and a mariuana plantation of many hundreds of plants. nordine amrani is one of the people who does the work belgians do not want to do.

meanwhile in italy

in florence a right-wing extremist shot two senegalese immigrants and then killed himself. the gunman's name is gianluca casseri.

and in germany and norway

germany is still reeling from the discovery of a neo-nazi death squad ("döner mörder") who killed eight immigrant snack bar owners. norway has its lone anti multi-cultural gun man anders breivik, who shot more than sixty kids attending a holiday camp of the social-democratic party.

reactions in the press

in the dutch press nordine amrani is described as a "liege man" and a gun nut. not as someone of immigrant stock. which is what the press does all over the west to obscure the immigrant origin of a large part of the crime wave that has been hitting western nations since the 1970ies. expect more headlines as immigrant colonies grow in europe and their members become more assertive. also there will be more terrorist attacks by right-wing terrorists, both as individuals and in groups. the economic crisis and the resulting high unemploymenst will only fan the fires as "idle hands are the devil's workshop".

european governments are preparing for a greek default





what is bein said in holland

the german and dutch governments are preparing for a greek default. the dutch minister of finance de jager stated that with regards to the greek debt crisis his ministry "considers all scenarios". so that implicitly means the dutch ministry of finance is considering a greek default, that is an inability to pay back what it has borrowed.

and in germany

more imporantly the german minister of economics and finance philipp rösler has speculated publicly on the risk of greece defaulting. the german ministry of finance is making preparations for the turmoil on the financial markets which will ensue once greece is unable to make payments to its lenders. at that point greece will also be unable to pay civil servants' salaries and benefits to pensioners and those on welfare. this is projected to happen by october. 

the reason why german and dutch politicians are speculating on a greek default is electoral. their voters are unwiilling to support them if they continue to throw money at the greeks. without the money from germany greece will default, as their own tax revenue is insufficient to cover their projected spending. 

and then

if greece defaults and is not bailed out, other countries in a debt crisis such as italy, ireland and spain will also not be bailed out. it they are not bailed out by germany they will not be able to attract loans. without the loans they will not be able keep up their projected spending. their budgets will contract very rapidly, their economies will shrink and the investors who lend them their money will have to write off the debts.

the german banks

and these investors are often german and dutch banks. if the countries in a debt crisis go broke, the german and dutch banking sector will be in a huge crisis. and the german and dutch economy will slow down. and then all of europe will experience a shrinking economy as a result of all the debt that has been taken on.

greek debt crisis





parapundit has financial news. and it is bad. greek treasury bills now charge 88 percent yields in order to attract buyers. 

that is incredible. it is like those great depression stories grandfather told me.

immigration affects the bottom first

mass immigration is transforming europe. one of its effects is that its political culture is losing the sedateness that is the result of not being part of a great power struggle. many european countries became very laid back after 1945. with the arrival of large numbers of third world immigrants first social relations on the lower rungs of society became more strained, as the streets of european countries experienced an ethnic crime wave that has lasted 40 years. 

reaching the political elite

since 9-11 these immigration fueled tensions are starting to be felt in the political apex of society as well. the political class which foisted wave after wave of new populations on european peoples started to feel a growing backlash from populist parties, such as the danish people's party in denmark, vlaams belang in belgium, freedom party in the netherlands and the svp in switzerland. but the political elite always felt physically secure.

elite insecurity

that seems to be over now. the cause is the assasination of 70 plus young norwegian labour members by terrorist anders breivik. a few days ago dutch labour leader job cohen was interviewed by daily newspaper trouw and said: members of the [labour] party are asking themselves whether this could happen in the netherlands. nobody was expecting that a prosperous and politically stable country such as norway could be the scene of such a ruthless murderous attack. one tends to ponder about the question whether such a thing could happen in the netherlands as well.cohen continued: do not underestimate how much fear this caused amongst social-democrats and other leftist politicians. it is a sad feeling, when one works on society, to bind people together it is a favor to be replaced 

cohen still does think he and his ilk did dutch people a favour when he flooded the country with third worlders. he is still not aware that all societies which have to endure high levels of diversity become fragmented and lose social cohesion. this was shown by professor robert d. putnam in 2007: in the presence of [ethnic] diversity, we hunker down. we act like turtles. the effect of diversity is worse than had been imagined. and it’s not just that we don’t trust people who are not like us. in diverse communities, we don’t trust people who do look like us.
loss of trust

anders breivik had lost trust in norway's political elite because they had betrayed him and his fellow norwegians. many other europeans feel betrayed too. because the road to a peaceful change of policy has been blocked by anti-racist legislation such people will take their anger out on the left. breivik's act was both immoral and counter-productive. it will be more difficult for a rightwing anti-immigration party to make headway in norway do to the hardening of norwegian attitudes caused by his deeds. 

the splintering effect

there is no silver lining. i think there will be more attacks on political parties by members of the public. not just in norway but all over europe. these attacks will frighten the public and give the political class the opportunity to increase the repressive legislation and to increase security services for the political class, not for the population at large.

and so the indiginous populations in europe and the political class are growing further and further apart. this will not end pretty.

not defending our nations is madness





last september 3, die freiheit, a new german eurosceptic party opposed to islamisation held a conference in berlin. one of the speakers there was oskar freysinger, a swiss eurosceptic and an enemy of islamisation. mr. freysinger's party organised the anti-minaret referendum in switzerland. mr. freysinger is a great speaker and he made an impressive appeal to his audience in the youtube clip featured below. the clip is subtitled in english.

oskar freysinger: have we gone mad?

london: edl coach is attacked by muslims





a bus full of english defense league (edl) supporters was attacked on saturday by muslims in the tower hamlets neighbourhood in east-london. the muslims spontaneously attacked the patriots, because ethnic englishmen expressing their patriotism is completely unacceptable to these immigrants.

about me





snouck


snouck hurgronje was a dutch orientalist and scholar of islam the son of a reverend. mr hurgronje went to jedda, saudi arabia, in 1884, convincing the islamic authorities of his sincerity as a convert to islam. as "abd-el ghaffar" he went down to mecca, a city reserved for muslims. here he did an anthropological investigation into the city and its religious practices. just before the annual pilgrimage or hajj he was expelled. 

his travel report named "mecca" made mr. hurgronje well known amongst orientalists. 

mr. hurgronje had spoken to the jawa, the indonesian expatriate community in mecca. he used his knowledge to assist the dutch administration and military in the dutch east indies (present-day indonesia) to assist in the defeat of the revolt on west sumatra or aceh. 

his dictum was that the imams and ulama had to be hit with harshness while the aceh military caste had to be co-opted, as the islamic religious leaderhip were the true leadership of the revolt. in his later life he went back to the netherlands leaving his family there. he started a new family, naming his daughter “christina”.
