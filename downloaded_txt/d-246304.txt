river and lake remediation

 
 


lab services:
 
 

		filamentous identification lab service. one reason 
		to identify filaments is to determine the filaments characteristics and 
		then determine the type present. 
		if the type is found out, a root cause can usually be associated 
		with a particular filament.  
		if the cause is known, then a correction can be made to alleviate 
		problems. chlorination is only a quick fix. 
		without process changes, filaments will grow back after 
		chlorination. 
wastewater biomass analyses and cooling tower analyses also available

 


training materials:
 
 
training is an integral part of any job. not everyone is at the same level of training. many people want beginning concepts and basics.  some need technical information or troubleshooting. some want equipment, technology or process information. 
we have developed a full set of basic training, advanced training, 
		filamentous identification the easy way as well as custom training cd's 
		manuals. we also provide hands-on training classes and soon will have an 
		online "e-university".

		online wastewater training courses. courses on wastewater equipment, 
		biomass and filaments. check out our website with our elearning center and training course's. ceu credits are 
		available where 
		applicable.

		 



microclearâ® microchillâ¢ contains a unique and newly patented 
		proprietary blend of psychrophilic microorganisms that are naturally 
		occurring bacteria with the ability to grow at 4â°c, and lower. because 
		of the diversity of the microorganisms and enzyme systems, incorporated 
		into this product, it is excellent for use in municipal and industrial 
		wastewater applications. the safe, naturally occurring bacteria are 
		present in high numbers to handle difficult to treat wastewater problems 
		in lower temperatures.

		microclearâ® products works well with ww treatment systems, lagoons and liftstations 
		where lack of movement and odors are present. microblockâ¢ is a proprietary formulation of ingredients containing a 
		solid slow release for control of odors. contains a 
		specially formulated, proprietary blend of microorganisms, 
		micro/macronutrients, and surface tension 
		suppressants/penetrants.  because of the diversity of the microorganism 
		systems incorporated into this product it is specifically developed for 
		use in situations where there is a particular high impact from odors as 
		well as fats, oils and grease. this product can be used in the treatment 
		of liquid and solid organic waste. 

 
delivering you innovative and technical expertise and sound business solutions to help you improve your bottom line is our goal.
		
		smooth operation of a wastewater treatment plant is critical. 
		environmental compliance is a must. operational costs are skyrocketing 
		with new environmental regulations. below are ways we can help your 
		biological systems needs.
