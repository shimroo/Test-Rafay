 lincoln county, north carolina
economic development association
 




close to charlotte, north carolina. connected to everywhere.




some things you can measure. acreage. workforce statistics. transportation metrics. the hard data and numbers are important, of course. but so are the intangibles. the things that are felt, not measured. hometown pride. a lakefront sunrise. families, friends and neighbors together at the ball field, the local theater, the ice cream parlor. connections are what life is all about. lincoln county, nc, has them.




we’re one of the friendliest corners of the charlotte, nc region. business friendly. friendly friendly. a community with a strong sense of place and purpose, and the drive and hustle to make things happen. our connections ripple out to nearby charlotte, one of the nation’s fastest-growing metro markets, and to the world, with a network of major interstates, rail and an international airport hub. business locations are life locations. the link between them is critical. the link is lincoln.
