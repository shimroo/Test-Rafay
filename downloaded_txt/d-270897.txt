mel & florence brilliant


experience and value!

marie was able to sell my house in one day! she knew exactly how to price my home in order for it to move fast in this competitive market. we also had our offer picked on a home that had multiple offers on it! marie was always available to my husband and i whether by phone call or text. her office staff is amazing and helped to move things along flawlessly. i will absolutely refer her to any family or friends that are looking to buy or sell. give this fabulous lady a call you won’t regret it!

the best team!

marie and mark are excellent realtors as well as friends of ours. not only did they sell us our first home but they help us sell it in 2 days. they are the most professional real estate company on upper cape cod. they are efficient, organized and honest. we appreciate all their help during both times of buying and selling our home. can’t thank them enough.
