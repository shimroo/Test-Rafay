cue sheets online
lots of cue sheets are available on this server. right now we have about 680 dances with head cues, and about 100 dances with full cue sheet (fine print).
cue sheets (head cues)
 there are 2 ways to access to the cue sheets. either you use the 
full alphabetical index. or you also may try the indices by phase and rhythm.


cue sheets by phase:

phase ii
phase iii
phase iv
phase v
phase vi


cue sheets by rhythm:

2step
waltz
fox
quickstep
tango
single swing
slow 2step


rumba
cha cha
jive
samba
west coast swing
paso doble
mambo
bolero


full cue sheets (fine prints)
in contrast to the quick cues, which usually are used by the cuer for cueing to the music, the fine prints give all information about the dance. every step, all directions and the timing are explained in detail in the fine prints. this is the basis to teach a dance. for full cue sheets a special  notation  is used. usually it is very hard to get fine prints in digital form, because only the choreographer has them. so if you happen to have a fine print on your computer, you are welcome to submit this to the server.
