nutrition faqs
it’s time to get serious about proportions, health and ice cream. of course, keeping yourself on a daily regimen of exercise, healthy diet of fruits and vegetables with a reward here and there—can even mean a good ol’ boost of morale!








about us













are there healthy minerals in ice cream?
            






most ice creams are a rich source of phosphorus and calcium, sometimes even accounting for between 6 to 10% of the daily value (dv), that’s for a 1/2 cup serving. both minerals are important for muscle function and skeletal health.









can ice cream be part of a healthy diet?
            






everything in moderation! and of course enjoying an ice cream on a hot summer day, with family and friends or after a hard-earned task as a reward—there’s nothing quite like it. to avoid over-indulging, try sticking to minis, smaller bars or cones to keep your portions in check. or use our advice on a smaller bowl or mug.









what brands contain the lowest calories?
            






if you’re hoping to enjoy the desserts with less guilt, try skinny cow’s line of products like not fudging around chocolate fudge or next level vanilla caramel. all the indulgence in perfectly reasonable proportions. outshine offers a range on no-sugar added options, and smaller bars. häagen-dazs offers a few mini proportions, and sorbets that help keep you on the healthy side.
