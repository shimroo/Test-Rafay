a 100% american company!


easyrider lan pro
is a portland, oregon computer network
engineering and outsourced 

unix administration consulting company. we do
complete, ground up network and 

noc designs and builds, implementations, 
upgrades, conversions, baselining, support and problem solving. we 
can travel to your job site to work on your project or you can save 
a pile of money by having some of the development work done remotely.
our rates are extremely competitive and unlike some others, we have 
quite a few noc designs under our belts already.


easyrider lan pro
owns and operates 
vigilance monitoring,
a professionally staffed, proactive computer server, applications and network
monitoring company.
we can use sniffers and other tools to 

audit sites, measure traffic patterns,
identify bottlenecks and recommend
improvements.  we can use our professional monitoring tools to
baseline your equipment and do capacity planning for future growth.


network security is a big focus for 
easyrider lan pro.  every network
we have looked at in recent years has had significant security vulnerabilities that were just
begging to be exploited!  if you don't have an active, aggressive security
plan already in place, you need to talk to us.  we have a great deal of experience with intrusion detection
systems (ids), firewalls and security "best practices" as well as hack
prevention, denial of service (dos) and virus prevention methods.  let us
tighten up your network before you get hacked! 
have a look at our "no network is 100% secure" 

enterprise security white papers for information about things you can do 
easily and inexpensively to dramatically improve security in your data center.
interested in information about the 

cybersecurity act of 2009?
are shrinking it budgets and ever-reducing staff headcounts causing your 
network security focus to "fall through the cracks"? consider bringing in an 

expert security consultant to assess your current vulnerabilities. 
in the battle to protect your network: if you know the enemy and know yourself you
need not fear the results of a hundred battles. -- sun tzu quote

enterprise security for the non-technical office worker
a cybercrime security brown bag lunch seminar



this is a one hour seminar geared towards non-it office staff who use company
computers.  as you probably know, lack of user knowledge is the number one cause of
successful hack attempts. most it organizations simply don't have the time or the
resources to develop and deliver the training needed to secure this major
vulnerability
in their computing environment.  considering that a successful hack can cost many
thousands of $$$ and several days to clean up, we believe that you'll agree that
the nominal cost for our seminars will be well worth the money.
inquiry   to schedule a

brown bag seminar at your portland/vancouver area
facility right now!
