i pioneered modern day commercial parasailing by developing the parasail launch/retrieval delivery and rider transport systems 
used throughout the commercial parasailing industry from the early 1970âs until today.  these systems have been accepted and 
recognized as the industry standards for commercial operations throughout the world.   
i hold the majority of every single and multiple  parasail system patents granted by the united states patent and trademark 
office for commercial parasailing, including the: 
1.
parasail launching and retrieving apparatus, 
2.
parasailing assembly and system and launching the same,
3.
para-sail rope guide system
4.
aerial recliner for parasailing 
5.
rider support assembly for parasailing and
6.
strap assembly for parasailing.   
my patent relating to the strap support assembly for parasailing was used by nasaâs dryden flight research center in 1995 for 
its x-38 prototype crew return vehicle.  
i also have extensive experience, beginning in 1971 and spanning nearly three decades, in the design, development and 
operation of parasailing equipment and operations.  i developed the first stationary parasail launching and retrieval platform in 
1971, the first motorized parasail launching and retrieval platform in 1972,   in 1976  i was the first to design and manufacture  
and commercially operate the first self-contained winch boat that included a parasailor tow bar and  harness assembly  that is 
commonly referred to as a â tow barâ     
in 1976, i was the first to commercially operate a parasail winch boat using a tow bar and harness support.  
the crude tow bar design posed some risk and became problematic for commercial operations that required further 
development.
in 1983, in an effort to improve overall parasailor safety, i combined the tow bar and body harnesses together and called it the 
floating tow bar harness, photo below.
this was part of a series of inventions trying to improve the safety of the tow bar/harness design that eventually evolved into the 
invention of the parasail aerial recliner that incorporated the same attachment point locations to the parasail canopy as the tow 
bar, but eliminated the need for an independent multiple body harness systems.  
in 1985, i wrote, established, and published the first operating standards and guidelines for commercial parasailing, modified 
versions of which is still being used by operators today. in the early 1990âs the tow bar idea become a popular low cost solution 
versus the aerial recliner with the popularity of the winch boats and is now accepted as a method for multiple passengers.
commercial rental and operations experience, knowledge and training
i was one of the first parasail operators to be approached by a resort hotel to operate a commercial parasail concession, and 
continued to do this for several resort hotels  including entering into a four-year participant  agreement with walt disney world 
in 1994 to operate a commercial parasail concession.   in this capacity, i wrote the first  parasail operating guidelines and safety 
standards manual for parasailing in a resort/hotel setting. i also have served as an advisor and consultant for other commercial 
parasail operators located at other resort hotels in the united states and internationally. i am frequently called by resort hotels, 
including the radisson, to inspect parasail operations and their equipment and/or develop parasail operating guidelines and 
safety standards for their commercial parasail operations.  
i have also served as an advisor and consultant to other entities, including the united states air force and united states navy in 
the improvement of their motorized parasail âlaunch onlyâ platform utilized for their water survival training program.  i designed 
and built the first winch boat for the military to use in this program.  i have served as an advisor and consultant to the united 
states coast guard, the national transportation safety board, and the federal aviation administration in their investigations of 
parasail accidents.   in 1998, i founded parasail.org, an online publication that provides the general public, commercial 
operators, and government entities with information relating to commercial parasailing, including risk awareness, accident 
statistics, consumer safety tips, and operating standards. since the mid 1980âs  i have been among the first contacted by any 
local, state, or federal agency whenever a major parasail accident occurs in the united states involving serious injury or death, 
and since that time, i have been involved in multiple investigations.

testimonials  
you'd probably like to know what law firms say about my expert witness and consulting services, so here are just a few 
testimonials that i have received over the years.
panish shea & boyle.. www.psblaw.com 
we were reluctant five years ago to get involved in parasail litigation.  our law firms success rate is over 99% in plaintiff liability 
cases with verdicts in the billion dollar range  primarily in land and air transportation market sector.  your 40 years of expertize 
and experience in the field of para-sailing; and as our investigative consultant played a major role in us stepping into this venue 
with three (3) successful out of court settlements to date.   what we have learned in spite of recent efforts to regulate 
commercial para-sailing against preventable accidents.  increased insurance claim settlements now averaging $3+ million and 
judgments reaching $9 million (the highest to date) that consistently exceed policy limits an exposing non-operator third parties.  
parasail litigation has become a prime target for large firms like ourselves willing to accept these cases and produce higher than 
average results for plaintiffs.  -  deborah chang, esq. of  panish shea & boyle - los angeles ca. 
 
walker vs. sheraton hotelsâ¦ >  it is important to note that the defense was never able to qualify anyone in the industry as a 
"parasail expert" to refute your testimony. also, the jury almost recited your testimony in the verdict.  in summary, your 
testimony was not only helpful in winning this case, but reaffirms your position within the industry  - ralph lotkin esq. of  lotkin 
& cochrin  - washington dc 
woodcock vs. nc watersportsâ¦ >  it was terrible thing to experience this parasailing tragedy with our clients and then listen to 
defense lawyers try to pass the blame around. but no matter how bad it got, your wealth of information and experience kept 
things together in helping us secure a (9 million dollar verdict).    joel rhine of lea, rhine & rosbrugh, p.l.l.c.  - north carolina
myers vs. beiswenger entâ¦  > we were in settlement negotiations for $200,000 before the court compelled your testimony 
which persuaded the jury to returned a 4.5 million verdict for our clients.  stuart ratson - stewart, tilghman, fox & bianchi p.a. - 
miami, florida 
swinehart vs. holloway et. al...  > parasailing negligence in this incident would have been very difficult to prove without a reliable 
parasail expert.  manuel & thompson p.a. - panama city, florida
fiser vs. thomasâ¦ > as you know, i struggled with my partners to take this case on without your assistance.  we are confident 
that with your support we will reach a fair settlement for our clients. clifford higby esq. of byrant & higby - panama city, florida
knobloch vs. parasail cityâ¦ >  despite the strong evidence (i.e. video tape of the adverse weather conditions and towline 
snapping) would not have been sufficient to reach our settlement goals without your involvement.  david otto esq. of newman 
& okum, pc - new york city 
shaffer vs. parasail cityâ¦ > your assistance in our case was paramount to our successful settlement.  roger vaughan esq. of 
wagner, vaughan & mclaughlin / shaffer v. parasail city - tampa, florida
raisner vs. parasail usaâ¦ >  this case being over ten years old it was hard to decide our next move without your expertise. fern 
flomenhoft / russo & keenan  - new york city
nicolas fillis v. luquillo parasailâ¦ > this case never would have gone anywhere had you not agreed to help us.  even though our 
client was seriously injured, and ample evidence to prove negligence we did not feel the case would have survived in court and 
ready to accept the original offer until you agreed to join the team that resulted in a settlement 7 times the original amount for 
my client.  thank you. richardo c. rodrigus esq. - puerto rico
