the ultimate farm-to-table experience

 

after 24 seasons, numerous awards, recognitions and two other locations, primo — in rockland maine — has matured into what chef melissa kelly calls a "full circle kitchen," the ultimate farm to table experience.what started out as one chef and two cooks in the kitchen, one greenhouse and one acre of vegetables has now become a full staff of 60 with 2 greenhouses, over 200 laying chickens, 150 broiler chickens, 5 ducks, 15 pigs and 3 acres of vegetables continuously rotating throughout the season. we have  an endless pursuit to accomplish a more sustainable ecosystem filled with love, creativity, and respect for the food.
