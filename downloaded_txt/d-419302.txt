sisterhood & community: hear us. see us. join us.








we’re a community of latinas who can come together to learn & grow with other latinas—comadres—in their community and around the world. during the pandemic, we were hosting virtual zoom meetings for various states, regions, even internationally. since then, we have started to meet in person again and enjoying each others company live and having outings. each comadre using her own comfort as to whether to use a face mask or not.
some states like new york city have several comadrazo groups. if there isn’t one in your area, perhaps, you’d like to consider starting one. contact us for more details.
