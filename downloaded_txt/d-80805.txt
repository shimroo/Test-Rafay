rave reviews ‚ù§Ô∏è 



here are some delighted participants and this is what they had to say. 









 





brilliant!!! i have gained a wealth of applicable knowledge and insights from tj, just got through the first part of this course and will be studying through several times over and continuing on! it‚Äôs incredibly important to me that as an aspiring life &motivational coach, i‚Äôm coming across as conversational to my audience as if they are someone i‚Äôm coaching personally~ sharing messages that are relevant, engaging, and to the point without rambling lol! i‚Äôm grateful for what a ginormous gift it is having access to this level of coaching from tj!!! highly recommend!

if you only have time/money for one public speaking class, this needs to be it! tj walker, a proven media and public speaking expert have way over-delivered in his complete public speaking masterclass for every occasion. i like how there‚Äôs a comprehensive curriculum, but you can just hop around to the sections that apply to you. not every section is going to apply, but with 550 videos (the max on udemy) you can‚Äôt go wrong buying this course. each section is also in easy-to-watch chunks.

this truly is a master class. he covers everything that could possibly be covered, in my opinion. take the classes, do the exercises, make the videos, and you will improve. like nike says, ‚Äòjust do it! like tj says, you have to practice. he reiterates it, constantly, in this course because it is an issue. just watching the course doesn‚Äôt help. you have to act on them, and practice. watch your practice, critique, and do it again. tj has so much valid information, i know that i will be back to review and digest more of it. great job, tj.
