where the past meets the present

georgetown is a lot of things to a lot of people. cobblestone streets and cupcake tours. waterfront picnics and political watering holes. canal history and charming boutiques. founded in 1751, 40 years before the nation’s capital, dc’s original neighborhood has a storied history—but half the fun is writing your own.
