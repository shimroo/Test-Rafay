"still, there was once supposed to be a message. let that be a lesson to you, adults used to say to children, and historians to their readers. but do the stories of history really teach anything at all?"    - margaret atwood, the robber bride
the mekong network is a collection of articles, documents, and photos, primarily related to cambodia. it has been online since 1999 and, to be truthful, has been unchanged for nearly half that time.
updates here are likely to be few and far between. older articles, however, will be preserved at their current urls, so that existing links and references will remain viable.









something old
nearly all of the content from the old mekong.net site is still online. hard to imagine why anyone would be looking for these articles, but here they are.







something new
links to newer projects and articles can be found here, but bear in mind: "new" in this context simply means "things that weren't here 5 or 10 years ago."







something visual
if you've been searching far and wide for a collection of random, poorly-organized photo galleries, this is just the place for you.







something true
a handful of random essays, true in the sense that they cannot be categorized as fiction, and do not deal with werewolves or leprechauns.
