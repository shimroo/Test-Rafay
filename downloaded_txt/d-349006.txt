is your business struggling to find (and retain) the right people?

          like most businesses, you're likely using resumes, cover letters, and interviews to make important hiring decisions.
        

          while these methods seem to work, you still may be struggling with recurring issues like:
        

high turnover
low productivity
customer complaints
performance problems
problem/disruptive employees
conflicts with managers or supervisors












 















improving the traditional hiring approach

          while resumes, cover letters, and interviews can tell you candidates' work history, education level, special skills or training, and communication style, only pre-employment testing allows you to predict key hiring factors such as:
        

loyalty & longevity
job satisfaction & performance
team & cultural fit
ability to manage time & stress
reliability & integrity
and more


 






pre-employment testing is the missing piece to your hiring process

 


        our hiring system uses 20+ years of data to evaluate everything from candidates' personalities and work ethic to integrity and skills, ensuring you get a complete picture of every candidate, every time.
      
 
 







pre-employment tests show you:











                      work ethic

                      how they react to stress
                    







                      if they'll fit in with your team
                    







                      strengths and weaknesses
                    







                      if they're honest and truthful
                    







                      if they'll hit performance goals
                    









                      how they'll treat your customers
                    







                      how well they listen and take direction

        how to create skills-based assessments for hiring
      


        

  
    
      
        companies are taking a closer look at the skills they need employees to have, and how to best assess those skills. having a degree or certification in a certain area is not an accurate indicator of candidate capability. this new awareness has led to what harvard business review calls a âreset in hiring practices.â

        why hiring takes so long and how to speed it up
      


        

  
    
      
        talent shortages and increased competition made hiring difficult in a pandemic. top candidates were often swept off the market quickly, meaning businesses who failed to act fast were left to hire from a smaller, less-qualified applicant pool.

        structured vs. unstructured interviews
      


        

  
    
      
        there are two basic styles, or models, of interviews employers usually use when hiring new employees: structured and unstructured interviews. just like job candidates, each one has its own strengths and weaknesses. but do the advantages of a structured interview outweigh the advantages of an unstructured interview?
