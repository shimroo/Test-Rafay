our promise…



meadow gold’s commitment to the health and wellbeing of hawaii’s families begins with our dedication to making quality products. we source our milk from the last remaining local dairy and supplement with california milk to meet hawaii’s demand. after the first pasteurization, we retest and re-pasteurize the milk in hilo. cleaning and sanitizing are routine, with our systems undergoing a 3- hour cleaning every 24 hours. we take great pride in maintaining our facilities and in achieving the highest level of food quality certification.
