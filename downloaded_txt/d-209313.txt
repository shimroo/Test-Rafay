											where are the best places to go on a rainy day?
									 	

ground kontrol
don't let the rain get you down! there's plenty of fun for every age (yes, they're even open on mondays!) once you step through the doors at ground kontrol. for thirty-somethings, it's a chance to reclaim your "pinball wizard" days, and for younger folks, see what a "real" record album looks like! seriously, though, it's a great place to re-live the 1980's by testing your skills on over 50 vintage games including space invaders, pac-man, donkey kong, and more. only twenty-five cents per play! they even carry records, tapes, cds, and 8-tracks for sale!610 sw 12th / portland, or 97205503-796-9364ground kontrol
