						christian ethics today						



the christian ethics today foundation publishes christian ethics today in order to provide laypersons, educators, and ministers with a resource for understanding and responding in a faithful christian manner to moral and ethical issues that are of concern to contemporary christians, to the church, and to society.
bill moyers once said, “look upon these pages as you would a campfire around which we gather to share our life experiences – the stories, ideals, and hopes unique to our understanding of faith.”
