i was 51 years old and complained to my
                           doctor for years about prostate symptoms.
                           stupid me for not insisting on the psa
                           blood test.















 
                  
                   












! warning
                           ! 



did you know that a man is 33% more
                  likely to get prostate cancer
                  than a woman is to get breast cancer? it's
                  true.
                  a husband, father, son, brother, grandfather,
                  friend dies
                  every 18 minutes of every day from prostate
                  cancer
are you a male 40-75
                  or over 35 and african american
                  or your father or brother had prostate cancer?
                  get
                  tested! psa and
                  dre*
someone you know may be affected.
                  one in every seven men will get prostate
                  cancer.
35% will be under the age of 65.
                  there will be over 248,530 men with a new case of
                  prostate
                  cancer this year. over 34,130 will die because
                  they didn't get an examination or didn't act soon
                  enough.
                  don't let it be said, "he was too afraid or
                  embarrassed to get tested."
                  we cannot rest until we win the battle against
                  prostate cancer.
 

                  7:28
take
                  the risk factor test
four important things to
                  remember before getting
                  tested
1. be sure that you're rested.
                  2. no sexual activity for 72 hours before the
                  test.
                  3. got a cold? put it on hold.
                  4. either have your psa test before the dre or
                  delay taking a 
psa test for 48 hours after you
                  have had your dre test.
* if you get a
                  reading between zero and 1, get tested again in
                  five year.
                  if the reading is between 1 and 2, get tested again
                  in two years.
                  if the reading is between 2-4, get tested every
                  year.
                  if the reading is over 4, consider additional tests
                  like psa free,
                  amas, ultrasound, x-rays, and more blood t
                  ests, then, maybe a biopsy. and, take this health
