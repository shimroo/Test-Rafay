posted on laminate flooring cost guide 


are you considering laminate flooring for your home but not sure about the cost? laminate flooring is an affordable and durable option for those looking to update their floors without breaking the bank. however, there are several factors that can affect the cost of laminate flooring, including thickness, ac rating, and water resistance.
in this laminate flooring cost guide, we will break down each of these factors and how they can impact the price of your new floors. we will also provide a cost estimate for installation per square meter and offer some tips on how to save money on your laminate flooring project.
so, let’s dive in and explore the cost of laminate flooring.
how thickness affects cost
if you’re looking to save some cash, you might want to consider going with a thinner laminate flooring option. thinner laminate flooring is generally less expensive per square foot than thicker options. however, keep in mind that thinner laminate may not be as durable as its thicker counterparts.
thinner laminate is typically around 6mm thick and is suitable for low traffic areas such as bedrooms or closets.
if you’re looking for a more durable option, you may want to consider a thicker laminate flooring. thicker laminate is generally around 10mm to 12mm thick and is more expensive per square foot. however, thicker laminate is more durable and can withstand high traffic areas such as living rooms and kitchens.
it’s important to weigh the cost versus the benefits when choosing the thickness of your laminate flooring.
in addition to thickness, other factors can affect the cost of laminate flooring. the quality of the materials, the brand, and the installation fees can all impact the final cost.
it’s important to do your research and shop around to find the best deal for your budget. remember that investing in a higher quality and more durable laminate flooring can save you money in the long run by reducing the need for repairs or replacements.
how ac rating affects cost
understanding ac rating is crucial when selecting the right laminate for your space, as it directly impacts the durability and longevity of your investment. ac rating is a measure of a laminate’s resistance to abrasion, impact, stains, and burns. the rating system ranges from ac1 to ac5, with ac1 being the least durable and ac5 being the most durable.
a laminate floor with a lower ac rating may be cheaper upfront, but it won’t hold up well over time, especially in high-traffic areas. on the other hand, a laminate with a higher ac rating may cost more initially, but it’ll be a better investment in the long run as it’ll be more resistant to wear and tear. it’s important to consider the level of foot traffic in the space where the laminate will be installed when selecting an ac rating.
another factor to consider when it comes to ac rating is that it doesn’t necessarily correlate with thickness. a thicker laminate doesn’t necessarily mean a higher ac rating. it’s possible to find a thinner laminate with a higher ac rating than a thicker laminate with a lower ac rating. therefore, it’s important to weigh both thickness and ac rating when selecting a laminate flooring option for your space.
how water resistance affects cost
when you’re looking for a durable and long-lasting option for your space, it’s important to consider how water resistance affects the price.
laminate flooring that is water-resistant will typically cost more than those that are not. this is because water-resistant laminates are specially treated to protect against moisture damage, making them ideal for areas with high humidity or potential water spills.
water-resistant laminate flooring is also more expensive because it offers greater protection against water damage. this is important in areas such as kitchens, bathrooms, and basements, where spills and leaks are common.
with water-resistant laminate flooring, you can expect a longer lifespan and less need for repairs or replacement due to water damage.
when choosing water-resistant laminate flooring, be sure to look for those with high-quality water-resistant treatments such as spotted gum flooring. cheaper options may claim to be water-resistant, but may not offer the same level of protection as higher-end options.
investing in a quality water-resistant laminate flooring may cost more upfront, but it will save you money in the long run by avoiding costly water damage repairs.

however, if you’re looking for something more durable and water-resistant, you may want to consider spending a bit more. premium laminate flooring can cost between $35 to $45 per square metre and is ideal for high-traffic areas like hallways and living rooms. when it comes to installing laminate flooring, it’s important to factor in the cost of labour.
the installation cost can vary depending on the complexity of the job and the experience of the installer. on average, the cost of labour can range from $20 to $30 per square metre. it’s important to get a quote from a professional to get an accurate estimate of the total cost to install laminate flooring in your home.

posted on 6 good reasons to invest in laminate flooring 


what makes laminate flooring such a good idea?
one of the main reasons why people choose to refurbish a space or to build a new home from scratch is to make their living environment more appealing.
with brick and mortar, and with creativity and determination, you can transform even the ugliest room into personal heaven. the floor is one of the largest areas in a space, hence being one of the most important aspects to consider when refurbishing your home. choosing the right flooring can make all the difference.
hardwood floors, ceramic tiles, carpets, or laminated flooring are some of your available options. making the right choice is a matter of carefully considering your top priorities, in order to find the most suitable material and style. if you love comfort and flexibility, laminate flooring is the way to go. timber laminate flooring is one of the latest trends in interior décor, due to the fact that it looks very similar to hardwood flooring but it requires way less maintenance. let’s see a few more reasons why laminate flooring is such a great option.
1. less expensive
flooring isn’t an impulse purchase. if you need to cover a large area, prices can add up very quickly. laminate flooring is a convenient choice, due to its relatively lower price. you can enjoy the warm look and the rustic appearance of hardwood floors for only a fraction of the cost. furthermore, laminate flooring is very resistant to wear and tear, so it will look like new for a very long time.
2. easier to install
one of the most cumbersome parts of a renovation project is the installation of timber floors. wood flooring is bulky and heavy, thus being difficult to transport and to install. on the contrary, the very fast installation of laminate flooring is truly remarkable. it comes in more manageable planks and it features the amazing tongue and groove click system that makes it so easy to install that even a child could do it.
3. extremely durable
there is a popular belief that laminate flooring is brittle and flimsy. this is nothing but a misconception. in fact, timber laminate flooring is designed for the high level of wear and tear of modern homes. in addition, hardwood flooring, no matter how beautiful, is prone to warping. laminate flooring features a scratch-resistant layer that makes it withstand even high levels of traffic. also, laminate flooring has more bounce factor than many other materials such as stone and ceramic tiles.
4. contemporary and versatile
since laminate flooring can come in virtually any colour and style, it’s easy to find a model to complement the other interior design elements. durable and easy to install, it is ideal for contemporary homes that are subject to more wear and tear than other residence styles. you can install it in any of your rooms, particularly in hallways, kitchens, family rooms, and other spaces subject to intense traffic. this flooring is so easy to clean that it makes an excellent choice for your home. you can have the beauty of wood floors without having to put up with difficult maintenance.
5. fade-proof
installing new floors is always nice, thanks to the beautiful texture and character. however, as time goes by, traditional flooring fades. timber laminate flooring doesn’t fade, thus being a better choice than carpet and hardwood. exposure to sunlight is the culprit for the fading of the colours. laminate flooring is created with a special wear layer that protects it from fading and wears. this makes it a very practical alternative to hardwood flooring.
6. subfloor friendly
the excellent versatility of laminate flooring makes it suitable to install on a wide range of subfloor types. you can lay it on top of concrete or vinyl floors. this isn’t possible when it comes to hardwood floors. all you need to install laminate flooring is a flat subfloor.
for easy installation, make sure you also install a moisture barrier. your old floor can act like one, thus saving you the hassle of removing it to install the new floor.
these should be enough reasons for you to pick laminate flooring for your home. in terms of design, feel free to browse through our collection of laminate flooring. you’ll surely find at least one that suits you!




posted on top advantages of microfiber mops 


microfiber mops are all the rage, and for many good reasons. in fact, they offer an array of advantages, and once you make the switch from your current mop to a microfiber mop, you’ll quickly realize it was a good decision.
in the past, i would use a broom to sweep around the apartment before i took out the sponge mop on my laminate flooring. you see, my apartment becomes dusty quickly because of the air pollution. thick dust used to build up near the windows, and it was a hassle to get rid of it. a sponge mop worked alright, but streaks would be left behind and this became annoying.
i would easily spend a considerable amount of time sweeping and mopping. it was getting too much to go back and forth between sweeping and mopping, but then i make the switch to a microfiber mop. with that said, a few of the top advantages of microfiber mops include:
1. versatile
microfiber mops can be used for wet mopping and dry dusting. the same pad can be used for the entire process of wet mopping and dusting. after you’ve dusted the floors, you can take off the mop pad and rinse it off with warm water before re-attaching it and continuing on with the mopping.
2. eco-friendly pads
the pads that are used for microfiber mops are eco-friendly. this is because you don’t throw them away after a single use. they can be reused several times. furthermore, if a microfiber pad gets very dirty, then take the pad off of the mop and place it inside your washing machine.
3. effective at picking up dust & dog hair
you won’t have any problems dusting or picking up dog hair. in fact, you’ll effortlessly pick up both. unlike a broom, you won’t have to go over a single area several times.
4. no dirt or streaks left behind
sponge mops and string mops often leave behind streaks and dust. microfiber mops collect everything in a single swoop or two. this means you won’t have to repeatedly go over a surface in order to get it clean.
5. the swivel head
another advantage is that microfiber mops have a swivel head. you’ll have no problem moving around all kinds of objects. this includes chairs, tables and other pieces of furniture.
6. cover large areas
these mops have wide heads. this allows you to cover larger areas without much effort. you’ll spend far less time cleaning by using a microfiber mop than you would with a regular wet mop and/or a broom.
7. less back work
the mops are lightweight and can get through gunk with ease. you won’t have to push down hard or scrub excessively. this means you won’t feel drained after cleaning, nor will your back ache or anything of that nature.
8. no bucket required
microfiber mops don’t need a lot of water. in fact, you might just have to rinse the pad once after every room you clean. this doesn’t require a bucket, as rinsing the pad under the sink should be good enough.
9. great for laminate floors
microfiber mops are highly effective at cleaning laminate flooring. this is because you don’t have to use a lot of water, which can actually be bad for laminate floors. in short, microfiber mops are safe to use on laminate floors than string mops, which require a lot of water.
final thoughts
as you can see from the above, there are many advantages that microfiber mops offer, but those are only a handful. if you ask anyone who owns this type of mop, the chances are they’ll have nothing but good things to say about it. as previously mentioned, once you switch over to a microfiber mop, you’ll immediately realize it was a great decision to make.
do you want to thoroughly clean your floors without putting much effort into it? if so, then you should get a microfiber mop. all you have to do now is shop around for microfiber mops and choose the one you like the most.





posted on 5 advantages that laminate flooring has over hardwood 


the aesthetics of hardwood floors is the allure that has many homeowners opting for this type of flooring. hardwood floors exude a certain chicness, quality, and refine look that adds value to living areas. with the timber used being adequately treated and cured, what you get is a natural flooring that will last for years. 
conversely, there is laminate flooring, which is made to mimic the hardwood floors. it is not made from authentic timber, but it does offer numerous benefits that make it a fantastic flooring option for your home. below are some of the notable advantages that laminate floors have over their hardwood counterparts.
1.    pricethe cost of installing a hardwood floor is higher than that of a laminate one. with the latter, you get recycled timber pressed together at high temperatures to form solid engineer wood that is then covered with a membrane that mimics hardwood flooring. a result is a flooring option that mirrors the hardwood floors, but costs less. purchasing quality laminate will set you back around £2.5 per square foot while hardwood can be as high as £4.5 or more per square foot. if you factor in those figures and the fact that the installation costs for the laminate floors are 50% less than that of the hardwood floors, then you see why laminate is the way to go.
2.    easy installationyou can use a diy (do-it-yourself) approach when dealing with laminate floors. you do not need to use glue or special equipment. many of the laminate flooring options are designed to snap together. that means they are available as modular pieces. you, therefore, do not need to hire a floor installation professional to do the job. the same case cannot be said of the hardwood flooring that requires special tools and adequate skills to install. if you want your home to be installed by professionals, contract this laminate flooring installer for a professional job.
3.    suitable for different environmentslaminate flooring can be installed in the kitchen, bathroom, and other areas of the house that are partially moist. you can even find some laminate flooring that you can invest in your basement. you will not have such flexibility when you opt for hardwood floors. you will be restricted to dry place because wet conditions can cause the timber to crack, warp, and rot.
4.    pet-friendlyif you have pets in your home, then you should consider using laminate flooring. the material has excellent scratch resistance meaning it can endure the clawing of your cat or dog. pick the type that is around 12mm thick so that you avoid the annoying scraping sound that your pet will make when clawing the floor. you will not have to worry about dings or other damages even when you have kids running around the house. hardwood flooring, on the other hand, will require special attention to protect it from scratches.
5.    heating flexibilityif you have radiant heating in your home or plan to install such a system, then you should go for laminate flooring. you cannot install radiant heating under hardwood floors to avoid damaging the timber.
from the above comparisons, you hopefully have an idea of why laminate floors are a practical and affordable flooring option to hardwood. you can call us today to learn more about laminate floors.






posted on the drawbacks to buying laminate flooring that is cheap 

laminate flooring
is it just laminate flooring of cheap quality or is it really on sale?
from time to time you may be lucky to come across a great deal on high-quality laminate flooring. but in many cases, you are tricked into buying a product that is inferior which is marketed as the flooring of good quality that they are selling at an attractive reduced price. for this reason, you need to be careful about where you shop for your laminate flooring. 
to begin with stay away from unknown or unbranded, laminate flooring. today there are a variety of companies based in china that produce laminate flooring products that are inferior. they sell these products unbranded to the different distributors. the distributors brand this flooring themselves, yet in essence, these are unbranded floors. 
in the majority of instances, these flooring products are made with cheap materials along with a surface treatment that is inferior. the floors will begin to deteriorate or show up wear-and-tear in as little as six months. within 12 months you will be extremely unhappy or frustrated with the purchase. when you are unhappy with the flooring in your home, it will become extremely frustrating as you have to see the floors every day and you are constantly reminded about the bad decision you made. 
however, the unbranded and cheap floors are in some cases suitable for environments that experience low traffic. so if you live on your own or you do not have pets or children constantly running around your home, these floors may serve their purpose adequately. 
you may want to know about buying the entry-level branded floors that you can pick up for 50% or less compared to the premium models. one of the major drawbacks about these floors has to do with how thick the laminate-core is. entry-level floors feature the thinnest cores which result in laminates which feel a lot less stable when you walk on them and even make a hollow sound as you are walking over them. also, the cheap floor feels and look less like hardwood when compared to the premium versions. 
there is a time when a cheap floor will be suitable. for example, if you own rental properties, these floors can perform for around 3 to 4 years adequately. they might not be luxurious yet still suitable for tenants. these are far better options when compared to carpets, that you may have to replace every time you get a new tenant. 
another situation where cheap laminate floors are good options is when you are planning to sell your home, and the existing flooring is in poor condition. the installation of new floors along with a couple of cosmetic changes may assist you in getting a higher price. floors are usually the 1st thing that new homeowners will replace, so cheaper laminate flooring will usually be shortly replaced anyway. 
another situation where the cheaper versions of laminate flooring might be suitable is for areas that receive low traffic in your house. these floors are usually graded associated with traffic. so the cheaper floors are suitable for a low traffic area like a bedroom.  in case you want to buy great quality laminate floorboards, i highly recommend you visit this laminate flooring melbourne warehouse , they have wide range of timber products in their showroom with amazing installation services.




posted on should i buy a premium underlayment, or save money and by buy cheap? 

underlayments are generally sold in rolls of 100s/f. prices range from $25 to $80 per roll, translating to an extra $0.25 to $0.80 to your flooring cost. often, homeowners reduce the overall total cost of their flooring purchase by purchasing a cheap underlayment. this is not a good idea.
underlayments are an important aspect of laminate floors for two primary reasons. firstly the quality of your underlayment has a direct effect on how the floor feels and sounds underfoot. secondly, the underlayment will affect the wear and tear of your floor.
underlayments server the following purposes:
moisture protection
thermal insulation
impact sound absorption
hinders mould growth with anti-microbial additive
help prevent dust mite colonies
smooth minor subfloor imperfections

impact sound absorption:
the main factors that affect the sound are the thickness and density of the underlayment. underlayments range from 0.075in to 0.25in in thickness. because laminate flooring is a floating floor, i.e. it is not fixed to the sub-floor, the floor tends to give off the sound when walked upon. thicker underlayments offer more sound reduction.
additionally, denser underlayments also reduce sound as well as offering more stability. however, thick underlayments with low density can add instability to the floor as they are compressed when walked upon, and this will be felt underfoot. in particular, natural cork underlayments are very good sound insulators, as well as being very dense. if you live in an apartment and people are living below you, sound absorption is a very important factor. if you do not install a sufficient sound barrier, your neighbours will hear you walking on the floor, and this could result in you having to remove your new floor.
thermal insulation:
if you live in a cold climate, thermal insulation is an important factor. thicker underlayments act as better heat insulators and barriers. radiant heat panel underlayments are also available.
moisture protection:
moisture rising from a damp subfloor will slowly destroy the core of your laminate flooring. to combat this, your underlayment should have some form of vapour barrier to protect the underneath of the floor from subfloor moisture. some underlayments are an all-in-one sound and moisture solutions, while others are either sound or moisture barriers. regardless of what type of sub-floor you have, installing a moisture barrier is essential.
hinder mold growth with anti-microbial additive and prevent dust mite colonies:
if you live in a climate where mould growth is common, you can install an underlayment with an anti-microbial additive. if your sub-floor is wood, this type of underlayment can also prevent dust mite colonies.
smooth minor subfloor imperfections:
generally speaking, laminate floors can only be installed over level sub-floors. if your floor has minor undulations, a thick, dense underlayment can help to smooth out the undulations. note that this is only for minor undulations. floors with serious undulations must be levelled before installing a laminate floor.




posted on kids and pets! how long will my wood laminate flooring last? 

i have an active household with young children and pets. will wood laminate flooring handle the heavy wear and tear?
yes, provided you install a good quality wood laminate floor.
today, reputable laminate manufacturers must submit their flooring to the european producers of laminate flooring (eplf) for rigorous testing. the eplf is an independent organization which aims to set standards for the laminate flooring industry. floors submitted to the eplf go through a series of tests that evaluates a laminates resistance to stress and is then given a rating code according to its performance. they test the floor for resistance to scratches, burns, fading, stains and impact. if the floor fails any of these categories, then it is not certified.
pergo – coastal pine wood laminate flooring

the following is the ac rating guide and this will assist you in determining if a floor is suitable for your specific needs.
ac 1: 21 (residential, moderate traffic: suitable for bedrooms or guest rooms)
ac 2: 22 (residential, general traffic: suitable for living rooms and dining rooms)
ac 3: 23 (residential, heavy traffic: suitable for all areas)
ac 3: 31 (commercial, moderate traffic: suitable for hotel rooms, small offices)
ac 4: 32 (commercial, general traffic: office, restaurant, boutique, cafă©)
ac 5: 33 (commercial, heavy traffic: public buildings, department stores)

although ac1 is rated for moderate traffic and suited to bedrooms, if you have young active kids you are better off going with an ac2 rating for their bedrooms and play room. small pets will not have much impact on your floor. however larger dogs can scratch the laminate surface. if you have large dogs at home, it is advisable to get a better quality laminate that meets a minimum of an ac2 rating. however, ac3 would be optimum.
north american laminate flooring association (nalfa)is the us equivalent of the eplf. nalfa is the organization that sets the standards for laminate flooring in the usa. nalfa is a non-profit organization, and its members are unpaid volunteers. laminates submitted to nalfa undergo a range of stringent tests. if the laminate floor meets or exceeds nalfa standards, it will earn the right to display the nalfa seal of approval. note that submission of laminate flooring to nalfa is voluntary. the following laminates carry the nalfa seal of approval: clarion laminates, columbia flooring, kronotex usa, mohawk, quick-step, shaw, torlys, pergo, mannington mills. a complete list of nalfa approved laminate flooring brands can be found at the nalfa website.
the combination of kids and pets results in constant heavy traffic in the main living areas, and it is advisable to purchase a wood laminate flooring with an ac3 rating. although these floors are more expensive, they will stand the test of time and still look good after many years of heavy use.
if you have an active household, stay away from floors that do not have an eplf certification as chances are these floors are not good quality and would not pass the eplf test.




posted on laminate flooring – what you need to know! 

laminate flooring quality and price vary greatly. there are so many products on the market today, each claiming to be the best due to some specialized manufacturing method or surface finish, that it becomes difficult to ascertain which floor is best suited to your specific needs. the information contained in these pages is intended to give you the background information you need to find the right floor at the right price. for sure, there are many aspects that affect suitability that you have not considered and we discuss them here.
laminate flooring is a great alternative to hardwood floors. laminate floors are cheaper than hardwood, more durable and easier to maintain. due to their increased popularity over the past few years, there has been an explosion of new styles and many more manufacturers have now entered the market. prices range from $0.89c to $4 an s/f and quality vary according to price.
ultimately your decision on which laminate to purchase will come down to price vs quality and this decision is affected by the amount of foot traffic in your home, in which rooms the flooring will be installed and how long you intend on staying in your current home.
active households, where a floor is subject to a high level of wear and tear require a better quality floor, while a cheaper floor could surface for households with less foot traffic. additionally, certain areas of your home receive more traffic than others. laminate flooring manufacturers grade their floors according to 3 levels of foot traffic: moderate traffic, general traffic and heavy traffic. bedrooms are considered moderate traffic areas, while dining rooms, living rooms and entrance ways are classified as general or heavy traffic areas. this means that you do not need the same quality floor for all areas of your home.
