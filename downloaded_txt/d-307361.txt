big
trefoil (lotus uliginosus, also
known as l. pedunculatus, l. major,
or bigleaf trefoil) is an excellent legume for poorer soils.
it thrives in soils that are high in acidity, high in aluminum
content, or are waterlogged. big
trefoil is commonly used for hay, forage, conservation plantings, or
wildlife habitat. less commonly, it may also be used for honey
production and land reclamation. 

 
growing
conditions:
big
trefoil can withstand (and thrive) on soils that: 


are
	waterlogged (constant moisture). 

have
	high aluminum (>3umols al). 

have
	high acidity (4.5-5 ph) 

have
	high manganese (up to 0.76g/kg dm) 

possess
	little fertility ("fragipan-type" soils) 

 


here in the willamette valley of
oregon, much of our soil is heavy clay with high aluminum which
creates a toxicity for many crop plants. this coupled with a high
rain fall creates an acidic, high aluminum, and wet clay soil--a
perfect location for growing this crop. 

 
 nutritive
value in forage:

29%
	crude protein on average, depending on maturity. the younger growth
	in the spring is higher while late fall drops to the low 20s.
hay
	quality similar to alfalfa when cut in season.
non-bloating
	due to condensed tannins found naturally in lotus.
easily
	palatible. 


long-lived perennial if managed
	correctly, thereby reducing input costs per acre.

has an ability to “creep”
	or “spread” due to vegetative growth. this increases
	stand.

growth cycle begins later in
	the year than grasses and stays active later in the year as well,
	ensuring forage during times when grass is usually dying off in the
	summer. 






planting,
seeding, pasture management:
big
trefoil may be seeded using traditional crop methods. broadcasting or
aerial overseeding are effective, especially in areas where
conventional tillage would be difficult or impossible (such as in a
forestland or area for wildlife). 

 
standard
seeding is in the fall or spring. seeding rates are commonly stated
as 2-5 pounds per acre, but i recommend 10 pounds per acre of coated
seed.  




big trefoil is often planted
with companion grasses when it is used for pasture or forage. rates
are usually in the ratio of 1:2, meaning 1 pound of trefoil for every
two pounds of companion.  for example, 10 lbs. trefoil would mix with
20 lbs. grass in the mix.  




companion crops can vary. i’ve
had experience with annual ryegrass, bentgrass, clover, and oats.
literature records other crops such as rye, orchardgrass, and vetch.
in general, trefoil will do better and the companion crop worse in
the wetter sites with the opposite occuring in drier sites. 




pasture management is similiar
for big trefoil as for other legumes such as clovers or alfalfa.
avoid overgrazing in the late fall. use of temporary electric fencing
and intensive grazing works well to ensure animals eat grasses and
not just the trefoil, their preferred forage when given a choice. 





anti-helminthic
properties:

grazing on crops with condensed
tannins (like lotus) seem to reduce worm egg counts in growing
lambs. use of lotus in pasture can be advantageous to parasite
control and a boon to organic sheep production. 




if you’re raising
livestock organically or trying to reduce inputs, grazing trefoil can
help you reduce worm infestation and the need for chemical dewormers.




wildlife
use:

big trefoil is a known
attractant for elk and deer. until recently, this crop was listed as
a seed for elk habitat in oregon and washington. because it is a
“non-native plant,” big trefoil is no longer listed in
this way. however, it is still a top grazing plant for the deer in my
area; they find my fields quite tasty. 





big
trefoil versus birdsfoot trefoil:
big
trefoil (lotus
uliginosus)
is closely related to birdsfoot trefoil (lotus
corniculatus),
but is less well known. both are trefoils and share the same general
plant morphology and growth patterns. both are non-bloating legumes
and can be used in similar ways. birdsfoot is the more “well
known” trefoil in the u.s. and many people when talking of
trefoil don’t know there’s more than one species or
confuse the two together. 



the
table below details the differences between these species: 







 


big trefoil


birdsfoot trefoil




seeds


1,075,000 per pound
			(average); green


500,000 per pound; brown




growth


prostrate growth with
			rhizomes and stolons


may be prostrate, some
			stolons




aluminum tolerance


very high (>3umols)


lower (<7 umols)




acidity tolerance


4.5-5.5


>6.0




manganese tolerance


up to 0.76g/kg dm


<0.50g/kg dm




soil water tolerance


constant moisture
			(waterlogged)


moist, but not constant




soils


fragipan (high clay, low
			ph)


moderate clay




seeding rates


low (5 pounds and up)


low but usually double big
			trefoil’s rate



 

the main difference between
these two plants is the growing conditions. big trefoil can grow in
standing water, high acid soils, or soils with a high aluminum
content. birdsfoot trefoil grows better in less extreme soils.
