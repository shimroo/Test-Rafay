adhd remedies:


 guaranteed alternatives for attention deficit, 
				depression, hyperactivity and stress. 



 
              



“enthusiastic student” and “pleasure to have in class”
    appeared on my son’s first mid-term report, replacing the
    “very little effort” and “missing assignments” comments that
    chronically plagued past mid-terms and report cards.


my
    son’s teachers gave glowing reports of a young man who
    handed class work and homework in on time, who paid attention and actively
    participated in class.   



				i am still amazed that this is the same person who, just one 
				year prior, struggled to maintain a “c” average in school, was 
				tested for learning disabilities and received an attention 
				deficit disorder diagnosis after a
    school career marked with distress and defeat.


then i found hope. i found 
				the powerful and effective adhd remedies


attend, 
extress, and

memorin
    a healthful, drug-free and cost-effective way to manage add and adhd
    symptoms of attention deficit disorder.

clinical
    studies show that attend offers about the same level of effectiveness as
              	the stimulant 
medications adhd drugs prescribed 
				in eliminating symptoms adhd people commonly exhibit.
 

				while ritalin and other add and adhd medications have 
				potentially serious side effects, attend builds the body and 
				feeds the brain. for as certain as i am that i do not want my 
				son on adhd medications, i am equally certain that quality adhd 
				remedies like attend offer a better way to manage the symptoms adhd.
the 
              goal of this web site is to provide parents similarly struggling with
    attention deficit disorder and the worries of ritalin, adderall and other
    add and adhd medications with sound information and a level of comfort in
    knowing that you do have choices in the treatment of attention deficit
    disorder.


this
    web site consolidates attention deficit disorder information found in my
    research and provides information about, what we believe is, the highest
    quality nutritional supplement on the market today for the symptoms of
    attention deficit disorder. attention deficit disorder (add) is a label 
              given to children and adults with significant problems in four 
              main areas of their lives; inattention, impulsivity, hyperactivity 
              and boredom. the term attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is 
              used when hyperactivity is a symptom. in this web site, attention 
              deficit disorder is used to describe both add and adhd.
              


              attention deficit disorder ranks among the most common 
              neurological disorders among american children, affecting as many 
              as 2 million. currently about six million children are taking 
              ritalin, adderall, concerta or other medication to manage the 
				symptoms adhd often has. in 
              every classroom in the united states, you can expect to find at 
              least one child with attention deficit disorder. add and adhd boys 
              outnumber girls by 3 to 1 in prevalence. 
              


              attention deficit disorder can hinder concentration, learning and 
              memory. add and adhd also affects a person’s ability to process 
              and sort incoming information or stimulus.
              
              while
    attention deficit disorder is not classified a specific learning disability,
    add and adhd often makes it difficult for a child to do well in school and
    in social situations.



              all too often, the knee-jerk reaction to 


hyperactivity
    			attention deficit disorder



              symptoms is 
              ritalin or other attention deficit disorder medications. yet, many 
              parents are alarmed by the widespread use of adhd medications and 
              the negative side effects and want adhd remedies that are safe and 
				effective.
ritalin
    and other add and adhd medications do improve short-term behavior and school
    performance in many children with add and adhd symptoms of attention deficit
    disorder and ritalin is a convenient way to handle hard-to-handle kids. but,
    ritalin and other add and adhd medications also have many potentially
    harmful side effects.
              
 
              parents are often given only two choices when faced with an 
              attention deficit disorder diagnosis; use adhd medications or do 
              nothing. doing nothing is not an option. this site provides 
              information and options beyond those limited choices to alleviate 
              and possible eliminate add and adhd symptoms.
              

parents
    have the ultimate right and obligation to make informed choices for their
    children’s health and well being. each parent must judge their own comfort
    level in using ritalin or other add and adhd medications commonly used for
    the symptoms of attention deficit disorder, and dealing with the
				
side effects adderall
and other adhd medications had to offer. each parent must also form their
    own opinions on whether the add and adhd symptoms can be better managed
    through alternate methods beyond ritalin and other add and adhd medications
    commonly prescribed for attention deficit disorder.



              a large body of attention deficit disorder research indicate that 
              a number of factors lead to the 
adhd causes. a well-balanced diet high in amino acids and essential 
              fatty acids and quality nutritional supplementation play a large 
              role in providing the brain with the fuel it needs to function at 
              optimal levels.
              see 
adhd diet therapy for more 
				information.

              scientifically proven to help with impulsivity, hyperactivity and 
              other symptoms of attention deficit disorder. compared to other 
              nutritional supplements for attend deficit disorder, attend has – 
              by far – the most extensive list of ingredients. attend
