“there is no competition in regards to the quality, finish and customer service received. having been in the industry for over 20 years, we haven’t come across another product or service that has even tempted us. every album produced is of the highest quality, and any request is dealt with quickly and effectively.”
joseph koprek


"i have worked with seldex in my entire time as a busy wedding photographer.  albums remain my single largest investment in business and i would not trust anyone else to supply them to me.  seldex have always provided amazing prompt and friendly service, urgencies on the odd occasion have never been questioned but met with a "no worries we can make that happen for you". a beautiful legacy quality product for me to provide to my clients to enjoy. thank you seldex for being awesome!"
