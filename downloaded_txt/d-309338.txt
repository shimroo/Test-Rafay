maestro uk 



 at maestro uk our goal is to highlight the craft of frame builders. in an industry where the choice is slowly being taken away from the customer, we still spec each individual component to your choosing, wether that is for rim brake or disc, carbon or handmade steel/titanium frames we have the flexibility to build your dream bike.  for over 45 years mike has specialised in finding the best frame builders and offering their products to his customers. the goal has always been the same, to offer genuinely hand made frames from master frame builders, at competitive prices. the industry has changed drastically in those years but we have felt a resurgence of customers wanting truly hand made frames, that fit you properly and won’t let you down.  modern-day steel and titanium, built by these master frame builders offer a ride quality that can’t be matched. the technology in these modern tube sets has evolved drastically over the past 30 years, offering light-weight, durable and highly tensile frames that perform in our view, on par with modern carbon bikes yet with their own unique character. 



























a bixxis visiton december the 14th i had the absolute pleasure of visiting doriano and martina de rosa at bixxis. i first met doriano when i was around 11 years old at de rosa, and being at his workshop brought back fond memories of travelling down to italy with my dad, mike to pick up frames. i left today feeling the same excitement and passion about bikes as i did that first time 27 years ago.  to be able to speak with doriano and ask him some questions on frame building was like being let in on a secret encyclopaedia of knowledge, a rarity these days. why do different bikes of the same material ride so differently? his preference over steel or titanium, the unique challenges in building titanium frames, should sloping vs traditional geometry frames feel different to ride? (they shouldn’t but often do) and which champions had he personally made frames for, badged up with their sponsors names. to name a few.  over his career that started around 12 years old under the watchful (and i imagine proud) eyes of ugo de rosa, doriano through trial and error and countless hours building frames has honed his skills to a unique level, something he humbly admits is an ongoing endeavour.  my own feelings of riding one of his frames for the last 10 months were backed up when a new customer came in after picking up his bike and riding around lake como, wanting to understand how it’s possible one of his frames could ride so perfectly on the road, making all his other carbon bikes seem dead, soulless. there is something special in every bixxis frame, uncompromising in his pursuit of perfection, balance and elegance. and what an honour it is to be able to sell them to our customers.

c64 buildi have been sat on this video for a few days now, it’s a seemingly simple bike build video but has brought up a lot of memories for me while thinking of the history. i grew up with maestro both the business itself and f.s maestro pro team, i remember the team launch in the old shop in pagham handing out coffees to visitors ( i must have been 8/9 at the time) as i got older i would more time in the shop with my dad mike slowly being allowed to help out with builds and chatting to regulars, printing price lists to send off to customers with brochures and visiting belgium to watch my brother nigel race, later on living and racing in belgium myself with dreams of being pro. the industry and technology of bikes have constantly changed, the love for it has stayed the same. i’m allowed to build bikes now but not wheels, that is reserved for the don. marc perry
