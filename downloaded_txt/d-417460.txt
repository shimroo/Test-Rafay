in 1985, brian and patti allingham purchased the property, along with the original lodge and 16 cottages. they were able to recognize the significant opportunity and potential the property and lodge had in the tourist industry. they renamed the business pine cliff resort and began the major transformation to build the business as it's known today. the couple sold half of the cottages and refurbished the 8 remaining ones. the resort originally had only five seasonal campers, a number that the allinghams have grown to over 80. each year, brian and patti continue to upgrade the resort, the facilities and its cottages. in over 70 years of history, it was always in the owner's concern that families enjoy the resort, spending quality time together and creating memories. for brian and patti allingham, in the 38 years they have owned their business, this concern became their greatest mission!today, pine cliff resort has become one of the best camping and seasonal trailer resorts in ontario and is looking forward to host our guests all year round.
