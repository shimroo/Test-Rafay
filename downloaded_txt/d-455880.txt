the 
heart of the kenai peninsula


	located at the intersection of the sterling and kenai spur highways on the 
	kenai peninsula and born when both roads were completed in the 1940s, 
	soldotna is a hub for fisherman near and far and why?: the kenai river runs 
	through it.


	each fishing season, draws thousands of residents and visitors alike into 
	soldotna on a quest for famous kenai river salmon. in fact, the worldâs 
	largest king salmon was caught from the waters of the kenai river in 1985 
	and the 97.2-pound trophy now hangs on the wall of the soldotna visitor 
	information center. biologists believe genetics and the fact that kenai 
	river salmon often spend an extra year at sea account for their gargantuan 
	size. a trophy salmon elsewhere in alaska is a 50-pound fish, while here, 
	anglers don't get too excited until a king salmon tops 75 pounds.


	all this makes soldotna the most fish-crazy place in alaska during the 
	summer and the fastest growing city on the kenai peninsula with a population 
	of just more than 4,000 residents. soldotna is a full-service community and 
	well set up for the wave of anglers who flock here from mid-may through 
	september for the runs of red, silver and especially the king salmon in the 
	lower kenai river.


	soldotna was incorporated in 1967. it has since become the retail, 
	governmental and medical hub of the kenai peninsula. the following 
	headquarters and state offices are located in soldotna.


	> department of highways

	> department of public safety

	> fish and game department

	> forest, land and water management


	central peninsula hospital in 
	soldotna serves the soldotna and kenai areas. soldotna is also headquarters 
	for the kenai 
	peninsula borough school distract. kenai 
	peninsula college is 
	also located in soldotna.

 reviews



failure is simply the non-presence of success. but a 
		fiasco is a disaster of mythic proportions.
	
â orlando bloom





remember not only to say the right thing in the right 
		place, but far more difficult still, to leave unsaid the wrong thing at 
		the tempting moment.
  
â benjamin franklin





when you know who you are; when your mission is clear and you burn with the inner fire of unbreakable will; no cold can touch your heart; no deluge can dampen your purpose. you know that you are alive. 
â chief seattle, duwamish
