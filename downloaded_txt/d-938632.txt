	 marking not required for notice in process or method claims
	 
    


 in crown packaging technology, inc. v.  reexam beverage  can co. (march 17, 2009) the federal circuit reiterated  that the notice  provisions of §287  do  not apply where the patent is directed to a process or method.     [a] party    that does not mark a patented article is    not entitled to damages for infringement prior to actual notice. although rexam asserted only the method claims of the '839 patent    against crown, the district court    dismissed rexam's counterclaim because    the '839 patent also includes unasserted apparatus claims. the district court erred. the law is clear that the notice provisions    of §287    do not    apply where the patent is directed to a process or method. bandag, inc.    v. gerrard tire co., 704 f.2d    1578, 1581 (fed.cir.1983). in    hanson,    718 f.2d at    1082-83, we held    that 35 u.s.c.    §287(a) did not    apply where the patentee only asserted the method claims of a patent which    included both method and apparatus claims. hanson    is    factually identical to this case, and we are therefore bound by the rule of    hanson.    in    american    medical systems, inc. v. medical engineering corp., 6 f.3d 1523    (fed.cir.1993), we explained:   the purpose    behind the marking statute is to encourage the patentee to give notice to the    public of the patent. the reason that the marking statute does not apply to    method claims is that, ordinarily, where the patent claims are directed to    only a method or process there is nothing to mark. where the patent contains    both apparatus and method claims, however, to the extent that there is a    tangible item to mark by which notice of the asserted method claims can be    given, a party is obliged to do so if it intends to avail itself of the    constructive notice provisions of section    287(a).       id.    at 1538-39.    as the    american    medical opinion    goes on to explain:   in this    case, both apparatus and method claims of the '765 patent were asserted    and there was a physical    device produced by the claimed method that was capable of being marked.    therefore, we conclude that ams was required to mark its product pursuant to    section    287(a) in order to    recover damages under its method claims prior to actual or constructive    notice being given to mec.  id.    at    1539 (emphasis    added). in this case and hanson,    the    patentee only asserted method claims despite the fact that the patent    contained both method and apparatus claims. in american    medical, in    contrast, "both apparatus and method claims of the '765 patent were asserted."    american    medical, 6    f.3d at 1523. because    rexam asserted only the method claims of the '839    patent,    the marking requirement of 35    u.s.c. § 287(a) does    not apply consequently, we reverse    the district court's grant of crown's motion for summary judgment dismissing    rexam's counterclaim for infringement of the ' 839    patent.

	 fair use doctrine under u.s. copyright law
	 
    


authors rights under copyright law are  subject to certain limitations,  including the doctrine of “fair use” that was developed through a substantial  number of court decisions over the years and has been codified in section 107 of  the copyright law.   in the  u.s., the fair use doctrine allows limited use of copyrighted material without requiring permission  from the rights holders under a  four-factor balancing test considering:  purpose and    character whether the use in question helps fulfill the intention of    copyright law to stimulate creativity for the enrichment of the general    public, or whether it aims to only "supersede the objects" of the original for    reasons of personal profit.     nature of the copied    work courts are more likely to find fair use where    the work is factually-oriented, facts and ideas are separate from copyright—only their particular expression or fixation merits such    protection.    amount and    substantiality in general, the    less that is used in relation to the whole, e.g., a few sentences of a text    for a book review, the more likely that the sample will be considered fair    use.   effect upon work's    value courts often consider two kinds of harm to the    potential market of the original work.  first, courts consider    whether the use in question acts as a direct market substitute for the    original work. second, courts also consider whether potential market harm    might exist beyond that of direct substitution, such as in the potential    existence of a licensing market.  as noted by  the u.s. copyright office, the  distinction between fair use and infringement may be unclear and not easily  defined. there is no specific number of words, lines, or notes that may safely  be taken without permission  and acknowledging the source of the copyrighted material does not  substitute for obtaining permission.   the 1961 report of the register of copyrights on the  general revision of the u.s. copyright law cites examples of activities that  courts have regarded as fair use: “quotation of excerpts in a review or  criticism for purposes of illustration or comment; quotation of short passages  in a scholarly or technical work, for illustration or clarification of the  author’s observations; use in a parody of some of the content of the work  parodied; summary of an address or article, with brief quotations, in a news  report; reproduction by a library of a portion of a work to replace part of a  damaged copy; reproduction by a teacher or student of a small part of a work to  illustrate a lesson; reproduction of a work in legislative or judicial  proceedings or reports; incidental and fortuitous reproduction, in a newsreel or  broadcast, of a work located in the scene of an event being reported.”

	 uspto interim procedure for patent term adjustment recalculation
	 
    


the u.s. patent and trademark office expects to  complete by march 2, 2010, the software modification necessary to comply with  the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit's recent decision in wyeth v.  kappos regarding the overlapping delay provision of 35 usc  154(b)(2)(a).   in the meantime, the uspto will be processing  recalculation requests under an interim procedure that is available to a  patentee whose patent issues prior to march 2, 2010, and who request it no later  than 180 days after the issue date.  this procedure is available only for  alleged errors in calculation that are specifically identified in  wyeth.   a copy of the notice submitted to the federal register  for publication and the form for patentees to use in requesting a recalculation  of patent term is on the uspto web site at http://www.uspto.gov/patents/announce/pta_wyeth.pdf.   an applicant is entitled, subject to certain  conditions and limitations, to patent term adjustment if (1) the uspto fails to  take certain actions during the examination and issue process within specified  time frames; (2) if the uspto fails to issue a patent within three years of the  actual filing date of the application; and (3) for delays due to interference,  secrecy order, or successful appellate review.     the guidance does not  address patents that have issued more than 180 days ago, nor has the uspto  provided any indication that it will address this issue in the  future.

	 uspto rules on special status petitions for green technology patent applications
	 
    


in a federal register notice published and effective on december  8, 2009, the u.s. patent and  trademark office announced rules for implementing its previously-announced  pilot program in which an applicant may petition to have an application  involving green technologies advanced out of turn without meeting all of the requirements of the existing accelerated examination  program such as examination support  documents. the green technology pilot program will run for  twelve months from its effective date. the uspto may extend the pilot program (with or without modifications) depending on the  feedback from the participants and the effectiveness of the  pilot  program. once a petition is granted,  the special status applications will be placed on an examiner's special  docket prior to the first office action, on the examiner's amended docket after  the first office action, and will also have special status in any appeal to  the bpai and in the patent publication process.  however, petitions to  make special under the green technology pilot program must be filed before  december 8, 2010 and the uspto will accept only the first 3,000 petitions, provided  that the petitions meet several  requirements, including:  the non-fee    petition must be in a nonprovisional, non-reissue application that    was filed on or before the date of the notice (december 8, 2009), and at least one day before a first office    action is mailed (which may be a restriction requirement) or appears in the patent application information retrieval (pair) system. continuing applications will not automatically be accorded special status based on papers filed with a petition in a parent application. each continuing application must on its own meet all requirements for special status. the petition to make special must be accompanied by a request for early publication in compliance with 37 cfr 1.219 and the publication fee set forth in 37 cfr 1.18(d).  the application must be classified in one of    the may classes    identified section v of the    federal register notice copied below. the application must have no more than 3 independent    claims and 20 total claims, or a preliminary amendment must be filed to reduce    the number of claims at or below these thresholds.  applicants may file a preliminary amendment to cancel the excess claims    and/or the multiple dependent claims at the time the petition to make special is filed.  the claims must be directed to a single invention and    include a statement that if the uspto determines that the claims are directed    to multiple inventions, the applicant will agree to make an election without    traverse in a telephonic interview, and elect an invention that meets the    eligibility requirements   the claimed invention must materially enhance the quality    of the environment or materially contribute to: (1) the discovery or    development of renewable energy resources; (2) the more efficient utilization    and conservation of energy resources; or (3) greenhouse gas emission    reduction, and explain how this standard is met  if applicant files a petition to make special under the green technology pilot program that does not comply with the requirements set forth in the notice, the uspto will notify the applicant of the deficiency by issuing a notice and applicant will be given only one opportunity to correct the deficiency  within the longer of one month or thirty days.  otherwise, tithe  application will not be eligible for the green technology program.   the time period for reply is not extendable under 37 cfr 1.136(a).  for applications pertaining to environmental quality, the petition to make special must state that special status is sought because the invention materially enhances the quality of the environment by contributing to the restoration or maintenance of the basic life-sustaining natural elements. if the application does not clearly disclose that the claimed invention materially enhances the quality of the environment by contributing to the restoration or maintenance of one of the basic life  sustaining natural elements, the  petition must be accompanied by a  statement signed by the applicant,  assignee, or an attorney/agent registered  to practice before the uspto, in  explaining how the materiality standard is  met. the materiality standard does not  permit an applicant to speculate as to how  a hypothetical end-user might  specially apply the invention in a manner  that could materially enhance the quality of the environment. nor does such standard permit an applicant to enjoy the benefit of advanced examination merely because some minor aspect of the claimed invention may enhance the quality of the environment. see  mpep  §  708.02 (item v).   for patent applications  pertaining to: (1) the discovery or development of renewable energy resources; (2) the more efficient utilization and conservation of energy resources; or (3) the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions,  the term ''renewable energy resources'' includes  hydroelectric, solar, wind, renewable  biomass, landfill gas, ocean (including  tidal, wave, current, and thermal),  geothermal, and municipal solid waste, as  well as the transmission, distribution, or  other services directly used in  providing electrical energy from these sources. the second category would include inventions relating to the reduction of energy consumption in combustion systems, industrial equipment, and household appliances. the third category listed above would include, but is not limited to, inventions that contribute to (1) advances in nuclear power generation technology, or (2) fossil fuel power generation or industrial processes with greenhouse gas-abatement technology (e.g., inventions that significantly improve safety and reliability of such technologies).   the petition  to make special for an application  directed to development of renewable  energy or energy conservation, or directed  to greenhouse gas emission reduction, must  state the basis  for the special status (i.e., whether the invention materially contributes to (1) development of  renewable energy resources or energy conservation, or (2) greenhouse gas emission  reduction). if the  application disclosure is not clear on its face that the claimed invention materially contributes  to (1) development  of renewable energy or energy conservation, or (2) greenhouse gas emission reduction, the  petition must be accompanied by a statement signed by the applicant, assignee,  or an attorney/agent registered to practice before the uspto, explaining how the  materiality standard is met. the materiality standard does not permit an  applicant to speculate as to how a hypothetical end-user might specially apply  the invention in a manner that could materially contribute to (1) development of  renewable energy or energy conservation, or (2) greenhouse gas emission  reduction, nor does the standard permit an applicant to enjoy the benefit of  advanced examination merely because some minor aspect of the claimed invention  may be directed to (1) development of renewable energy or energy conservation,  or (2) greenhouse gas emission reduction. see mpep  § 708.02 (item vi).   for uspto the press release, click here.  for the federal  register notice with more details of the program and the requirements to  participate, click here.  uspto director kappos  also provides this entry on his official  blog on the subject with links to his remarks from the press  conference, as well as press accounts of the announcement in nytimes.com  and wsj.com.      the following is a list of the  eligible classifications: a. alternative energy  production 1. agricultural waste (uspc  44/589). 2. biofuel (uspc 44/605;

effective october 1, 2009,  the united states patent and trademark  office (uspto) is expanding and "enhancing"  the original first  action interview pilot program which ended on june 28,  2009.    under the enhanced first action interview pilot program ending april 1, 2010, the examiner will conduct a prior art  search and provide the applicant a pre-interview communication, which is a  condensed preview of objections or rejections proposed against the claims.   within 30 days from the issue date of the pre-interview communication, the  applicant must either choose not to have a first action interview with the  examiner, or schedule the interview and file a proposed amendment or remarks  (arguments).  the response period to reply to this pre-interview  communication can be extended by 30 days. should the applicant choose  not to have a first action interview, a first action interview office action  will be promptly issued and the applicant will have one month or 30 days,  whichever is longer, to reply.  if an interview is scheduled, the applicant  must be prepared to discuss issues related to the patentability of the  claims.  if agreement is not reached on all claims in regards to  patentability, the applicant will be given a first action interview office  action to which the applicant will be given one month to reply with  limited extensions of time and this first action interview office action  will be considered the first action on the merits.  the applicant can  also waive receipt of the first action interview office action during the  interview with the examiner, convert the previously-submitted draft amendment to  a formal amendment, and proceed directly to the second substantive  examination.  other aspects of the program  include:   expanding the    pilot across more art units in the technology centers, depending upon the filing date of the    application. new utility nonprovisional applications    that fall within one of the following groups may be eligible for the enhanced    first action interview pilot program:   applications filed on or before      november 1, 2006, and assigned to workgroup 1610 (art units      161x). applications filed on or before      october 1, 2006, and assigned to art unit 1795. applications filed on or before      february 1, 2008, and assigned to workgroups 2150      and 2160 (art units 215x and 216x). applications filed on or before      july 1, 2008, and assigned to workgroups 2440 and 2450 (art units 244x      and 245x). applications filed on or before      june 1, 2007, and assigned to art unit 2617. applications filed on or before      may 1, 2008, and assigned to art units 2811-2815, 2818, 2822-23, 2826,      2891-2895.  applications filed on or before      december 1, 2007, and assigned to art unit 3671.  applications filed on or before      january 1, 2008, and assigned to art unit 3672. applications filed on or before      november 1, 2007, and assigned to art unit 3673. applications filed on or before      february 1, 2008, and assigned to art unit 3676. applications filed on or before      july 1, 2007, and assigned to art units 3677. applications filed on or before      november 1, 2007, and assigned to art units 3679. applications filed on or before      may 1, 2006, and assigned to art unit 3735. applications filed on or before      april 1, 2007, and assigned to art unit 3736. applications filed on or before      december 1, 2006, and assigned to art units 3737. applications filed on or before      august 1, 2006, and assigned to art units 3768. applications filed on or before      december 1, 2006, and assigned to art unit 3739. applications filed on or before      september 1, 2007, and assigned to art units 3762 and 3766. applications filed on or before      september 1, 2006, and assigned to art unit 3769. previously, all applicants had to go through all phases of the    pilot’s procedure. after receiving a pre-interview communication that contains    the results of the examiner’s prior art search, applicants may now choose from the following:   a. the full pilot procedure (pre-interview      communication, interview and first action).  b. waiver of the interview (pre-interview      communication and first action only).  c. waiver of the interview and first action (by      filing a reply in compliance with 37 cfr 1.111(b) in response to the      pre-interview communication).  d. waiver of the first action (by requesting      entry of a proposed amendment during the interview).      the time period to reply set forth    in the pre-interview communication will be extendable by one additional month.    (previously, the time period for reply was non-extendable.) the time period within which to conduct the    interview will be two months from the date of filing the interview request    form. (previously, the time period    was two months from the office notice date for the pre-interview    communication.)  failure to timely reply to the    pre-interview communication or to timely conduct the interview will not result    in abandonment of the application. instead, a first action will be provided,    similar to waiving the interview.  applicant's request to    participate in the program must be filed during the six month life of the    program and at least one day before a first office action on the merits    of the application appears in the patent application information retrieval    (pair) system.  the request to enter the pilot program must be    made via efs-web which can be accessed at: http://www.uspto.gov/ebc/index.html     more information:  original pilot

enhances information exchange between applicant and examiner and promotes    early resolution of outstanding issues washington – the commerce    department’s united states patent and trademark office (uspto) today announced    that it is expanding its first action interview pilot program in which an    applicant is entitled to an interview with the patent examiner prior to the    first office action on the merits in a new utility application.  the    program will expand to additional technology areas for a six-month period    beginning on october 1, 2009.  the initial pilot program was limited to    two computer-related technology areas.the initial six-month pilot    program, which began april 28, 2008, has shown that the patent process    benefits when interaction between the applicant and the examiner are enhanced    at the beginning of examination because patentability issues can be resolved    early when the applicant and the examiner discuss them one-on-one.  for    the applications involved in the initial pilot, the first-action allowance    rate increased six-fold when compared to applications from the same technology    area not involved in the pilot. “when people talk to one another and    listen to one another they can quickly understand points of agreement as well    as differences, and resolve those differences in real-time,” noted under    secretary of commerce for intellectual property and director of the uspto    david kappos.  “initial results from this pilot are very impressive and    show that interviews present a clear path to resolve issues and move    prosecution forward quickly.”currently, an applicant may request an    interview prior to a first action. granting of an interview is within the    discretion of the examiner who has not yet reviewed the case, and the    applicant may be required to identify relevant documents and explain how the    invention is patentable over these documents.under the expanded pilot    program, the examiner will conduct a prior art search and provide the    applicant a pre-interview communication, which is a condensed preview of    objections or rejections proposed against the claims.  within 30 days    from the issue date of the pre-interview communication, the applicant must    either choose not to have a first action interview with the examiner, or    schedule the interview and file a proposed amendment or remarks    (arguments).  should the applicant choose not to have a first    action interview, a first action interview office action will be promptly    issued and the applicant will have one month or 30 days, whichever is longer,    to reply.  if an interview is scheduled, the applicant must be prepared    to discuss issues related to the patentability of the claims.  in this    interview, if the applicant and the examiner reach agreement on all claims in    regards to patentability, a notice of allowance and fees due will be    issued.  if agreement is not reached on all claims in regards to    patentability, the applicant will be given a first action interview office    action setting forth any requirements, objections and rejections to which the    applicant will be given one month or 30 days, whichever is longer, to reply,    with limited extensions of time.  it is this first action interview    office action that is considered the first action on the merits in the    application.there have been several improvements made to the program    since the initial pilot. for example, the response period to reply to the    pre-interview communication can now be extended by 30 days.  also, the    applicant can now waive receipt of the first action interview office action    during the interview with the examiner, convert the previously-submitted draft    amendment to a formal amendment and proceed directly to the second substantive    examination.  this may be preferable to those who would prefer not to    wait for the first action interview office action and refile the proposed    amendment formally. the uspto will continue to survey applicants    during the expanded pilot to make further improvements to the    program.for details regarding eligibility and criteria for    participation in the pilot, see the uspto web site, at http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/dapp/opla/preognotice/faipp_v2.htm.###

	 tgif for religion and intellectual property
	 
    


on july 7,  2009, pope benedict xvi published his third encyclical  letter titled "caritas in veritate" (charity in  truth) which, among other things, states that "on the part of rich countries there  is excessive zeal for protecting knowledge through an unduly rigid assertion of  the right to intellectual property, especially in the field of health care.  at the same time, in some poor countries,  cultural models and social norms of behaviour persist which hinder the process  of development."     in response, the intellectual property owners  association announced that it  and others "are working to  educate on the incentives that ip rights provide for advancing knowledge and  creating jobs."   good luck in  bringing some of that same religious fervor to your  organization.

	 evidence of intent to use before the us trademark office
	 
    


the latest issue of the  trademark reporter includes sandra edelman's timely and informative article  on bona fide intent, entitled "proving your bona fides - establishing  bona fide intent to use under the u.s. trademark (lanham) act," 99 trademark reporter 763 (may-june  2009).   according to  the  ttablog, the u.s. trademark trial  and appeal board's recent decision in honda motor co., ltd. v. friedrich  winkelmann, 90 uspq2d 1660 (ttab 2009)  [precedential], brought the bona fide intent issue to the forefront for  many trademark practitioners. there the  board sustained honda's opposition to herr winkelmann's section 44(e)  application to register the mark v.i.c. for vehicles, ruling on summary judgment  that winkelmann had failed to establish the requisite bona  fide intent to use his mark in the usa. according to edelman,"registration applicants should be very careful about including too many products or services  in their intent-to-use based applications, and should maintain some  minimal level of contemporaneous  documentation and provable business rationale for the products or services listed in the application."  the affirmative activities that  have been deemed indicative of the presence of a bona fide intent to  use a trademark in  commerce include:  conducting a trademark    availability search performing preparatory graphic    design work or labeling on sales material for a    product; using a mark in international    jurisdictions using a mark in test marketing testimony regarding informal,    unwritten business plans or market research obtaining necessary regulatory    permits obtaining a correlative domain name    for the mark or setting up a website making contacts with individuals who    might help develop a business; correspondence mentioning the planned    use of the mark attempts to find licensees, including    ones outside of the u.s. obtaining commercial space in which to perform the    services  the factual circumstances that have been  deemed indicative of a lack of a bona fide intent to use  include: ·     an  unrealistically broad listing of goods and services;  a defensive intent to prevent others from using the    mark; the filing of numerous    intent-to-use applications without ever using them or    subsequently abandoning them; the absence of any    steps or planning to use the mark; lack of industry-relevant experience; misrepresentation of goods or services in order to reserve a    mark

	 website "means" requires algorithm disclosure
	 
    


in ex parte catlin,  __ westlaw __ (u.s. pto bd. app. & int.  february 3, 2009)(precedential), the board held that a method claim for implementing an  on-line incentive system that recited "providing, at a merchant's web site,  means for a consumer to participate in an  earning activity to earn value from a  merchant" was invalid for  indefiniteness under 35 u.s.c.  section 112, second  paragraph, where the application failed to disclose any algorithms that  transformed the disclosed general purpose processor to a special purpose computer programmed to perform the disclosed  functions:   according to administrative patent  judge horner,  . . . we have thoroughly reviewed the    appellants' specification and have not been able to locate an adequate    disclosure of structure, material, or acts corresponding to the functions of    allowing a consumer to participate in an earning activity and earn value from    an earning activity. in particular, the specification does not disclose any    specific algorithm that could be implemented on a general purpose computer to    allow a consumer to participate in an earning activity and earn value from an    earning activity. accordingly, the specification fails to disclose the    algorithms that transform the general purpose processor to a special purpose    computer programmed to    perform the disclosed functions of the first elements of claims 1, 9, and 20.    the appellant has failed to disclose any algorithm, and thus has failed to    adequately describe sufficient structure, for performing the functions recited    in the means elements contained in the first step of claims 1, 9, and 20 so as    to render the claims definite. accordingly, claims 1, 9, and 20, and    claims 2-8, 1 1 - 19, and 2 1-25 depending therefrom, are unpatentable . .    . as  indefinite.

	 federal circuit standard of review for itc decisions
	 
    


in erbe  elektromedizin gmbh v. international trade commission (fed. cir. 2009; may 19, 2009), the court restated its standard  of review for decisions of the u.s. international trade  commission:  we review the rulings of the itc    under the administrative procedure act, 5 u.s.c. § 706. 19 u.s.c. § 1337(c);    osram gmbh v. int'l trade comm'n, 505 f.3d 1351, 1355 (fed. cir. 2007).    "rulings of law by the itc are reviewed for correctness, and findings of fact    are reviewed to ascertain whether they were supported by substantial evidence    on the record as a whole." osram, 505 f.3d at 1355. . . .  we review claim construction de novo. cybor    corp. v. fas techs., inc., 138 f.3d 1448, 1456 (fed. cir. 1998) (en banc).    the claims "must be read in view of the specification, of which they are a    part." phillips v. awh corp., 415 f.3d 1303, 1315 (fed. cir. 2005) (en    banc) (quoting markman v. westview instruments, inc., 52 f.3d 967, 979    (fed. cir. 1995) (en banc)). we generally do not construe claim language to be    inconsistent with the clear language of the specification; "[u]sually, it is    dispositive." phillips, 415 f.3d at 1315 (quoting vitronics corp. v.    conceptronic, inc., 90 f.3d 1576, 1582 (fed. cir.    1996)). . .    . . . .    the fundamental disagreement between the parties boils down to whether    fixed optics are a "working channel." .    . . the parties agree that    infringement requires the accused devices to be used with an endoscope having    at least two "working channels" and that the accused devices have only a    single "working channel" if the fixed optics are not a "working channel."    based on our claim construction, the itc correctly concluded that erbe    presented no evidence that any accused device had been used with an endoscope    that had at least two "working channels" and, therefore, that there was no    evidence of direct infringement and thus no basis for finding induced or    contributory infringement. in light of this holding, we need not address the    other arguments raised on appeal. accordingly, we affirm.

	 federal circuit clarifies materiality test for geographically deceptively misdescriptive marks
	 
    


in in re spirits international,  n.v., (april 29, 2009), the u.s. court of appeals for the federal  circuit vacated the ttab's decision in which the board found the mark  moskovskaya to be primarily  geographically deceptively misdescriptive of vodka. (ttab decision here  via the ttablog). the cafc  ruled that the board had improperly applied the materiality test of section  2(e)(3) because it failed to consider whether a substantial portion of all  relevant consumers (not just russian speakers) is likely to be deceived:    in this case, as in every case, in order    to establish a prima facie case of    materiality there must be some indication that a substantial portion of the relevant consumers    would be materially influenced in the decision to purchase the product or service by the geographic meaning    of the mark. here the board properly    recognized that in order to be deceptive, foreign language marks must meet the requirement that “an    appreciable number of consumers for the goods or services at issue will be deceived.” in re spirits, 86 uspq2d    at 1085.  the problem with the board’s decision is that it elsewhere rejected a    requirement of proportionality, and    discussed instead the fact that russian is a “common, modern language[] of the world [that] will be spoken    or understood by an appreciable number of u.s. consumers for the product or service at issue,” such number    being in this case 706,000 people, according to the    2000 census. id. the board, however, failed to consider whether russian speakers were a “substantial portion of    the intended audience.” because the board applied an    incorrect test, a remand is required. we express no opinion on the    ultimate question of whether a substantial portion of the intended audience would be materially    deceived. we note that only 0.25% of the u.s. population speaks russian. appellant’s br. 26. if only one quarter    of one percent of the relevant consumers    was deceived, this would not be, by any measure, a substantial portion. however, it may be that    russian speakers are a greater percentage of the vodka-consuming public; that some number of non-russian speakers    would understand the mark to suggest    that the vodka came from moscow; and that these groups would together be a substantial portion    of the intended audience. we remand to the board for a    determination of whether there is a prima facie case of material deception under the correct legal test in the first    instance. because of our disposition on    the question of the prima facie case, we do not reach the questions raised by the appellant as to the board’s    rejection of the survey as rebutting the prima facie case, though we note that the board’s holding as to this issue    was heavily influenced by its incorrect view of    materiality.
