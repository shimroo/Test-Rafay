we convene spiritually and politically engaged individuals from multiple lineages, buddhist and otherwise, to explore practices to be in wise and compassionate relationship to ourselves, each other, and movements. our convenings and programs are led by and lift up the voices and priorities of black, indigenous, heritage buddhists, and people of color who share our commitment to regenerative living economy, queer feminism, and racial justice.



the buddhist peace fellowship’s purpose is to serve collective liberation through connecting dharma to the current moment.
