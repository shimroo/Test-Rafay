mortarless & segmental retaining wall systemssince 1990, innovative concrete has provided customers throughout east coast and midwest with the finest selection of natural looking concrete retaining walls though its patented stonewall select retaining walls system.
the business prides itself on stonewall's distinctly different look, which has an offset, split face design; this design is so unrivaled that it is the only retaining wall system with its own trademark. the random pattern face is designed to reduce the amount of cutting needed to create a curved wall, which saves customers time and money. the patented interlocking, hollow-cored blocks make it easier to install than most other retaining wall systems.
stonewall select provides naturally scaled, real-rock beauty that combines many of finest elements of todayÂ’s concrete retaining wall systems. because of its mortarless design, installation is a breeze. the double-cored block is lightweight and makes it easy to install steps, curves and corners.
from large commercial landscapes to do-it-yourself home designs, no project is too rocky for innovative concrete.

stonewall select's "distinctly different look" is so unique that we are the only retaining wall system to be issued a trademark on the look of the face.

our "random pattern" face substantially reduces cutting of the block on curved walls versus patterned block, saving you time and money on installation.
