when our building was hit by lightning, it wiped out all phones, radios, computers. even the generator took a hit. eastern worked through the night to get us back on line. eastern is a company you want on your side.
bob gallagher - county of delaware 911



our generators are in almost daily use for long hours. we depend on them, and we have always gotten much more than normal life expectancy. i know where i’ll go for my next generator if our current one doesn’t outlast me.
robert c. purrenhage - head of bookmobile services chester county library



…excellent response time to service calls. your technicians are very knowledgeable.
paul voss - public safety building - wilmington, de



without a doubt, eastern generator is the best company i have the pleasure of doing business with – always here when i needed – or better yet-when i thought i needed them
fred fortino - automated wagering international



eastern rehabilitated our old generator at a modest cost and have maintained it well. emergency service was timely and efficient. eastern is part of our maintenance team.
robert w. mueller - delaware valley friends schoot of paoli



the purchase of our generator was the best purchase we ever made. we have never had a problem with it at any time, and know we can count on power within a count of 3!
rhoda w. richards - bryn mawr post office



all the other contractors i tried were either non-responsive or overpriced. eastern generator responded promptly. their installation crew was courteous and efficient (not to mention neat!) i’ve been very pleased and so has the rest of the board.
patricia pitzer - drexel hill baptist church



‘over the past 14 years, our situation required extensive research for some unusual applications… the eastern crew always pulled through.”
anthony cambria - professional health services



your people did a great job with a complicated installation. they were timely and efficient and, most importantly, team players.
pete maruca - orion general contractors



when the electricity goes out for other companies and people’s homes, we go on with business as usual as if nothing has happened. my thanks to the entire staff at eastern generator.
rick zito - ac & public refrigeration

eastern generator’s only business is (and always has been) generators – making sure our customers have the power they need, whenever and wherever they need it.
since 1984, when we began as a generator service company, we’ve built our business on the power of customer satisfaction. personal, professional service remains our top priority today as our factory-trained technicians service thousands of generators of virtually all makes and sizes. we sell a wide variety of new and reconditioned generators, not just one or two brands.
our customers get the best system and value for their needs. with eastern generator, you’re not just buying a generator-from site assessment and system recommendations, to installation and testing, through maintenance and service, you’re getting the reliability of standby power that kicks in the instant you need it. for power and people you can depend on, call on eastern.
generators are our only business. don’t be fooled by fly by night companies that don’t invest in their technicians or provide cutting edge technology.
