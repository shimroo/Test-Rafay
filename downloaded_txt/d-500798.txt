life begins...



miscarriage stories of loss, hope and help. it's always devastating to experience a loss. it can cause you to feel alone, isolated. there's no 'right' way to feel - a range of reactions are possible and normal. in addition to the grief you may feel, your body will be undergoing some profound hormonal adjustments, which may make you feel very emotionally volatile. if you have had a miscarriage, take the time to understand better why these occur and why it is not your fault.

five miscarriages and a baby







privately i've been battling my own set of personal challenges - five miscarriages and a baby...

maggie is fast approaching two and is the joy of my life. i've had three of my five miscarriages since she was born so the struggle isn't over, but i've come to appreciate how lucky i am.

i have what so many people want but never actually get - an incredible daughter, a loving fiancé and a supportive family that have shared and absorbed my pain where they could (thank-you all).

today's book suggestion:
avoiding miscarriage: everything you need to know to feel more confident in pregnancy
-- there are only four major causes of miscarriage, and targeted questionnaires help each woman clarify whether she might be at higher risk in any of these areas.

each cause is explained thoroughly but clearly, with the information and support women need to improve their chance of future successful pregnancy. this makes the book as relevant for women who have never even been pregnant as it is for women who have experienced miscarriage.

the book presents a detailed overview of miscarriage, dispels common myths, provides flow charts to help reveal the cause of any previous unexplained loss, and offers positive, practical options for action.

it is written from the patient's perspective, drawing on sympathetic case studies to introduce each chapter and presenting complex medical research in a way that is easy to understand. the reassuring and upbeat tone inspires a positive attitude, and the book enables each woman to identify the path that is right for her based on her unique personality and circumstances.

after 16 tries, i finally got the baby i wanted





maria pridmore said the arrival of daughter mia shannon was ‘a dream come true’.

the 32-year-old said: ‘after the two i lost and all the  miscarriages, i never thought i would be gifted with one. she is so  precious to us.’

the cancer nurse lost 16 babies over a 13-year period and gave  up on the idea of a family after the stillbirth of daughter shannon and  death of son kia at the age of two weeks in 2009.

herb & vitamin list explaining uses for infertility





a woman named ladawna originally posted this on the  new high fsh support forum in july of 2005. i thought it was worth sharing again, and so i can keep it on file for myself...ladawna wrote: i’m not a doctor nor do i consider myself one. this is information i’ve collected from studies, research and from those who study herbs. i highly recommend consulting a doctor or a professional before taking any of them. please note that only some of the herbs listed below indicate whether or not they are safe for pregnancy. please treat all as being unsafe until speaking about their usage with your re or ob/gyn. vitamin a - is an antioxidant that helps prevent free-radical damage to cell mitochondria. angelica (dang gui) - can help to regulate the menstrual flow (scanty flow) and aids in the lining of the uterus. can also help to lower fsh. alpha-linolenic acid - is important for ovulation. aids in the egg release (from the follicle) and allowing the development of the corpus luteum that is responsible for progrestrone production. alfalfa - aids in pituitary problems. this works well with fertility drugs. b6 - see lecithin. baby aspirin - used after ovulation to help in preventing miscarriage. most often recommended after iui/ivf. bee pollen - taken with royal jelly can possibly improve or eliminate menstrual problems. is rich in vitamins, minerals, nucleic acids, and steroid hormones. strengthens the pituitary gland. beechwood - used often while taking clomid or serophene. beechwood aids in building cervical mucus and is an alternative to robitussin (plain only). it can be found in most health food stores. black cohosh - a natural supplier of estrogen. black cohosh should only be taken from menstruation to ovulation. when used other than specifically for fertility can lead to early miscarriage. blessed thistle - is used when black cohosh isn’t tolerated. blue-green algae - contains chlorophyll, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals. strengthens pituitary gland. there are two types—chlorella (from freshwater) and spirulina (from saltwater) vitamin c - is an antioxidant that helps prevent free-radical damage to cell mitochondria. camp bark - is considered a reproductive tonic. take from menstruation to ovulation. catnip - elevates the mood. can help prevent miscarriages and morning sickness. cayenne - increases the effectiveness of other herbs. taken from menstruation to ovulation. chaste tree (aka vitex) - inhibits fsh & can make hormones more subdued. regulates estrogen and progesterone. great to take a few months before doing an fsh level test or cct to help lower the results of fsh levels. **note** works against maca, damiana, and infertility drugs including clomid! coenzyme q-10 (coq-10) - helps support and improve mitochondrial (powerhouse of cells) function. during aging, the mitochondrial dna is damaged by free radicals in our system contributing to poor egg quality occurring with aging. damiana - enhances fsh & lh. a natural aphrodisiac. dhea - is a hormone building block that decreases with aging. it can be used in place of growth hormone to help the ovaries respond. a study reported that taking 80 milligrams per day for 2 months improved response to gonadotropic drugs.**note** don’t take for long periods of time. women with elevated male hormones should not take dhea. dong quai - is a hormone regulator and uterine tonic. it is known as the female hormone regulator. dong quai should be taken in the first half of the cycle from menstruation to ovulation. **note** do not take during pregnancy evening primrose oil (epo) - is a uterine toner and helps to increase the fertile quality cervical fluid. regulates menstrual flow (scanty, dark flow) and aids in the lining of the uterus. it neutralizes over-acidity in the body. epo should be taken the first half of the cycle - from mensturation to ovulation. vitamin e - is an antioxidant that helps prevent free radical damage to mitochondria (in cells). this is very important if you wish to conceive. eskimo 3 - contaminant free fish oil to assist with ewcm production. false unicorn root (helonias) - lowers estrogen. tones & strengthens the muscles of the uterus. prevents miscarriage (especially when used with lobelia). used for some types of complications of pregnancy. can possibly help to lower fsh. folic acid - important for cell division. it also can help prevent spinal bifida. active ingredient in most prenatal vitamins. gingko - improves blood flow to the brain & pituitary gland. ginseng - contains steroids similar to estrogen and progesterone. aids in reducing stress. can possibly help lower fsh. regulates male hormones especially when taken with sarsaparilla. take from menstruation to ovulation. hawthorn - can help prevent miscarriages. hops - has estrogenic effects. can have a calming effect. **note**also can slow down sex drive. kelp - great for the pituitary glands. helps lower prolactin levels. lady´s mantle - considered a reproductuve tonic. take from menstruation to ovulation. l'arginine - improves bloodflow to the pelvic organs. in a study, this amino acid was found to increase ovarian response, endometrail receptivity, and pregnancy rates in ivf patients who took 16 grams of l-arginine by increasing blood flow to the ovaries. it not recommended to take that much though. lecithin - b6. for pituitary gland. it is known for helping to normalize hormone levels which in turn helps to lengthen the luteal phase and to minimize pms and morning sickness. licorice root - contains estroil, an estrogen. depresses the pituitary gland. helps stabilize blood sugar levels. take from menstruation to ovulation **note** shouldn’t be taken for long periods of time or in large doses. works against fertility drugs. lobelia - helps to prevent miscarriage. works great with false unicorn root. loveage - is considered a general reproductive tonic. take from menstruation to ovulation. maca - can enhance fsh, lh, and reduce stress. magnesium - low magnesium levels are associated with low progesterone. can lower the risk of premature birth, may reduce preclampsia, cerebral palsy and mental retardation. motherwort - considered a reproductive tonic. take from menstruation to ovulation. nettle - is considered a reproductive tonic. take from menstruation to ovulation. paba (para-aminobenzoic acid) - a b vitamin which stimulates the pituitary gland and sometimes restores fertility to a woman. paba affects the formation of red blood cells, and stimulates the production of folic acid in the intestines. supplements of 300 to 400 milligrams daily has been found to prevent and correct aspects of some autoimmune conditions including infertility. pantothenic acid - is a b5 vitamin. synthesizes hormones and cholesterol. improves the body's resistance to stress. deficiencies can cause infertility, though being deficient is rare. pycnogenol (or oligomeric proanthocyanidins) - is a super-antioxidant that helps prevent free-radical damage to cell mitochondria. red clover - used to aid fertility. take from menstruation to ovulation. red raspberry leaves - strengthens the uterus and entire reproductive system. can help prevent miscarriage. royal jelly - with bee pollen can improve or eliminate menstrual problems. contains high amounts of amino acids, vitamins, and enzymes. considered to be the queen bee's equivalent of fertility drugs. sarsaparilla - contains both male and female hormones. for men, it increases sperm count especially when taken with ginseng. for women, it balances female hormones, strengthens the pituitary gland and enhances both fsh & lh. contains progesterone. saw palmetto - may be beneficial for infertility, menstrual disorders, ovarian dysfunction, lactation, thyroid deficiencies, and painful menstrual periods. this herb is mainly used for male problems and have only found it to “may be” work for female problems. selenium - an antioxidant that helps prevent free-radical damage to cell mitochondria. a deficiency of selenium can lead to infertility in women. valerian root - basically does the same thing as wheatgrass. very relaxing to the whole body. vitex - see chaste tree wheatgrass (or barley grass) - helps the cervical mucus and uterus have the right ph balance needed for conception and implantation. can help restore hormonal functioning.white peony (bai shao) - can help to regulate menstrual flow (scanty flow) and aid in the lining of the uterus. wild yam - used to increase progesterone. can help prevent miscarriage. wobenzyme - used by women that have miscarriages caused by immune issues. contains rutin. zinc -
