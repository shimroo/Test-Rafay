guide to contents (continually evolving)this site is designed to  help you deepen and share your faith, and if you skeptical about the claims of christianity, to address your reservations. people in the twentieth-first century raise objections to christianity that are often based on confusions, misunderstandings, unwarranted assumptions, and faulty conclusions. christian faith, however, makes at least as much sense as anything else on the market. what happens in the world can prove discouraging, and if  bad news hits close to home, we can end up feeling devastated, which of course is understandable. to some, our planet and perhaps human beings seem like they’re on the fast track to self-destruction. but god has something else in mind, an overarching purpose for the world. such good news lies at the center of christianity, and it is this news that is well worth embracing and sharing. it offers legitimate hope and therefore can go a long way toward overcoming pessimism and despair. below, you will find six commonly expressed obstacles to faith, along with bullet points suggesting, if you are not a christian, what you may want to think about. and, if you are a christian, perhaps how you might respond when seekers and skeptics bring up these obstacles in conversation. they are quick-hit summaries of what is contained in christianity for seekers and skeptics: critical thinking and passionate faith by dr. clinton mclemore.  beneath the six obstacles and responses to them, you will find a growing list of questions that are often of interest to (1) people who already believe in god through christ but want a deeper understanding of christianity, or (2) those who are searching for faith but who, for one reason or another, remain skeptical. next to each one, you will find additional ideas to ponder. clicking on the button will take you to thoughts and reflections that you or others may find helpful.to some questions about religion, it is easy to provide good answers. for others, there may be no straightforward or obvious answer, and different groups of christians have suggested different answers. finally, there are questions to which perhaps no one has developed a fully satisfying answer. this site contains no attempt to nudge anyone toward a particular christian tradition, whether eastern orthodox, protestant, or roman catholic. there are many noteworthy christians within all three. its purpose is to present well-reasoned ideas and arguments that leaders of all three traditions would endorse. all of the questions and responses are intended to reflect beliefs shared by all christians rather than ones on which they disagree. we therefore try to avoid statements that are of secondary importance.we are striving to represent only what all mainline christian traditions would consider orthodox, a term that can prove confusing. it is important not to confuse this term with eastern orthodoxy. the word orthodox comes from combining two greek roots, ortho, meaning straight or correct, and doxa meaning belief or opinion. we use orthodox to mean foundational affirmations accepted by leaders of the three main branches of christianity mentioned above. although orthodox may bring to mind someone who is narrow-minded, rigid, and reflective, that is not at all what it means here.new ideas are often superior to old ones. concepts, principles, and procedures that today are second nature to a well-trained surgeon are vastly superior to those of a surgeon during the civil war. but in more abstract areas, the difference between old and new are not always clear-cut. questions having to do with what gives life meaning, or guides right human conduct, continue to prove challenging and are as relevant today as they were in greece three-thousand years ago.invitation: we invite you to send us suggestions for questions we have yet to address but perhaps should. if we don't have good answers, we'll try to find people who do. we welcome your suggestions.responses to obstacles
