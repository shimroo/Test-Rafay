positively impacting our community: what our customers say
customer testimonials
 
 "the help you can receive is great!" 
"these folks are as helpful as they can be within the order of
  the law.
free legal help is offered. if you have trouble with any forms, you
  can come in, and they will help. they can not advise, but they will
  clarify and simplify. translation services offered.
they take a lot of abuse and still keep you informed of any issues
  you need to deal with, and they will direct you to the right form for
  your intentions with a case.
compared to montana, the help you can receive is great. men in
  montana receive zero help. mothers are granted a representative while
  men are left to figure out everything, and if you do it wrong, well,
  the jails still have cells outside. btw, it gets to -30f in the
  winter. you do get to come inside at night though....the floor is just
  as cold." -- blight
 
 
 "what a nice and helpful group of people!" 
"walking up for the first time i was trembling!!! walking out
  i   said to myself, "huh, what a nice and helpful group of people
  there." -- brian
 
 
 "i am satisfied with the service."  
i feel compelled to write a review because to date my experience
  does not match that listed from the other 125 reviews. i am dealing
  with a case being transferred from nj.
i called to find out what the process was, and the person
  communicated how to do that online so i would not waste my time coming
  into the office. they also let me know it would be 20 days because
  they were backlogged. on day 20, an intake person reached out to me
  via text (the method of communication i indicated i preferred) and we
  arranged a phone call that day. they were very courteous and they told
  me what paperwork they needed. i dropped it off the next business day
  (monday). on that friday, i received paperwork in the mail with my
  case number, and request for some additional documentation, which i
  completed and mailed back in. the following week i received more
  paperwork with the online login to the customer connect child support
  site. i have the phone number for my case worker.
we are still in the process of establishing our case, but things
  are   moving along at a reasonable pace. i do not see a significant
  difference in the demeanor of the people i have interacted with here
  vs nj. i will provide an update on how things progress but so far, i
  am satisfied with the service. -- christine
