the term 'aspi' is an acronym 
          that stands for: advanced scsi programming interface. 
          all the following terms are synonymous: aspi layer, aspi drivers, 
          aspi interface. the term 'scsi' [scuzzy] is an acronym 
        that stands for small computer systems interface.






an aspi layer consists of four files [see gray boxes below] that 
            'lie between' various programs [software] and certain devices, such 
            as cd/dvd-rom drives and cd/dvd burners/writers [hardware].

          software 
          programs such as cd digital audio extractors [commonly 
            known as 'rippers'] 
        and cd-writing utilities such as cdrwin use/require aspi drivers to 'communicate with' scsi devices.
many people don't realize however, that the files contained in an aspi 
          layer are also used in systems that *don't* contain a scsi adapter, 
          or scsi devices .. for things such as ripping 
          cd audio and burning cd/dvds.

        this is why you'll find aspi-related files and info posted at sites such as cdrwin, nero, feurio, doom9, fireburner, plextor & the coaster factory.
it's not vital you know this, but aspi drivers consist of the 
          following four files (with directory locations):

windows 98 / me:
  windows\system\iosubsys\apix.vxd
  windows\system\aspienum.vxd
  windows\system\winaspi.dll
  windows\system\wnaspi32.dll


windows 2000:
  winnt\system32\drivers\aspi32.sys
  winnt\system\wowpost.exe
  winnt\system\winaspi.dll
  winnt\system32\wnaspi32.dll 


windows xp:
  windows\system32\drivers\aspi32.sys
  windows\system\wowpost.exe
  windows\system\winaspi.dll
  windows\system32\wnaspi32.dll

the latest adaptec aspi layer [for windows 
            xp] looks like this:

 version info for windows 
          2000 should show the middle two files listed as v4.60 
          [like this], or at 
          least that's what the 
          aspiinst.pdf file says that comes with the latest aspi layer drivers 
          [v4.71.2]. 

          if your aspi-installation info doesn't look like this, it 
          doesn't mean there is anything necessarily wrong with your system configuration. 
          but if you're having trouble ripping or burning, i might be able to 
          help.







note: in order to get wowpost.exe and winaspi.dll updated to the latest version, i had to rename the 
            two files in the 'adaptec' folder: wowpost.ex_ becomes wowpost.exe, 
            and winaspi.dl_ becomes winaspi.dll. 

          then i manually copied these two 
          files to my \system folder. but first i renamed the current ones to 
          wowpost_old.exe and winaspi_old.dll, so i could go back if i had any 
          problems. i got this tip from hendrick. steve ryan writes to say: 

adaptec compressed wowpost.exe & 
            winaspi.dll in their download - calling them wowpost.ex_ 
            and winaspi.dl_. although aspi_check notes them as v4.71.2 when compressed, 
            they are really v4.60 when uncompressed using the expand utility. 
            i confirmed this using the nero infotool program.

if you experience problems with this aspi configuration, 
          you have several options to consider. first: if you can't see your cd-rom 
          or burner [in windows xp], you might want to try double clicking on 
          the reg_xp.exe file that comes with the latest drivers 
          from adaptec. 

          this will tell your system that you have a burner and 
          cd-rom and where they are located [logically]. i would expect these 
          types of problems to be more common with brand-new systems [no previous 
          aspi layer installed].
you might also want to try manually deleting wowpost.exe 
          and winaspi.dll in winxp, as some people claim that winxp doesn't 
          need these two files. but try beginning with all 4 
          files first. read the posts 
          by hendrik here for more info along these lines. or you can try 
          reverting back to the old, stable v4.60 using forceaspi 
          [see below].

update 29oct2002 - adaptec released v4.71.2 
            of its aspi drivers (thx tarrant). see here. 
            anyone having problems 
            with these new drivers? 

you can download two different copies of adaptec's 
          aspi checker from my 
          downloads page. this utility will scan your computer and report 
          what version of aspi drivers are currently installed in your 
          system.
if you are having trouble ripping and/or burning with 
          winxp, v4.71 [or later], you might want to check out 
          this file. it contains 
          a registry fix that might help. it didn't help me. i found it while 
          searching the cdex 
          faqs.
update 02apr2003 - i have gone back to v4.60 
          in winxp because neither of my two favorite cd audio rippers [eac 
          & cdex] work with v4.71.2. 
          they both lock up (not responding). i'm not sure why. soon as i installed 
          v4.60 however [via 
          forceaspi], they both worked flawlessly again.
first i backed-up my current aspi layer [via dumpaspi]. 
          then i removed my old aspi layer [via killaspi, because windows will 
          not let you replace system files with older versions]. finally i re-installed 
          v4.60 [via instaspi] and then rebooted. voila! both 
          rippers work again. it's magic.



force aspi
forceaspi 
          is a popular utility that will install version 4.60 (1021) of adaptec's 
          aspi drivers, *without* an adaptec card or software in your system 
          [hence: force]. force aspi v1.7 is the latest version. many 
          folks, such as those at sony 
          and adobe 
          find these drivers work best. if the latest version is giving you headaches, 
          definitely give these a try.
force aspi will 
          also *back-up* your current aspi configuration. so, if you encounter 
          problems, you can easily restore your original aspi drivers. 
          the command *dumpaspi* creates a backup of your existing aspi layer. 
          

          you can also back-up your current aspi configuration by copying files 
          [individually] listed above to a back-up directory of your choosing 
        [such as aspi_old].
[while we're on the subject of back-ups, i want to mention 
          <shameless plug> my user's 
          guide for norton ghost. ghost is perhaps the ultimate back-up utility 
          for the home user. </plug> back to force aspi...]
the command *instaspi* will install version 4.60 (1021) of adaptec's 
          aspi drivers to your system. forceaspi works with windows 98, windowsme, 
          windows nt, and windows 2000 .. regardless of your particular system 
          configuration. it also works fine with windows 
          xp, as reported by many happy winxp users.
your existing aspi layer will be *overwritten* and you'll need 
          to reboot before changes take effect. the file named index.html 
          that comes with forceaspi contains all the instructions you'll need. 
          it looks like this.
you can download force aspi here,  or from doom9 
          (listed under support utils, near the bottom), or a million other 
          places. wimpy was the original author of forceaspi, but his site is no longer operating. [i want to give credit 
          where credit is due.]
