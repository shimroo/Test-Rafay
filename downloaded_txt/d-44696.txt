if you are looking for
a
special and unique art, this is where you will find it. randy is known
internationally for his research and work making authentic style medieval illuminated manuscripts, whole medieval books,
and for his illustrations
on magic: the gathering
cards, start trek model kit
covers, magazines and book
covers, and
tv. his clients have been many of the top companies in their markets.
    
are you looking for a gift
for someone special, or for a handcrafted book for yourself? randy will make your
medieval art
just as
it was done in the middle ages, using the same authentic materials and
techniques. unlike other illuminators who use modern
equivalents
and copy existing art, randy works as if he were actually an artist in
the middle ages. he even makes many of his colors because they are so
difficult to find today. your art can be on genuine animal skin
parchment, with ink made from wasp nests, genuine gold and silver leaf,
and pigments made from such exotic materials as lapis lazuli, azurite,
malachite, vermilion, minium, saffron, buckthorn berries, and brazil
wood. and if you want your own book of any subject dear to you, he will
bind it in wood boards and leather, with hand made clasps and other
hardware, in your choice of styles as were done in europe before 1500
ad.
to
learn more about the process
and what randy can do for you, please visit the galleries listed to the

 i am writing a very ambitious book about how medieval manuscript books were made. it is tentatively entitled secrets of
forgotten
masters:  a
21st c. artist's exploration of the technological processes used for
making illuminated manuscript books from 700-1500 in western
europe. 
i cover
the tools. materials and techniques from making the raw hide into
parchment pages, making colors from scratch, writing, gilding and all
the way through tooling a fine binding. take a look at my sofm page here. you can also see a great sampling of
what will be in that book if you take a look at my articles on how i make medieval books
and pages.

secrets of forgotten masters is a work still in progress.



this
book is a
collaboration between randy and most of the other early magic:
the gathering artists. please click on the image to see details! 
randy has sold out all of his copies of the book, but has prints of his featured painting "the white tree."











randy makes many kinds of art;
so whether you
like science fiction, fantasy, or contemporary art, please enjoy the
links.
prints are
available of many of randy's works. to order prints, purchase
originals, or commission new works, please see the store page for
