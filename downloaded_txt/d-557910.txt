apple's cheapest iphone now starts at $599wednesday february 19, 2025 8:31 am pst by juli cloverahead of the launch of the iphone 16e, rumors suggested that apple would target a price point at or below $500 to stay within the range of prior low-cost iphone options and to encourage sales, but apple opted for a higher starting cost.
the ‚Äåiphone 16e‚Äå is priced starting at $599 for 128gb of storage, and it is now apple's cheapest ‚Äåiphone‚Äå option, even in countries like india where more affordable iphones often sell well.
the now-discontinued iphone se started at $429, so it has become $170 more expensive to get an entry-level ‚Äåiphone‚Äå.
apple raised the price of the ‚Äåiphone 16e‚Äå because it has a modern design, more expensive a18 chip with apple intelligence support, an action button, face id, and a higher starting storage. the increase in cost will improve apple's average ‚Äåiphone‚Äå selling price, but it could put the device out of range of some customers.
here is apple's new pricing lineup, with the ‚Äåiphone 16e‚Äå included:

‚Äåiphone 16e‚Äå - starting at $599
iphone 15 - starting at $699
‚Äåiphone 15‚Äå plus - starting at $799
iphone 16 - starting at $799
‚Äåiphone 16‚Äå plus - starting at $899
iphone 16 pro - starting at $999
‚Äåiphone 16 pro‚Äå max - starting at $1,099

the ‚Äåiphone 16e‚Äå is available for pre-order on friday, with a launch to follow on february 28.

this means accessories such as ‚Äåmagsafe‚Äå cases, chargers, battery packs, and wallets will not work with the device. none of the silicone cases for the iphone 16e are ‚Äåmagsafe‚Äå cases. despite this omission, the ‚Äåiphone 16e‚Äå continues to feature standard qi wireless charging up to 7.5w. 
this makes the ‚Äåiphone 16e‚Äå the first iphone with a "modern" design to miss out on ‚Äåmagsafe‚Äå. ‚Äåmagsafe‚Äå was introduced with the ‚Äåiphone‚Äå 12 lineup in 2020 as a new accessory ecosystem.

related roundup: iphone 16eshow full article11 commentsapple no longer sells any iphones with a home buttonwednesday february 19, 2025 8:09 am pst by joe rossignolthe new iphone 16e unveiled today features face id instead of touch id. as a result, apple no longer sells any new iphone models with a home button, for the first time since the original iphone launched all the way back in 2007.
after debuting in 2007, the home button gained touch id fingerprint authentication when the iphone 5s launched in 2012. apple began phasing out the home button when face id debuted on the iphone x in 2017, and now that the previous iphone se with a home button is discontinued, that process is now complete.
touch id is no longer available on any current iphone models as of today, but it remains built into the power button on the latest ipad air, ipad mini, and entry-level ipad models. touch id also remains a feature on the macbook pro and macbook air.

the new modem contributes to the ‚Äåiphone 16e‚Äå's power efficiency, giving it the longest battery life of any iphone with a 6.1-inch display, such as the iphone 15 and iphone 16.
expanding the benefits of apple silicon, c1 is the first modem designed by apple and the most power-efficient modem ever on an iphone, delivering fast and reliable 5g cellular connectivity. apple silicon ‚Äî including c1 ‚Äî the all-new internal design, and the advanced power management of ios 18 all contribute to extraordinary battery life.
no other apple devices contain the c1. all other ‚Äåiphone‚Äå models use modems from qualcomm. similar to how apple silicon allowed apple to move away from intel processors, apple's 5g modem allows the company to reduce its reliance on qualcomm.

as a result of the iphone se being discontinued, several individual iphone features have also met the end of the road. apple no longer sells any iphone models with a a home button, touch id, lcd screen, a sub-6-inch screen size, or lightning.
apple also discontinued the iphone 14 and iphone 14 plus today.
the lineup now consists of the iphone 16, iphone 16 plus, iphone 16 pro, iphone 16 pro max, iphone 16e, iphone 15, and iphone 15 plus.
there is a bit of a quirk in apple's current iphone lineup. the iphone 16e has an outdated notch, yet it has apple's latest a18 chip and apple intelligence support. meanwhile, the iphone 15 and iphone 15 plus have the newer dynamic island, yet a two-generations-old a16 bionic chip and no apple intelligence support.
apple will likely discontinue the iphone 15 and iphone 15 plus when the iphone 17, iphone 17 air, and iphone 17 pro models launch in september.

the ‚Äåiphone 14‚Äå and ‚Äåiphone 14‚Äå plus were introduced in september 2022 as the standard models in apple's annual smartphone refresh, positioned below the higher-end pro models. at the time of their discontinuation, the ‚Äåiphone 14‚Äå was priced at $599, while the ‚Äåiphone 14‚Äå plus was available for $699, marking a reduction from their original launch prices of $799 and $899, respectively.
the standard ‚Äåiphone 14‚Äå retained a 6.1-inch super retina xdr display, while the ‚Äåiphone 14‚Äå plus introduced a 6.7-inch variant‚Äîthe first time apple offered a large-screen option on a non-pro model. unlike previous years, there was no ‚Äåiphone 14‚Äå mini, as apple opted to replace the compact 5.4-inch model with the larger plus variant.
both devices were powered by the a15 bionic chip, which had originally debuted in the iphone 13, featuring a 5-core gpu for improved graphics performance. they also gained crash detection, which leveraged onboard sensors to detect severe car accidents and automatically contact emergency services if the user was unresponsive, and emergency sos via satellite, allowing users to communicate with emergency responders in areas without cellular or wi-fi connectivity. 
the camera system was enhanced with the introduction of the photonic engine, a computational photography technology aimed at improving low-light performance across all cameras. additionally, the front-facing truedepth camera received autofocus for the first time to improve sharpness in selfies and video calls.
it's worth noting apple has never discontinued a mainline ‚Äåiphone‚Äå midway through the year before. with their removal from apple's website, the company's non-pro lineup now consists of only the ‚Äåiphone 16e‚Äå, iphone 15 and ‚Äåiphone 15‚Äå plus, and iphone 16 and ‚Äåiphone 16‚Äå plus.

the iphone 16e features a larger 6.1-inch oled display, up from a 4.7-inch lcd on the iphone se. the display has a notch for face id, and this means that apple no longer sells any iphones with a touch id fingerprint button, marking the end of an era.
the iphone 16e is powered by an a18 chip, enabling support for apple intelligence features, such as notification summaries and genmoji for creating custom emoji. in the iphone 16e, the a18 chip has a 6-core cpu, but a binned 4-core gpu, whereas the a18 chip has a 5-core gpu in the iphone 16 and iphone 16 plus.
the device is also equipped with an apple-designed 5g modem called the c1, whereas other iphones have a qualcomm modem. apple says its own modem is so power efficient that the iphone 16e offers the longest battery life of any 6.1-inch iphone model ever.

on the back of the iphone 16e is a single 48-megapixel fusion camera, which provides a 2x "optical-quality" telephoto option, according to apple.
other key features include an action button instead of a ring/silent switch, a usb-c port instead of a lightning port, ip68-rated water resistance, . the device does not have the camera control button that was introduced across the rest of the iphone 16 lineup last year. in addition, the iphone 16e lacks magsafe.
iphone 16e supports apple's satellite features. when outside of cellular and wi-fi coverage, the iphone 16e supports emergency sos, roadside assistance, messages, and find my via satellite. availability of the features varies by country.
apple will be accepting pre-orders for the iphone 16e starting at 5 a.m. pacific time on friday, february 21, and the device launches on friday, february 28 in 59 countries and regions. in the u.s., pricing starts at $599. the device is available in white or black, and with 128gb, 256gb, or 512gb storage capacities.

wabetainfo reports that the feature is controlled by a new toggle in whatsapp's ios notification settings, called "clear badge." the setting carries the description: "your home screen badge clears completely after every time you open the app." 
the option, which is already available in whatsapp for android, should serve to reduce clutter on the user's home screen, and potentially lessen "unread anxiety." wabetainfo notes that the feature may have already appeared for some users in the past few weeks, including those on the stable release from the app store. however, for reasons that remain unclear, whatsapp decided to disable them shortly after their initial release. 
the feature is currently making its way through beta testing again via testflight, so expect it to roll out to all whatsapp users in the coming days.

"we're making some changes to create an even better gemini experience on ios," the email read. "gemini is now available as its own app, and that's now the best place to use gemini. to continue using gemini, download the new gemini app from the app store."
the change makes sense, since the standalone gemini app already offered enhanced functionality compared to the limited integration within the google app. it allows iphone users to interact with google's ai through text or voice queries and includes support for gemini extensions. 
a key feature is gemini live, which wasn't available in the previous google app implementation. when engaged in a conversation, gemini live appears in both the dynamic island and lock screen, letting you control your ai interactions without returning to the main app.
the gemini app is free to download on the app store, and google offers premium features through gemini advanced subscriptions available as in-app purchases. gemini advanced is part of a google one ai premium plan costing $18.99 per month. apart from gemini in mail, docs, and more, it includes access to google's next-generation model, 1.5 pro, priority access to new features, and a one million token context window. users need to sign in with a google account to access the service.
tag: googleshow full article28 commentsiphone 17 pro: apple has 'tested' wireless reverse charging featurewednesday february 19, 2025 3:26 am pst by tim hardwickapple has reportedly tested a wireless reverse charging feature for its upcoming iphone 17 pro models that would make the iphone capable of delivering power to other apple devices, according to the weibo-based leaker instant digital.
the chinese leaker claims that apple is testing a 7.5w wireless charging feature for iphone 17 pro models, and it could be used to charge other apple accessories like airpods, apple watch, or potentially an upcoming magsafe battery pack.
long-running rumors of iphone reverse wireless charging capabilities finally came to fruition in 2021 ‚Äì albeit in a limited way ‚Äì when apple released the magsafe battery pack for iphone 12 and newer models. when attached to an ‚Äåiphone‚Äå that was charging via lightning, the ‚Äåiphone‚Äå could deliver power to the magsafe battery pack, which was the first instance of an ‚Äåiphone‚Äå being able to route power to an accessory device. 
apple discontinued the magsafe battery pack in september 2023 with the launch of the iphone 15 lineup, which dropped the lightning cable in favor of usb-c. iphone 15 and later models can reverse charge apple watch, airpods, and other smaller devices that support power delivery at up to 4.5 watts via the usb-c port, but the wireless reverse charging feature for apple devices has not been implemented since the discontinuation of the magsafe battery pack.
in 2022, supply chain analyst ming-chi kuo predicted that a relaunched magsafe battery pack would eventually transition to usb-c, but that has yet to happen. likewise, in september 2023, bloomberg's mark gurman also said he expected usb-c versions of the magsafe battery pack to return "eventually." but he qualified that by saying "don't hold your breath." 
instant digital today admitted that while apple is testing the reverse wireless charging feature for the iphone 17 pro models, the leaker does not know if the feature will actually be enabled on the devices when they officially launch. apple is expected to release its iphone 17 lineup around mid-september.

apple northbrook opened in 2005, and the store moved to a larger space in the mall in 2017.
apple confirmed that affected employees will continue to work for the company.
"at apple, we're always focused on providing an exceptional experience for all of our customers," said apple. "with the evolving redevelopment plans at northbrook court mall and the departure of several retailers, we have made the difficult decision to close our store there. we've loved serving the northbrook community for nearly 20 years, and our valued team members will continue their roles at apple. we look forward welcoming customers at one of our eight chicagoland locations, as well as on apple.com and the apple store app."
the news was first reported by crain's chicago business.
northbrook court is considered to be a dying mall, as it has lost several major retailers over the past few years, including lululemon last month.
apple also permanently closed its infinite loop and royal hawaiian stores early last year, but it has also opened several new stores around the world since then, including at the miami worldcenter, the exchange trx in malaysia, and elsewhere. apple also announced that it will soon be opening a store in downtown detroit.

the ai pin will work until 12:00 p.m. pacific time on february 28, which is just 10 days from now. at that point, ai pin features like calling, messaging, ai queries and responses, and cloud access will stop being available. humane recommends that ai pin users sync their devices over wi-fi to download stored pictures, videos, and notes before february 28 because data will be deleted after that.
the sudden discontinuation of the ai pin comes as humane is being sold to hp for $116 million. hp is purchasing humane's cosmos ai platform and more than 300 patents and patent applications, plus hp will be hiring humane's employees.
humane does not plan to provide the majority of customers with a refund, even though the ai pin worked for under 12 months. refunds are only available to customers who are within their 90-day return period. customers who purchased an ai pin on or after november 15, 2024 will get a refund, but other users are out the full $700. note that all refunds must be submitted by february 27.
humane recommends that customers recycle their ai pin through an e-waste recycling program, as no online features will remain functional and it will only be able to provide offline information like battery level.
additional information about the ai pin's discontinuation is available on the humane website.

most rumors have referred to the device as a new iphone se, since it will succeed the iphone se (3rd generation), but there is mounting evidence that the device will be named iphone 16e instead of iphone se (4th generation).
as a refresher, the iphone 16e name was first mentioned in december by fixed focus digital, an account with more than two million followers on chinese social media platform weibo. later that month, a leaker known as majin bu on x also cited a source who claimed that the next iphone se will actually be named iphone 16e.
in a follow-up post today, majin bu cited a source who has apparently seen an iphone box with the name iphone 16e on it. in addition, bloomberg's mark gurman believes that apple ceo tim cook's teaser post about a "new member of the family" being announced this wednesday suggests that the device will indeed have a new name. and last, there are several amazon listings for so-called iphone 16e cases, although that could be guesswork.
the device is rumored to feature a larger 6.1-inch oled display, face id, an a18 chip, a usb-c port, apple intelligence support, an apple-designed 5g modem, and more. apple should reveal pricing and a release date tomorrow.

aptoide has been around for quite some time as an app marketplace on android devices, but the company began working on an ios marketplace when apple added support for sideloading apps last year. the marketplace has been in testing in a beta capacity since june 2024, but it is now available to all eu users.
"this full launch marks a major milestone in game distribution on ios and aptoide's commitment to an open and unrestricted app distribution ecosystem. apple users now have access to newfound freedoms, but there's a huge amount of work still to be done to continue opening up ios globally and reduce friction for users, and game developers."
aptoide is a free alternative app store that's available on iphones and ipads for those who are located in the european union. it is unique among app marketplaces because it adds support for app versions, so users are able to install and play older versions of ios games.
the option to install older versions of games is useful on older iphones that can't run newer software updates, or for those who simply prefer an older version of a game. apptoide's game selection can be found on the aptoide website.

a render of the iphone 17 pro's alleged camera designin a note with investment firm gf securities, obtained by macrumors this week, apple supply chain analyst jeff pu said the iphone 17, iphone 17 air, iphone 17 pro, and iphone 17 pro max will all support up to 35w wired charging speeds.
last year, chargerlab found that the iphone 16 pro models achieved maximum sustained charging speeds of around 30w. in one image, the website showed the iphone 16 pro max reaching a peak charging speed of 37w with apple's 140w usb-c power adapter, but it is unclear how long the device kept charging at that speed.
phonearena saw similar results with the standard iphone 16. in its review last year, it said that device reached a peak charging speed of 38w when it was "under extremely heavy loads such as benchmark testing or playing games." the website said the iphone 16 achieved a sustained charging speed of closer to 20w.
all in all, with the iphone 16 and iphone 16 pro models already reaching peak wired charging speeds in the 35w range, it sounds like there will be no significant improvement to wired charging speeds with any of the iphone 17 models.
pu did not reveal wireless magsafe charging speeds for any iphone 17 models. iphone 16 models can charge at up to 25w with magsafe.
