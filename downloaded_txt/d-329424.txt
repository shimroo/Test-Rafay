bringing people together again

designed for simplicitya simple, intuitive design for a new era of entertainment









 

when designing amico, we had a vision - make gaming accessible again. our team has packed an incredible amount of features into a simple and affordable package. luckily, we didn’t have to start from scratch — the original intellivision system had many great features that served as inspiration for amico. modern technology, updated ergonomics, and a modern personality make for an entertainment system like no other.

“at intellivision, our mission is to use technology to bring family and friends back together by delivering simple, affordable, family-focused entertainment to everyone.” — tommy tallaricofounder

   











we strive for simplicity in everything we create — from our easy touchscreen, disc, and motion controls, to our effortless menus and games for all skill levels.

 











an amico system with two controllers and six installed games will retail for around $249 at launch — all additional games will be priced between $4.99 and $9.99 at launch. through our free android and ios app, mobile devices can be connected to amico for up to eight total players. 

 











every game on amico encourages group participation and teamwork through "couch co-op" style gameplay, while also offering single player modes. we are committed to offering products that parents feel confident about — all of our games have no graphic violence/blood, bad language, or sexual content, and are rated e or e10+. we also offer easy-to-use, positive-reinforcement parental controls. 

 











we want amico to be who you turn to on family game night — we offer a diverse, curated library of original titles, retro, party, educational, and table games, so everyone can join in. we also utilize our unique controllers and interactive lighting to create a gaming experience you can’t get anywhere else.
