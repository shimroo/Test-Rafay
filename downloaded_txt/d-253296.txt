eddie pryzbyla: the building's patron










                                                                edward j. pryzbyla graduated from the catholic university of america with a bachelor's degree in 1925 and was awarded an honorary doctoral degree in 1995. through the years, mr. pryzbyla made many significant contributions to the university, including hundreds of trees and plants, the pryzbyla plaza, the pryzbyla arbor, and over $10 million to support the construction of the edward j. pryzbyla university center. pryzbyla once remarked "i want you to promise to help me show the students and staff how to love and care for this campus as much as i do." eddie pryzbyla died in 2000, so did not get to see the building that bears his name (the pryz opened in march 2003). through his generosity and spirit, he left an enduring positive legacy to all those connected to the catholic university of america.
