welcome to martin black horsemanship
martin’s favorite place is deep in the rugged, sage filled, ranching country of the owyhee mountains. his innate ability to feel a horse’s footfall, rhythm and offer smooth transitions that become both effortless to horse and rider; building a strong foundation from the first saddling to high-level performance horses. whether dancing through lava rock or flying down the fence at the world’s greatest horseman, he will give you the opportunity to become the best you can be. he offers horsemanship clinics at select locations along with month long schools at home.
