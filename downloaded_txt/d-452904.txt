one hundred reasons to mourn the loss of ink on paper - from word weaves



on her blog, susan is creating a list of one hundred reasons to mourn the loss of ink on paper"i’m dedicating one post a week to the value of ink and paper books. my goal is 100 posts; 100 reasons they shine over e-books. my intention is not to trash e-books. i accept the digital future. but i don’t prefer e-readers and i mourn the downfall of print books. i only have 25 reasons on my list, so the quest is to grow that list. if you’d like to share your reasons, please leave them in comments. if yours is one i don’t have, i’ll use it and credit your name.  reason # 1.  paper books are physical treasures. when you pull them from your shelf to read again or to enjoy leafing through, you remember where you got them . . . ." (more) if you have a reason of your own, go to word weaves and add a comment.

kelly benjamin runs for city council



kelly benjamin is running for the district 6 seat on the tampa city council on a pragmatic, common sense platform based on neighborhood revitalization, small business support, and improved transit (including making seminole heights a station if the light rail proposal passes in november).he just filed on monday so he does not have a website up and running yet, but he will in the next week or so. he will be qualifying via petition again and canvasing all over seminole heights and west tampa in the coming weeks.although i'm not living in the area, i throw my support behind kelly benjamin. this is his second try for this office. he has a lot of interesting life and work experience since then and i think he will do a good job as a city council member.for more details read the creative loafing article  and tampabay.com  bay buzz blog

electric fence,barbed wire and razor new rules



an email i received from reader wendy who asked that i post this:> the new rules for installation of electric fences, barbed wire, and razor> wire are going before city council on thursday evening at 5:30 pm. the> proposed rule states that any business that can show they had criminal> activity on their property can be allowed to put in an electric fence,> barbed wire or razor.>> a more comprehensive proposal was put forward but, apparently, city council> did not put it forward.>> this ordinance will be sent to the planning commission as it is written> unless we can get city council to either> a) continue this to allow public input or> b) modify this.>> the proposed verbiage that was set forth originally but was not approved> was:>> a variance can be had allowing an electric fence, razor wire, or barbed wire> if the applicant can:>> "1) provide documented police reports that clearly demonstrate criminal> activity occurred at the property during the two years prior to the variance> request, reports of false alarms cannot be used to demonstrate a> significant security need.>> 2) provide evidence that, at the time the criminal activity occurred other> means of security protection devices were installed and in proper operating> condition. other means of security protection devices include, but are not> limited to, alarm systems, guard dogs, security personnel, and/or adequate> chain link or sold wall fencing, when allowed.>> in applying the variance criteria, the verb,, arc, or blc shall balance the> applicant's need for the variance with the visual impact to the surrounding> community. the purpose of the provision is to ensure that any use of> electric fencing barbed wire or razor wire should be used only as the> extreme last resort of property protection.">> based on what is currently being proposed, any business that is broken into> can get a variance for barbed wire, razor wire or an electric fence.>> if you cannot attend thursday night, please send an email to> tampacitycouncil@tampagov.net asking them to change the ordinance as> originally proposed. if ou want to send me your email, i will read it into> the record.>> the more people that show up, the greater the impact.>> thank you,>> susan long

pitbull bans



this week in the mutt report i focused on pitbull bans.   the st. petersburg times had a recent article on the topic.“for the past three years, edna elijah has carried a baseball bat when she walks because her neighbors have been attacked by dogs. once, she had a run-in with a dog “that looked like a pit bull.”   she wasn’t injured, but her words resonated with the right people. so recently, legislators in tallahassee have been considering a bill to regulate dogs by breed . . .the bill proposed by rep. perry thurston, d-plantation, passed a senate committee last month. it would not outright ban any breed, but it would give communities the ability to require muzzling, neutering or additional insurance for certain dogs, measures that critics say would have the same effect as a ban.” (more)

dog dies at curtis hixon dog park



on my mutt report blog i write about how a 1o pound shih tzu was killed at the new curtis hixon dog run   it is so small there is no way to separate the big and small dogs.  seminole heights has a dog run at frierson and 12th st., just south of hillsborough, in se seminole heights.  it also is too small for dogs to be separated.  i wonder if there have been any negative  encounters there?
