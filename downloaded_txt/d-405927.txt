  "...the nobility of a
paladin in the form of a web page." 
- wired
geekdad

first time here? visit the faq
page to find out what all of
this is about
    





















please read: a message from w.j.walton about the future of the sitewelcome
to the escapist, a web page
devoted to the betterment of role-playing games and the education of
the public and media of their benefits to society. 
tabletop role-playing
games like dungeons & dragons are an
engaging and intellectually stimulating activity that promote teamwork,
problem solving, and creative thinking. even better, in hands of a
parent, guardian, or educator, they can be a fantastic teaching tool.

on
this site you will find:

 information on what
role-playing games
(rpgs) are and how they are played (see the faq pages),
how to get involved in the hobby (see
the square one
podcast), and how to get kids involved, too (see the young person's
adventure league project).
 information on what
role-playing games
aren't - the history
behind the urban myths surrounding rpgs like dungeons
& dragons.
 articles, information, and
links on
how rpgs can be beneficial to players, including using rpgs to teach
and build social and problem-solving skills (see the reading, writing,
& roleplaying project)
 information on getting gamers
and game companies involved in charity work and other philanthropic
pursuits (see the bequest
project) 
 features on the gamers
themselves (tell
me about your
character), and gaming media (the escapist video
movie review report).
 the occasional bit of humor,
such as
the time when i attempted
to prove that dungeons & dragons spells
aren't real

the escapistcast is
sadly no more,
due to lack of time to properly maintain it. it was great fun while it
lasted, and i may find the time to fire it up again someday. thanks
to all who listened and participated!

the
escapist forum

due to the popularity of social media, i've decided to shut down the
official forum and instead let the conversations happen there. for
those who would like to particpate, you can follow the escapist on
twitter (@rpgadvocate),
facebook (facebook.com/rpgadvocate)
and google+ (the
escapist)



the escapist wiki includes
sections on roleplaying in education and the kid-friendly game finder,
a database of game stores, clubs, and groups that offer kid-friendly
roleplaying.


a r c h i v e

the escapist archive is
a collection of the articles that have been gathered on
the site over the years - articles on roleplaying in popular
culture, in schools, in the military and government, and positive and
negative pieces about the hobby.

resources


the resources page
includes links to informative articles and pages on studies about
roleplaying games, how to handle reporters and game stories in the
media, and even some handouts that summarize roleplaying advocacy.


features


these are the sorts of things that go on around here all the time.







random
encounter - musings on roleplaying games,
life, and how the two don't mix. 



tell me about your
character - interviews with average, everyday,
extraordinary gamers. have you submitted yours yet?





20
sided world - a column on gaming culture from
different parts of the world.





the escapist video
movie review report - reviews
of rpg-related visual media - films, television shows, etc. this
feature is about to undergo some changes, including a new title, so
watch for it!





projects

these
are the ongoing advocacy projects at the escapist






bequest is a
project aimed at getting gamers involved
in charitable efforts - making donations, organizing drives,
volunteering time, giving of themselves. in short, making a difference.
giving of yourself builds character, it aids those in need, and it
shows the world that gamers are good people. it's a three-way victory.





the
young person's adventure league is a project aimed at
getting future generations interested in roleplaying, with suggestions
on the best rpgs to play with kids and tips on keeping the adventures
fun, engaging, and sometimes even educational.





reading,
writing, and roleplaying is a project devoted to using
roleplaying games as an educational tool in the classroom or even at
home.



terra
libris is a project that focuses on role-playing games
as a library activity, to encourage reading, research, socialization,
and library skills.





square
one is a gaming podcast hosted by sam chupp of the bear's grove
and bill walton of the escapist, that focuses on tips and suggestions
for new players interested in the role-playing hobby.

square one is currently on indefinite hiatus. 



read an rpg book
in public week
is a thrice-annual event aimed at making the hobby more visible,
increasing public understanding, and possibly even attracting new
participants.
