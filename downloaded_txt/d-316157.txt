after dark sizzles in san diego with fancy dance clubs and nightspots, cultural happenings, casino action, and bars galore -- from beach bars to piano bars,  sports bars, dive bars, and just plain neighborhood bars. weekends are especially hot. most cultural happenings -- symphony, theater, and opera  unfold downtown. coffeehouse culture, with music at night, is also big. at the nearby gaslamp quarter, martini bars and upscale dance clubs abound, including the three-story stingaree restaurant and nightclub with waterfalls and translucent floating staircases leading to a rooftop bar. dance clubs and bars of pacific beach and mission beach attract a more casual, typically younger crowd. bikers hang out at ocean beach to soak up reggae and grateful dead-style jam bands. san diego's gay and lesbian community hangs out uptown. san diego's music scene rocks, dominated by hard rock, alternative rock, and indie rock. thanks to state law, alcoholic beverages aren't sold after 2 a.m.
