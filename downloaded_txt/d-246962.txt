the hudson woods collection



the hudson woods pantry & credenza were designed in partnership with lang architecture to complement the hudson woods homes.the hallmark of both pieces is a slender, slatted wood front. the ridges of wood create a subtle striation that enhances the color and character of the material. the drawers, with cutouts rather than pulls, are reminiscent of classic drawer styles in libraries or schoolhouses. leather loop pulls and warm brass fixtures elegantly contrast the wood. the collection has a timeless yet modern design language appropriate for any setting.
