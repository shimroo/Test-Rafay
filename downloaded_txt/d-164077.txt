to bring the transforming hope of jesus to livingston county and the world
we elevate one name. we talk with god first. we passionately delight in god. we do more by doing less. we were given to give. we tremble before god’s word. we are in this together. we fight for people. we start now. and above it’s always - ever - only about jesus.

we know going to a new church for the first time can be daunting at first. this is why we want to do everything we can to make you feel right at home. we’ll meet you out in the parking lot just to say hello, help get your kids out of the car if needed, and make sure you know right where to go. our connection team will be with you every step of the way!
