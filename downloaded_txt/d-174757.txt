            "great time at iron buffalo, we got over 25 miles of practice in two days and a good class size for learning. chadwick and doug were a great    odd couple    pairing and provided concise feedback. my girlfriend and i decided after the class were more comfortable continuing our learning on dirt bikes before moving to the road, partially due to the instructors focus that the basic class is just an intro class and not    the    motorcycle training course..."

            "i took the trike training class. the classroom part was a 3 hour zoom class. this was great, because it made our on the bike training day shorter and more fun. the class was small which was great to have better attention from the instructor. lot's of good information and training. i highly recommend taking this class if you are going to ride a trike of any brand."
