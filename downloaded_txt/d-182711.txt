daniel - the miracle beagle


daniel's story

"on oct. 3, 2011, i was put into a gas 
			chamber in florence, alabama along with 17 other stray dogs. carbon 
			monoxide was pumped into the chamber. when officials returned later 
			and opened the door, i walked out.
i was dubbed a miracle dog, weighed about 
			20 pounds.
i was set for a new life in new jersey, 
			courtesy of eleventh hour rescue. the group is dedicated to saving 
			pooches from death row in high-kill shelters.
once i was gifted my life back, i met some 
			very nice people. they all treated me so well and showered me with 
			love. i did want to know if i would end up in a forever home. my 
			foster parents, arranged for me to meet and greet a family in 
			nutley, new jersey. i had never heard of this town since i was new 
			to the area. our first meeting was on oct. 30, after a 
			significant snowstorm...."

			nutley notables: the men and women who made a memorable impact on our home town, nutley, new jersey


by anthony buccino






			the township of nutley, new jersey, accumulated a wealth of 
			celebrated and eccentric people who over-shadowed the 
			salt-of-the-earth folks who lived here, raised their families and 
			built the town into the place that norman rockwell only dreamed of 
			illustrating for the cover of the saturday evening post. this new 
			book profile nearly 200 town folks, some you may know and many you 
			will not forget.    


			 our nutley notables include old west sharpshooter annie oakley who 
			has a street here named in her honor; home-diva martha stewart who 
			grew up on elm place and often writes of growing up in nutley but 
			has no street named for her; and others who may have to wait a while 
			for street naming honors.


			featured individuals run the gamut from politicians to high school 
			coaches and athletes; from notorious personalities to beloved 
			entertainers to the fellow in the local shop to the artists and 
			writers who toiled long ago and today. their images and stories 
			document the unique contributions they've made that shaped nutley 
			today.


			even the most ardent nutley historian will find new surprises in 
			this collection.


			the author thanks the nutley historical society and the nutley free 
			public library for allowing access to their vast archives and 
			experts in compiling this first volume of nutley notables.


			available on
			
			amazon

			times past, you'll enjoy buccino's essay collection.
