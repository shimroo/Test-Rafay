recent testimonial "    in 2002 i moved from clayton, ny leaving behind a 4-bedroom farmhouse, a 54x30 size pole barn and 9 antique vehicles. over the past 22 years i was unable to properly maintain the property, and as a result both the house and vehicles entered into a metamorphosis state of dilapidation due to age and weather-related neglect. after careful consideration i decided to list the property for sale, however i was also faced with the momentous task of selling 9 antique vehicles in various states of disarray. with little hope in selling the old farmhouse and 9 antique vehicles, i felt dishearten, despaired and trapped. then i learned about auction sales researched the best auctioneers from binghamton, ny to the thousand island region. as a result, i learned about brzostek's real estate auction company. i did an extensive review of the company and derived at the conclusion brzostek's real estate auction is in fact the best auctioneer to sell both real estate and vehicles in central and northern new york. (full disclosure; i'm a retired law enforcement officer at the state level, and i did my due diligence in vetting brzostek's real estate auction co).  i called brzostek's real estate auction co in 2023 and talked with the owner mr. bernard j. brzostek (professional auctioneer and licensed real estate broker). i informed mr. brzostek about my old farmhouse and vehicles. i further added to the chaos by advising him that i live in the state of north carolina. mr. brzostek took the time to truly educate me on the benefits of auctioning and helped me immensely with all of the associated paperwork. in fact, mr. brzostek made a trip to my home in north carolina to pick up pertinent documents that i would not send thru any carrier. after the document phase mr. brzostek worked with the lawyers and others to bring this auction to fruition.  on sunday, july 28, 2024, a successful auction was conducted, and the property along with all 9 vehicles were sold without any issues. mr. brzostek did an outstanding job in selling the house, property, vehicles and other items at the auction. additionally, his wife played a vital role in the success of the auction as well. in conclusion, i'm truly grateful and thankful to the brzostek family and brzostek's real estate auction company for their kindness, professionalism and top-notch skills.
