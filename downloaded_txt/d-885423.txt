i have a new home!





well, i've been thinking about this for a long time, a very long time actually, but neoknits finally has a new home!  after a little push from connie (and her beautiful new site) i decided i had procrastinated enough.  it was time!my new home will make it easier for me to share my thoughts and designs.  the limits of blogger are no more!  my patterns now have their own little neat corner so it's easier to browse rather than my overly crowded sidebar.  it will also be easier to interact with my readers.  if you've used blogger, you know the comment function doesn't make it so easy to respond to questions or even to just say thanks for the compliment.   so come on over to neoknits.com and check out the new space and don't forget to change my rss feed in your blog reader!

interweave knits winter preview





the interweave knits winter preview is up!  check out my newest design - deep texture tunic.this design started out as one of 5 designs for my knitscene collection, but i only needed 4.  so this one was odd man out - for the moment.  the editor still thought it had potential so it was passed over to the interweave team for review, and made the cut for winter. this is my first design knit totally in the round and i have to admit, i kinda liked it.  not having to seam up a really woolly, warm sweater in 98 degree heat was kind of a plus.  thankfully ik knitters will have a shot at this one in the correct season.

florida and how i met barbara walker





my next stop after rhinebeck was southwest florida to visit with my grandmother.  it was so warm and relaxing, i didn't really want to come home!  and yes, if you must know, there was knitting happening by the pool.the visit seemed so short, but i manage to pack in a decent amount of activities plus have time to relax. on the first day, we took a trip up to the marie selby gardens.  i am a big fan of orchids, and it certainly did not disappoint.on the way back, i wanted to do a little yarn shop exploring and i found a wonderful shop called a good yarn.  susan, amy and crew were so welcoming it was definitely my lys away from home - so much so that i ended up coming back for knit night on thursday and stopped in one final time on friday before heading home.  they have only been open for 6 weeks and the selection was wonderful: madelintosh, schaefer, rowan, malabrigo......i could go on and on!  i didn't come back with any yarn (darn deadline projects), but i did manage to pick up wenlan chia's new book twinkle sews and a pretty cheap project bag.and here's where the story gets very interesting - and don't mind my fan girl gushing.  when visiting a good yarn, i had found out that i had just missed.....ready for this......barbara walker!  yes, the treasury of knitting patterns barbara walker!  i couldn't believe it!  how could i have been so close to meeting one of the knitting greats and it got away from me?  as we were talking about it, my grandmother realized that this must be the same woman that her neighbor knows and had told her about a year or two before, she just could never remember her name.when we returned home, a few phone calls were made and sure enough, her neighbor did know barbara and just like that, i had a meeting set up to meet her on friday at her home.   i can't even pretend that i was cool, calm and collected when i heard the news.  i was jumping up and down, twittering the news, smiling from ear to ear.  i know you guys understand!on friday, i met barbara walker and got to see a small portion of her doll collection, actual knitted pieces from some of her books, pictures of her published designs, and sweaters she had knitted for herself, family and friends.  she has knit so many beautiful sweaters  over the years and many were sparkly.  i was in such a state of sensory overload, i wish i had asked more questions, but we briefly talked about magazines not giving credit to the designers in the past and how the pay scale hasn't really changed much.  she also talked about how she has created some 1,000 original stitches never seen before.next, she showed me a book shelf filled with books she's written, books that she wrote that have been translated into other languages, and books she has contributed to.  besides her knitting books, she has also written several feminist books.  i also got to see her tarot and i ching decks which she had done the artwork for and her extensive mineral collection.  barbara walker is quite the amazing woman and i feel so lucky to have had the chance to have a short visit with her.so i celebrated my birthday, saw some great sunsets, ate good food and met barbara walker.  i don't know how i'll ever top this one!

my rhinebeck recap





i know it's a little late, but you can never have too much rhinebeck talk, right?  just got back from florida and finally have a little time to catch up with things!i didn't really have much of a plan this year, just wanted to have fun and hopefully purchase some great stuff.  however, when i heard that clara parks was signing copies of her new book, the knitters book of wool, i knew spirit trail fiberworks would be my first stop.  i really enjoyed clara's first book, and i knew this one would not disappoint.  in fact, i haven't even had a chance to peek inside yet - must set aside some time asap!before going over to meet clara, we arrived at the festival just in time for the lunchtime ravelry meetup and to meet bob.  ysolda whipped this up just a few days before.  so amazing!  i was also so surprised to see maritza at the meetup too.  we've missed her so much at our weekly lic knitting group and it was so nice to get to chat for a few minutes.my only yarn purchase of the day came from alicia adams alpaca.  i got 3 gorgeous balls of a  suri alpaca/merino blend in a heather grey color - my color of the moment apparently.i also scored a cool new tea mug hand thrown and hand painted by jennie lanners.  she had some very cute mugs with sheep wearing socks and things, but the leafy one called to me.  maybe i'll pick up a sheep one next year.after the festival, colette, gwen, sonia and i were off to the ravelry party and to meet up with the rest of the astoria crew.  i was worried that it would be a little chilly, but all was well.  i didn't even have to break into the toe or hand warmers. the ravelry crewkimberly and i rock our bliss shawlettesthis rhinebeck trip was definitely the best ever!  i got to meet so many wonderful knitters and relax with friends.  i can't wait til next year!and last but not least, i leave you with a dose of cuteness.
