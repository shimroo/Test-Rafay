a step beyond 



st peter's school is the only school in barcelona that offers the ib continuum in english from 3 to 18 years old
 



we are the only school in catalonia with a science laboratory for children from 0 to 6 years old, the first to introduce subjects such as blockchain, nanoscience, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence in its curriculum, and the only school in barcelona to offer the ib continuum in english across all stages: nursery, primary, middle years and diploma program. at st peter's school barcelona, we prepare our pupils to face the different challenges they will encounter. for this purpose, we seek to nurture critical and open-minded thinkers, who are prepared to live, study and work wherever they desire.
