morning thoughts






i wake up and pour some high octane espresso down my throat. as i check my email and newsgroups i see business as usual old stuff: fema deficiency, intolerable debasement on the neighborhood/state/government level, and a couple of more organizations opening here in n.o. i just about feel as if i'm perusing a kurt vonnegut novel.

reality here has been supplanted with surreality. to quote the cheshire cat in carroll's alice in wonderland, "we're all frantic here." everyone that is here in the city has been contaminated by the weird mental unease that accompanies living in the wake of katrina. numerous individuals are existing in homes that are without force and/or part of the way crushed, a lot of people more are setting up loved ones who are all of a sudden jobless and homeless. all are somewhat stunned and befuddled. it is similar to nothing i have ever experienced.

uptown is an island amidst an ocean of mayham. it is genuinely unusual to surmise that piles of can't, exhaust streetcar tracks, and the various points of interest of post-k life are the "new typicality," as well as boundlessly better than neighborhoods just a couple of squares or miles away. a couple of pieces on the opposite side of st charles avenue it goes totally dim. no force, streetlights, or anything. yet i know individuals living there, outdoors in their homes utilizing generators for high temperature and refridgeration (on the off chance that they have a working ice chest which is uncommon). a couple of minutes away lies the aggregate obliteration of lakeview and the lower 9. an outing into those zones is an aggravating and terrifying thing.

things around us gradually ressucitate, consistently new organizations open (now its just a normal of four pieces between open organizations! for a precise posting of nearby places that are presently open go to http://www.quartercrawl.com ) the crescent city has turned into the new boondocks. having an inclination that an old west boomtown, and a semi-possessed demolish new orleans should most likely win the strangest city in the us title!

with one and only prominent exemption everybody i know is constantly positive and is designed up for the new period. while trauma of shifting degrees undermines one's mental soundness we all are adapting. the technicalities of pre-k have been put aside as everybody tries to discover their feet in the new orleans. the populace that is here comprises of the individuals who are dead set not to let the city kick the bucket, regardless of how hard the administrative structures attempt to slaughter us with clumsiness and disregard. there is a commeraderie i have never seen previously among those of us that are back, and there are additionally arriving consistently. it is my fondest trust that this inclination proceeds as far as might be feasible.

humidity










absolute humidity is an amount of water vapor, usually
discussed per unit volume. the mass of water vapor,per unit volume of total air
and water vapor mixture, can be expressed as follows:



absolute humidity in air ranges from zero to roughly 30 grams
per cubic meter when the air is saturated at 30 °c. the absolute humidity
changes as air temperature or pressure changes. this is very inconvenient for
chemical engineering calculations, e.g. for clothes dryers, where temperature
can vary considerably. as a result, absolute humidity is generally defined in
chemical engineering as mass of water vapor per unit mass of dry air, also
known as the mass mixing ratio, which is much more rigorous for heat and mass
balance calculations. mass of water per unit volume as in the equation above
would then be defined as volumetric humidity. because of the potential
confusion, british standard bs 1339 suggests avoiding the term "absolute
humidity". units should always be carefully checked. most humidity charts
are given in g/kg or kg/kg, but any mass units may be used.

amaryllidaceae







amaryllidaceae are a family of herbaceous, perennial and bulbous flowering plants included in the monocot order asparagales. the family takes its name from the genus amaryllis, hence the common name of the amaryllis family.

there have been widely differing views as to the limits of the family. the most recent apg classification (apg iii takes a broad view of the amaryllidaceae, which then has three subfamilies, the agapanthoideae (the old agapanthaceae family), the allioideae (the old alliaceae family) and the amaryllidoideae (the old amaryllidaceae family). with this definition, the family includes about 75 genera and 1600 species.
plants have rather fleshy and two-ranked leaves and flowers typically arranged in umbels at the apex of leafless flowering stems, or scapes. the agapanthoideae have superior ovaries, as do the allioideae, the onion subfamily. the allioideae produce allyl sulfide compounds which give them their characteristic smell. the amaryllidoideae have inferior ovaries.

humidity





humidity is a term for the amount of water vapor in the air, and can refer to any one of several measurements of humidity. formally, humid air is not "moist air" but a mixture of water vapor and other constituents of air, and humidity is defined in terms of the water content of this mixture, called the absolute humidity. in everyday usage, it commonly refers to relative humidity, expressed as a percent in weather forecasts and on household humidistats; it is so called because it measures the current absolute humidity relative to the maximum. specific humidity is a ratio of the water vapor content of the mixture to the total air content (on a mass basis). the water vapor content of the mixture can be measured either as mass per volume or as a partial pressure, depending on the usage.

in meteorology, humidity indicates the likelihood of precipitation, dew, or fog. high relative humidity reduces the effectiveness of sweating in cooling the body by reducing the rate of evaporation of moisture from the skin. this effect is calculated in a heat index table, used during summer weather.

ny steps up again

greater new orleans area musicians and music industry-related
enterprises

applications available at www.foundationsforrecovery.org.

new york, ny november 1, 2005: the higher ground hurricane relief fund,
established by jazz at lincoln center and administered through the
baton rouge area foundation, announces grants for musicians and music
industry-related enterprises from the greater new orleans area.
individuals and organizations affected by hurricane katrina can
download applications and review eligibility requirements at
www.foundationsforrecovery.org. the deadline to receive submissions is
november 7, 2005.

grants for individuals will be made up to $15,000, with priority given
to professional jazz musicians. grants up to $100,000 will be issued to
nonprofit organizations, with priority given to music-related
institutions. applications are subject to deadlines.

derek e. gordon, president and ceo of jazz at lincoln center commented,
"the focus of the fund will be to help those individuals and families
evacuated from the greater new orleans area as they address immediate
concerns related to housing, food, education, health care and basic
survival necessities. the fund will also provide resources to assist
individuals over time to rebuild their homes and livelihoods."

the higher ground hurricane relief benefit concert, held on september
17th, was produced by jazz at lincoln center and telecast live on the
emmy award-winning pbs series "live from lincoln center." the event
included performances by an array of musicians and entertainers and
raised funds for disaster relief by encouraging viewers to make
donations to the higher ground hurricane relief fund. to date, over $2
million has been raised. all proceeds from blue note records' higher
ground benefit cd will also benefit the fund. find out more about this
event at www.jalc.org.

the baton rouge area foundation is a community foundation, a nonprofit
organization composed of over 300 charitable funds with over $375
million in assets established by individuals, families, corporations
and organizations. since 1964, the foundation has made grants in the
areas of arts & humanities, community development, education,
environment, human services, medical/health, religion and scholarships.
