“it amazes me as to how dynamic he is
                  and his products are.”
"brian tracy is without a shadow of doubt a world class legend! i have been
                  studying his material for years now and it amazes me as to how dynamic he is and his products are... he has
                  material on business, sales, confidence, setting goals, time management and other less well known subjects
                  like 'accelerated learning techniques'. he is also a former black belt in karate... and will always be one
                  of my favourite motivational speakers of all time."
- bhavin shah
