welcome
    to my cloth doll gallery. i'm deanna hogan, cloth doll maker and designer. i
    began making cloth dolls in the mid to late 90s, after discovering the amazing things
    being done by other doll artists!   
 
i became a member of odaca - the original doll artist council
    of america in 2006. odaca's objectives are to promote original artists and
    their work, to achieve and maintain a high quality of handmade doll making, and to educate
    collectors and the public about original artist dolls.
