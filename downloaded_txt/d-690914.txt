advancing the ability of all motorcycle riders









                    register now














montana motorcycle rider safety (mmrs) became montana's official motorcycle training school in 1989 as a part of the montana office of public instruction in helena.

we are here to provide different levels of motorcycle skills training at several locations throughout the state of montana. every year approximately 1500 new and experienced riders learn how to safely operate motorcycles through mmrs courses.

the courses offered by mmrs are designed to advance the ability of all riders. our first course, the basic ridercoursesm (brc), is specifically designed for novice or beginning riders. this is an entry-level, learn-to-ride class that consists of at least 15 (5 classroom & 10 riding) hours of formal classroom activities and on-cycle riding exercises.






























the next level, our basic ridercoursesm 2 (brc2), is a class for someone who rode a few years back, or has been riding on their own and wants to enhance their riding ability and get their motorcycle endorsement.

for seasoned riders with the need to improve their skills and take their riding ability to another level, we have the advanced ridercoursesm (arc). this course consists of activities that emphasize personal risk management and self-assessment strategies, and on-cycle exercises with emphasis in cornering, braking, and swerving.
