        academic integrity
    
dalhousie university expects all students to be responsible learners, demonstrating honesty, trust, fairness, and respect.

‘the expectation that teachers, students, researchers, and all members of the academic community act with: honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility.’

what does academic integrity mean for students?







each class you take, exam you write and assignment you complete will have different rules depending on the instructor. 




but no matter what you are required to do to earn your degree, dalhousie university expects all students to be responsible learners, which means that you will complete assignments yourself and acknowledge sources of information and ideas when they are not your own, among other things. 
the statement on intellectual honesty is dalhousie's main academic integrity policy for students and includes definitions of types of academic offences and penalties.
