mr. watkins letters to  the parole board
case file: felix brown 

age: 66 
incarcerated: grafton correctional institution 
parole hearing: february 2025
			  repeat violent offender: fifth parole hearing since 2013 
sentence: given 18-year to life prison sentence in october 1995, by then trumbull county judge mitchell f. shaker after being convicted of charges of murder and having weapon while under disability. 
brown was convicted of killing his girlfriend monica brandon on feb. 24, 1995, by shooting her in the forehead with a gun he kept near the headboard of the bed of his niles apartment. brown had claimed the shot was fired as an accident during an argument. prosecutors stated brown shot brandon deliberately because he was angry she was dating other men. brown admitted during the trial that he lied when telling a 911 dispatcher that robbers had killed brandon. 
brown was previously in prison in 1981 for breaking and entering, went back to prison in 1983 for receiving stolen property and forgery and again in 1994, brown was sentenced to prison for drug possession and drug trafficking positions. 
prosecutor dennis watkins said brown suffers from a condition known as ârevolving door syndrome. being released some four times and yet went back again and again after committing more crimes.â			  
quote: âthis man (now at age 66) would surely be a danger to the community. and at the same time, we know he doesnât mind going back to prison, which only increases the risk.â
                                                                                                                   -- prosecutor dennis watkins, in a 2018 letter to the state parole board, opposing brownâs release from prison			  
throughout the years, family members of victim monica brandon have opposed brownâs release on parole. additionally, the latest report from odrc states his current risk score -- after 30 years in prison -- is moderate. 
âsurely, public safety should require his (brownâs) continued incarceration,â watkins states.

two trumbull county viiolent offenders denied parole
the ohio adult parole authority has extended the prison stays of two violent offenders from trumbull county, who have been imprisoned for a total of 73 years.
jenna maze, administrative assistant for the victim/witness division of the trumbull county prosecutor’s office, learned on jan. 21 that bids for parole have been denied for both van gentry fickes, 60, and david owens, 59.
fickes, photo at left, who is serving a 30-year-to-life prison sentence for conviction of two counts of murder, has been extended until at least october 2029, while owens, photo at right, who is serving four life sentences for convictions of rape, has been extended by the parole board until at least october 2027.
prosecuting attorney dennis watkins said he is very pleased with the decisions, saying the victims and family members of these crimes -- and the public in general -- will be safe. in his opinion, the release of these offenders, based on their histories, would present “a clear and present danger to the public.”
in letters objecting to his possible parole, watkins wrote that owens has “a disgusting sexual appetite for children under age 13” and has shown continued bad conduct with dozens of prison rule infractions, including drug use, fights, threats, destruction of property and the stalking and threatening of a female corrections officer.
by age 27, owens had been a repeat violent offender some 17 different times between 1985 and 1988 before getting a six-month prison sentence for two counts of forgery and one count of receiving stolen property. in 1992, he was arrested by warren police for multiple counts of rape and kidnapping, involving four female victims ages 9,9, 8 and 5.
at a 1985 jury trial before the honorable judge david f. mclain, fickes was convicted in the 1983 violent slayings of christine and ronald fickes -- his mother and brother -- who were killed by shotgun blasts. the murders were committed while fickes was on probation for attempted breaking and entering convictions. in his letter to the parole board, watkins called fickes “truly devoid of conscience.”
watkins and his assistant prosecutor and former common pleas judge peter kontos tried the case for the state.

maximillian bell denied parole, eligible again in â28

 
inmate maximillian bell, who was given a 12- to 50-year prison sentence by trumbull county judge andrew d. logan in november 1996, had his bid for parole rejected by the ohio adult parole authority and will remain in richland correctional institution.
 mary jo hoso, victim/witness coordinator for the trumbull county prosecutorâs officer, learned of the parole boardâs action on wednesday, sept. 18, 2024.
 according to the ohio department of rehabilitation and corrections website, bellâs next bid for parole will occur in august 2028.			  
trumbull county prosecuting attorney dennis watkins was pleased with the decision of the board. in recent letters to the board, watkins stated bell remainsdangerous to society and is a sociopath and would not obey the laws and rules of parole if released. 
bell was convicted in 1996 of charges of involuntary manslaughter, kidnapping and aggravated robbery in the death of mark heltzel of warren. at the time, he was a juvenile and was bound over by the juvenile court for adult prosecution.			  
this was bellâs fourth request of parole.			  
according to watkins, bellâs involvement with the ohio department of rehabilitation and correction over many years has not appeared to modify or improve the behavior he established as a juvenile. according to an institution report summary dated nov. 7, 2022, bellâs infraction involved performing a lewd act with his private part while looking at two correction officers âas if he was stalking the officers like a predator.â he was charged with rule violations involving seductive or obscene acts, indecent exposure, exhibitionistic masturbation.

mr. watkins letters to  the parole board
case file: martin a. petersime 
petersime denied parole until may 2027

 
age: 70
incarcerated: grafton  correctional institution
repeat offender: fifth  parole from prison request
sentence: given 12  -to 40-year sentence on 1992 convictions of 20 sex counts including rape,  pandering obscenity involving minors, minor in nudity material, pandering sex  material involving minors, corrupting minors, disseminating sexual material to  minors

mary jo hoso, administrator of our victim/witness division, informed prosecutor watkins of the parole board decision on wednesday, august 14, 2024, that repeat violent offender and child rapist martin petersime has been denied parole until at least may 2027.
thankful for this action, the prosecutor’s office also notes that the ohio parole board has repeatedly turned down petersime’s release on parole. petersime, 70, has now served 32 years in prison, most recently in grafton correctional institution.
“the children of ohio and elsewhere are safe with this chronic child sexual predator in prison,” said prosecutor dennis watkins.
petersime had a parole hearing in july 2024, his fifth after being given a 12 -to 40-year sentence on 1992 convictions of 20 separate felony sex offenses involving at least six different minors, including rape, pandering obscenity and sexual materials involving minors, minors in nudity material, corrupting minors, and disseminating sexual material to minors.
“without a doubt to know martin petersime is to know the consummate child sexual predator lurking among us,” prosecutor watkins has written in letters to the parole board opposing his release. “from the petersime criminal history, â¦ (he) has been the ‘traveling pedophile’ going from piqua, ohio, to cleveland, ohio, and to warren, ohio.”
court and police records showed some of petersime’s young male victims were taking music lessons at his downtown warren music center, while others were hired to clean up or were enticed there with marijuana that petersime admitted he kept handy for that reason. none of the victims were named during the highly publicized criminal case, except the one who turned in the music teacher on april 28, 1992, by going to the warren police department with a pornographic videotape made at the music store by petersime trying to entice a child to perform sexual acts while dancing to the rock music of van halen.
even after spending many years in prison and given numerous rehabilitative programs, petersime was caught by prison officials downloading pornography and committing lewd sexual acts. (see attached letters in opposition)

mr. watkins letter to  the parole board

update, august 5, 2024
terrance stargell is denied parole


 
age: 55
incarcerated: chillicothe  correctional institution
parole  hearing: june 2024 
repeat offender: sixth  parole from prison request
sentence: given 15  -to 70-year sentence on 1987 convictions of rape, felonious assault, aggravated  burglary, and gross sexual imposition
crime: broke  into sw warren home of 62-year-old woman, who was speech impaired, stabbed her  dog, then bound her and repeatedly raped her while accomplice removed items  from her home. 
          prosecutor watkins is pleased to announce today that his office has been informed by the ohio adult parole authority that convicted sexual offender and predator terrance stargell, shown at left, has been denied parole and will not be considered again by the state parole board until an april 2027 hearing.
the prosecutor’s office, along with the victim and her family, have repeatedly opposed stargell’s release since his 1987 convictions by a trumbull county jury for rape, felonious assault, aggravated burglary, and gross sexual imposition
stargell was given a prison sentence of 15 to 70 years by then common pleas judge mitchell f. shaker for breaking into the southwest warren home of a 62-year-old woman, who was speech-impaired. he stabbed her dog to death, before attacking and repeatedly raping the victim.
in mr. watkins’ long tenure in office, the prosecutor said “stargell’s vicious crimes against an elderly disabled homeowner is beyond belief and can only be viewed as acts of a domestic terrorist.”
“the facts speak for themselves,” watkins said.
in his letter to the parole board, watkins wrote that stargell on new year’s eve 1986 burglarized the loveless avenue home of the disabled retiree who was living alone. he stayed in the home terrorizing her for approximately six hours, including stabbing her pet dog “boo” many times, even going under the kitchen table after the dog. stargell then tied the woman’s hands with black nylon socks and hit her four or five times in the face, knocking off her glasses.
he then tied her feet with the brown twine from the woman’s hanging baskets and then struck her more times before raping her in all her cavities. afterward, stargell put the woman on her couch and gagged her mouth with the white socks she was wearing. then he ransacked the home with a female accomplice stealing many personal items including two televisions, a clock radio, four table lamps, a sweeper, an iron, jewelry, purses, personal medication, cash, and even her id card (as if her existence had no meaning to him).
“it’s remarkable that any human being could be so vicious and cruel to an innocent and helpless elderly person he did not even know,” watkins wrote.
stargell, 55, will now remain incarcerated in chillicothe correctional institution for at least three more years.
