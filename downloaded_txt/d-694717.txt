каково влияние циклической нагрузки на прочность опорных подшипников на сжатие?

posted on january 23, 2025 9:22 am by darryl myers  comment 

циклические нагрузки оказывают значительное влияние на прочность и долговечность опорных подшипников при сжатии. 
вот основные механизмы, посредством которых циклические нагрузки могут снижать прочность подшипников:

усталость материалов:

постоянное циклическое изменение сжимающих нагрузок вызывает усталость материалов, из которых изготовлены компоненты подшипника.
это может приводить к появлению микротрещин, раскалыванию, отслаиванию поверхностных слоев и в конечном итоге разрушению 1118 2902840 подшипника.


накопление повреждений:

каждый цикл нагрузки/разгрузки вызывает небольшие необратимые деформации и повреждения в структуре материала.
с течением времени и множеством циклов эти накопленные повреждения ослабляют материал, снижая его общую прочность на сжатие.


износ и деградация смазочных материалов:

циклические нагрузки могут приводить к быстрому износу и деградации смазочных материалов в подшипнике.
ухудшение смазывающих свойств увеличивает трение и контактные напряжения, что ускоряет разрушение подшипника.


изменение геометрии и зазоров:

повторяющиеся циклические нагрузки могут вызывать пластические деформации отдельных компонентов подшипника.
это приводит к изменению геометрии, зазоров и посадок, нарушая равномерное распределение нагрузки и снижая общую прочность.


резонансные явления:

если частота циклических нагрузок совпадает с собственной частотой колебаний подшипника, может возникать резонанс, значительно увеличивающий амплитуду нагрузок.
это крайне нежелательно и может быстро разрушить подшипник.



для повышения прочности опорных подшипников, работающих в условиях циклических нагрузок, необходимо:

использовать материалы с высокой усталостной прочностью.
обеспечивать эффективную смазку и регулярную замену смазочных материалов.
учитывать резонансные явления при конструировании и выборе частоты нагрузок.
применять прочные конструктивные решения, исключающие чрезмерные деформации.
проводить регулярный контроль и техническое обслуживание подшипников.
