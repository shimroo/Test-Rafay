jbc announces status change
jamestown business college has made the very difficult decision to stop enrolling new students. the college will continue to provide the coursework and graduation requirements for all of our currently enrolled students. eventually, this change will lead to the closure of jamestown business college. these changes are the result of the college’s size and the expanding government regulations.
jbc is 100 percent committed to helping all of our current students complete their programs. the college will be reaching out to all enrolled students to discuss their schedules. admissions will be reaching out to all applicants to assist them with other college options.
jbc has been part of our community and serving its students since 1886. over the years, countless students have earned their degrees and moved on to successful futures. you would be hard-pressed to enter a business in jamestown, ny, and not come across one of our grads because the majority of jbc grads stay and work locally.
for the foreseeable future, it will be business as usual for jbc. we look forward to a continued celebration of the college’s wonderful history as we work through this final chapter with our current students, our alumni, and our local community.
jbc is working with bryant and stratton college who will hold jbc and obi transcripts after jbc closes in february 2025.  students and alumni will be able to request their transcripts directly from b&sc’s website when the change occurs.
*proposed substantive change is pending approval by msche.

tamara“jbc is a great college.  they gave me personalized help from the admissions process….right through to graduation!”
shelby“my favorite thing about attending jbc was how close-knit you become with the instructors.  they were always there to help you when you needed help on homework or just to talk.  they truly care about you and want the best for you!”
magena“my favorite part about attending jbc is how small the school is. it gave me the opportunity to have more one-on-one time with my instructors when i needed extra help understanding a topic or with my assignments.”
mikala“jbc has taught me so many things and has built up my confidence, especially in public speaking. jbc has given me the skills to be successful with my degree.”
