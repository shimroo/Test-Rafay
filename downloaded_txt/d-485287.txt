pirates' lair: aftermarket, custom, and performance motorcycle accessories for exotic motorcycles

































 
we all know that  finding special, imported, or custom accessories for
            your  motorcycle is a challenge. my goal here at pirates lair
            is to remedy the situation by offering a line of exclusive products
            for our quasi-esteemed clientele... all under one website.
as 
                an avid motorcyclist myself, i have specifically chosen every product 
                that i sell here and personally endorse each item. if you aren't 
                completely satisfied with something, i'll make it right. i treat 
                my customers like i want to be treated. .. with respect. a simple 
                philosophy yes, but it's worked for us for over 20 years.
