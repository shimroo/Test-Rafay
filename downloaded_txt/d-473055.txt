sony announced latest  nwz-e350 walkman






sony's just announced a latest e-series walkman, the e350. available in blue, red or black, these bad boys come in both 4gb and 8gb varieties. simple players, they proffer up to 50 hours of music playback, and up to ten hours of video, and hold a variety of formats. additional than that -- well, there's not much more than that. if you can't wait to get your hands on one, well you'll have to wait until next month, but it will cost you $70 for the 4gb and $80 for the 8gb version once available at sony style.

rumor: appletv renamed itv, will have apps but no 1080p playback video






according to an engadget basis—the same one that said the next appletv would be a $99 unit with iphone guts—apple's next tv device will be rebranded itv. and it will have apps, but it won't play 1080p video.
that final bit has apparently been a point of contention for apple, but apparently the new unit's internals—reportedly an a4 cpu and 16gb of flash storage, can't quite handle 1080p or 1080i playback. the basis says that the itv will bring apps to televisions, though there's still no information on how that will work, or if it will be able to run apps designed for the ipad or iphone.
while the idea of apps on the tv seems like a grand get through in (d)evolution of the couch potato, it'd certainly be a bummer if apple's new push into the living room couldn't play our biggest and best files. and i still want amazing like this.

motorola glam makes android 2.1, plenty of ritz to south korea






yes, it may look like the dell aero when peeking it head-on, but motorola's glam is appropriate to be far more complicated that the self-proclaimed "world's lightest android phone." launched today over in south korea, this android 2.1-based handset (which we toyed with previous in the year when it was known as the xt800) boasts a 3.7-inch capacitive multitouch panel (854 x 480), dual led flash, a 5 megapixel camera, bluetooth 2.1+edr, 3.5mm headphone jack, usb 2.0 connectivity, an hdmi socket, 1gb of nand flash, 512mb of sdram, an 8gb microsd card, inbuilt gps and maintain for a multitude of multimedia formats. mum's the word on a price, but it be supposed to be shuffling over to sk telecom -- high heels and all -- by the end of august.

iphone 4 jailbreak enables facetime video calling more 3g







we had  really already hacked up a 3g facetime video call using an iphone 4 and a mifi, but now that apple's newest handset has been jailbroken, you can toss the extra hardware,  you just need a little cydia app called my3g, which lets you run wifi apps over 3g. facetime video quality appears to be unchanged, but from what we have seen the framerates experience depending on your connection  attractive much what you'd expect to get when running a video flow optimized for high-bandwidth connections on a smaller pipe. still, it is right away the best reason to jailbreak your phone  check a video after the break. see the below video:

new imacs core i3 review






there is nothing externally different about the new imacs apple just released last tuesday, but the hardware beneath that familiar aluminum chassis has gotten faster -- particularly on the low end, where a new 3.06ghz intel core i3 processor and separate ati radeon hd 4670 graphics chip have in use over for the previous gen's 3.06ghz core 2 duo and included nvidia geforce 9400m. that's a big boost apple claim the new version is some 50 percent faster -- and so we really turned down the hot-rod 27-inch 2.93ghz core i7 imac in favor of a stock $1,199 21.5-inch core i3 when it came time to pick up a review unit. we required to see just how much bang apple's delivering for the entry-level buck, and we weren't frustrated when the tests came back.
