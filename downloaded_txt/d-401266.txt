                    welcome to debruyn seed store


this family owned and run business started out in a small general store in zeeland, mi back in 1915 as a way for the local farmers to purchase seeds at the start of the season, and then have an outlet for their produce at the end of the growing season. the founder passed the business to his two sons, who split the business into seeds and produce. the seed store was established in 1955 in downtown zeeland and quickly expanded to include lawn and garden needs, pet food and supplies as well as a full line of seeds. we pride ourselves on our quick, efficient service and our quality seeds.
