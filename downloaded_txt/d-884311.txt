resonus classics (2019)
following critical acclaim for their series of duo recordings for violin and flute on the theme of the art of elegant conversation, period instrument group the elysium ensemble returns to resonus with an expanded lineup to present an arresting and vibrant new recording of flute concertos by the baroque composer johann joachim quantz.
with elysium founders greg dikmans (flute) and lucinda moon (violin) as soloist and leader, the ensemble breathes fresh new life into these striking and beautifully crafted works with performances that are at once filled with a compelling spirit and warmth.
