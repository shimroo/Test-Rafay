david gold, beloved chairman of gold group international and joint-chairman of west ham united, was a true one off. born into poverty in the east end of london, he worked tirelessly and innovatively to become one of britain’s most successful businessmen. he was a true entrepreneur, who loved his work, but found joy in encouraging and inspiring others to chase their dreams too. he was endlessly proud of watching his daughters, jacqueline and vanessa thrive in their work and delighted in watching them turn ann summers into the huge success it is today.
a west ham fan from day one, dg was endlessly proud of having played for west ham colts and the club’s a team in his youth. while life took him in a different direction, he never lost his love for the club, purchasing his first shares in 1991, before finally realising his dream to be owner and chairman in 2010.he was never too busy to give his time to the supporters, because he was one of them, attending every single home game without fail, and travelling to away games for as long as he could. he was passionate about fundraising for the west ham foundation and championedthe development of the youth academy training ground.
he was a philanthropist, donating regularly to the many charities close to his heart. his warmth,kindness and unwavering support for those around him will never be forgotten.
dg leaves a legacy we will treasure, forever.
