about me
i am a social scientist and technologist. in both roles, i work to understand the social dynamics that shape online communities. my work focuses on communities engaged in the peer production of digital public goods free culture and free softwareâlike wikipedia and linux. for most of my life, i have also participated in these communities as an activist, contributor, and leader. i spend most of my time consuming, and increasingly often producing, academic articles, software, blog posts, essays, books and talks.
you can follow my latest musings and projects on my weblog copyrighteous. i microblog infrequently as mako@social.coop in the fediverse and as @makoshark on twitter.

my active affiliations include:

community data science collective: i am a member of the community data science collective (cdsc). the cdsc is an interdisciplinary research group made of up an incredible team of researchers at number of different universities and from the world beyond academe. the collective's work is focused on the study of online communities. our research is deeply interdisciplinary, most frequently consists of âbig dataâ quantitative analyses, and lies at the intersection of communication, sociology, and human-computer interaction. i founded the cdsc with aaron shaw.
