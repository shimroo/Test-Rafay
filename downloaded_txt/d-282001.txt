i’ve been lucky enough to travel all over the county and visit some of the top utv and atv destinations.  are you looking for an epic desert adventure, maybe the ultimate off road mountain trails or some good old southern mud?  well i’ve been there, let me take you there through these pages.  get inspire to plan your own atv getaway.  one day trips, over night camping or luxury condos you choose. life is too short, get out and explore now, you never know what tomorrow might hold.




 



moab utah trails












the ultimate off-road destination for atvs, utvs, jeeps. image thousands of miles of trails just waiting to be explored. easy open roads, deep canyons, extreme rock crawling. ***warning***  once you go to moab, you will never go any place else.







taylor park colorado












have you seen atvs and utvs in epic looking mountain photos or wondered where they film utv commercials?  you are likely looking at taylor park.  scenery here is the best you will find outside of a national park.  i once took a friend here and his comment was "i thought they only had places like this in the movies".






pauite and fremont trails












can you imagine a place built just for atvs?  well that is exactly what the paiute and fremont trails are.  a huge network of hundreds of miles of trails plus a 300 mile loop creating one of the most scenic and relaxing utv trail experiences in the usa.

colorado atv trails












rocky mountain high, have you ever heard the old song by john denver?  if not do a quick youtube search of it, then look at these trails to see where his inspiration came from, maybe you will find your own rocky mountain high on an utv trip to colorado. 






georgia atv trails












this is where it all started for me.  way back in 2000 i was in a computer programing class at the university of georgia and one of our assignments was to create a webpage.  what better way to do a class project than to do it on something you love.  this was a time before digital cameras so many of the pictures are grainy but the fun was still the same.  many of the trails are still open.  now is the time to get out there and make your own memories






alabama atv trails












some of my first off-road memories are from alabama.  a friends father used to take us to kentuck on weekends and we loved every second of it, i even had a date there.  now there is a whole new selection of trail around the state for utvs.  see what alabama has instore for you.






idaho atv trails












once upon a time i was on a family vacation in idaho and we were passing through the town of mackay and signs for atv trails. 
 being that i can never pass up the chance to go for a ride we decided to check them out.  what a neat place, i hope to one day get back and explore more of what idaho has to offer.
