	 so much i've missed
    


hello to everyone on this saturday, october 29th. i'm doing so much better. thanks to everyone for your good wishes. the cards did it in an epic game 6 and game 7. they pulled it out! i've never been a st. louis fan (1967 etc.) .today here in north central connecticut we're awaiting a never before seen intense october snowstorm. woo pee. i mean that because all the leaves on the trees and snow, heavy and wet with wind, will bring down power lines. i like snow, but in october???? power outages are too darn likely. the snow is fine, no electricity is not. i'll have an update after 12 noon. right now it's 10:55.about the red sox, thank you tito and theo.the 2012 season will certainly be different but with the core of players boston has with a couple additions (starting pitcher for sidelined lackey,etc) who knows.as always, be well.

	 boston 12 texas 7...cc grand tater
    



carl crawford's grand slam pushed the red sox to a 12-7 defeat of the rangers. it also gave bedard his first victory in a boston uniform. here's carl himself... “i don’t look at the numbers. i guess when [the media] reminds me, then i know. but other that that, i just try to take each new day as it comes. that’s my approach.’’ here's papi... "that’s the guy we used to play against. he changes a game just like that. one swing, look what it did.’’ and beautiful it was, that's for sure. today, game three comes up with  j. lackey (12-10)  vs m. harrison (10-9). you never know what your going to get with lackey on the mound. watch him pitch-his pitching is like a box of chocolates... you see what i mean? that's going to be it for me today. i hope you have a wonderful sunday. click on this post's title for more and as always, be well.

	 texas tops red sox 9-0... ouch!!
    



andrew miller gave up six runs in the first 1 1/3 innings friday night. the sox never recovered, and fell out of first place. that thud  was nice. while in first and we''ll be there again. i feel it deep in my heart. it's only one game between the yankees and and the sox. we need a pitcher (lester) to become  more consistent. yes, jon has a few disappointing games on his resume.  he hasn't been as winningly consistent as he was as recently as a couple of months ago. he didn't pitch yesterday, it was just an example. andrew really brought his team to their knees. helpless. these are the games that seem pre-set. it was just one guy. today, they play against texas. it'll be boston vs. texas in an evening game. we need to string together a few victories and get our confidence and batting prowess together. also click on this post's title to hear and see more about it all. i thank you for popping in and as always, be well. thanks.

	 ny yankees 4 boston red sox 2..a clunker
    



 jon lester ran out of gas after just five innings, but left with a 2-1 lead en route to a 5-2 red sox loss. there were over 350 thrown,  and many were ugly. they can't all go your way and this win surely didn't. ny takes the series 2 games to one and i expected so much more. but it was not to be, not even close. i'll have a full wrap-up later today. thanks. click on this post's title for more on the game. jon threw 151 pitches in these  innings here's boston manager terry francona... "long games -- we're all tired. tonight, we just didn't swing the bats that well. we move on and try to win tomorrow."  it was a long time coming and the loss was inevitable. it's as if the writing was on the wall before the final pitch was thrown. maybe it was. it's bye bye time. i'll be back in a few hours. i thank you for coming in.

	 red sox 9 yankees 5
    



jacoby ellsbury hit a two-run home run in the sixth to help fuel a major boston red sox victory last night by a score of 9-5.. ells is batting .313 with 24 homers and 84 rbis. not bad for a guy who bats lead off. he never ever hit it over the green monstaer. ells said this last night... “that was pretty cool. i’ve wanted to do that.’’ on a field full of mvp candidates, ellsbury stood tallest. he is now hitting .313 with 24 homers and 84 rbis from the leadoff spot. that's amazing! with 27 games remaining, ellsbury is one run shy of his career high of 98. he also had his 35th double last night. the home run was the first he has hit to the opposite field in his career and only his eighth off a lefthander. here's piedey... “he’s been great all year long. there’s nothing he can’t do on a baseball field,’’ teammate dustin pedroia said. “we’re glad he’s on our team. he’s a force at the top of the lineup.’’ that was a wonderful moment in the middle of  a victorious effort for boston. oh yes it was. today, aj burnett goes for the yankees and jon lester, our best with josh beckett, takes the mound for the red sox. i like that pair going against each other. if jon can stay out of early inning troubles, as he's been lately, the yankees should leave boston with a loss. go sox.

	 yankees 5 boston 2
    



i have this summary for the yankees and red sox from this morning"s boston globe. i come back with a post a little later today...the yankees took the first game of this three-game set against the red sox to whittle boston's lead to a half game in the american league east before a fenway park crowd of 37,773. "cc sabathia (18-7), winless in four previous starts against the red sox, went six innings and allowed two runs on 10 hits and two walks while striking out 10.john lackey (12-10) went seven innings and allowed five runs (four earned) on seven hits and four walks while striking out three.new york pitchers gave up 13 hits but struck out 13 as boston stranded 16 runners in a 3-hour-59-minute game that saw yankees pitching coach larry rothschild (seventh) and manager joe girardi (ninth inning) ejected by third base umpire mark wegner.rothschild was run from the game when he protested john lackey's hitting catcher francisco cervelli, who hit a solo homer off lackey in the fifth inning. girardi was ejected when closer mariano rivera plunked sox catcher jarrod saltalamacchia on the left wrist in the bottom of the ninth." lackey's five runs doomed his club. oh well, we'll get 'em today. we'd better!

	 back to work for the yankees & red sox
    


the boston red sox will put on their uniforms and tackle with the ny yankees tonight after a very wet interruption. here are the pitching match ups, but first, a word from our dh... “this is great. our guys need the rest. we’ve been going like crazy around here and guys are tired and this is going to give us a little bit of a break physically, so we can get our energy ready to go the rest of the way. we’ve got the yankees coming in and that’s always going to be a tough series and very intense for everybody. so we’re going to be rested for that.’’  tonight, john lackey will be on the hill at wet but still friendly fenway. i'll see you soon.

	 for what it's worth...
    



theo epstein was involved in a big way with boston's acquisition of adrian hernendez. the padres coveted our center fielder, jacoby ellsbury. now he's turned himself into an irreplaceable cog in the red sox offensive attack and their defense. imagine the  sox without jacoby. i don't even want to go there. here's reliever daniel bard... “a lot different. who’d be playing center field for us? we’d probably have had to go sign someone else, or maybe cam (mike cameron) would still be here. jacoby’s the sparkplug for our offense. you could say he’s been our most consistent guy all year. he had a really good spring training, maybe a little bit of a slow april, and he’s pretty much been on fire ever since.” so thank you,theo epstein. you did good. the hurricane tracked just to the west of where i live but unbelievably, my power stayed on with nary a flicker. for that, i'm thankful. what i'm not thankful for is the lack of ingress and egress. (i can't go anywhere until tomorrow because the road i live on is underwater. so i'm stuck here. don't get me wrong. the fire department came yesterday and they knocked on every door to tell the people living here that town farm road and route 4 are underwater. they told me things should be back to normal tomorrow. i have my two kinds of insulin here but one of them needs to be refrigerated. i have plenty of food and drink and i'll be fine until tomorrow morning. the river that keeping me penned in is the farmington river, a tributary of the connecticut river. oh well, you can't fight mother nature. on that note, i'll say goodbye. as always, stay safe. thanks.

	 red sox grab two wins on saturday.. 9-1 & 4-0..yankees/ baltimore sunday doubleheader  has been cancelled
    



the boston red sox had a great but rain-delayed day while capturing two wins yesterday against oakland at fenway park in boston. the first game's final score was 9-1 sox for the lester win and 4-0 for the bedard outing. the only reason bedard was denied a victory was another rain delay. that's too bad but i'm very happy he's part of the boston starting quintet. for a number five guy, he's pitching well. so today, you must pick something other than baseball to spend your lazy afternoon with. here's boston's manager, tito francona... “we’ll use it (two days off) to our advantage. that’s what we always try to do. we were really fortunate the way it worked out. now we can let the guys regroup because they’re going to need to. this has been a long haul here.” yes, after a couple days off today and monday, the yankees will invade fenway park. with yesterday's red sox double whammy over oakland, they are a full 2 games ahead of their new york rivals. let's keep it there. or more! “it’s always a big series,” david ortiz said of the impending matchup. “we always play to win so it’s always good.” i have to run. no, i don't have anywhere to go (we're not supposed to be on the roads) but i do have to do a full house walk-through coming up right now. the winds have picked up and as soon as the sun makes its first appearance, i'll have an update.it's still pitch dark outside. so be safe today. if you live in the northeast, as i do, you know you have to be careful. they just said the hurricane's landfall will be right around the previously announced 11 am edt. so sit tight (or sleep well) until then. you can click on this post's title for more sox news and as always, be careful, be well. if you have any questions, just leave yours as a comment and i'll answer it, if we have electricity. i have a funny feeling we're not going to lose it. as always, be well, my constant readers. what would i do without you? don't forget to get in touch with me through the comment sections of every post and as always, be well.

	 that was yesterday, yesterday's gone...oakland 15 boston 5
    



i'm happy this type of games, score wise, are so few and far between with this club from boston. the final score? 15-5 oakland a's over the boston red sox. it was a combination of things, every one of them not good for the sox. but i want to make this post short and dwell on the doubleheader scheduled for today. jon lester will be starting for the red sox ready to face moscoso. here are the statistics for both upcoming game. weather wise, game one should be ok, game two is still a question sign. but at least they have a chance to play it. if the powers that be decided to play the evening game tomorrow, there wouldn't be a chance to play it. nice.  sat. 27	oak	**12:05 pm et	csca/nesn **j. lester (13-6) vs. g. moscoso (6-7)...12 noon sat. 27	oak	**5:05 pm et	csca/nesn**	e. bedard (4-9) vs. tba  two great games for an ever-darkening late summer day into night. i really hope the two teams, in game two, can get in at least 6 quality innings as well as the nine plus in game one but right now, i don't think that scenario will play out. why? i'm just looking at the timeline. the red sox want to win both of these games. last night, the ny yankees also lost, so boston's place in the al east has been preserved for game one at least. again, if you're planning to go to game one, you'll have no weather problems at all. game two? that could get a little complicated. today, we'll take it one game at a time. game one begins at noon at fenway with the skies, slate gray and getting darker, holding off dropping their loads. but who really knows? does anybody really know what time it is? i'm sure there's someone somewhere that that information. if not, constant readers, guesstimate.    i'll talk to you tomorrow first thing in the morning unless the hurricane god makes a personal visit here. as always, be well. if you're in the mid-atlantic coastal region visiting us. make it go away! just kidding. go sox...twice. again, in my opinion, that second game looks more and more iffy but it's only 6:11am here and in boston so the grounds crew will work hard for the playing field  to be ready for a game two.  have a great day and please, enjoy the games. after yesterday's wipeout the red sox will be trying extra hard to win both games today. hmm...that's it for me! click on this post's title for more sox stuff. thanks.
