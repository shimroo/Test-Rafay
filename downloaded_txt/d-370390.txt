 testimonials 







                     very, very nice staff. i was shocked how helpful and lovely everyone was. i highly recommend. it was my first time here and will not be my last. the lovely ladies all helped me picked out frames - like 4 of them all took the time to make me feel important enough to give me their opinions, i have never been to a place where the staff made me feel so welcomed. again, lovey place!                  




                  anandini m.               







                     dr. stephen was very engaging and gentle with my 9-month baby while he did the eye exam. he was very good with her and she didn’t cry at all. he explained thoroughly the results of the eye exam and answered all my questions. the staff was very nice and friendly too! they have a nice waiting area for children.                  




                  emma l.               







                     first time back, since covid started. nothing has changed, thankfully. the service and interactions with all the employees are always wonderful, helpful, and supportive. this is the best place i have ever been. even if i move out of state, i would book a flight to come back for any appointments. that’s how amazing the service and employees are.

                     had a great experience at st lucy’s vision center, the customer service is great from the moment you walk in the door, to the moment you leave. they really make sure all your needs are taken care off and that you are satisfied with their attention. dr. stephen is very knowledgeable and patient and you can tell he has been doing this for a long time. would recommend.                  




                  sebastian l.               







                     this is my go to spot for all my eye care needs. dr. stephen is thorough and knowledgeable in his eye exams. he is on top of latest trends and technology. the facility is very well kept. the inventory for eyewear could be better but they offer a decent variety of frames from popular brands. i've been coming here for a number of years and strongly recommend their services.
