understanding your financial goals

the importance of budgeting
budgeting is often seen as a tedious task, but it's actually the foundation upon which all other financial decisions are made. by creating a budget, you're giving yourself a clear understanding of where your money is going and making conscious choices about how to allocate it.
this doesn't mean cutting out everything fun and exciting â quite the opposite! a well-crafted budget allows you to prioritize your spending and make room for the things that truly matter to you.
