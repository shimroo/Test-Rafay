smartphones - which one should i buy?






smartphones are beautiful, so beautiful in fact that many manufacturers are beginning to place female voices inside your phone so they seem more lively and vibrant, too bad that they don't substitute for a girlfriend. however, as beautiful and elegant as smartphone maybe you may find it difficult to choose the right one for you. with so many different options in the market, how do you decide which one is the best for you? here, i'm going to share with you my five tips for choosing the right smartphone.

rank your priorities: i don't mean keep a written note of what you look for in a phone, it's better to keep a mental note or an idea. when i say priorities, i mean what aspects of a smartphone do you find important. maybe you need a phone that cost under $400 or with a really good camera. a bright and beautiful screen, even a stylus or maybe you need a phone just for watching funny videos. as long as you know your top two or three priorities for your smartphone, you should be able to narrow down certain phones and then make a decision from there.

don't be afraid to buy old phones: a lot of people will tell you that they need those brand new smartphones with the best and brand new specs. that doesn't mean you need such phone too! in a few months time the iphone 7 will be one year old, but the previous launch i.e. iphone 6 is still considered as a very good smartphone. so, when you're looking for the right smartphone look to the older generations of the smartphones as well, because often times you'll find phones that are still very good and are also cheaper.

don't feel the need to buy high-priced smartphones: many smartphone manufacturers are moving toward this trend. you can still find some cool features and durable smartphones at a price that is lower than most high-end smartphones. ever since i bought the oneplus 1 for under $350, i've been so impressed with what companies can provide for such a low price. on the other i find the galaxy note 5, which costs over $800, is way too expensive and iphone 6 price is just reasonable. the point is that your smartphone does not need to be expensive to be a great quality.

think about your smartphone's accessories: these accessories include chargers, battery packs, cases and pretty much anything you can either attach or connect to your smartphone. we do rely on a lot of these accessories, so you need to look for a well-established phone like the iphone or the popular android phones built by companies such as, samsung, lg, motorola. you probably won't find many accessories with smaller names or new brands, just think about whether or not you need them.

iphones are very basic: i'm not saying people who use iphones are basic, don't get me wrong! what i am saying, however, is that i would have an easier time learning to use an iphone then if i were learning to use any other smartphone. it's a fantastic phone an very convenient because most accessories work with iphones. they always have great cameras and apple services even though considered overpriced are excellent in terms of keeping everything you own all in one place. i'm not saying to put the iphone is your number one option, but i am saying that if you're looking for a high-quality device that's simple and easy to use go for the iphone. like i mentioned above, look to the older models of smartphones because many of them are still brilliant smartphones.

so, that's it guys i hope you've enjoyed reading it and hope have learnt something good as well. if you like to know about the latest updates from the tech world, i'd recommend you to visit techintakes.com. you will find there pretty helpful reviews and hands-on experiences of different tech related products by the experts.

avoid the flu with a clean cell phone screen






this year, we've seen the worst flu season in many years. in fact, because of the type of flu strain that seems to have reached near-epidemic status, of those who received a flu vaccine, only six out of ten will avoid getting the flu. the good news is if you do get the vaccine and still contract the flu, your symptoms are said to be much milder. even so, no one wants to be down and out for a week to ten days with this type of illness, so it's important to protect yourself as much as you can. that means frequently washing your hands, avoiding touching your face as much as possible, and taking extra precautions to clean the air and surfaces you come in contact with on a regular basis. that includes using anti-bacterial wipes on your desk and phone at work, and making sure you have a clean cell phone screen too.

how do you get the flu?

experts believe that you get the flu by coming into contact with someone who has the flu. if that person sneezes or coughs, the germs travel through the air and the tiny droplets land in your nose or mouth, gross. however, those airborne water droplets can also land on the surfaces around you. this is the 'viral' part of the sickness and it happens very easily. the statistics demonstrate a need for additional precautions to be taken, including cleaning things you touch regularly. one of those things is definitely your cell phone.

maintain a clean cell phone screen

during flu season, you might want to avoid allowing a stranger or even a friend to use your cell phone, which is pretty good advice all the time actually. however, keeping your cell phone fairly sequestered won't keep it free from any particles that might be in the air. there are various companies that have made it easier for you to make sure you have a clean cell phone screen during flu season with screen cleaners. the two most popular product on the market are microfiber cloths, which can be kept right in your purse, pocket, or a drawer in your desk and are microfiber patches of cloth, and screen cleaner stickers, which are microfiber cloths that adhere to the back of your phone for easy access.

the microfiber cloths can be tossed into your washing machine periodically to ensure that they stay clean. simply wash with like other common materials, and avoid bleach, fabric softeners or dryer sheets for the best results. sticky screen cleaners are an easier alternative because they attach to your phone itself, and they usually come in a variety of designs. these can be washed by hand in a sink with some gentle soap.

you use your cell phone during the day quite a bit, touching it to your face and hands and checking it constantly. even if you set it down on a table, or leave it in your open purse, airborne germs can come into contact with it. microfiber is a great choice for cleaning your cell phone because it uses an electrical charge to attract and remove particles, dirt, and germs.

take a look at some of the products that are out there, as there are many great options that can help you stay well this season.

from bucket list to loyal patron






great marketing provides us with an opportunity to stimulate interest in our business, drawing customers in to sample what we have to offer. successful efforts may even garner you a position on the "bucket list"; that small ranking of must-see once, must-do once, must-try once products and services that includes of course, your competition.

such an achievement is wonderful as it is recognition for the hard work put in to building your enterprise; but real success should be measured in good part not only by the volume of first time purchasers; but by the percentage of clients who buy from you again and again, and again...

much has been said about the cost benefits of attracting and maintaining loyal customers; those who choose you even when the options are plentiful and may quite likely have something equally good to offer.

analysts note that it is 6 to 7 times more costly to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing customer. therefore, it's equally important, if not more, to cultivate and maintain loyal customers while attracting new customers.

how do we harness the rewards of a successful marketing plan and transform the audience it generated into long term, repeat, supportive, partners in our future success? what steps can we take, what actions ensure such an honor?

make customers love your products and services

products and services are the base of a business. they're not only important factors that can distinguish you from your competitors, but also reasons to keep customers coming back repeatedly. products and services loved by customers often have something in common:

realize promised value: have your products and services performed as advertised? if yes, customers are likely to stay satisfied with your products and services even though they may have higher expectations. sure, it will be much better, if you give customers more than you promised.

deliver a pleasant user experience: customers are people; people have emotions. bringing a pleasant experience to the users can produce great influence on improving customer loyalty and spreading your brand. this requires you to invest in the usability, design and interactive experience of your products and services on top of just features. as to how to know customers' real feelings about your products, social media can be a great tool; you will not find a more unfiltered source of data.

provide dedicated support: service is the most direct way customers feel their importance in your business. be responsive and helpful whenever customers need your assistance, from pre-sales queries to post-sales support. let the customers know you are always standing by.
"quality in a product or service is not what you put into it, it is what your customer gets out of it" ~peter f. drucker

learn from lost customers

when customers stop using your products and services, you lose them. do you know why each of the customers leaves you?

it would be helpful to create a lost customer database which includes the following:

reason: why do they give up on your offerings?

lifetime: how long have they used your products and services?

solution: how to convince them to continue using your products?

requesting such feedback and creating a database on the findings can help you with identifying root cause of your client loss and equally important, preventing future losses. it will give you insights on better serving your current patrons. as we know; happy customers will bring you more customers and opportunities while unhappy ones may cause public relation crises.

"your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning" ~bill gates

nurture your supporters

treat customers as individuals as not everyone responds to event the most sincere gestures in the very same manner. customize interactions and correspondence; track personal trigger points and reference them when connecting.

ask for feedback from your repeat patrons and by all means, respond and/or act upon these highly valued nuggets to provide assurance that you are in fact listening.

"loyal customers, they don't just come back, they don't simply recommend you; they insist that their friends do business with you" ~chip bell

7 basics for keeping your company's data safe






each and every other week there is another prominent information rupture in the media. from target to home depot to icloud to jpmorgan to snapchat to the white house-and most as of late the overwhelming assault on sony pictures entertainment-there's dependably a feature highlighting the loss of information and rupture of trust.

be that as it may, that doesn't mean your business must be one of them and endure the stunning $3.5 million misfortunes coming about because of a normal information rupture.

here are seven practices and items you can receive today to stay out of the information rupture club.

1. arm yourself for the dangers inside.

information hazards today don't exclusively start from malevolent programmers, regardless of the fact that news features recommend something else. a late pwc study found that inside dangers and mix-ups now constitute a greater test to business security than outer ones, implying that paying little respect to size, today's organizations must control information on capacity stages, as well as on representative and business accomplices' gadgets and records.

2. get the lay of the area.

ask yourself: "what is the most delicate, private information that our business holds, how is it taken care of, and who has admittance to it?" create a spreadsheet coordinating information sorts and administrations to the representatives and business partners who can get to them. make a point to incorporate the two most delicate sorts of information: client data and licensed innovation.

3. parts and authorizations.

once you've distinguished your benefits, audit levels of access and on the off chance that they can be controlled by means of approach, or, even better, automatically. a critical variable to consider is whether your substance administration stage of decision permits the profundity of control executives need to set parts for every particular use case inside the organization. it's imperative that these are refined, constraining get to and alter of essential information to approved staff.

4. take in your shortcomings.

a great many people reuse the same secret word crosswise over administrations, including business related projects. at the point when a major retailer or administration supplier is broken, there is an undeniable chance that corporate messages and passwords are additionally affected. a comparable weakness as of late empowered aggressors to access a great many dropbox accounts as outsider administrations incorporated with the item were bargained, laying a huge number of usernames and passwords powerless.

to learn in the event that this has happened some time recently, begin by heading once again to security master troy hunt's site or breach alarm's free instrument and sweep representatives' email addresses through their device-their database is frequently overhauled with the most recent distributed breaks.

5. passwords hold the key.

to keep a comparative episode, have a solid watchword administration strategy. teaching workers about never reusing passwords crosswise over administrations and making more grounded passwords (go for length over assortment of characters, however) is additionally key.

naturally, this prerequisite results in hard to recollect passwords, straining efficiency. on the off chance that conceivable, begin utilizing a watchword administration application. they're anything but difficult to utilize, naturally create solid passwords for every administration-and, in particular, they're secure. lastpass is a pioneer in this field.

6. expect the following shellshock.

there is another critical motivation to keep focused of security news. inside the previous year alone, two noteworthy vulnerabilities were observed to prowl in broadly utilized programming-heartbleed and shellshock. we can securely expect that it won't be long before the following defenselessness is uncovered, and it's imperative to pay consideration on the news for when they become visible-particularly if any of the product your business uses is traded off. mass abuse of these vulnerabilities can happen in as meager as a week's opportunity after they're uncovered, so your business is at danger in the event that you stick around-or far more terrible, do nothing.

7. get your work done

at the point when picking administrations to execute into your business' work process, it's essential not to ignore unadulterated security for profitability advantages, a simple mix-up in today's efficiency and-cloud-crazed environment. do your due determination, and make a point to run with administrations that are prescribed by security experts and your industry's significant affiliations, which frequently distribute rules important to your business sector and administrative environment. it's likewise vital to ensure the administrations that you choose to run with incorporate protection strategies and sureties that will educate you when their frameworks are ruptured.

can you recover lost data?






in a nutshell, recovering data means that someone has to try to salvage inaccessible data from a corrupted or damaged storage site. think computers and how they crash, sometimes inexplicably and you are suddenly left with nothing.

that feeling of helplessness when your computer crashes leads you to an expert in data recovery. sometimes they are successful and sometimes they aren't but they are all trained in salvaging files from storage media like external hard disk drives, solid state drives, usb flash drives, cd's, dvd's, and magnetic tapes.

data recovery can be needed for different things, the most common is an operating system failure but computers can also be damaged by physical damage and things like tornadoes, flooding and hurricanes; things that are deemed 'acts of god'. then of course there is the good old virus or trojan horse that gets into the computer and renders it in need of quick and professional assistance.

if you have the most common type of data recovery it will be because of an operating system failure and in that case the technician will try to get your files on to an other device. if you have a drive level failure and/or a compromised file system or hard drive disk failure the data may not be as easy to recover and read. in this case the technician would try to repair the file system itself, and luckily some damage may be able to be repaired by replacing parts of the hard disk. if there is still damage there is a specialized disk imagining procedure that can be undertaken to try to recover every readable bit of the data that can be reclaimed. then the files can possibly be reconstructed.

usually if your computer crashes and you need a data recovery expert you will take the computer to them, but other times they have to do their work remotely either because the system is just too big to take in or just too far away for it to be possible. this of course requires a lot more skill and expertise in the field.

simply, then there are four phases of data recovery. repair the hard disk drive, image the drive to a new drive, logical recovery of files and repair retrieved files. once all four steps have been taken, we hope that your computer is up and running again, and it should last-until the next time you experience a crash.
