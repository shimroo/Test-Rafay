the age of internet and elder care






in today's day and age, technology rules the world. there's hardly a person out there who doesn't have some electronic gadget on them at all times, helping them meet the demands of day-to-day life. it's become the norm! but when you stop to think about it, society’s shift towards being so technology-centric has been a relatively recent change. the world wide web as we know it was only invented in the early '90s, meaning the most recent generations actually grew up during the big boom of technology. many people alive today spent their formative years with little to no technology, making it harder for them to understand the data-driven world we live in now- and nearly impossible to catch up with the near-daily advancements that come with it. so you may ask then, why create a website for the elderly to find caretakers such as eldercare.com? the answer is simple. though we understand the technical limitations of our ageing population, we also recognize that more often than not it...
