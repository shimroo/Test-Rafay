thanks for visiting intimate audio, a site hosted by  dale turner 


a rock singer-songwriter / multi-instrumentalist / film composer, dale turner is also an instructor at hollywood's musicians institute, and author of 50+ instructional books/transcription folios (a fave being power plucking - a rocker's guide to acoustic fingerstyle guitar). he writes a monthly acoustic guitar column for guitar world magazine, and is featured in their "lick of the day" app for iphone/ipad. a los angeles resident, turner is also the former west coast editor (1996-2007) of the now defunct guitar one magazine.
 turner owns/uses an assortment of old, weird, rare, and/or exotic instruments—unique stringed, percussion, and synthesizer "scoring tools." some of these—including the charango—are featured in his score for the  animated short weeds,  the first animated short completed within the filmmakers co-op at disney feature animation, and  one of three "commended" (extra) films included in 2018 oscar nominated shorts - animation, the theatrical release of five academy award nominated animated shorts (dear basketball, garden party, lou, negative space, and revolting rhymes) nominated for the 90th academy awards.
guitar player  magazine calls turner's latest cd, mannerisms magnified: "smart pop tunes that are crammed with interesting guitar parts and tones ... like what the beach boys might do if they were on an acid trip that was on the verge of getting out of control. yeah!"
contact dale turner, to help fulfill your unusual/quirky, dark/eerie, suspenseful/mysterious,  surreal/abstract, provocative, eclectic, sensitive film project's emotional/dramatic needs (imdb).

"open road" (0:55) -  unsettling piece partly inspired by hildur guðnadóttir's work on the joker, along with jonny greenwood's there will be blood score. played on one of my uncommon fiddle-like instruments (horror)






"solitude" (0:28) - a short, reflective piece played on some of my  fiddle-like instruments (drama)






"red reckoning" (2:10) - a david lynch / twin peaks homage... sort of (surreal mystery, drama)






"night speeder" (1:45) - intense, night-time car chase (being hunted) music (action, suspense)

"ice sculpture" (1:53) - a piece conjured from images of frozen swedish and norwegian landscapes (experimental, art film)

"mournful strings" (1:32) - somber underscore piece (mock-up) for 14-12-10-8-6 string orchestra (epic, drama)

"pumpkin patch" (1:15) - modern jazz march with jagged/intricate elec. gtr. & sax melody (live excerpt)






"christening" (0:44) - "modern" acoustic guitar piece (open tuning, percussive smacks, slapped harmonics, tapping) written as a "thematic/style sample" for a film heavily incorporating "progressive fingerstyle acoustic guitar"






"wishing well" (0:44) - playful yet melancholic. perhaps a tad fantastic mr. fox-inspired (instruments wise). ukulele w/flutes, marimba, snare drum, string bass & glockenspiel (animation, end title)






"bazaar dance" (1:10) - jamming with myself during covid-19 / coronavirus quarantine—numerous hand-played instruments (fretted violin, glissentar, frame drum, saz, lp udongo ii udu, etc.), loosely inspired by the "gypsy fiddle" moments in the hans zimmer / lorne balfe score for guy ritchie's sherlock holmes (2009), and perhaps some sounds in alexandre desplat's argo (2012) awesomeness (international thriller)






"noiseless machine" (1:29) - wrote this stomping guitar riff (+bonus geets) to a trashy drum groove created by my great friend linus lau. did two full songs in one short-ish day... but the recording you are hearing here, the drums aren't the same as the original  (not sure why), and linus later added bass. (this is an edit; actual song is much longer.) originally a pitch for a film seeking very specific rock-flavored jams (scoring). (zombie, road trip)






"clean space trip" (1:18) - wrote this fun guitar stuff  to a percolating drum groove created by my great friend linus lau. did two full songs in one short-ish day... but the recording you are hearing here, the drums aren't the same as the original (not sure why), and  linus later added bass. full version is much longer, and has a pretty cool guitar solo at the end; this fades out before that. originally a pitch for a film seeking very specific rock-flavored jams (scoring). (zombie, road trip)
