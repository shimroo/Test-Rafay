owner’s message






















brianne costa



owner & ceo



i was five years old and had a big personality – but only around those i knew. my mother thought i was cute enough to do commercials, but she didn’t count on me being mortifyingly shy around strangers. how do you teach your child not to be nervous? there are no “anti-shy classes.”acting classes helped me grow my confidence and self-esteem quickly and effectively. acting skills work from the classroom throughout life. the performer’s academy is a great place to learn to perform and take those skills to the stage, screen, classroom, or boardroom.not everyone who attends classes at tpa wants to be in the entertainment industry. almost half of our student body is here to experience the art of acting and performing—with no aspirations or goals to be the next child, teen, or mature star. many parents have shared with us that their children have become more confident, their self-esteem has been boosted, and they are making new friends while having a great time.

lance & darya s.






"this academy is top notch! i took a leap of faith to help my daughter enter into the world of acting. the moment i walked into the performer's academy, i was met with warm, honest, and supportive people. they have helped guide my daughter in an amazing way, and are there to help with everything from headshots, to learning, and dealing with agents. they truly want to see people succeed, and are all in every step of the way. i feel comfortable sending my daughter there. i know she is safe, and among staff who truly care.  i know they are looking out for her, and her best interest. i highly recommend this business for serious actors, and those that just want to have fun, and build their confidence. five stars just isn’t enough!"
susan b.






"i've been a student at the performer's academy for several years and highly encourage anyone interested to give it a try. the staff and teachers at the school are dedicated to helping you succeed with whatever your goals may be. i've learned invaluable information about acting, the entertainment industry, and earned many personable skills from public speaking to simply gaining much more confidence in myself. i've attended several acting schools in orange county as well as in los angeles, but have always gravitated to the performer's academy. from an outside perspective, becoming a working actor seems like an intangible profession, but when provided with the right tools and assets, the things you've only dreamed of start becoming reality. i participated in their 2024 actors forum and was able to meet several amazing agents and managers and sign with a team i feel confident in. i currently take paris' masterclass, which i highly recommend, and learn ample amounts of new skills even after years of attendance. regardless of age, whether you want to try acting seriously or just for fun, the performer's academy is an amazing place to start, grow, and flourish!"
devyn k.






"i have been taking classes here for about a year, and it has been an incredibly positive and supportive experience for me! all of my interactions with teachers, staff, ownership and other students have been extremely positive. in fact, this place feels like an additional family in my life.  my most consistent exposure has been to the monologue class (for older kids and adults) on wednesdays with paris. he is an incredibly gifted teacher, actor and person - and i say that comparing him to all the teachers i've had in my life in all disciplines . i can't speak highly enough of him and that class. but i've immensely enjoyed the other classes i've taken there as well (musetta on saturdays).  i do this only for fun and learning the craft, but it seems like an excellent place for those who wish to act professionally. this industry seems like it can be cutthroat, but somehow i feel a connection to the people here that feels more like community and friendship than a business or transactional. i hope everyone else feels the same as i do."
ali n.






"i've been incredibly impressed with the performer's academy and their dedication to nurturing young talent. my daughter has been attending classes here for nearly five years, and the staff has consistently been professional, informative, and supportive of her acting aspirations.  the academy has provided her with a solid foundation in acting techniques and has helped her develop essential skills for the industry. thanks to their guidance, she has achieved significant milestones, including signing with an agent and securing roles in several commercials. i highly recommend the performer's academy to any parent seeking a quality acting program for their child."
tim t.






“i stumbled across the performer's academy two and a half years ago.  having grown up in an acting family, i knew right away i had found a genuine acting program, one that hires working actors and directors as teachers.  this direct connection to the film industry gives students professional-level preparation for on-camera work. but the performer's academy isn't just a training program for those who have already decided they want to be an actor. it also gives students space to develop and explore acting in a genuinely supportive environment.  two years later my daughter now goes twice a week, auditions for paying roles, and has an agent. the performer's academy showed my daughter what i knew all along: that she is an actor, that she is an artist, and above all, that she matters.  thank you to all the teachers and staff for making that transformation possible!”
rachel r.






"a true hidden gem here in lake forest. my wife discovered this place for our (3 years old at the time, 7 now) daughter to learn about acting as it seemed a natural fit for her personality. it was one of the best things we could ever do for her. she truly loves coming here and learning with her friends and instructors. it's her home away from home. the owner brianne treats everyone like family. because of their tutelage, our daughter has been signed to one of the best agencies around and has been in a few commercials as well. if you have a child who has that outgoing personality or one that is shy and needs encouragement to break out of their shell, this is the place for them. it's fun, educational, and a great space to encourage and build up children's confidence. our entire family loves this place and the incredible people who make it so!"
ken h.






"i started coming to the performer’s academy during my first year of college, and it was the best decision i have ever made. the teachers here are incredibly talented and supportive, coming from all different backgrounds and specialties. the manager, tatiana, is incredible and has been so supportive of me and works with my insanely hectic schedule, and the owner, brianne, is one of the kindest people you will meet. whether you want to act professionally or just make friends and learn fun skills, this is definitely the place for you!! i highly recommend the performers’ academy to everyone of all ages."
veonn m.






“the absolute best place to take acting classes outside of los angeles. the staff is fantastic, with teachers who are working in the industry, and the owner with years of experience and connections to every aspect of hollywood! the performer’s academy gives you the room to grow and develop as a performer, with teachers who are dedicated to your success!”
sydney b.






”my daughter began taking classes at the performer’s academy in 2015. she was 5 and we were looking for a place in orange county that would truly teach her and not scam us! the performer’s academy is absolutely legitimate and a wonderful place for you & your kids. whether you are seeking acting classes, coaching, taping, or even a self-confidence boost and/or public speaking practice, the performer’s academy is it! 10/10…hands down.”
