steam deck - steam hand held gaming system


sledgstone posted a topic in video games, july 15, 2021


steam has made its own hand held game console. it can be used as a handheld or docked to a tv like the nintendo switch. honestly, this looks like a solid hand held. everyone that does pc gaming has a steam account and most likely alot of games already in their library. 

there are three versions: $399, $529 & $649 depending on the internal storage. its shipping december of 2021.

the hardware looks great too:

playstation 5


sledgstone posted a topic in video games, january 13, 2020


until we get solid info from sony, theres only speculation so far about the final list of features, prices, etc. the latest rumor i just read was this:

https://bgr.com/2020/01/13/ps5-release-date-price-announcement-and-preorder-details-leaked/

if true the price will be $499 and be available for preorder early february. and there will be full backwards compatibility with digitally owned games. and ps4 controllers will be forward compatible, which would explain that new extra back button attachment that was announced.

coronavirus disease (covid-19)


sledgstone posted a topic in random, march 18, 2020


hows the coronavirus impacting you? thankfully i work from home and my job is not affected yet so i haven't had any work outages. i know quite a few people now having drastically reduced hours in the food industry and they'll be struggling to pay bills here by next week. i haven't been shopping since last friday and it was a mad house then and only gotten worse from what i've heard. there is coronavirus cases in my county here in ny and it looks like the economy is going to crash. maybe this new stimulus package will help? if they do send out checks to everyone like the bush stimulus did, i'm going to have to throw that money right at my roof leak instead of additional food supplies. x_x i have one piece of roof that is not in good shape and apparently has been leaking for a while, buried under masses of snow until it recently all melted. home insurance guy was a prick and doesn't want to cover it. i'll be switching home insurance companies just because i didn't like the guy. i also think my agent misrepresented to me the actual quality of the insurance package too.

			i've been getting ready for spring for the last couple months and its taken up a crazy amount of my free time. we expanded our garden to be really huge last september in preparation for growing fruit and veggies. then we decided to expand it another 6 more feet in one direction which we finally got finished last weekend. it was alot of work because our garden has an almost 6 foot tall deer fence all around it. we hammered in u-posts into the ground and attached the deer net and buried the bottom of the net so nothing will burrow under it. i should do measurements at some point to figure out its total volume. its huge. lol.



	we have 3 apple trees, 3 cherry trees, and 1 nectarine tree in there. we still have to move 3 of those trees into their permanent locations (they are only 1 or 2 year old trees so its still possible to dig them up) and we have to plant a new apricot tree in there. i prepped the two rows for veggies last month but theres alot of weed whacking to do still and plants to move. we have 4 grape vines, 4 blueberry bushes and multiple raspberry plants to move. i started a bunch of veggies from seed and those tomatoes are still in an unused bath tub in my house with a light over them getting bigger every day. i'm looking forward to getting everything planted and done so all this gardening can give me a break.

			fml my pressure tank is failing for my well. its getting replaced next week. getting a new whole house water filter installed too along with some new valves and safety upgrades. props to the well company employee for giving me the tip of hooking up an air compressor to the pressure tank to put some air in the bladder to get the system gimping along until the repair work is done. i miss public water. lol.

			this has been a busy summer. i'm almost looking forward to winter so i can get a break from all the lawn mowing and outside projects. hopefully the snow blower i bought this year works good so i'll have alot of free time this winter to get caught up on things. when i've had free time i've been playing final fantasy x over the last 5 months and i've somehow finally hit 100 hours on it. lol. only took me about half a year.  i still didn't beat it yet but i'm at the end game stuff now with the monster arena and omega ruins.
