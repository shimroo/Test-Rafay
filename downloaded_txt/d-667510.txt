arkansas health 
		group, a division of baptist health, is a physician group practice 
		designed to better position physicians for healthcare delivery of the 
		future. as the first organization of its kind in our state, the vision 
		for arkansas health group is to offer cost-effective, quality care and 
		superior clinical outcomes through physician governance, with support of 
		the state's largest healthcare system.

		patients, employers and managed care providers are seeking the cost 
		savings, depth of service and quality care which an integrated 
		healthcare system, such as baptist health, can provide. as part of this 
		network of care, arkansas health group offers a solid foundation of 
		financial, technical and professional support for its physician partners 
		including well-staffed and equipped clinics that promote excellent 
		patient care. our physician partners are encouraged to involve 
		themselves in the group's management. an active physician advisory board 
		ensures that physicians have the resources they need without losing 
		control of their practices.

		physicians are freed from the burden of paper work, but are still able 
		to retain a voice in how their practice is run. this gives the doctors 
		more time with their patients, lowers insurance costs and with the 
		backing of baptist health, the states' largest not-for-profit healthcare 
		provider, brings affordable healthcare close to home.
