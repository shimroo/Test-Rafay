in 1992 we didnât have the internet to spread our good news, we relied  on our community in cobb county. todayâ 90% of our articles are submitted by that community, who want to share their good news -- we believe the bright side newspaper is the original social media platform. 
we embrace social media and the internet whole heartedly, which is why we are moving the publishing of our monthly bright side newspaper to online only.  due to increased costs of printing and postage we will not longer publish and mail our printed paper.
