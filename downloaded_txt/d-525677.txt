know all scales instantly....

play like you never played before...



become a master of scales, modes,
and improvisation with the
interactive
guitar scales method



if you want to develop top-class guitar
scales and improvisation skills,
then the guitar scales method (gsm)
is the tool that will make your
dreams come true.


gsm is a multimedia software
that teaches you, plays with you,
trains and drills you with
accelerated learning techniques,
and takes you step by step from
your current level (beginner,
intermediate, or advanced)
all the way to total mastery of
scales, modes, and improvisation.

in fact the method is so revolutionary
and effective
that it only takes a few weeks
before you actually develop the kind
of skills most guitar players
can only dream about:


the ability to put your hand anywhere
on the fretboard and play in any key without
hesitation.
the ability to improvise
effortlessly even on fast-changing
chords and keys.
the ability to know instantly and
effortlessly what scale and mode to use on
any chord.
the ability to play instantly and
effortlessly any scale in any key,
anywhere on the fretboard.
the ability to use artfully
the unique "colors" of each different
note in a scale.
the ability to play great
solos on any chord sequence.
the ability to improvise
an endless stream of creative
musical phrases.
the ability to start and close
your musical phrases with powerful and
meaningful notes.

the ability to use even your
occasional mistakes in building
ingenious musical phrases that
enchant your listeners.

most guitar players can only dream about
such abilities, and yet these exciting
skills can be developed with relative ease
if you have a smart learning
strategy and effective tools --
which is exactly
what the guitar scales method gives you.


 
a little "secret" revealed

if you want to improve your
playing dramatically,
you must understand clearly
this most important point.
are you ready? here goes:

mastery of scales, modes,
and improvisation is
not difficult, it's only complex.

read that line three times.
this is exactly what it means:

scales mastery is the
combination of several "micro-skills",
e.g. fretboard positions, fingerings,
scale patterns, scale degrees, etc.
that's why i say it's "complex".

at the same time, however,
these micro-skills are individually
rather simple and easy to master.
that's why i say it's not really
difficult -- it's just the combination
of a few simple components.

so the smart thing to do
is to learn each
micro-skill individually

and then
gradually put them together.

this is exactly what gsm does.
this is why the guitar scales method
is so powerful and enjoyable, making
it possible for you to become a master
of scales and improvisation in weeks
rather than years.

and the next thing you need to know
is that...


 
you learn by playing only

this is extremely important:
you only really learn when you play,
not when you watch others, listen, read,
or think about it.

sadly, that's why many guitarists try
with different books, charts, methods,
videos.... and generally fail to translate
most of that information into
practical skill.

on the other hand, with the
guitar scales method software
you spend over 90% of the
time actually playing your guitar:
you play, enjoy yourself,
and build your skills at the
same time.
that's how you really learn,
rapidly, naturally, enjoyably,
without excuses and without fail.

the more you practice with
gsm the more you develop
musical intelligence.
in other words....

 
the mindset makes all the difference

using gsm you immediately
start to understand
and experience
the mindset of the guitar master,
and then gradually develop such a
 mindset yourself.

this is extremely important.
you see, you could spend years and years
playing and copying the solos of your
favourite guitarists but still
not develop the ability to
create original solos of the same
quality yourself. why? because you
have no clear idea of how the masters
"think", you have no clear idea of
their mindset during improvisation.

only when you start to develop
a musically intelligent mindset
yourself will you achieve
revolutionary improvement
of your playing,
and that is one of the
main benefits gsm gives you.

specifically,
the guitar scales method is
designed to give you
the ability to effortlessly
"see" scales, modes,
notes, degrees, chords, and chromatics
on the fretboard.

the end result of training with
gsm is that you eventually develop a
powerful musical "mindset":

the effortless knowledge of
how every note on the fretboard
relates dynamically with any
chord, and the ability
to use it in practice.
such a mindset is priceless for
improvisation. it makes all the
difference in the world.


in practice you will develop
this mindset gradually.
while you will experience your
first break-through's
almost immediately,
you will have to use gsm
for several weeks to a few months
to get this mindset totally and
permanently established in your
mind and in your fingers.

and while talking about fingers...

 
developing speed and technique

gsm will also train you to develop
speed and precision, play scales
and modes with effective fingering,
and develop a rich collection
of scale patterns.

this is necessary because after
knowing what to play, you also
need the technical ability to
play it with precision, speed, and
feeling.

scale patterns, arpeggios, and
other simple and effective exercises
included in gsm will help you build
the kind of serious "chops" you need
to turn the flow of ideas in your
mind into a flow of notes on your
guitar.


 
direct experience

i invite you to download the trial
version of gsm and see for yourself
how it works.

download gsm trial, fire it up,
grab your guitar,
do the first interactive exercises...
and only then, by your own experience,
will you start to understand what
it really means to master scales
and improvisation.


so you be the judge.
i invite you to compare
the guitar scales method
with any other book,
e-book, course, video, tape,
software, cd, dvd, chart,
play-along, or any other
method whatsoever....
and then decide if we are
right to say that gsm is
conceivably the best
scales-learning method
on the planet!
