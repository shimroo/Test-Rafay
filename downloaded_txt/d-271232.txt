this beautiful young man, elijah mcclain, a violinist that spent his lunch breaks at local animal shelters, putting on concerts for cats and dogs because he believed music would help soothe their anxiety, passed away after being detained by police for “looking suspicious.” link in bio.





 


the only reason we are hearing about this is because of the video. link in bio.

“it seems that we are dealing with an invisible group of patients who are in danger of falling through the cracks after coronavirus. we have to prevent that." link in bio.
















“injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere”
i stand with my community against the systemic oppression that has existed from the beginning. #blacklivesmatter 
thank you to @radxmag for the photo and post.










i can’t breathe.
the rate at which black americans are killed by police is more than twice as high as the rate for white americans. this is a non-comprehensive list of deaths at the hands of police in the u.s. since eric garner's death in july, 2014. (npr)  #blacklivesmatter










“lady liberty”…. “love is the real liberty; we never feel free until we have learned to love.” r.m. edgar
inspired by my wish for an america that offers hope to all and a spirit of looking out for one another. 
does freedom mean it’s ok to not wear protection, because you don’t have symptoms and unknowingly pass a disease to someone else?  shouldn’t freedom = love for each other? 
wearing a mask doesn’t mean you are not free; you are protecting your and everyone’s loved ones….someone’s brother, child, doctor, and given the unpredictable nature of this disease--- you!

thank you, governor burgum of south dakota. if there is even a chance that you could help spread this virus, why would you risk it? 99,440 (us) and 347,858 worldwide deaths. how can we make this more real?  please, please protect each other. the life you save could be your child’s or your own.









today,  i mourn the loss of our brothers and sisters who have given their lives in the service of our country, risking everything to save us during this crisis. you are our angels and the best of humanity. 
and to james mahoney, a true hero, who had reached retirement and returned to treat covid patients; you are an angel of angels.  my condolences to the family and loved ones of james mahoney for your profound loss.










my deepest condolences to mrs. cooper-jones, mother of ahmaud arbery, and to the countless parents who have lost children due to hatred, bigotry and gun violence.










i want to wish all of our mothers a happy mother’s day. i hope you and your children are safe and well, there is no greater gift.










during these incredibly difficult times, i feel uncomfortable posting anything regarding my career. however, i want to express my appreciation to @debarros.paul for his review of “chimes of freedom” and @downbeat_mag for featuring our album in the hot box (june, 2020).










dear friends,
i hope that you and your loved ones are safe and healthy during these incredibly difficult times. i’m just writing to reach out  and tell you how much i appreciate you. 
what is going on is beyond anything that i’ve experienced in my lifetime, and i can only imagine what our first responders are going through, putting their lives on the line to try to save people. each day is more heart-wrenching than the last. these angels; these heroes need to be protected from the risk of this ravaging virus. 
i am so aware of our intense fragility as human beings as well as the indomitable spirit  that is in all of us. the deep love and kindness in people melts my heart.
i have no idea what the coming months will bring; hope we will see each other soon! 
please see the  link to “lady liberty” in bio. 
love,
lynne
