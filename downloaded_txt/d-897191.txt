pressure-enhanced splitting of density wave transitions in la3ni2o7–δ


the observation of superconductivity in la3ni2o7–δ under pressure, following the suppression of a high-temperature density wave state, has attracted considerable attention. the nature of this density wave order was not clearly identified. here we probe the magnetic response of the zero-pressure phase of la3ni2o7–δ as hydrostatic pressure is applied, and find that the apparent single density wave transition at zero applied pressure splits into two. the comparison of our muon-spin rotation ...

spin-orbit control of antiferromagnetic domains without a zeeman coupling


encoding information in antiferromagnetic (afm) domains is a promising solution for the ever growing demand in magnetic storage capacity. the absence of a macroscopic magnetization avoids crosstalk between different domain states, enabling ultrahigh density spintronics while being detrimental to the domain detection and manipulation. disentangling these merits and disadvantages seemed so far unattainable. we report evidence ...

anisotropic skyrmion and multi-q spin dynamics in centrosymmetric gd2pdsi3


skyrmions are particlelike vortices of magnetization with nontrivial topology, which are usually stabilized by dzyaloshinskii-moriya interactions (dmi) in noncentrosymmetric bulk materials. exceptions are centrosymmetric gd- and eu-based skyrmion-lattice (sl) hosts with zero dmi, where both the sl stabilization mechanisms and magnetic ground states remain controversial. we address these here by investigating both the static and dynamical spin properties  ...

concurrent operando neutron imaging and diﬀraction analysis revealing spatial lithiation phase evolution in an ultra-thick graphite electrode


energy-eﬃcient, safe, and reliable li-ion batteries (libs) are required for a wide range of applications. the introduction of ultra-thick graphite anodes, desired for high energy densities, meets limitations in internal electrode transport properties, leading to detrimental consequences. yet, there is a lack of experimental tools capable of providing a complete view of local processes. here, a multi-modal operando measurement approach is introduced, enabling quantitative spatio-temporal observations of li concentrations and intercalation phases in ultra-thick graphite electrodes.neutron imaging and diﬀraction concurrently provide ...

yba1−𝑥⁢sr𝑥⁢cufeo5 layered perovskites: an attempt to explore the magnetic order beyond the paramagnetic-collinear-spiral triple point



further information aboutquantum research

 
layered perovskites of general formula aa'cufeo5 are characterized by the presence of spiral magnetic phases whose ordering temperatures 𝑇spiral can be tuned far beyond room temperature by introducing modest amounts of cu/fe chemical disorder in the crystal structure. this rare property makes these materials prominent candidates to host multiferroicity and magnetoelectric coupling at temperatures suitable for applications. moreover, it has been proposed that the highest 𝑇spiral value that can be reached in this structural family ( ∼400 k) corresponds to a paramagnetic-collinear-spiral triple point with potential to show exotic physics. since generating high amounts of cu/fe disorder is experimentally difficult, the phase diagram region beyond the triple point has been barely explored. to fill this gap we investigate here eleven yba1−𝑥⁢sr𝑥⁢cufeo5 solid solutions (0≤𝑥≤1 ), where we replace ba with sr with the aim of enhancing the impact of the experimentally available cu/fe disorder. using a combination of bulk magnetization measurements, synchrotron x-ray and neutron powder diffraction we show that the spiral state with 𝐤𝑠=(1/2,1/2,1/2±𝑞) is destabilized beyond a critical sr content, being replaced by a fully antiferromagnetic state with ordering temperature 𝑇coll⁢2≥𝑇spiral and propagation vector 𝐤𝑐⁢2=(1/2,1/2,0). interestingly, both 𝑇spiral and 𝑇coll⁢2 increase with 𝑥 with comparable rates. this suggests a common, disorder-driven origin for both magnetic phases, consistent with theoretical predictions.

our facilities




swiss spallation neutron source sinq

neutron scattering techniques are highly versatile and powerful tools for studying the structure and dynamics of condensed matter. a wide scope of problems, ranging from fundamental to solid state physics and chemistry, and from materials science to biology, medicine and environmental science, can be investigated with neutrons. in addition to scattering, non-diffractive methods like imaging techniques allows for non-destructive inspection of materials and components, providing information on their internal structure, composition, and integrity with growing relevance also for industrial applications.







swiss muon source sμs

the swiss muon source – powered by the psi 590 mev cyclotron with a proton current of 2200 ma – is the world's most intense continuous beam muon source. the proton beam hits two graphite targets. attached to those are seven beamlines for muon (or pion) extraction, two of them are equipped with superconducting decay channels. the available muon energies range from 0.5 kev to 60 mev.







swiss research infrastructure for particle physics chrisp

with particle beams made up of pions, muons, neutrons, protons, and electrons, researchers are investigating how our universe is constructed. the swiss research infrastructure for particle physics – chrisp –  enables them to determine fundamental natural constants with the greatest precision and to look for deviations from the current standard model of particle physics.
