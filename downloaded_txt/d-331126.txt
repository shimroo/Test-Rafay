welcome
        to pipesfamily.com, my web page for the pipes family in the united
        states. 

 this site is dedicated to the history of our pipes forebears and
        their military service. our goals are to identify all persons named
        pipes who were born before 1900 and connect them to the proper branch of
        the family and to document as many military careers as possible. we also
        enjoy documenting our connections to the history of this great country.
        you will find pipes ancestors involved in almost every major historical
        event in  this country.

         an
        amazing story about wwii told by robert felton pipes. he was a waist
        gunner in a b24 liberator, shot down over europe and survived without
        capture.

		i offer my apologies for the "oldness" of this web page. i started it 
		many years ago, built it myself  and have upgraded the start page 
		several times. it needs it again and the added complexity of having it 
		fit on multiple platforms and screen sizes is challenging. old dogs need 
		to learn new tricks. i am working now on fixing broken links, converting 
		old ms word files and html files to pdfs. meanwhile all the data is 
		still there even if it is a little clunky. be patient please!
