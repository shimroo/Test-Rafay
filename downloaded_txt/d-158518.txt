      tom wilson is southern california artist with an extensive resume and a large family.click here for his full bio."tom's outlook on fame is impressive, his passion for pop art is infectious, and it appears he has exorcised the ghosts of the tannen clan with brush strokes and marvelous perspective." ~zeon santos, neatorama.com"in this thoughtful, reflective video essay, titled “i am pop art,” wilson explains how the art form that he loved as a child came to define his own existence as much as anything, and how he has—fittingly—responded to his status in the culture by embracing pop art itself." ~michael walsh, nerdist.com"now the actor tries to confront the daunting prospect of having become pop art by creating some therapeutic art of his own. not only is the art pretty cool, but it’s fascinating to see the actor deal with his kind of fame so bluntly and publicly." ~ethan anderton, slashfilm.com
