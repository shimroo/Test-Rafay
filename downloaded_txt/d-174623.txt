tradition and innovation in music
the creation of music has been an organic process
          since the dawn of humanity, and golden horn hopes to continue that
          tradition. we work with musicians who are enthusiastic, and we maintain
          mutual feelings of trust. every album we release is a product of
          collaboration and love.
