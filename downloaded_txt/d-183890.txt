welcome! first launched by darcy paquet in 1999, this site has grown with the help of many volunteers to provide a comprehensive introduction to korean cinema.

now screening in korea:


dark nuns dir. kwon hyuk-jae



a sequel of sorts to jang jae-hyun's 2015 hit the priests, which told the story of two priests carrying out an exorcism. this new film is by a different director and focuses on different characters, catholic nuns in particular. starring song hye-kyo (the glory) and jeon yeo-bin (cobweb), this film ranks as the biggest release of the lunar new year holiday.
