  what is the epiphany?
 the 
feast of the epiphany (january 6) is the day when we remember the arrival of the magi or wise men who followed a star to worship jesus. 
it begins the season of epiphany, which lasts until ash wednesday.  epiphany is the season when we remember the revelation of jesus to the world and to individuals.  during this season, we hear stories of the way that the light of christ spreads to the ends of the earth.
