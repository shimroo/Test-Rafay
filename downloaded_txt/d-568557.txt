richard and i had so much fun at the bowling alley. richard is a fantastic bowler. i always lost to him. we played four games until we couldn't bowl anymore. i really enjoyed seeing richard's laughter and fulfillment everytime he made a strike.

 febuary 11, 2007 :  7:30 am - 5:00 pmwow, disneyland has always been my favorite place to spent the day at. it's even better now that i got a chance to spend it with everyone in best buddies. i got to hang out with my best buddy richard along with the other buddies. my buddy really enjoyed some of the rides at disneyland. he said he would spent the night there if he'd the chance. moreover, richard and his friend darington really enjoyed the wacky hats we got them while we were checking out some of the shops at disneyland. brian and his buddy, darington got to experience the log ride and stars wars experience together. i thought disneyland was the best place to become best buddy with another.a special thank to eldon, our advisor and supervisor of progectteam. also, kevin izquierdo who is the president of best buddies. thank you for planning the event.good times.

	 a part of best buddies
	 
    


i had many fun times hanging out with my buddy. best buddies is one of the best experiences that i have ever had as a college student at uc riverside. i really enjoyed interacting and spending times with my buddy because he is really friendly and one of the most honest friend that i have found. even though he is intellectually disabled, he is not internally or integrity disabled. i have learned so much from my buddy that it is not only i that enhances his life on a one to one friendship, but it is also he that changed my life much more that anyone could have imagined.
