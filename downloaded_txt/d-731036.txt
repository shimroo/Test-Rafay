my name is lilly.  i have been collecting 
vintage costume or fashion jewelry since i was young without ever realizing it.    i have been studying, 
researching, and selling vintage costume jewelry since 1999.   
some of you may know me by  

liljep 
on ebay or my recently closed ebay store,  
 
jewels to auto 
parts.  i also had a store on 
ruby lane by the same name as this site, 
lilly's vintage jewelry!
vintage costume jewelry is a perfect way to go 
green!  recycling old jewelry that has style and high quality, what can be 
better.  vintage jewelry is amazing.  it was originally made for a 
season and considered throw away jewelry.  the quality and craftsmanship is 
a huge testament to the time that it has lasted.  the united states has 
lost most of this industry and the outcome is obvious.  most of today's 
fashion jewelry really is throw away in comparison to jewelry from the past.
i try to have a wide variety of pieces for 
everyone's different style.  you may find a few contemporary or some "real" 
pieces, but my main focus is vintage costume or fashion jewelry.  i love 
the flashy glitzy jewelry of the past.  the thermoplastics and lucite and 
bakelite pieces catch my attention.  the modernist jewelry is always 
interesting.  the patriotic jewels are always a favorite.  you will 
find the whimsical to the "real" look going through my site.  so you 
never know what i'll be adding next.  also remember that most, if not all, 
of the pieces i find, i only have 1 of.  so if you're thinking about it and 
planning to come back later - it may be gone!  we also take orders with 
payments by checks and money orders.  please see our 
order info page for 
more information.
i guess you can say that i'm as addicted to 
the research and books of vintage jewelry as much as the jewelry itself.  
check out my new book pieces page, i have a lot of books!
i 
am a proud member of the jewelry ring, vintage fashion and costume jewelry, 
collecting miriam haskell, 
and jewel collect groups.
