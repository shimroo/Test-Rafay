          from the scholarly to the working world
      


we study the cultures of africa and its diaspora from a variety of disciplinary perspectives. our course offerings focus on african societies as well as on african-descended communities of the united states, the caribbean, latin america, and other african diaspora communities around the world. the faculty of africana studies are all specialists of africana scholarship but trained in a variety of fields, among these literature, history, sociology, political studies, and anthropology. our courses are mostly interdisciplinary and designed to integrate scholarship on race, gender, and class. several of our courses are cross-listed with other units. we offer courses that fulfill the general education requirement as well as the intensive writing requirement.




















          congratulations to the class of 2024!

          message from the chair
      


"founded as a result of student activism, africana studies at rutgers-newark is one of the nation's pioneering departments. we are committed to bringing together a diverse community of students, scholars, and artists interested in better understanding the experiences and contributions of people of african descendants globally. our name and focus have evolved over the decades, but our original passion for studying africa and african descendants remains at the center of what we do."
darién j. davis 
professor and chair of africana studies
