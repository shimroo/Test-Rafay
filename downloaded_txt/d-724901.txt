welcome to our genealogy site
we're so pleased you dropped in to visit our site. we've worked for years on this family and its connections to our ancestors. these trees encompass royal, presidential, quaker, native american, mayflower and jamestown lineages all the way back to the beginning of written history. the 9000+ biographies under the notes sections are the treasures of this site. the human genome project has determined that we are all related to each other by the year 1200. it is my sincere hope that you find out how we are cousins. enjoy.







the chosen
we are the chosen. in each family there are some whom seem called to find the ancestors, to put flesh on their bones and make them live again. doing genealogy is not a cold gathering of facts but, instead, breathing life into all who have gone before. we are the story tellers of the tribe. we have been called, as it were, by our genes. those who have gone before cry out to us: tell our story. so, we do. in finding them, we somehow find ourselves.

stephen hopkins
he was the only person on the mayflower who also was in jamestown. his life makes for exciting reading as his ship was stranded on an island they named bermuda. they were on their way to the new world in what did become the jamestown settlement. he is attributed with trying to establish a "democratic" process in bermuda, and for the main ideas in the mayflower compact. the world owes him much.










remember allerton
remember allerton was just five years old on the mayflower. she and her two siblings lost their mother and baby brother in the first winter. half the mayflower passengers died the first year. they were rationed at 6 kernels of corn per person per day so it's no wonder. remember was six at our country's first thanksgiving.










pocahontas 
matoaka "pocahontas" rebecca had an extremely difficult life after befriending the british at jamestown. she was kidnapped by them and displayed to gain funding by the british in england. she was converted to christianity, married to john rolfe (even though she was married to a member of her tribe and had 2 small children at the time), and died at age 21 on the beginning of their voyage back to jamestown. we descend from her daughter, ka-okee.










marmaduke coate
likely born in 1738 in hunterdon co, new jersey, he was the 3rd generation of coates to make their way in america. when he was a child, his playmate, mary jane coppock, was captured by indians. when age 18, he had the bravery to ride from tribe to tribe to find her. he bought her back from the natives with his horse, bridle, and saddle. he and mary are our ancestors. this is the story that got me into the wonderful hobby of genealogy.







we tell their story

		my parents used to tell me stories about their ancestors: the story of marmaduke coate who bought his wife for a horse, bridle, and saddle; the story of my cousin-the president; the story of my grandfather who built a whole street of homes with  his hands. it's these rich stories that gave me the love of a lifelong hobby, that i highly recommend. it has brought me pure pleasure. who knew we'd be connected to almost all the continents in the world, to royalty, to most of the us presidents, to the mayflower, to jamestown and to famous souls like pocahontas. i'm proud of our family's resilience. i hope that my descendants will carry on this wonderful tradition as they incorporate their own expanded families.
