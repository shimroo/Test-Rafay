    joy in work
  





at the heart of any meaningful work is joy. not always easy to find—too many distractions. money, for one. fun to have. not the same as joy.last year was a grind—so much that i turned to consultants, art therapists, and courses on creativity and art, anything to rediscover the joy of making. i used to roll my eyes at the word self-care. my motto was simple: just work harder. i even had a t-shirt made.turns out, i was wrong. i’m still working. a lot. sometimes more, sometimes less. but with a focus on writing. the difference is, i’ve started making space for joy. doing things that help me experience it in the work itself. and lately, it’s been working.except—we’re close to signing a deal with an american company (american is a loaded word these days). it’s pulling me back into the podcast world, complicating the simplicity i’ve been building. a steady revenue stream should be an enabler.but the act of making money? it’s rarely joyful.unless, of course, that is what brings you joy.which is why so many others are rich.and i am not.

    blackouts
  





i’ve been sitting here for 30 minutes. this is my time to be creative, to practice writing—but i’m at a loss. the blank page has won today. but i have managed a quick thought.the recent blackout here in montague reminds me of a certain kind of leadership.sitting in my studio during these freezing winter days takes a lot of electricity to stay warm. and after years of pushing electrification as the preferred energy source, the government—celebrating their success—seems to have forgotten one critical detail: the strain this shift would place on the power grid. now, in the dead of winter, we’re being told to cut back on electricity use.there’s always this disconnect between big ideas and the realities of making them work. a good leader—the kind we need—sells the vision but also prepares for the challenges that come with it.i think this might be called pragmatic realism—a leadership style that balances inspiration with practicality. the best leaders paint an appealing picture of the future, getting people on board with their vision. but they don’t stop there. instead of ignoring potential obstacles, they acknowledge them and plan accordingly.unfortunately, our provincial leadership seems stuck in tactical thinking rather than strategic planning. they’ve done well in moving people toward their vision—but they haven’t at all prepared for the grid’s breaking point. and so, during the blackout, we sat in the cold, wondering why no one saw this coming.

    the great accident
  





after the great accident--when the technocrats, in all their brilliance, erased every identity--life was reduced to paper, a fragile record of existence. but as the last bureaucrat sifted through the endless files, she realized the regime wasn't just documenting disappearances--it was making them happen, one shredded life at a time, until the day her own name slipped from the machine and landed at her feet.

    memory
  





i never understood retirement.why work so hard for something that may never come? the phrase i remember hearing was always the same: work hard now so you can start living later. but why not start living immediately?my memory is failing. once, i had a vivid, multisensory recollection—one of my strongest. it was the moment we first arrived in taiwan, exhausted and utterly unprepared for what lay ahead. the airport doors slid open, and we were swallowed whole by the heat, the humidity, the press of bodies, the noise. and a smell—eucalyptus, maybe. i used to remember it all so clearly. but now? the noise is gone. the scent, vanished.it reminds me of the fading newspaper clipping on my fridge. a photograph of my mother standing beside some politician. politics always seemed woven into the fabric of island summers. but now, the ink has almost disappeared, the faces barely discernible. a memory dissolving into nothing.another memory—once powerful—was the moment i stood outside the operating room, waiting. a nurse handed me catriona, newborn, wrapped tight, placing her in my arms as if i knew what i was doing. i used to remember everything: the overwhelming emotion, the tingling in my hands, the metallic scent of iron, the sheer helplessness of it all. now? i have pictures somewhere.we spent a lifetime in taiwan, traveling across asia. i saw more in a single day than i might have in months back home. and yet, it’s all slipping away. the experiences, once vivid, are now images on paper. a life of motion and discovery seems somehow less permanent than a life of accumulating things.did i make a mistake, choosing experience over security? escaping the endless race toward “someday”?maybe that’s why people strive for retirement. not just to rest, but to collect moments they can hold onto—memories strong enough to carry them into whatever comes next.

    abyss 
  





you look out the window. someone is balanced on the edge. not quite standing, not quite falling. you’ve seen this before—variations of it—but still, you watch. it isn’t normal to walk so close to the cliff’s lip, but normal has lost its shape, its meaning. maybe it was never more than a word, stretched to fit whatever people needed it to be.you should call out. you don’t. your voice catches somewhere between thought and breath. they waver, teasing the abyss, a hesitation too deliberate to be accidental. it reminds you of something—an old story, a history lesson—but history doesn’t repeat itself, does it?surely, they will right themselves. people wanted to take down the warning signs, after all. maybe they believed the danger had passed. maybe they just didn’t like to be reminded.so you stay at the window, watching, waiting.—-since starting the microfiction course, i have made it a daily habit to write a story, or a brief reflection as quickly and concisely as possible. this morning, as i skimmed the headlines on bluesky, this image came to mind. the casualness with which today’s media reports on what would once have been unthinkable is striking—horrors reduced to passing updates, framed with the same detachment as the weather.

    coffee and the search for tasting note nirvana
  





other than a brief and ridiculous flirtation with tea, i have been a coffee drinker all my life. lately, this addiction has taken on a whole new dimension as i spend whatever disposable income i have on fresh-roasted beans, chasing elusive tasting notes—funky, fruity, or spicy. the search has become something of an expensive obsession, rarely satisfied but always compelling.i blame this love of coffee on the excellent roasters that emerged in hsinchu when we lived there. they introduced me to espresso, which i seldom drink now, and hinted at wonderful notes of star anise. at ink coffee, they would sometimes even place a bit of the spice directly in the latte. it was wonderful. when i was working from home in the science park, i frequented a local roaster whose entire shop was no larger than our apartment living room, sampling various light-roasted beans from around the world. back then, i settled on kenyan beans.since returning to canada, i’ve become obsessed with pour-over, buying bag after bag of beans every month. with so many independent roasters in canada, i’m never short on options. whenever we visit a new city, the first thing we do is seek out the local roaster so we can bring some beans home. at the center of this obsession is the desire to experience the flavors that the roaster promises—sometimes with frustrating inconsistency. i once bought a bag of geisha from the shed in charlottetown that tasted explicitly of strawberry jam. but finding flavors that clear and distinct since then has been rare. the coffee is almost always excellent, but when the bag says i should taste melon, i want to taste melon!over time, i’ve realized that in chasing these tasting notes, i’ve built a ritual—one that forces me to slow down, practice patience, and carve out a quiet moment away from screens and the endless shouting of the people online. it’s now more about the pause, process and the stillness it brings to my day.

    microfiction course
  





i just finished a short course on writing microfiction with marion lougheed, a former montague native now living in spain. i learned about the course through her mother, blanche, via the montague writers group facebook page. it was a wonderful experience, and marion fostered a supportive and engaging group—no small feat, especially over zoom.microfiction is a style of storytelling that focuses on brevity, typically under 300 words, though there are no hard rules. i’ve added this to my daily writing routine, and so far, it feels like a manageable challenge. writing such short, contained stories allows me to focus only on what is essential to convey the narrative—to be more economical with words. it also gives me the freedom to explore different characters, experiment with structures, and, most importantly, have fun.there’s also a practical application. these stories will find their way onto the sleep tight stories youtube channel, tiktok, and social media.but what i find most rewarding is that, for the first time, i’m actually writing down the stories that have been in my head for years. i’ve always had these silly ideas floating around—similar in tone to one i wrote during the class—but i never had a manageable way to bring them to life. at 300 words, a story feels possible. a novel? too daunting.

    creator contract complexities
  





i’ve signed many contracts over the years. the easiest were based on a conversation, a handshake, and the mutual need to maintain good relationships. employment contracts were generally clear and backed by labor laws, though over time, many grew more complex with non-disclosure and non-compete clauses.as an independent contractor, contracts became longer but remained clear, with deliverables on both sides plainly defined. their primary purpose was to set expectations and protect both parties.now, as someone working as a “creator”—a term i neither appreciate nor ever applied to myself—contracts have become bloated, opaque, and one-sided. unless you’re delivering millions of dollars in value, the other party holds all the leverage. these agreements are no longer about defining terms of work; they are designed to ensure that, if a dispute arises, the larger party wins. what is a small independent going to do? spend a fortune on legal fees to challenge an unfair deal?for what should be simple working relationships, contracts have become needlessly convoluted. i’ve had to hire lawyers just to navigate them. our first legal firm was expensive and knowledgeable but ultimately provided little value. the second offers a better price but moves slowly, and adds complexity to an already difficult process. they aim to level the playing field, but that’s not possible. what i need is simple: will this contract cause harm?we could avoid working with outside companies altogether and stay fully independent, but that would mean turning down revenue streams that help smooth out the peaks and valleys.this is the choice many small independent creative companies face—sign an unbalanced contract and hope for the best or walk away from opportunities that could sustain their business. the question is whether there’s a middle ground, or if the modern contract has simply become a tool to reinforce power imbalances.

    have people collectively started hallucinating? 
  





i'm not a great listener. i've trained myself, and others, on how to be one, but it's never come naturally to me. especially around the dinner table, where my mind always seems to wander.my goal has been to avoid the draining effect of the constant noise, anger, and hate that flood online spaces. of course, if you only watch cat videos, you might never see anything but innocence.  but yesterday, i fell into an old habit. i spent time listening to a couple of short speeches, and while the comment sections were overwhelmingly positive, there was also the expected wave of anger that comes with public figures. but did anyone actually listen? i did. i even transcribed what they said, and the interesting part was that they said nothing. the questions weren't answered, and the responses were largely nonsense. but it was well-spoken nonsense--delivered with perfect intonation, a flair for the dramatic, and absolute conviction. i realize that social media promotes surface-level engagement rather than deep critical thinking. but why do people agree so readily? several psychological concepts help explain this. the bullshit receptivity effect (aptly named) suggests that people often perceive vague or meaningless statements as profound. then there's motivated reasoning, where individuals unconsciously fill in the blanks with their own beliefs, making weak or empty statements seem meaningful. in thinking, fast and slow, daniel kahneman explains that when a statement is easy to process--whether due to clarity, repetition, or the confidence of the speaker--people are more likely to accept it as true. we see this in canadian political ads recently (we all know what's important to pierre poilievre).when statements are vague enough, they can mean anything to anyone, allowing people to project their own beliefs onto them. so perhaps this isn't a hallucination, but a shared illusion--where empty words feel profound, conviction replaces truth, and we find ourselves nodding along, mistaking noise for meaning.maybe it's time we start listening more intently, before we resign ourselves to a future built on nothing but well-spoken nonsense.

    killer bees
  





i wasn't a true believer. i just went along for the show. my aunt and uncle said it was the best entertainment to be had around here, and well, i wanted to see what the fuss was all about. we found a clean patch of grass and set up our chairs. my uncle, always prepared, popped open a beer from the cooler.first came the music--loud, twangy, and grating. not my cup of tea. then the platitudes, the kind that made the crowd clap without thinking. the man next to us clapped too hard, his palms red and raw, like he'd been practicing all day.and then the speech began. the voice droned, low and steady, like the hum of an old machine that just kept going. it wasn't the words that mattered--half the sentences drifted past, disconnected, senseless. but the crowd cheered anyway, as though the sound itself was enough to move them.that's when i heard it. a faint hum, at first, like a single bee circling too close. out here in the countryside, bees, bugs, they're just part of the air. but this sound grew louder. angrier. it pressed against you, filling the space with a vibration you could feel in your chest.and then it took shape.a swarm. a massive, coordinated cloud, moving in perfect synchrony, shifting and twisting like a murmuration over a field. it should've been beautiful.except insects don't usually explode.the stage was gone in an instant, swallowed in a flash of light and sound. smoke curled where it had been, rising into the sky like a signal. i wanted to run, but i couldn't. my uncle's beer toppled, foam spilling into the dirt.the crowd screamed, but i didn’t hear it. everything felt distant, unreal.that was the beginning of the end.
