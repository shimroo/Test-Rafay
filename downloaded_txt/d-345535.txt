history of the old north church

old north’s fame began on the evening of april 18, 1775, when the church sexton, robert newman, and vestryman capt. john pulling, jr. climbed the steeple and held high two lanterns as a signal from paul revere that the british were marching to lexington and concord by sea across the charles river and not by land. this momentous event ignited the american revolution. built in 1723, christ church in the city of boston, known to all as the old north church, is boston’s oldest surviving church building and one of the city’s most visited historic sites. in 1775, on the eve of the revolution, a substantial number of congregants were loyal to the british king, and many held official positions in the royal government, including the royal governor of massachusetts, making robert newman’s loyalty to the patriot cause even more extraordinary. each year we welcome over 500,000 visitors to our site to experience this unique and stirring monument to liberty.

a house of prayer for all people



the old north church (formally christ church) is the oldest episcopal (anglican) church in boston. we were established over 300 years ago in 1723, more than 50 years before the american revolution and the church’s famous lantern signal. the congregation and clergy seek to keep faithful to the mission of openness and welcome proclaimed by our first rector, the rev. dr. timothy cutler, in his inaugural sermon of 1723 on the text from isaiah, “my house shall be called a house of prayer for all people” (isaiah 56:7).
old north’s multicultural and intergenerational community is inspired by our history and committed to gospel principles of justice and service, striving to shine beacons of light in our neighborhood, city, and the world. we are dedicated to learning from our past in order to be a more faithful, inclusive, and loving community today, nourished and sustained by scripture, sacraments, music, fellowship, and outreach beyond our walls. learn more about the old north congregation here.
whether you are here to worship with us during a visit to boston or are seeking a spiritual home, please know we are delighted to welcome you to old north church. we offer both in-person and virtual worship.
sunday services are held at 11am and are open to all. with regular visitors from across the country and world, advanced reservations for sunday worship assist in our weekly planning. please click here to reserve, or contact the church office via email:congregation@oldnorth.com.

a site of conscience






old north church historic site has been designated as a site of conscience by the international coalition of sites of conscience (icsc). with over 350 members in 65 countries, the icsc is the only global network helping historic sites, museums, and memory initiatives connect past struggles to today’s movements for human rights and social justice. each member abides by the icsc’s four operating principles:
1. interpret history through site.
2. engage the public in programs that stimulate dialogue on pressing social issues.
3. share opportunities for public involvement and positive action on the issues raised at the site.
4. promote justice and universal cultures of human rights.
we are grateful for this meaningful recognition from the icsc and we are eager to continue our work of illuminating the past as we build a brighter future.
