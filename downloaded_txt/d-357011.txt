what our clients say
									






											steve and his crew have been performing landscape maintenance for over ten years.  his firm provides reliable excellent service.										

cheryl s.
airmont, ny




											we started off with landscaping the front of our house.  it started with his landscape designer coming out to our property, discussing our needs and our vision.  dave shortly thereafter put together an awesome rendering.  he followed through the project from conception to completion.  we love our property.										

dina
rivervale, nj


 

											my husband and i have been using steve’s lawns for a number of years now.  my previous landscaper left me in a bind one snow storm.  i called steve’s lawns to plow for me going forward.  they were very prompt and reliable.  since then they have redone our front entryway with stone veneer, resolved multiple drainage issues, and two years ago installed travertine around my pool.  i would highly recommend steve and his team.										

tony l
saddle river, nj




											i wanted to take this opportunity to thank steve’s lawns for doing such a wonderful job maintaining the grounds at my corporate park.										

walter m
mahwah, nj


 

											we never had a landscaper that actually answered the phone and showed up on time for appointments.  what a pleasure to finally have found a professional company to deal with.										

susan l
new city, ny




											most recently we decided to have a pond rebuilt.  we had a pond built in our backyard a little over a year ago by another landscape contractor.  it looked very out of proportion to our house and began to leak water a few months after installed.  steve’s landscape architect dave visited my home and redesigned our backyard.  it included a beautiful elevated patio made from porcelain with a bluestone inlay, built in bbq, and a new pond-less water feature.  steve and his crew did an exceptional job.  they are always there for us!										

david b
airmont, ny


 

											what an amazing crew.  they always keep my property neat and clean.										

shira
orangeburg, ny




											just saw steve and his family in the journal news.  i have known steve since he was fourteen when he first started mowing my lawn.  he is probably one of the most honest hard working individuals i have ever known.  what a shame to see how local government can act wrongfully with no consequence.  please support steve as i do.    see recent lohud article http://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/rockland/ramapo/2016/07/12/chestnut-ridge-landscaper/86981282/
