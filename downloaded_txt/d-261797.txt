                by matt hicks with its cavernous corridors, damp empty cells and
                peeling walls, it’s unsurprising that this philadelphia
                former prison is a popular destination for filmmakers and
                tourists alike. completed in 1836, the radial style and solitary
                confinement policy of eastern state penitentiary (e.s.p.) were a

                by gavin slack if you asked someone to tell you about the moon,
                they would almost certainly reply “there’s nothing
                to tell, it’s just a lifeless, boring rock that orbits the
                earth”. this is one of the biggest commonest
                mis-conceptions. the moon is far from being a “lifeless,
                boring rock”,...

                the myrtles plantation was built in 1794 by general david
                bradford and remains today an excellent example of antebellum

                by martin jeffrey ghosts are a multi-faceted phenomenon that
                deserves to be classified as a range of different events. many
                ghost sightings are readily explained as individuals who appear
                out of their normal location or time; often the ghost also seems
                to change the surroundings of the witness, giving the...
