mermaids of sxm

mermaid diving is a world with one foot in reality and the other in 
			fantasy. the padi mermaid program is designed for non-divers and 
			divers alike, from as young as 7 years old. although this experience 
			shares techniques and equipment used in scuba and freediving, 
			mermaid diving (or 'mermaiding') is its own form of diving.

let's go diving!

the waters of st. maarten / st. martin and the surrounding islands offer 
		very interesting and varied scuba diving at moderate depths, which means 
		easy and relaxed diving and snorkeling. besides numerous varieties of 
		reef fish, you are likely to see great barracudas, tarpon, flying 
		gurnard, moray eels, snake eels (there are no sea snakes in the 
		caribbean), stingrays, spotted eagle rays, sharks - both 
		nurse and reef, turtles, lobster, and a lot of macro critters. there are 
		numerous well established coral reef systems with a wide variety of 
		beautiful soft and hard corals in pristine condition.
dive / sail vacations!
for those of you who love to sail, st. maarten / st. martin is the ideal 
		destination for a sail / dive vacation. st. maarten / st. martin is home 
		to the major yacht charter companies, among them, sunsail, the 
		moorings, horizon yacht charter and dream yacht charter. we offer a 
free guide to scuba diving from your yacht in the 
		waters of st. maarten / st. martin and the surrounding islands which 
		gives general information and details on over 14 great dive sites 
		located just a short, safe dinghy ride from the best yacht anchorages.





dive trips around st. maarten




for a morning 2 tank dive - st maarten offers 
				some really great diving along the south coast. with a 
				combination of reefs and wrecks there is something for everyone. 
				fish life is varied and quite prolific and the shark, turtle and 
				stingray population is abundant  especially the sharks in the 
				man of war shoal marine park area. dives are generally kept to 
				45 minutes to minimize the surface interval. with an average 
				depth of 55ft and very little current our sites are considered 
				easy profile; however these dive sites are all ¼ to ¾ miles 
				off the coast and as such are considered open ocean dive 
				sites.
				dive sites are decided on the morning of the dive as they are 
				weather dependent, and the site chosen may change on the way out 
				if another dive boat is already on that mooring. generally the 
				dive boat tries to take you to the best site for the day  after 
				all the dive masters want to have a good dive too :)

for an afternoon single tank dive - while the dive shops 
				sometimes schedule a single dive to the above sites, most single 
				tank dive trips, discover scuba and training dives will often be 
				to little bay. this dive site is a nice, shallow, inshore dive 
				site that all the dive shops use for training. surface 
				conditions are always calm. visibility, averaging 40 to 50ft, is 
				not as good as the off shore dive sites. while this dive site 
				does have a diverse fish population, and can have turtles and 
				even spotted eagle rays, it does not have the sharks and larger 
				fish and coral population you will find on the deeper sites.
