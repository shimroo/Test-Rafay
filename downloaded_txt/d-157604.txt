liberty to the captives                                                       our purpose













the spirit of the lord god is upon me; because the lord hath 
anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the 
brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the 
prison to them that are bound. isaiah 61:1
by god's grace, gary and lisa ruby are committed to stand fast for 
the truth and give a complete witness to the things that god has commanded us to 
share.
