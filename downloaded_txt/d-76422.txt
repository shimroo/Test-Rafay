"fantastic 
    screen capture app!"
    this feature-rich little app includes everything you 
    could possibly wish for in a screen capturing program, including built-in 
    graphic tools, multiple undo's, and the capability of saving the screenshots 
    as bmp, jpeg, or gif. i frequently add arrows or other highlighting to my 
    screen prints so usually take the bmp file into psp to add graphics, however 
    with this program all the graphic tools i need are included. smooth, 
    professional installation process, works great with xp, and uninstaller is 
    built in.

"great screen 
    capture tool!"
    i was looking for an easy to use screen capture tool, and this works great. 
    i wanted to take a picture of a java applet, so i downloaded this, installed 
    it and had my first image in under a minute. great tool!

"this utility 
    is wonderful!"
    i have used corel draw, paint shop pro, and several other packages, but for 
    quick and dirty capture (i almost always use rectangle area) this is the best for the money. thanks!!!
