a rich brewing traditionwelcome to bohemian brewery, makers of utah’s finest lager beers since 2001. brewing in bohemia — part of present day czech republic & bavaria — dates back to 900ad. the discipline of “lagering” slowly developed over several centuries, and in 1842 the legendary bavarian brewer josef groll created the first batches of modern pilsner using traditional techniques with new paler malts. it is from these deep roots that bohemian brewery lagers owe their heritage to. originally from czechoslovakia, joe petras brought the old-world tradition of european lager brewing to utah, and since 2001 we have continued perfecting the art. 100% locally owned and operated, at bohemian we are brewing heritage. na zdravi!  













unique brewsfrom old central-european lagering traditions, to newer brew styles, there's a bohemian lager beer with your name on it.













cozy environmentwhen you visit us at the brewery you'll get a feel for the cozy, old-world confines and genuine hospitality that define our roots.

brian ericksenhead brewerafter growing up in wyoming, brian moved here to attend the university of utah. while in school, he fell in love with utah's mountains and deserts, and he also learned to homebrew. but what started as an occasional hobby spiraled out of control; he needed something more. his next move was to the napa valley, where he studied the ins and outs of winemaking, another passion of his. while the winery was a valuable experience, it also reassured brian that he was a brewer. in 2009, brian moved back to utah and joined the bohemian family where he has been "lagering" ever since.
