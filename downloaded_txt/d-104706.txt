what is psi?
psi (psychosomatic integration) is an overall evidence-based treatment approach for working with complex trauma and dissociation, that addresses the root causes of trauma-based symptoms and fragmentation, and so results in long term recovery. highly effective psychological and somatic techniques are woven into a carefully staged treatment approach, which systematically integrates significant relationships into the treatment process. psi seeks to heal early experiences of abandonment, neglect, trauma, and attachment loss, that otherwise tend to play out repetitively and cyclically throughout the lifespan in relationship struggles. it is unique in that it approaches the body first (bottom-up processing) but also works to reinstate systems of meaning.

what is psi?
psi (psychosomatic integration) is an overall evidence-based treatment approach for working with complex trauma and dissociation, that addresses the root causes of trauma-based symptoms and fragmentation, and so results in long term recovery. highly effective psychological and somatic techniques are woven into a carefully staged treatment approach, which systematically integrates significant relationships into the treatment process. psi seeks to heal early experiences of abandonment, neglect, trauma, and attachment loss, that otherwise tend to play out repetitively and cyclically throughout the lifespan in relationship struggles. it is unique in that it approaches the body first (bottom-up processing) but also works to reinstate systems of meaning.


 1.   bodily mindfulness therapiesaddress the bottom-up processing that so often renders verbal psychotherapy ineffective. they are particularly powerful when used to help couples and families become aware of their non-verbal communications and automatic reactions and gain more mastery over them.  they also assist survivors of trauma to ground and cope with their frequent experiences of both hyper-activation (overwhelm) and hypo-activation (dissociation). sensorimotor psychotherapy  draws from somatic therapies, neuroscience, attachment theory, as well as from the hakomi method, a gentle psychotherapeutic approach pioneered by ron kurtz. (http://www.hakomi.com/).


2. ego state work including the dnmseveryone has ego states - parts of self that take on different roles and functions. states that seal off due to trauma or attachment injury can be at odds with one another, and this can cause many of the symptoms survivors present with (e.g. "part of me wants this, but another part wants the opposite").  ego state therapy brings these states into harmony so that all parts of self cooperate to attain desired goals. the dnms, created by shirley jean schmidt, is a type of ego state therapy that helps resourced parts of self repair internal relationships that were based on needs not having been met adequately in the past. these resourced ego states learn to reparent regressed parts of self so they are no longer trapped in the past or inappropriately dependent on others.


.3.   family systems and attachment repairattachment repair and systemic intervention into current troubled relationships provides an opportunity to work through harm from past dysfunctional relationships and to experience and internalise secure forms of attachment in the present. it encourages awareness and healing of the primary relationships in the individual’s life.


4.   trauma workmoving traumatic memories from non-verbal re-enactments into stories that can be verbalised and left in the past, helps survivors to live and thrive in the present.
