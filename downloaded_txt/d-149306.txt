doe rules brochure 














 











electronically commutated motors (ecm) offer high efficiency and energy conservation 









electronically commutated motors are comprised of a brushless permanent magnet (bpm) motor integrated with an electronic control module which precisely drives the ec motor’s permanent magnet rotor, providing a more energy-efficient operation. ec motors are an excellent, cost-effective way to boost an hvac system’s overall efficiency.
