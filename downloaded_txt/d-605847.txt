awakening the truth frequency: into the unified field
$19.95 $16.95
by laura eisenhower if you aren’t living your most authentic self, you can’t realize universal and personal truth. if we compromise and waver in our integrity, how on earth will we successfully navigate life or our relationships?  we become vulnerable to distortions and imbalances that attract archonic attachments and ai signals, that keep us in a lower existence of reality. we have lost touch with our connection to our higher mind and intuitive abilities and its integration into our daily life.  the quickest way to heal is for awakening the truth frequency to embody our highest self.  our bodies thrive in this energy, not the distortions or programs.  and now more than ever before, we live in times when our energies are supported by spiritual forces like never before. we must be humble enough to allow this alignment and let go of the ego attachments about what other people think, and not be afraid to admit where we have been misled. claiming our truth eases our journey into the unified field.

awakening of a warrior: past lives of a navy seal remembered
$24.95 $19.95
by michael jaco michael jaco’s past life autobiography is unlike any other. it travels back through the great wars in ancient india, egypt, greece, and rome. it is an epic and thrilling story of kings and generals, philosophers and religious leaders. it is an autobiography of his being, as it has reincarnated into many lives throughout history. numerous great thinkers have believed in the transmigration of the soul. general george patton, gandhi, henry ford, the dalai lama, all discussed memories of, or beliefs in, having past lives. the great philosophers pythagoras, socrates, plato, aristotle, and even saint augustine believed in the rebirth of the soul. awakening of a warrior is the result of jaco’s investigation—his treasure hunt—into the lifetimes he experienced before the present. included are his lives as king abimelech of gerar, who allied with abraham in the creation of a new religion called judaism; cyrus the great, who unified all of persia and implemented zoroastrianism as the state religion; and marcus furius camillus, who came to be considered the second founder of rome.

beyond esoteric: escaping prison planet
$19.95 $18.95
by brad olsen nothing in this world works the way we are led to believe it does—there is always more to the story. be aware that there is a war being waged for our body, mind and soul. owners of corporations have taken over governments in a new form of fascism that now incorporates high technology and artificial intelligence. the survival of the human race may depend on breaking the truth embargo, that is, exposing the big lie (the fascist style takeover) and collectively developing an übermind. everything we think we know about the universe and the planet in which we live, whatever we have been led to believe concerning the course of human history, could very well be completely wrong or, at best, contain distorted facts and disinformation. the 19th century teachers of the occult could never have imagined this kind of critical need for escaping prison planet in the 21st century—one that extends far beyond esoteric.

modern esoteric: beyond our senses (2nd edition)
$17.95 $16.95
by brad olsen in this age of mass deception, truth seekers must look beyond the current established models of information dissemination. the term “esoteric” implies knowledge available to a select few. those who venture deep into the annals of history in search of answers to life’s eternal questions comprise the ranks of the modern mystery schools, or those who seek to understand the forbidden subjects beyond our senses. “the truth is not just a casualty of war but of peace. the official narrative is controlled by an elite few to ensure that the real truth remains hidden within a culture of secrecy. we tend to live more in fear than in love, but california-based travel author turned conspiracy writer brad olsen hasn’t given up on the belief that the truth will be revealed and that humanity can create a utopia based on love and compassion. ” –nexus

key to solomon’s key: is this the lost symbol of masonry? (2nd edition)
$16.95 $15.95
by lon milo duquette the popularity of dan brown’s da vinci code has ignited an explosion of public interest in freemasonry and the role this ancient and secretive fraternity has played in the untold history of western civilization. what (if any) is masonry’s connection to the intrigues of the knights templar — the crusading order of military monks condemned for heresy and sorcery in the 14th century? did the templars, as so many modern commentators are suggesting, really possess a secret so astonishing that it threatened the very existence of the church of rome, and the monarchies of europe whose power rested upon the “divine right of kings?” “the purpose of masonry’s veneration of solomon is not to advance an alternate view of history, but to present, however subtly, the archetype of the future human being — men and women who truly possess solomon’s key — the power to master our own demons and redirect their destructive energy to build the temple of our own evolving soul.” –lon milo duquette
