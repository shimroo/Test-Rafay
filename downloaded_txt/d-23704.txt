imagine nixa
you spoke, we listened. we have a plan.

                      the city listened to its citizens in the development of this plan by inviting everyone who loves this community to help us imagine nixa’s future. the plan was drafted by the strategic planning advisory committee (made up of 15 nixa residents) who worked with city staff to review the community input and ensure the plan addresses the challenges facing the community and the municipal government.
