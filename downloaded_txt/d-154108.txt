vote no to issue #1 - stop gerrymandering















vote no on issue 1: protect butler county's gop values!issue 1 is a threat to our fair representation in ohio! this dangerous proposal would allow politicians to rig districts through gerrymandering—a tactic where electoral boundaries are manipulated to benefit one party, diluting the power of our votes.for butler county, this means less accountability and the risk of having our conservative voices drowned out. republicans here value integrity, local control, and fair elections. issue 1 threatens all of that. it puts power in the hands of bureaucrats in columbus, not the citizens of butler county. voting no on issue 1 is the only way to ensure our community keeps the strong gop representation it deserves.don’t let politicians choose their voters—stand for fair elections and vote no on issue 1 to protect our future! download the flyer and share across all social media!
