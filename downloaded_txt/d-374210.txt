we had such a great experience with outer banks blue realty. the website is user friendly and their selection of properties in the outer banks is outstanding. i was able to find a ‚Äújust right‚Äù house for our family in corolla. it had everything we needed and so much more. obb checked in a few times via text to be sure we were good during our stay and we knew how to contact them if we needed anything. it was the easiest checkout process ever as well. we are already looking forward to next year and making more memories. thank you so much!

as an obx homeowner, i cannot say enough positive things about outer banks blue. we have tried several rental agencies over the years and blue is by far the best. their knowledge, work ethic, and responsiveness is unsurpassed... i highly recommend obx blue to any homeowners looking for a rental management company moving forward. you will not be disappointed. all of the obx rental companies will tell you that they can make a difference. blue will absolutely make a difference.

amazing week at legacy! we have been to the outer banks many times, but the first time for us using outer banks blue. i have to say that this is the cleanest house we have ever stayed in. everything exceeded our expectations and we can't wait to book for next year with them!

my whalehead (corolla nc) property has been in the obb rental program since 2005. service is always top notch. altogether a great team, led by tim cafferty. my property is well-maintained by their team - and leads to great reviews from our rental clients. if you're an owner...get into their program; if you're a prospective renter...this is the place to rent from. no doubt.

we have rented from multiple companies over about 20 years. we will always be renting from blue from now on. the houses are always clean and cared for. issues are rare. but when one does arise, they are handled quickly, with the guest's convenience in mind.

i was skeptical renting from a rental company i‚Äôve never rented with before, however, this is one of the best management companies i‚Äôve rented from! we stayed at five lucky ducks. the reservation staff were very helpful when booking, and the house itself was everything we hoped for! very clean & as described! i will definitely be renting with outer banks blue again. thank you for exceeding my expectations! üòä

we recently stayed with outer banks blue at "boardwalk" in kill devil hills, and what a fabulous experience it was! from beginning to end, their team took amazing care of us - we felt as if we were staying with old friends!¬†if you want a stay where you are treated like family, these are the people for you! thank you, obb!

this was our second year staying at sea spray, and our fourth year renting from outer banks blue...¬†i‚Äôve always found their staff to be easy to work with, and they don‚Äôt tack on a bunch of extra fees like a lot of other agencies do. we‚Äôre already planning on booking sea spray again for next year!
