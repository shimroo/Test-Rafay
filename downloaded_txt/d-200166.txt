europe’s autumn girl accessories for fall: handbags, shoes, jewlery & gloves



yes fall is just around the corner. alas if we are lucky we will have a glimpse of an indian summer breaking into september up into early october. but still as the seasons change so does our wardrobe. i always feel a tang bit sad when fall comes around. the leaves start falling, awaiting the colder months ahead. but, i do love the colors of autumn. which are rich in bold reds, sienna browns, yellows, and greens. these are the colors we can gain inspiration from! even lilacs and lavenders, and blues are pushing forth their awesome colors. in the jewelry and accessories department. but what has europe got going on in the fall department? let’s find out! the fall shoe  high boots knee-high or over-the-knee styles are best paired with mini lengths and go great with wool mini skirts. these long boots will take lightweight dresses into winter. and the soft suede styles in the palest of hues are the feminine choice of the season. the fall handbag  baby bags wheter it’s perspex boxes, pompoms, or frilled leather purses. the more fanciful your bag, the better! don’t reserve these handbags just for evening outings - these little gems deserve to be displayed all day! the fall jewelry & gloves  costume jewelry from chunky wooden beads, giant deco cuffs, and bold neck pieces… jewelry comes super-sized! as long as it makes an impact, anything goes. gloves experiment with bold colors or try glossy black leather. the perfect glove length? ending halfway up the forearm. source: vogue uk

 michelle yeoh - our heroine and asian actress, gives fashion her own touch michelle yeoh cannot bring us any surprises. move over angelina jolie. this stellar asian actress is one of the top action actresses out there today. she is a woman who has gained fame and fortune by starring in action films. like leading male action hero jackie chan, yeoh has been celebrated for performing her own death-defying stunts and handling her own fight scenes. moreover, she has cultivated this reputation without compromising her femininity. yeoh's formidable beauty, poise and winning personality are what brought her to top of her league. this ex-bond girl. (yes she starred opposite pierce brosnan). recently celebrated in the quake of her movie - the mummy: tomb of the dragon emperor. michelle shone in her decadent and beautiful asian inspired costumes for this cool flick. as well as on the red carpet for the release of the movie. michelle is certainly not shy when it comes to being bright in yellow and gold pumps at her red carpet premiere of the mummy 3 here michelle sparkles in gucci. inspired by gisele’s catwalk fashion frenzy in the chic design from ancient china to the future with babylon ad. michelle's new flick also co-stars one of my favorite action actors - vin diesel. yes this futuristic thriller has michelle doing what she knows best - karate.and looking great of course! we love you michelle! michelle brings it on in her latest flick babylon ad starring opposite her leading man vin diesel source: google, yahoo!, babylon ad,

go west: cowgirl inspired styles for fall



 jessica simpson (source)  rihanna (source)  sienna miller (source) whether you are a little bit country (or a little bit rock n' roll), every fashionista will benefit from some western-inspired pieces this fall. okay, so cowgirl chic isn't exactly revolutioinary; many will agree that it was sienna miller who created a western/boho renaissance a few years ago. those styles, which were typically limited to just summer wear, are now translating into fabulous fall fashions. ready to take the reigns? then saddle up and add these goodies to your must-have list for your fall wardrobe: boots  sam edelman "utah" boots (source) the easiest and most versatile western-inspired piece you can buy has to be a pair of boots. the hottest ones of the season are fringy and covered in luxe suede. pair these with anything from jeans to skirts to add instant cowgirl flair. plaid  bdg mandarin plaid button-up (source) while j-simp has been embracing her love for plaid for months now, it's just now catching our attention for fall wear. look for plaid shirt dresses and button-ups for a casual chic look. i especially love what rihanna has done with hers, wearing it under a snug vest to give her western wear an edgier appeal. also look for brown suede bags and belts with antique hardware to amplify your look. denim vests (and any denim in general) married with gauzy white cotton tops are perfect for late summer/early fall transitions. so, whether you are looking for a way to resurrect some of your old summer favorites, or simply love the western wear look for fall, take some cues from these cowgirl inspired styles to put a little yee-haw into your look.
