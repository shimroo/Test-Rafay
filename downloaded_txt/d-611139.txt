fate..





"it's fate that brought us together, and it's fate that will keep us together..""i'm so sorry i hurt you,.. but i'd be lying if i said i regret what happened.. and i don't think you do either.. if you could go back and change things, i don't belive that you would.."----------------i was very sleepy that night, but for some reason i couldn't sleep.. i watched some tv (as i always do), and then i kept rolling around in bed for a while.. after some time, i decided to watch some more tv till i got sleepy..since i'm a huge fan of will & grace, i watched the few episodes left in the final season, which i haven't seen yet.. i watched and watched, until i was watching the season finale.. for those who haven't seen it, watch out, i'm sort of gonna ruin it for u now..for those of you who don't know will & grace: will is gay, grace is straight, and they've been friends/flatmates forever..so as you see, this doesn't "sound" like the kind of show that would really have a moving ending (as opposed to friends, where almost everyone on earth will be feeling for a certain character and crying their hearts out)..well, guess what? it did! their relationship resembles that of any 2 platonic guy/girl friends, where one of these days, when either of them "gets on with his/her life", the other one is forced to move out of the other's life.. have you ever heard of a time where that hasn't happened?..what really got me was the infinitie wisdom in a sentence that grace said.. "i'm so sorry i hurt you,.. but i'd be lying if i said i regret what happened.. and i don't think you do either.. if you could go back and change things, i don't belive that you would.."i guess that sometimes, you really do have to bear hurting your friends in order to do the right thing.. and just pray that they see through the pain and realize that you only did that coz you truly care for their happiness..sigh.."خذوا الحكمة من أفواه المجانين"

single vs. relationship





my friend: so, are you still single?me: define singleanswers i usually get: (i will not comment on any of them, at least not now!)- not talking regularly to a certain guy on the phone- not going out with someone- not sleeping with someone- being able to go out with whomever u want- not having a ring on ur finger- not being in a relationship ( me love you, you love me)- not in a stable emotional relationship- not seeing anyone exclusively- not planning future things with someoneso as you see.. most people would not agree on the definition of single..so why the hell don't u explain what u mean when ur asking me???! :dp.s. the apple disctionary thing defines it as "unmarried, or not in a stable sexual relationship".. get that for being clear! lol

he's dead!





he was perfectly fine.. sure, he wanted me to feed him.. but he can go for days taking care of himself.. he doesn't really "need" me except once every week or 2.. i was checking up on him.. i tried to feed him.. but he was..dead..my heart started beating really fast.. i held him.. i tried to revive him..he opened his eyes, and as if nothing had happened.. "who r u?", he asked..aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahmy sampool's memory was erased..sigh..------------------------------------------------------------------disclaimer: this is an official announcement to all of my friends out there; unless you have reminded me in the past 2 days of an upcoming event, a birthday, or anything of any significance, i am not responsible for forgetting it. it is completely and totally your fault for not reminding me.

random thoughts at 2.30 am.. friday night..





- being blonde is an addiction.. u just have to get more blonde all the time!.. it's like that saying: once u go black, u can never go back.. hmmm.. once u go blonde, u must stay blonde?! naa.. that's just lame! can u come up with a better one?- it's official: surgeons are hot!! for some reason i find them unbelievably sexy.. the attitude, the way they look when they're trying to meet a time deadline.. and ofcourse, the hygiene!! ahh.. does anyone know a single surgeon?? male surgeon (u know, for the sake of being clear!)- i was having an anti-studying spell.. u know, when u sit for hours in front of the book(s), and you don't really accomplish much at the end of the day?.. however, congratulations me, the spell is broken!!- studying in starbucks is a good idea.. however, some people think it's weird (including my own mother).. any suggestions? (othr places, what to tell those people, ..)- i love ragheb alame- i am into low-class arabic music these days..                      il-3inab, il-3inab, il3inaaab!- i am a nerd- i went to a symposium on how to choose ur medical specialty.. i'll probably blog about that later in detail.. but i guess i'm now hovering somewhere around surgery, orthopedics, family practice, emergency medicine.. out of the game (for now, at least): psychiatry, internal medicine. and ofcourse, as it's been since the beginning of time, not obgyn or pediatrics. hmm, any suggestions? :d- i've lost so much weight mashallah and i look great (or at least, i feel great about the way i look).. too bad i'm not on a deal with anyone, i would've sooo kicked their ass!!i guess that's it.. i gtg sleep (watch tv first!).. nighty night..oh yeah, i almost forgot.. why did ppl stop blogging and commenting on other people's blogs?? is it facebook al shirreer that's taking up all ur time?? :p

aaah.. valentine's day!





here comes the most dreadful "holiday" of the year.."valentine's day"..the most commercial day of the year..it's all about people wearing red, giving each other gifts (preferrably red roses), and celebrating their "love"..wait, hold on.. let me correct that..it's not people, it's coupled-up people..so basically, if u r single.. this "holiday" is not for u..but if u think that this means that u get to be free of the headache that usually accompanies all such events, then u r wrong!!you will be looked upon by the eye of ridicule, and asked by all those coupled-up people about "ur plans" and "who ur valentine is".. (!!).. as if having "a date" signifies that u r loved.. not only that, but that u deserve to be loved.. like ur not a little mean person inside..what if "my love" or whatever was out of town for that day? does this mean that i'm not loved?how about if i looked really ugly in red.. does this make me "not festive"?i've never "celebrated" valentine's day with anyone before..wait, let me rephrase that; i've never celebrated valentine's day with a guy before..the one i remember the most, is the one i "celebrated" with a whole lot of my friends when i was 15.. we all went out to dinner, and we were a huge group..and the most special, was the one where my close girlfriends and i went to dinner, remember u guys? ;)so in conclusionvalentine's day sucks..they're ripping u off guys!!----------------------------------p.s. if you guys think that i wrote this coz i'm so "bitter" coz i didn't get anything special, u r wrong :p i got a beautiful necklace from a very dear friend.---------------------------------p.p.s.بحبك يا رفيق..
