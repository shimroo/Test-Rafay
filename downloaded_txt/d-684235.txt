things that irk me!





so much is said about our inabilities to speak with good grammar and spell proper english; yet i see the following misguided signs everyday. here are a few examples:the back of an ice cream trucklast week, i discovered the king of misspelled professional signs. the level of sheer bemusement i received from the irony this square on sticks contains astonishes me to no end. i realize this exposes me as the incredible geek that i am but it was just too good to keep to myself. thanks to pretending to farmthis speaks for itselfmaybe they should be back in school! no comment!

a krazykat - psa





as the school season approaches i would like to remind motorist to be diligent in their observation of traffic laws.with children walking to and from school, waiting at the bus stops, and playing after class as kids will do their attention may be detoured when looking out for traffic.that's where we, as responsible adults must play a part in the safety of our young ones.remember the following:observe the school zone speed limits.stop at all intersections where a sign is posted.use care when appraoching a traffic signal and do not speed up to make a yellow light.consistantly scan your surroundings for kids when driving. especially side streets where cars are parked on both side and may obscure your vision.use your cell phone sparingly so as not to distract your attention from driving.stop for all school buses. do not speed up to pass them just because their yellow flashing lights come on. be cool and hang back and stop when the red lights are flashing.leave a few minutes earlier for work so that you are not rushed and not late if delayed by school bus stops.remember...the life you save may someday grow up to be president, the first human on mars, discover the cure for cancer or find the way to world peace.thanks,this article has been brought to you courtesy as a public service annoucement from krazykat. :)

church steeples...one repaired, another destroyed





this week repairs began on historic st. patrick's steeple thanks to a dedicated parishioner who left millions of dollars to the downtown church. the steeple was destroyed by fire in september, 1980, when it was struck by lightning. parishioner margaret hays tank wanted the church to rebuild the steeple. now the wish of mrs. tank is finally being realized because the church and four other catholic institutions will benefit from a $6.5 million estate that mrs. tank and her late husband, dr. reynold tank, left in their will.the will stipulates that the bulk of the couple's estate is to be equally shared by st. patrick's, the sisters of the oblates of mary immaculate, the sisters of st. francis in sylvania, st. john's jesuit high school, and st. louis university, which was dr. tank's alma mater.the diocese contracted in 2001 with a cellular phone company to restore the spire and install transmitters for cellular phones inside it. however, a few years later the firm bailed out of the deal that would have restored the tower, complete with four smaller "cricket" spires, to its original height of 240 feet. this week i observed workers utilizing cranes attending to the steeple. in addition i seen a report on wtvg reporting that the steeple should be replaced to its original height and adorned with a gold colored cross in a few month. it will be a refreshing addition to the downtown skyline wich went missing 27 years ago.then...today, this ironic story of a church in swanton from wtvg.church steeple destroyed by fireaugust 16, 2007 - mother nature made her mark in swanton last night. lightning struck a swanton church and flames shot through the steeple.it happened early this morning at the holy place church on church street and lincoln. that lightning strike had some people sitting straight up in bed. others thought they heard gunshots. they were all surprised to see where it hit. that lightning strike was an early-morning alarm clock for people here. firefighters had the fire out in about an hour, with most of the damage contained to the steeple. but, insulation smouldered inside, so portions of the steeple, including the bell, were removed so firefighters could get at the insulation. research information from wtol, wtvg and mark reiter, blade staff writer for his post on skyscrapercity.com

carty effect





with all the recent controversies surrounding mayor finkbeiner, i'm curious as to how his term in office has personally affected your life in toledo, ohio. this post is not to discuss carty himself or his antics, but rather how his decisions have directlty impacted (good and bad) your day-to-day existence here in the glass city.

a krazykat editorial - issue 5





i quote from b.c. forbes in 1953:'what have americans to be thankful for? more than any other people on the earth, we enjoy complete religious freedom, political freedom, social freedom. our liberties are sacredly safeguarded by the constitution of the united states, 'the most wonderful work ever struck off at a given time by the brain and purpose of man.' yes, we americans of today have been bequeathed a noble heritage. let us pray that we may hand it down unsullied to our children and theirs.'' "our liberties are sacredly safeguarded by the constitution of the united states"...but are slowly being eroded away by the likes of the new anti-smoking law in ohio. don’t get me wrong, i believe second-hand smoke to be as dangerous as we are being preached to about it. but this new law(who the anti-smokers will say was a product of the democratic process) imposes a socialistic value to our democracy. how hypocritical of them. what really is democracy in action is allowing a self proprietor to run his businsness as he sees fit. as long as he does not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, gender or other civil rights as protected under the law he should be able to run his establishment any way he see it.the rights of the majority do not supersede the rights of the minority.issue 5 in ohio was about much more than smoking. it was about eroding the values of democracy and civil liberties this country has come to depend on to make it the great country it is. if we allow these unconstitutional laws to run our lives and take away our rights to personal choice, let the majority run the lives of the minority, let the holier than thou think they know what is best for everyone an impose their way of thinking upon all, then we might as well live in a social state such as russia and china. if a smoker does not like the fact that a bar allow smoking... simply do not patronize it. if the bar owner discovers that his business is suffering because he alienating the anti-smokers, he will change his business practice. but it is his choice...not the decision of a majority who feel that their rights are more civil than that of the minority.an ohioan does not have the "right" to visit a bar that allows smoking. they have the "privilege" of visiting it based on the rules that the proprietor sets forth. if it is ok for a business owner to place a sign in his window that reads "no shirt...no shoes...no service" he should also be able to determine who he wants his clients to be by placing a "smoking allowed/not allowed" sign in his window.those who voted on the unconstitutional issue 5 were naive at the least and mislead by the political banter and demogogary(it’s akin to always saying that “they” are responsible for condition “y”. there’s this thing called “lies of omission”, lieing by telling the truth but not all the truth. depending on what you tell and what you don’t tell, you can give your audience quite the opposite idea of what’s going on than what really is.)of the ballot language. only when the law is expanded to include the elimination of act which they posses will they realize that they made a grave mistake in giving the government the power to dictate our lives and personal choice.

thanksgiving day





boy how thing have changed since i was a kid. no longer can i cherish that smell of the turkey cooking in the oven or the sweet aroma of pumpkin pie cooling on the stove. football games are a hit/miss sequence hoping to catch a play or two in-between being interupted with conversation about politics or stepping outside to have a smoke. missing is the tradition of dining room table all set with linen table cover and using the good china. now it more like a buffet on the counter, grab a plate and find a seat where you may.     now don't get me wrong. i still enjoyed a feast of all your tradditional thanksgiving staples like turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, corn, cranberries,and sweets galore. i am very thankfull and apprecitive of all the effort and hospitality of hosting this annual event by my brother and sister-in-law. a lot of energy and hard work were expended in the preperation of this feast; but still, i miss the "good old days"   i am reminded of this poem: the old-fashioned thanksgiving(edgar albert guest, 1881-1959)it may be i am getting old and like too much to dwellupon the days of bygone years, the days i loved so well;but thinking of them now i wish somehow that i could knowa simple old thanksgiving day, like those of long ago,when all the family gathered round a table richly spread,with little jamie at the foot and grandpa at the head,the youngest of us all to greet the oldest with a smile,with mother running in and out and laughing all the while.it may be i'm old-fashioned, but it seems to me to-daywe're too much bent on having fun to take the time to pray;each little family grows up with fashions of its own;it lives within a world itself and wants to be alone.it has its special pleasures, its circle, too, of friends;there are no get-together days; each one his journey wends,pursuing what he likes the best in his particular way,letting the others do the same upon thanksgiving day.i like the olden way the best, when relatives were gladto meet the way they used to do when i was but a lad;the old home was a rendezvous for all our kith and kin,and whether living far or near they all came trooping inwith shouts of "hello, daddy!" as they fairly stormed the placeand made a rush for mother, who would stop to wipe her faceupon her gingham apron before she kissed them all,hugging them proudly to her breast, the grownups and the small.then laughter rang throughout the home, and, oh, the jokes they told;from boston, frank brought new ones, but father sprang the old;all afternoon we chatted, telling what we hoped to do,the struggles we were making and the hardships we'd gone through;we gathered round the fireside. how fast the hours would fly--it seemed before we'd settled down 'twas time to say good-bye.those were the glad thanksgivings, the old-time families knewwhen relatives could still be friends and every heart was true.
