the nature connection











































































 weber’s art is a combination of paint and his nature photography, mostly captured in the wilderness of america’s national parks. his unique form of mixed media is about the craft and process of layering materials. the colors, textures and patterns are inspired by earthly landscapes, decaying signage from human life, and decaying german and dutch homesteads near his childhood home in the midwest. each piece uses a unique combination of materials and images that look perfect and ruined at the same time, juxtaposed to create rhythm, harmony and coherence.

in this episode of made in california, we head to the san bernardino national forest with los angeles mixed-media artist mike weber as he discusses how he splits his time between the city and the mountains. "it's almost like the locations of where i work are mixed media as well," says weber.
