new mexico: perfect for studio film production
 
of all the states offering film and tv incentives, new mexico has always been the most proactive about building a local crew base through measures such as the film crew advancement program, giving productions a 50% reimbursement of below-the-line craft worker’s wages for up to 140 hours of work if the job trains them in additional skill that will help advance their careers.
that’s in addition to the state’s 25% – 30% refundable tax credit for qualified in-state spending, which includes local hires. the abundance of high-paying below-the-line jobs created by the film and tv projects drawn to the state by the incentive have inspired many experienced production pros to permanently relocate to new mexico.
