what is a babes show like?
the four bitchin’ babes are four accomplished and seasoned  musician-actress comediennes, who together, create a tour'de force musical comedy  theatre troupe. touring and recording for 25 years, they fill the stage with whimsical songs and shtick, presenting the  hippest and most luxurious girl group harmonies “evah!” playing their own  guitars, bass, piano, and irish bodhran, this hilarious renegade sorority  of gal pals perform original songs and stories offering both poignant  views and unbridled comedic commentary on the joys and dilemmas of everyday  life. with their elegant wit, sophisticated (never blue) stand-up humor, and  enough bling to hypnotize the first five rows of any theatre, creating an  evening of wildly fun and raucous delight! 
so much new stuff!!!   come check us out!
