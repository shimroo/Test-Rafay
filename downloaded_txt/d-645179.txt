loving my daddy!





i always have been drawn to dads and have always wanted to play with my real dad who is gone, but i never did. dads are so loving and strong and handsome and have lots of stuff i like. mostly they are gentle when i amgood and tuff when  i dont mind, but love me anyway. hope ican find some on here cause i really really like to cyber with u dad!
