learn about speed skating
strap on a pair of skates and enjoy the grace and power of long track or the high-flying precision of short track. compete individually and as part of a team, racing in a pack or against the clock. speed skating is the simplicity of a race to the finish, but the journey to the end is anything but straightforward.
