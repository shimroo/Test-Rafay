	 3rd annual nyc anarchist film festival
	 



apparently their screening something of mine it's on the poster.the third annual nyc anarchist film festival in honor of our murdered comrade and colleague brad will takes place friday april 10, 2009 in the lower east side. see attached flier for locations and event times.as a prelude to the third annual nyc anarchist bookfair from april 11-12, the third annual nyc anarchist film festival will showcase contemporary documentaries and videos on current events and social movements from palestinian resistance in gaza to the popular uprising and recent riots that swept greece like wildfire.big noise films will screen a selection of short films from iraq. other filmmakers will present videos on environment, militant feminism, and movements for justice such as the ongoing struggle for human rights in oaxaca mexico.  videos will show courageous examples of resistance from india to europe, to latin america, to the u.s.a where dissent is being criminalized as terrorism. see videos that challenge the stateâ€™s unconstitutional "anti-terrorist" mandate from protests against the 2008 republican national convention.  we also proudly present footage from the fight for free speech, in the lower east side's famous "donut riot" that ended with spontaneous combustion in tompkins square park last summer. carlos castaneda wrote in "tales of power" that the "true art of a warrior is to balance terror and wonder." the nyc anarchist film festival does not shy away from either the terror we are forced to confront in our world or from the wondrous inspiration that graces the human spirit... related links :::  new york city - anarchist film festival 2009labels: anarchy, screenings

	 nyu students revoke the property destruction clause
	 



last night at 10 pm, nyu students barricaded themselves into a cafeteria in the student center and refused to leave until the administration met their demands. the students are seeking much more transparency, stabilized tuition and socially responsible investment among other things (details at takebacknyu.com). although nypd took up positions inside and outside the building, the nyu administration up until now declined to force the students to leave.today, a couple of dozen more students rushed into join their comrades in the cafeteria, bolstering their numbers and morale. an hour later the students broke through some doors onto a balcony to take over more space. previously, the students had taken a formal stance against violence and against property destruction. apparently they changed their minds when they decided to enter the balcony, writing on their website, "in the interest of tactical flexibility, we have chosen to revoke the property destruction clause of this statement."in a remarkable use of social media, you can follow along with events from inside the student occupation at a live blog and on live streaming video.i-witness video was on the scene last night and will continue to monitor events periodically.- eileen clancyi-witness videonyu student occupation linksoccupation organizers site with demands and updates: takebacknyu.comlive blog from student journalist:http://nyulocal.com/on-campus/2009/02/19/day-2-nyu-students-occupation-of-kimmel2 live video streams:http://www.ustream.tv/channel/take-back-nyuhttp://www.ustream.tv/channel/take-back-nyu-2labels: anarchy, class war, direct action, support independent media, video activism

	 a common ground mole?
	 



downloadcommon ground relief co-founder brandon darby wore wires for the fbi.article 1, article 2, brandon's confessioni have a lot of thoughts about this revelation.  most importantly: was brandon a common ground mole or get the job later?  and if he was a common ground mole: why would the fbi infiltrate a grassroots humanitarian organization whose main purpose was to help the hurricane victims of katrina?  and since the fbi was fully aware of the vigilante whites randomly shooting black people on the streets post katrina... why did they allow that to continue?related links :::  common ground relief, free the texas 2labels: anarchy, black panthers, class war, cops, direct action, disaster relief, fascism, new orleans, nwo
