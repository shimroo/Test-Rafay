youth news
~parents~

please review rule 400 regarding youth bowlers participation in adult tournaments, as the youth bowler is only allowed to participate in singles only.   participation in doubles, trio, or any team event with an adult bowler may affect the eligibility of the youth bowler youth status.
the tournament can be certified or non-certified by usbc, the youth bowler could still be affected.
