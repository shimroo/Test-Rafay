⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐we have our first pool and not only do they carry everything one needs to maintain it, they offer water testing as well! we brought in a sample, they tested it and talked us through the results. after that, the guy grabbed the chemicals, explained how to add them and how long after adding each one before it was safe to swim. he even told us about testing schedule and how to make maintaining easier, including things we could do to help extend the life of our pool! we walked away feeling confident, it was amazing!!- kari a.
