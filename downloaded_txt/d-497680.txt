welcome message

welcome to pocomoke city, the friendliest town on the eastern shore! it is located where the town expands through two counties (worcester and somerset) and stretches down to the tip of the eastern shore of virginia. pocomoke city, home of the proud pocomoke warriors (our future), and awesome athletes on this side of the chesapeake bay bridge. our three local schools have been credited as title one schools as well as blue ribbon schools.
pocomoke city became the center of attraction for servicemen and servicewomen to have fun-filled weekends with lots of activities to experience as they toured our town after a long week of employment at the wallops island flight center at wallops island, virginia. transporting cargo such as lumber, fertilizer, propane, other chemicals, corn, seeds, and other products via railway, the pennsylvania railroad traveled up and down the railway from pocomoke city to cape charles. the name eventually altered to penn central, and then to conrail. the railway, now known as the norfolk-southern railway, continues to transport the aforementioned products. 
from the manufacturing of firearms at benelli to the seafood, industry; construction companies to the defense-security company, hardwire, pocomoke city has employment opportunities for those wanting a challenge. 
with a variety of delicacies offered, one can opt for their preference of dining opportunities.
our historic buildings and homes, such as the coston house, the one-room school museum and the fairgrounds of the great pocomoke fair can be an awesome touring experience. yes, our recently renovated marva theater continues to bring movies for the entire family. modern senior housing has been a rewarding elevation to allow older residents security, lighting and more advanced upscale living arrangements. to take a scenic ride down the deepest river known worldwide for its size, cypress trees leaning over the banks into the pocomoke river in a sedentary, motionless stature. a delight and honor to be a part of this fair city; pocomoke is the definition of home. i challenge you to tour our beautiful pocomoke city, with all it has to offer.
have questions? want more detail? reach out to our chamber of commerce and get your answers! we have pamphlets, maps, illustrations and so much more!
 we are better together,
todd j. nock, mayor
