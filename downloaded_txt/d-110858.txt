editorial intern kira corasanti pauses to take in a view on teton pass. it’s the view she’ll remember from the hot tub when the avy danger goes all red. theo snowdon


take a break

a little over a month ago, i packed up and moved across the country to driggs, idaho. i quickly found a job at a small bakery, despite having zero baking experience—aside from binge-watching “the great british baking show” and “cake boss.”as part of my exploration of the area, i’ve been throwing on skins and heading into teton pass—first alone, then with friends. having spent my life skiing on the east coast, i find myself salivating at consistent snow, deeper powder and wide-open spaces. and of course, as any excited 20-something in a ski town, i’ve been out swing dancing, staving off colds with emergen-c and collapsing into bed at night. then i find myself back at the bakery, looking longingly at the mountains.last weekend, after weeks of snow drought, forecasts predicted up to 35 inches in the tetons. the air in town was dripping with excitement. but of course, i had to work.come saturday, the bakery was packed with locals heading up to ski. i was trapped, itching to join them. the snow came in, but conditions turned wet, windy and messy. folks returned from the mountain disappointed.so i settled into glazing gallettes, forgetting i wanted to be outside, mechanically moving up a skin track.when i finally got off work on sunday, still eager to ski, i found avalanche danger high at all elevations, with faceted snow prickling beneath a heavy, wet layer. reports said snow was breaking off as easily as the quiche crusts i struggled to remove from their tins that day. instead of risking it, i called a friend, grabbed some beers and we relaxed in a hot tub.though the promised powder didn’t arrive, i was reminded that slowing down isn’t always a bad thing. there’s value in taking a break—whether it’s letting go of fomo, skipping a ski day or catching up on laundry. and, of course, it helps to have a friend with a hot tub.—kira corasanti, editorial intern














get the 3oth anniversary issue



back in 1994, david and betsy harrower were exploring the backcountry on long, narrow, tele skis and having a grand old time. the only problem? “i realized there was no magazine to gain information about what had become the most fun part of my life,” writes david in his editor’s note in issue 161. and so, as the story goes, david and betsy, along with brian litz, started backcountry.
in the following 30 years, the publication and the sport have both grown and evolved. today, alpine touring setups reign, film cameras have been replaced by their digital brethren and many editors and photographers have come and gone on our hallowed masthead. in issue 161, the 30th anniversary issue, we highlight three decades of people who’ve made this publication what it is, both in editorial and art, and the backcountry skiing community that’s developed alongside us. 
in the next 132 pages coming your way, we look to the past and the present. we remember late telemark big mountain skier kasha rigby; dive into the heli-skiing pioneers who drove the development of avalanche safety; and recognize paul parker’s lifetime of contributions to the sport. and we report on efforts to make avalanche education more accessible; the apps offering better tour planning; and the italian splitboarder dedicated to uniting his backcountry community. 
as headlines fly, take a moment to recall all the things our favorite sport—and the publication dedicated to it—has been and continues to be. then take a victory lap at your favorite zone on us.

tele mike russell: turns for all
tele mike russell grew up as a sharecropper’s son in delaware before attending college and becoming an executive in the pharmaceutical industry. then he watched the second plane hit the world trade center and decided he’d better follow another path, this one to skiing in colorado, where he’d go on to find a family in the national brotherhood of skiers and help found its backcountry program.






eric blehm: meet your heroes
eric blehm’s roots in snowboarding run deep. he started riding during the sport’s infancy, and after college became an editor at transworld snowboarding magazine. years later, he was in a lift line when a fellow rider saw the “craig kelly is my co-pilot” sticker on his board, and asked blehm: “who is craig kelly?” he was floored by the notion that there were snowboarders out there who didn’t know who craig was. and this inspired him to write the darkest white.

mountain skills: professional vs. recreational avalanche training…what’s in it for me?
this winter, avalanche education in the u.s. will be evolving. the old system of level 1, 2, 3 will be replaced with two options: a recreational track and one geared toward professionals. the goal of the split is to deliver better, more focused courses to each user group. so how do you know which one’s… 


mountain skills: hydrate or die
we lose fluids through perspiration (sweating) and respiration (breathing). while ski touring, high elevation and drier air make this even more dramatic. and during the spring, warm weather further exaggerates the amount of fluid lost. dehydration leads to a drop of performance—in stages from slowing down to bonking to needing medical attention. 


mountain skills: anticipating point release avalanches
as the spring approaches, many of us turn our attention to steeper, more technical lines higher in the mountains. the layers of snow that formed throughout the winter begin to gain strength and the avalanche problem is less complicated—it’s ski mountaineering season! but as the temperatures climb, wet avalanches become a more regular, primary concern. 


mountain skills: take the time to be prepared for early season turns
it’s late fall and many mountains throughout the u.s. have seen some decent early season snow. as a result, stoke is high and people are itching to ski. guide steve banks shares his thoughts on how to capitalize on the early bounty.
