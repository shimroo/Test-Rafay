accounting for wind drift


chapter: comiccharacters: chuck, julio



when flying, it is essential to always account for the curvature of the earth. if you fail to do so, you would end up in space!
that reminds me of my time in the austrian army. i met a fellow there who was convinced that there was a big conspiracy that prevented ordinary people from space travel. like that you could take an ordinary 747 and just fly high enough and end up in space. it’s too long ago and i can’t remember his argument as to who was behind the conspiracy and how it was enforced. i just remember that i couldn’t convince him otherwise. it’s a bit like the flat earth theory in reverse.
anyway … always remember to stay inside the atmosphere, folks!

as most of you already know, the chickens turned 20 years old this year. next year, they would be legally allowed to drink in the states!
and our celebrations continue for the last few days of 2021.
we gave you patches (us shop | eu shop), we gave you daily extra comic strips. now we give you …
20 books or t-shirts!
we will raffle them away among you, our loyal fans. the lucky winners can freely choose one item among our chicken wings themed books and t-shirts!

now how do we know who our loyal fans are? everybody who is subscribed to our newsletter, of course! if you’re already subscribed, there is no need for you to lift a finger. you will automatically participate in the drawing. everybody else can subscribe here and will instantly be on our good side and take part in the raffle!
with the help of stef’s old rpg dice collection, we will select two lucky winners every day and notify them via e-mail.
(we average about 3-6 newsletters a year, mostly about announcements of new books, videos and the odd sale.)
good luck, everybody!
