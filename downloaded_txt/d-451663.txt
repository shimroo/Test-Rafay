          i love seeing honest interpretations of the current capital markets by those who have more experience than i do on the capital side.

i’m blessed to have an experienced team with many avenues for both funding as well as exit to come but love how the suggestion here is on the key metrics.

good business has always been had timelsss metrics that remain the same and have roi about them.  when i observe many of the current titans they had long plays but the metrics were and are the same business wise.

what are metrics you focus on in early stage that translate well into later stage?

          why first-time vc managers can outperform experienced ones

institutional investors, and most of the limited partners (lps) investors to the vc funds, often prefer seasoned managers who have a proven track record of success and strong returns. while experience can be valuable, this principle doesn't always hold true in the vc industry.

experienced managers often operate based on mental models constructed from previous facts and information. while these models can provide valuable insights, they can also create flawed perceptions of new products or technologies. for instance, an experienced vc manager might dismiss an innovative idea by thinking, "it won't work because previously it didn't work." this reliance on past experiences can prevent them from recognizing groundbreaking opportunities. before elon musk's success with tesla, many investors were skeptical about electric cars. 

venture capital investing is heavily influenced by mathematics and statistics, particularly the power law distribution. success often depends on a small percentage of investments that yield significant returns. therefore, having a well-diversified portfolio is crucial. a vc fund investing in, say, 40 startups can manage risk effectively because even if only 5% of those startups succeed, the returns can cover all fees and generate substantial profits. the returns might more higher if the fund operates in emerging markets where operation costs for startups are low compared to more developed countries. 

well-structured vc fund mitigates this risk through diversification and the statistical probability of success.

while experience is valuable, it's not the sole determinant of success in venture capital investing. first-time managers can achieve results comparable to or even surpassing those of experienced managers if they avoid being limited by outdated mental models, employ sound statistical principles, and maintain a diversified portfolio also adding smart vc fund principles. future laboratory ventures

          why buying your first business is the hardest & financing   the fear is being seen as too risky by lenders and investors.

the solution: prepare a solid business plan with detailed financial projections. work with a financial advisor to enhance your credibility. consider alternative financing options like sba loans or seller financing.

          interesting post, frank rotman .  

i'd argue that rather than try to use your markups as traction for raising funds 2, 3 and 4 , emerging managers should consider helping their startups get earlier liquidity via suggesting listing on growth exchanges like the toronto stock exchange, the lseg (london stock exchange group) or the asx .  

dpi > irr or tvpi when it comes to lps.  

a vc that returns >2x in 7 years to lps is going to have a much easier time raising the next fund than a fund with an irr or tvpi of whatever.  

the entire vc industry has drank the kool aid that companies should be doing >$300m in arr before listing.  the lp community needs / wants liquidity before the 12 to 14 years its currently taking to ipo in the us, however.   

startups can list on the above exchanges doing $20m in revenue with 30% yoy growth, they don't have to deal with sarb ox compliance and follow on raises are orders of magnitude easier for a listed company.  

why?  

there's so many more public market investors than private market investors.   

the only other option for emerging managers to stand out is by getting dpi via selling secondaries to a fund like practical venture capital

          how do venture capitalists make decisions

a foundational 64-page study that surveyed 850+ vcs at 681 firms to learn how they make decisions across eight key areas: 

• deal sourcing
• investment selection
• valuation
• deal structure
• post-investment value-add
• exits
• internal organization of firms
• relationships with limited partners

"in this paper, we seek to better understand what venture capitalists (vcs) do and, potentially, why they have been successful. we do so by surveying almost 900 vcs and asking how they make decisions about their investments and portfolios. we also explore cross-sectional variation in vc practices across industry, stage, geography and past success."

          successful ventures that have achieved product-market fit and have scaled their operations will probably face this new reality: 

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗹𝗶𝗾𝘂𝗶𝗱𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗳𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻𝘃𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀.

as explained by mark suster, this liquidity is most likely to come from private equity firms, who have the expertise to evaluate companies based on long-term fundamentals, much like the approach taken by warren buffett (rather than the speculative one from crypto-traders 😉).

valuation is not a one-time event but a dynamic process that follows a chain-like logic, where each link is interconnected. an irrational (high) valuation early in the chain can have significant repercussions later on, leading to fewer financing or liquidity options - as professional investors will not accept it.

you may avoid this by establishing a clear valuation roadmap that demonstrates a consistent risk/return rationale for each type of investor, from business angels and venture capitalists to private equity firms and the public market, spanning from the first funding round to the eventual public offering.

          📝 founder fundraising hack = write an investment memo for vcs (template linked below).

raising vc is a multi-step sales process. first you need to convince a single partner to invest, and then that partner needs to bring your deal to investment committee (ic) to convince the other partners.

the initial vc partner (aka deal champion) will write an investment memo to convince the other partners to vote for your deal during ic.

if a vc will write their own memo, why write one for them?

three reasons:
1. control the frame = dictate how your story is told
2. signal insider status = show you understand how vcs think
3. reduce friction to $$$ = vcs will copy/paste from your memo to theirs 😂

🪟 control the frame
there are good ways and bad ways to frame your startup. 

it's possible that a well-meaning vc will write a memo that frames your startup in sub-optimal ways.

the less experience and domain knowledge a vc has, the higher the risk.

you want to arm your deal champion with ammo to tell a bullet-proof investment story.

don't leave this up to chance. write a memo and share it with the vc to make sure they hit the right talking points in their own memo. 

🥼 signal insider status
i love when founders provide a written memo alongside the usual pitch deck and financial model.

it shows they're clued in to the game. they understand how vc firms work. they're an insider.

vcs want to invest in insiders, because insiders are more likely to raise subsequent financing and get to an exit.

outsiders are learning how the game works for the first time and will make rookie mistakes on the vc's dollar. don't be an outsider.

💵 reduce friction to $$$
you know how great product companies obsessively reduce the # of clicks a customer needs to make before paying for the product?

speed matters. a 2006 amazon study found that every 100ms in added page load time cost them 1% in sales. 

vc is no different.

the faster you can make the diligence process, the more likely you'll be able to raise capital.

your fundraising collateral is your product, and a memo is a key way to reduce time to funding (ttf).

every vc will have a set of questions during diligence. answer them up front in a memo, and watch your prospective investors eyes light up.

deals can be a grueling process involving several late/all-nighters, so the deal team will be thankful if you save them work and make their lives easier.

here is a link to the investment memo template i use. feel free to repurpose for your own needs: https://lnkd.in/ekgbjgws

          the value of assets in venture funds over a decade old is projected to surge from $15bn to $130bn in the coming years. here’s why that matters: most private funds are expected to start returning capital at the 10-year mark. 

but instead of cashing out, many vc firms are watching their capital stay tied up, waiting for a market recovery that may or may not materialize.

unlike private equity, where continuation funds have provided some relief, venture has largely avoided addressing this liquidity jam. some vcs—lightspeed with its $1bn fund, along with general catalyst, rockport, and insight—are starting to pursue continuation strategies. 

but venture is a different beast to pe: without positive cash flow from assets, startups often need new capital just to keep the lights on.

for lps—many of whom are pension funds and endowments that rely on distributions to meet obligations—this stagnation creates a critical funding gap. 

unable to recycle capital, they’re restricted from allocating to new funds, perpetuating the problem. but even with continuation funds, challenges remain. 

take shasta, for example, whose attempt to mark a continuation fund at 65 cents on the dollar was rejected by lps, reflecting broader skepticism around asset marks. as one emerging fund manager told me over beers:

“everyone knows the marks are b**lshit, but nobody benefits from pushing them down. nobody wants to buy in at these levels either—so we’re all stuck.”

venture is now at a crossroads: without fresh capital, startups could be pushed toward insolvency or fire sale exits. it’s a complex situation with no easy answers, but one thing is clear—addressing liquidity is no longer optional.

          this article could not come at a better time for me and my fund (danta fund ). 

after attending a recent summit where i felt the industry of #startups and #vc has become too generalist and differentation is hard to find, i now know to include danta fund as (per the article below) a " non-consensus alpha". 💪

it sounds pretentious, yes, but the description fits sooo well. danta fund is a specialized #agtech fund that provides #smartmoney to our founders. we are not only writing checks: we connect, we mentor, we build. 💥

as a recent colleague from another specialized non-consensus alpha emerging fund told me (andres baehr from savia ventures ): we, specialized emerging funds need to find a way to thrive among the sea of vcs.

it's like going back to when we were thinking about what to study in uni: 

-what am i great at? 
-what do i feel passionate about? -how can i make a difference in this world.

          vc’s biggest issue

altimeter’s jamin ball discusses what may be one of venture capital's most pressing challenges: the shifting alignment between vcs and founders. as funds grow from millions to billions, the dynamics that once drove shared success are evolving—and not always for the better.

1️⃣ how vcs make money:  
• 2% management fee:  covers operational costs like salaries and rent, providing steady income regardless of fund performance.
• 20% carry: a performance-based profit share that rewards vcs only when investments achieve major exits.

2️⃣ the historic power of alignment: 
• smaller funds in the past meant lean management fees, pushing vcs to rely on carry for wealth creation. 
• this created mutual goals: both vcs and founders needed big exits to achieve success.

3️⃣ the billion-dollar shift:
• massive funds today generate lucrative management fees, reducing dependence on carry.
• raises questions: is fund size prioritized over driving transformative exits, potentially misaligning long-term goals?

4️⃣ a growing concern:
• despite venture’s expansion, the "2 and 20" model remains unchanged.
• larger funds risk weakening the founder-vc alignment, impacting the future of startup innovation and wealth creation.

how do you think the evolution of vc economics will impact startups and innovation in the future?

🌟innovative vc firm overcomes exits drought with secondary sales🌟

⛵navigating a challenging landscape where exits are scarce, santa barbara venture partners (sbvp) has pioneered a novel approach to sustain its growth and attract investors for its second fund: secondary sales. instead of waiting for traditional exits like ipos or acquisitions, sbvp opted to sell shares of its portfolio companies, demonstrating its ability to generate returns for investors and stand out in a competitive market.

🎤according to dan engel, founder and managing partner of sbvp, these secondary transactions have been a game-changer, sparking investor interest and bolstering the firm's credibility. by leveraging its recent successes, including a lucrative stake in sports-betting company draftkings inc.' acquisition of digital lottery app jackpocket, sbvp seized the opportunity to return profits to its limited partners (lps) and pave the way for its second fund.

💡engel highlighted the challenges faced by young vc firms in raising subsequent funds, particularly amid a downturn in exit activity and heightened investor scrutiny. with traditional exit routes becoming increasingly elusive, the pressure is on for firms to demonstrate tangible returns and establish a track record of success.

✨"for us, secondary sales have been a game-changer. they've helped us return profits to our lps and attract investors for our second fund," said dan engel.

💰for sbvp, the decision to pursue secondary sales was driven by the need to provide liquidity to lps and validate its investment thesis in the eyes of prospective investors. by strategically offloading portions of its holdings in high-performing portfolio companies like bark technologies and rad ai, sbvp not only generated substantial returns but also bolstered investor confidence in its ability to deliver results.

⚠despite the complexities and potential stigma associated with early share sales, engel emphasized the importance of prioritizing investor returns and seizing opportunities to unlock value for stakeholders. with a focus on profitability and transparency, sbvp remains committed to its mission of delivering sustainable growth and maximizing returns for its lps.

🔍 "returning profits to our investors is our top priority. by strategically selling shares, we're proving our commitment to delivering results and driving value for our stakeholders," added engel. 

as sbvp continues to explore secondary transactions and expand its investor base, the firm stands as a testament to innovation and resilience in the face of market challenges. 🚀

          🎭 backdrop: the why of vc platform as a differentiator. yesterday i answered what platform in vc is: the value-add support and resources funds provide beyond capital. but why is capital not enough?

🚀 venture capital has exploded over the past few decades, from $1.5 billion in tech investments in 1991 to a peak of over $694 billion in 2021. at the same time, there are ~137,000 startups emerging every day.

🌐 during the dot-com era, tech investments reached $90 billion by 2000, backing companies like google, amazon, and paypal. despite the crash, the vc industry kept momentum. heavyweights like sequoia and accel diversified toward mobile and social startups, leading to major investments in companies like facebook, uber, and airbnb. accelerators like y combinator, techstars, seedcamp, and 500 global emerged, providing founders with critical resources, mentorship, and networks—laying the groundwork for today’s platform approach.

🌍 vc continued to evolve. hubs emerged outside silicon valley, with europe and asia now major players. data and analytics are central to investment decisions, and holding periods have significantly shortened. the rise of mega-funds, micro-funds, and specialised investors has introduced new dynamics. corporate venture capital (cvc) has also grown, with major firms launching their own arms. as a result, competition for resources, expertise, and networks has intensified.

📉 more recently, the 2021 funding peak, driven by pandemic digital transformation, low interest rates, and heightened tech interest, has given way to a tighter market from 2022 to the present. economic pressures and market corrections meant that many valuations set in 2021 did not hold up, resulting in promising startups raising flat or down rounds. consequently, startups have had to tighten their belts and focus on unit economics. while capital remains abundant compared to historic levels, particularly in sectors like ai, funds and platform teams must also remain focused and resource-efficient.

🔎 in this landscape, money alone doesn’t set a fund apart. as one anonymous lp noted in a recent carta article, it’s “a prerequisite for us to understand how managers provide something other than just capital...how can they win aside from paying the highest price?” in a tougher market, lps look for fund managers with “credibility from having lived in the trenches”—those who can prove their unique worth.

💡 mountside ventures’ emerging vc manager programme—“europe's first”—highlights this dynamic. while many programmes exist for founders, there is little support for emerging vcs navigating the competitive fundraising landscape. this drives home the rationale for platform teams to offer valuable relationships, practical resources, and support that help vcs stand out and succeed.

🤨 what signals have you observed that support or contradict these evolving dynamics? ⬇️
