about tunl

 



the triangle universities nuclear laboratory, or tunl, is a u.s. department of energy (doe) center of excellence. we’re a consortium of 4 universities: duke university, north carolina central university, north carolina state university, and the university of north carolina at chapel hill. our mission is to advance the frontiers of nuclear physics and to educate students and young scientists so that they can contribute to society across a wide range of technical fields, including nuclear physics. tunl's work is conducted by 20 faculty, 24 research scientists and postdocs, 21 staff, 65 graduate students, and about 25 undergraduates.  please see this video on how doe's support makes the tunl research enterprise possible. for more details on tunl's contributions to the national nuclear physics workforce, please watch this video.
