jenny tatone's favorite recordings of 2006



neumu's michael goldberg writes: in case you're wondering why things
slowed down to a crawl at neumu last year, the answer, in a word (and in a web
site), is mog (www.mog.com), where 
i've been spending most of my time.
 still, with 2006 over, i asked neumu contributors and
friends to share some of the albums that rocked their world. today, neumu senior writer
jenny tatone provides us with her faves of last year.
