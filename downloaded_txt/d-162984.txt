in this internship/project, a team of four uw students will apply their collective
                     education, training, and experience in addressing research questions related to identification
                     of weed species using drone-mounted sensors, image processing software, and machine
                     learning techniques. students will further explore the use of drones for precise herbicide
                     application and mosquito breeding abatement. the team will be mentored by faculty
                     from uw’s interdisciplinary geospatial information science & technology (gist) program.

                     of damage into the future from a heavy rain-caused event washing away dry beans.
traylin bruegger, of niobrara county, and jordan jochems, of cody, used skills gained
                     in a remote sensing class to solve problems on family lands. they’ll also earn certificates

driese joined wygisc in 2001 as a remote sensing scientist, where he established a
                     remote sensing lab and began teaching the core of the remote sensing curriculum at
                     uw. following subsequent appointments in the botany department and life sciences program,
                     driese returned to wygisc in 2019 to help design, launch, and direct the center’s
                     new interdisciplinary gist program before retiring earlier this year.
