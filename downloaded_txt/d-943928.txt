                    this home that was never mine
                

writing about toronto is hard. i haven't written about it much since getting
back from my trip there back in october because—and i don't really care how
dramatic this sounds—it all feels so raw. when i got to toronto, within a day,

politics


                    acute fear of the gigantic nameless thing

                    how to finish all the items on your to-do list

reading notes


                    reading notes on “modern science and anarchism”
                

this essay felt like an excellent short summary of anarchist thought and its
history. in attempting to make a case that anarchism is born from the inductive
reasoning of the scientific method, kropotkin ends up outlining the history of
the movement in a tight summary that i found particularly approachable.

                    kate critiques apple’s deep fusion in an ad-hoc manner
                

i am prepared to offer a critique of the iphone 11 pro camera, specifically the
deep fusion machine learning piece to add in detail.
