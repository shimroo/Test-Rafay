cortisol – the stress hormone


our immunoassay is widely used to measure cortisol in many biological fluids and has been used extensively as a biomarker for stress and to monitor adrenal function


shop now















plasminogen activation is involved in fibrinolysis, cell adhesion, apoptosis, and cell proliferation


we offer a complete line of plasminogen activators, inhibitors, enzymes, antibodies, and assay kits

the glutathione s-transferases: a large family of enzymes with many roles.


over 20 gsts in expressed humans. they play key roles in detoxification, steroid metabolism, and oxidative stress. we offer an extensive line of line of purified recombinant human gsts, as well as isoform-specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, and immunoassay kits

histamine is an important mediator of inflammation


measurement of histamine levels in foods and beverages, and in biofluids is faster and more precise with our immunoassay kit, which does not require derivatization and exhibits extremely low cross reactivities


shop now















isoprostanes: an excellent biomarker for oxidative stress


our unique immunoassay kit is widely used for simple, extraction-free quantification isoprostanes in urine, saliva, and breath condensates, and includes glururonidase to measure the total f2t isop level, removing a large source of inter-individual variability
