windows 
users: looking for a fast, simple, and low-cost 
solution to contact information conversion challenges?

address magic personal edition offers you a smoother conversion in 
a windows environment than the interguru service described below. 
unlike my more generalized 
service, address magic focuses on windows and uses special methods built 
into windows. as a result, it supports all contact fields and can work 
with complex environments like outlook, exchange server, and lotus notes. 
leaving aol?
convert your address books 
to microsoft outlook or outlook express with 

epreserver.

site.
corporate migrations
interguru recommends that corporate 
users who need to convert large numbers of windows users should investigate 

address magic enterprise edition . your purchase of this software helps 
support interguru.
