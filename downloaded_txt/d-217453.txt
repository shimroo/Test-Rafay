the irish bank bar & restaurant is one of america's most authentic, historically accurate and romantic irish pubs. the irish bank can be found snugly nestled in its own lane in the heart of downtown san francisco.our façade, with its traditional whitewashed cottage appearance, is adorned with magnificent brass plaques, hanging flower baskets and a breathtaking, ancient 19th century water pump, creating an impression reminiscent of a distinctive rural tavern.



the interior of the irish bank is truly unique. our friendly atmosphere is enhanced by a rare collection of antiques, award winning photographs, historical documents and advertisements, antique mirrors, church pews, sewing machines, barrels, crockery, farm implements, horse tackle and other memorable bric-a-brac - a very warm and intimate decor.
