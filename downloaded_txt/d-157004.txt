terminatorfiles changes into archive

					version 3.0 of our fansite (the one you see before you) was relaunched on may 24th, 2010. we haven't 
					posted any news... since we are more interested in providing our fans with what fans want; exclusive 
					content. and preferably, the best content available. thats our main goal!

					we've got detailed files!

					our site is already very big on content... but we want more! got something special that needs to be added? 
					be sure to send it in for review and if supa good, we'll help feature it.
