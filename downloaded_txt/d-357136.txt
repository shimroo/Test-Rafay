about the department
as one of the nation's top programs, our department is broadly focused on econometrics, micro and macroeconomic theory, and applied economics, with distinctive collaborations across these boundaries.
faculty research encompasses the broad fields of finance, international trade, development, public sector studies, law, business and monetary economics, with specialized scholarship focused on environmental and ecological economics, cultural, agricultural and natural resource economics, education, racial inequality, and labor and economic demography.
we are home to about 700 undergraduate students, making economics one of the most popular majors on campus, and our graduate programs have about 220 students working toward a master's degree or ph.d. both students and faculty are supported by a helpful and caring staff, who are dedicated to the department's success.

master's programs
our four distinct master’s programs include rigorous curriculums, flexibility, and the opportunity to explore other departments and schools in one of the nation’s top research universities. each program is tailored to meet your professional goals – whether that’s applied research in academia, industry, or government; applied research in financial markets; financial analysis; or pursuit of your doctorate.

ph.d. program
we offer a world-class doctoral program in economics, featuring a vibrant faculty of exceptional scholars and teachers along with superior research facilities. our faculty is dedicated to anchoring all teaching and research firmly in the core disciplines of microeconomics, macroeconomics and econometrics. the first year of the program lays the critical foundation necessary for later work in field courses and dissertation-level research.

our research
duke economics is a department focused on a distinctive intellectual vision of the discipline: one that combines methodological rigor with intellectual breadth and diversity — and an insistence on real-world relevance. our faculty and students operate in a flourishing intellectual climate that fosters the integration of activities across disciplines and sub-disciplines, across theory and empirical work, across teaching and research, and across units within the university and the larger raleigh-durham-chapel hill research triangle.
