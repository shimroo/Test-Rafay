my company used premier events for our christmas party in december. they provided a dj and several different casino games. based on employee feedback it was the best company party in years. we’ll definitely use premier again.

patty, thank you so much for making friday’s event a big success! the event itself was well set up and organized, the food was excellent, and the audio/video was great. everybody loved it and keeps complimenting all of us while requesting to make such events an annual thing. thanks again and i’m sure you will hear from us again soon.

our thanks to the premier events team for your important role in making our annual natofest banquet a success. the risers, pipe and drape, and plants enhanced the set up physically and aesthetically, impressing our international, military, and business community audience. lional, tony, and ray were a great team and the set up went smoothly. we thank you for your professionalism and recommend you to other groups who want to make their events extra special.

the promenade room has an amazing view but you “glammed” it up last tuesday night at the wells fargo event. i remarked that your truly imaginary works of decorating a room have been your trademark for years. they agreed! i always feel very confident when i recommend you to clients.

patty is a design professional with the ability to turn simple ideas into creative masterpieces. my numerous experiences with premier events, including four major productions, all culminated with outstanding results. under patty’s capable direction there is confidence that the end result will exceed expectations and be executed with supreme professionalism from setup to takedown

our spring benefit looked so gorgeous, you did such a wonderful job! it’s amazing how you can turn those boring, empty spaces into something so beautiful! we’ve gotten so much positive feedback from our attendees, especially about the décor. we already have ideas for next year!

premier events can take any idea you have and not only perfect it but bring it to life. they listen to your thoughts and dreams. they then are able to show you what they have and find out exactly what your taste is in decor. if you want a themed party or unforgettable wedding go with premier. you will not be disappointed. i’ve worked with them for the past 3 years and have always had 85-175 guests. they have always gone above and beyond to get the job done!

our student club used this company for our fourth annual event - after trying other companies in previous years - they did not disappoint! best equipment, best staff, best organization and by far the best customer service! highly recommend using this company for your events.

i don't know what i would have done without you guys, truly! you roll along with the punches right with me and help to troubleshoot as fires spring us. everyone has done nothing but rave and compliment every aspect of the party and they have no idea what sweat and tears that it took to come together. i'm very proud that it was the best party we've thrown to date for our company. i am thrilled with the outcome! you were an absolute pleasure to work with and i look forward to our next event together!

i didn't think it was possible but you outdid yourself -- what you did for our banquet was absolutely gorgeous!  when i walked in the room my mouth dropped and i walked from table to table just taking it all in!  beautiful! i loved the blue and silver together, and the sequins... it was stunning.

one of our employees came over and took pictures she was so impressed. the night was beautiful and its all because of you and your team!
