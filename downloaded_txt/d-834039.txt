our impact

 

more than $2 million in scholarshipsthe first miss maine was crowned in 1935. scholarships became the prize starting in the mid-1940s.since we started keeping track in 1980, the miss maine competition has awarded more than $2 million in scholarships to over 600 young women in maine.

 

making social impactevery candidate who competes for the job of miss maine must put forth her own unique community service initiative. our candidates have been advocates for mental health, public health, domestic and sexual violence prevention, and many other important social issues that face mainers every day.

  

invaluable skill-buildingwhile participating in the miss maine competition, young women gain skills in public speaking, interviewing, resume and essay writing, and making an impact in their communities. women who compete in the miss and teen competitions have gone on to become not only professional musicians and hollywood actresses, but also doctors, lawyers, firefighters, nurses and leaders in business and service communities in maine and around the world.

 










 

“running for miss maine was one of the best decisions i’ve made.”“…miss maine has prepared me for the real world and she said that my interview with her really showed that. i'm further in my career than a lot of people my age, and i owe a lot of that to the miss america program. even outside my political career, pageantry has contributed to who i am. i keep telling people that running for miss maine was one of the best decisions i've made.”   — stefanie veneziano, competed in 2009 and 2010. winner of the steven jensen memorial scholarship in 2009
