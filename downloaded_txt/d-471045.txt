            zip lining ended up being one the highlights of our week in cr. our group of 10 had a blast watching each other fly by from platform to platform. the course is well thought out and the staff are incredible.

            truly a fun amazing experience, the entire group running the excursion are top class good guys, with their main focus is to make sure you have fun. they have a photographer who follows the group and sells the photo packages at the end of the tour, a bit pricy but still worth it. we had a drizzle of rain when we were there, made the rain forest experience truly next level!! the views are magnificent. and very safe!! these guys are programmed moving guest quickly and efficiently through the rides while all along making sure safety clips are always on. we felt very safe and had a blast! pura vida, thank you!!
