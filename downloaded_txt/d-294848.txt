                        sports & events
                    









                                conformation
                            


                            dog shows (officially conformation) may look like beauty pageants, but they’re not. dogs aren’t compared against each other; they’re compared against the standards of their breed.
                        







                                agility
                            


                            an exhilarating way to exercise with your dog, agility is a fast-paced obstacle course with tunnels, hurdles, and other challenges that your dog completes as quickly as possible.
                        







                                rally
                            


                            in rally, you and your dog navigate a course, side-by-side, through 10-20 different exercises and, although it’s timed, it's more about proving excellent behavior and teamwork than speed.
                        







                                fast cat
                            


                            this fast-paced event features one dog running at a time, with their speed clocked and converted to mph. any dog over 12 months of age that are registered or enrolled with the akc can participate.
                        







                                virtual home manners
                            


                            this entirely virtual program tests for the 10 necessary skills that well-mannered dogs need in the home setting! vhm gets you started on practical skills needed before your first training class.
                        







                                scent work
                            


                            in akc scent work, the handler guides the dog through a set search area to find specific odors that the dogs have been trained to detect. 
                        







                                obedience
                            


                            developed in the 1930s, obedience is one of our oldest sporting events and is open to all breeds. from walking in figure eights to sitting for 1-3 minutes, dogs show off their good behavior.
                        







                                tracking
                            


                            your dog’s natural ability to recognize and follow a scent is on full display in akc tracking events.
                        







                                herding
                            


                            in the sport of herding, your dog uses his innate herding abilities to move sheep (or other animals) around a field.
                        







                                earth dog
                            


                            open to small terriers and dachshunds, earthdog tests are non-competitive and assess your dog’s abilities for seeking and locating prey underground.
                        







                                field trials
                            


                            since 1924, these competitions give your pointing breed a chance to show how fast he can run and his keen desire to hunt for and find game.
                        







                                hunting
                            


                            hunting tests are designed to test a dog's ability to work with their human hunting companion in a simulated hunting situation.
                        







                                farm dog certified
                            


                            the farm dog certified test is a series of twelve exercises in a noncompetitive pass/fail evaluation and open to all dogs over nine months that are registered or enrolled with the akc.
                        







                                lure coursing
                            


                            the lure will lead a pack to run as fast as they can, zig-zagging across an open field in hopes of catching it. the test is a basic performance of coursing that is non-competitive and is pass/fail. 
                        







                                coursing ability
                            


                            most dogs have the urge to chase different objects, whether it's a ball or each other during playtime. cat is a non-competitive, pass/fail event that harnesses their natural instinct. 
                        







                                coonhound
                            


                            nite hunts require coonhounds to hunt at night with a handler and be scored on their ability to trail and tree a raccoon. it is fun to watch and the hounds enjoy doing what they were meant to do!
                        







                                trick dog
                            


                            since the 1920s and '40s when trick dogs such as rin tin tin and lassie won peoples’ hearts, trick dog training has become one of the most exciting new areas in dog training today.
