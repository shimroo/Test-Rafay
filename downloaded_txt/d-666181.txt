quotes for home insurance and the differences in preparation between hurricanes and tornados






natural disasters are part of life, and unfortunately can hit us hard. these types of disasters span the nation coast to coast in the form of earthquakes, tornados, hurricanes, blizzards and even fire. however there are a few differences when dealing with home insurance and how these natural disasters can affect your place of residence, the amount of insurance coverage you are required to have and how you will be covered in the event of such a disaster.
tornado and hurricanes seem to be the majority of natural disasters that we see recently leveling houses, sweeping away neighborhoods and leaving their inhabitant without shelter. but how do these types of disasters affect your home insurance bill? not surprisingly, they are very different.
tornados
it is likely that you have either felt the effects of a tornado, seen images of one on tv or have actually lived through one if you are living in the midwest region of the united states. residential areas that are affected by tornados on a recurring timeline often are required or suggested to have increased coverage for tornado damage on their home insurance plans. because there are areas that are clearly mapped, such as the infamous "tornado alley", which spans from montana, south and southeast through texas, these areas are likely to have a mandatory clause in the insurance plans that require additional coverage in the event of a tornado. when tornadoes strike, they are unforgiving and can level a house within seconds. this means that all of your possessions, the entire structure of the home and the lives of you and your family are at risk. without proper home insurance quotes, you are likely to be in financial straits if a tornado were ever to hit your neighborhood.
hurricanes
hurricanes are a devastating natural disaster that can often take many years to recover from as we have seen over the last few years. the question is, what is it that makes a hurricane so bad for the area that it affects. one major factor about hurricanes that differ from a tornado is the water. water wreaks havoc on homes causing irreversible damages, producing health deteriorating mold and leaving homes inhabitable. when water becomes at a level where it enters your home and consumes your house, there is no way to salvage items, as it may be the case in a tornado. with home insurance quotes, you may be required to have additional coverage or hurricane coverage if you are residing in areas along the coast, and where storms are likely to hit. one other factor that will have a large impact on the home insurance quote is the flood zone. flood zones are designed to determine is your residence is within an area that is likely to flood in the event of a major storm, such as a hurricane. if you are in a flood zone you can expect to have an increase in home insurance to cover damages.
it is a good idea to review your home insurance quote with your licensed agent to see if you are in need of additional coverage for your residence. there is no worse scenario to be without the proper insurance once a natural disaster hits.

car insurance when it comes to covering natural disasters






it's surprising how quick people tend to forget about natural disasters after they've occurred. as soon as the consequences are eliminated it seems like things get back to normal and the disaster won't happen ever again. it's even more surprising to see such an attitude in people who live in areas where natural calamities are a common or even a periodic event. there's a feel of carelessness in their attitude when they don't take the hard lessons seriously and don't get prepared for the coming disaster seriously. one of the most common examples of such careless behavior is not insuring one's car against natural disasters. of course, there are more important things that usually have to be covered such as house or health. nevertheless, a car is the primary means of transportation in this country and it can be very hard to overcome the consequences of a serious storm, flood, earthquake or tornado without working set of wheels. so how do you protect your car against the damage caused by a natural disaster?
comprehensive coverage is the most useful thing in car insurance when it comes to dealing with types of damage that aren't caused by a direct collision with a vehicle or someone's property. typically, comprehensive coverage deals with the damage caused by windstorms, explosions, riots, vandalism, theft, falling trees and other things that cannot be classified as traffic situations. in most cases comprehensive coverage is enough to pay for a totaled car after a serious natural calamity. however, you first have to make sure that the type of damage that was inflicted to your car doesn't make part of the exclusions section. unfortunately, this happens too often, especially in places where particular disasters are more common.
for example, the insurance companies operating in the infamous tornado alley will usually exclude any type of tornado-related damage from the comprehensive policy and will require the customer to purchase a weaver for additional money. some of you may think that it's a pure rip-off, but you have to look at the situation from the insurer's point of view. why would they include a particular type of damage into a standard policy if it has nearly a 100% occurrence rate over a short period of time? after all, hundreds and thousands of tornadoes take place each year in the region, causing millions of dollars in losses, and it's the insurer who pays the most in the end. so it's hard to blame them for wanting to earn money in a situation when they are dealing with huge losses on a regular basis.
the example of tornado alley can be extrapolated on other regions too. areas with common floods, earthquakes or windstorms are places where you will certainly face inconvenient exclusions when it comes to car insurance coverage. but is it actually cheaper to avoid purchasing any weavers? certainly not, as you may end up with your car being totaled and the company not paying you anything because the case made it to the exclusions. sure, it's not the best way to get cheap car insurance but at least you will keep your car properly insured for all situations. and it's never too late to compare car insurance quotes to see if other companies have something more affordable to offer.

avoid distractions and get lower quotes for auto insurance






if you've been driving for a while or even if you haven't you probably know that the best way to get low auto insurance quotes is to keep a clean driving record. unfortunately, that's easier said then done. we all mistakes, and even the most experienced drivers can get into an accident due to a brief lapse in judgement.
one of the biggest causes of automobile accidents is distracted driving. here are some tips to help you stay focused on the road, and keep your driving record clean.
leave your phone alone. texting and driving had been getting a bad rap recently, and it's for god reason. people who text while driving are 23 times more likely to get into an accident. it's impossible to focus on what's ahead when your eyes are looking down at a screen, which makes this a very dangerous habit. most states have implemented laws against texting and driving, and against talking on a cell phone (unless using a handsfree device).
avoid eating and drinking. you will be doing yourself a favour if you fill up before heading out in the morning, even if it may seen easier to grab a coffee and a donut at the nearest drive-thru. you need at least one of your hands to eat or drink, leaving you one short on the wheel. this practice also steals some of your attention away from where it belongs on the road.
let your passenger pick the radio station. or, at least let them turn the dial to the station you request. likewise with the heat, volume, and any other buttons or knobs you might find yourself fiddling with. your chance of getting into an accident skyrockets at any moment your eyes aren't on the road.
take breaks. you should ensure that you take regular breaks of at least one break every two hours if you are driving for prolonged period of time. and, pay attention to your body. if you start to feel drowsy or catch yourself nodding off, pull over at the next available rest stop to get refreshed.
know your route. or if you don't, have your gps set up before you start driving. looking at a map or filling in details on a gps are both common distractions. if you are lost and need to check directions, make sure you pull over first.
be prepared. some distractions are out of your control. an overexcited child in the backseat, for example, or an insect coming in through the window. even billboards or other accidents can steal your attention away for a moment or two. the key is to always prepared for an unexpected surprise, and train yourself to stay calm and focused. if you do find yourself distracted, simply refocus and keep going. you can't go back in time, but you can try not to make the same mistake twice.
an accident- and ticket-free driving record will help you get the lowest auto insurance quotes available. protect yourself by making an effort to stay focused and prepared while driving.
