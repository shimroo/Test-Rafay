there will be new cdc regulations effective aug 1, 2024, regarding dogs entering the united states
this will impact dog breeders, pet owners, truckers (who have dogs on board), field trials, shows, cottage owners (who have a place on either side of the border), and many more.  there will be downstream negative economic impacts.
the regulations are very onerous, expensive and overall unnecessary.you can find the new regulations here.
if you disagree with the new regulations, please click on the link below and you can print a pre-written letter. it just needs to be signed and faxed/mailed/emailed to:
—canada: your member of parliament and the prime ministersâ office
—usa: your house of representatives elected official, senator and the white house

please let us know if you have done so. thank you for your support.

pups for sale

we do not always have pups for sale, particularly not during our winter months. here in manitoba, it is not unusual to have temperatures 40 below (fahrenheit and celsius) for 2-3 week stretches. our pups are mostly ready to go to their new environments starting in the spring, through till about july.

adults for sale

if you are looking for a good dog (either gun and/or trails) for the fall, this is the time to contact us. our dogs are running long and hard now, and although not trial ready, they are in excellent condition. don't wait till hunting season starts and then suddenly decide you need a good dog.

care advice

we cannot stress enough that it is crucial you have a good working relationship with your veterinarian, based on common trust and values. don't get taken in by a clinic with all the modern bells and whistles, with lots of personnel (all that comes out of your pocket in the end).
