9 hidden gems to get your mexican food fix in columbia sc



































of south carolina








welcome to
            
            
                columbia
            
            
                
                    south carolina
                


        in the heart of south carolina, tradition and tomorrow pair perfectly. as a creative hub that's fed by university and capital city communities, a gritty spirit and vibrant energy can be felt all around. it's a city where stately buildings buzz with new businesses and centuries-old sites give rise to fresh perspectives - all this in the midst of surrounding natural beauty.
