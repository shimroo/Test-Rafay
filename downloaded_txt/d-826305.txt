border crisis brings disease, and housing crises!   
9/16/2024 - border czar kamala harris
is still exhibiting an unwillingness to actually recognize two major
crises flowing from her open borders policies --disease
and housing---much
less to do anything about them
consider
disease!
"unknown
to many americans, this summer a major public health crisis quietly
emerged in new england. eastern
equine encephalitis
(eee) and west
nile virus,
two serious, third-world mosquito-borne diseases, have circulated in
the northeastern united states, killing
and hospitalizing
unsuspecting americans while spreading fear in surrounding
communities.
the
recent outbreaks serve as a glaring warning sign of the kinds of
unintended downstream effects of the mass importation of illegal
aliens from parts unknown. as individuals from at least 180 different
countries enter our borders and invade our communities at the hands
of kamala harris and joe biden, they are bringing deadly diseases
along with them.
the
two mosquito-borne diseases now making the rounds in the new england
region originated outside the united states. eee has a striking
fatality rate of 30 percent, while the west nile virus is less deadly
but often requires hospitalization and can cause long-term
neurological symptoms. there are currently no vaccines available for
either disease.

mass
immigration causes massive housing shortageyet
mass alien amnesty threatens!
8/23/2024
- cis.org
demonstrates mass immigration is the major cause of our massive
housing shortage



august
6, 2024 6:00 am - "the
housing shortage looms large as our nation faces a critical
presidential election. just last week, the national association of
realtors released new data revealing home prices in the united states
reached a record high in june 2024. itâs no wonder, then, that
housing costs are a top priority for young voters.  



unfortunately,
some in washington, d.c., continue to turn a blind eye to a key
factor exacerbating this crisis: mass
illegal immigration. 



houses
have been in short supply since the great recession, when housing
production steadily declined, especially the construction of
âaffordableâ apartments, which declined by 4.7 million units from
2015-2020. however, housing demand has only increased, driving up the
cost of living.  as of 2024, the u.s. was short somewhere
between 4 to 7 million housing units. the shortage of affordable and
multifamily housing is especially severe, as multifamily construction
has declined since 2021, dropping 14%. considering that incomes have
not kept pace with rising prices

alien amnesty threatens national security and public safety,
budgetary, and employment and natural environments. help stop it!




the
biden administration is implementing a de facto massive alien amnesty
(via the immigration parole provisions) and increasing legal
immigration again this spring!â¦ as its response to the border
crisis



consider
the following:



recently
the house sent to the senate h.r 2 that would tighten asylum and
related laws and mandate that the border wall construction be
completed. (unfortunately, h.r.2 contained no provisions limiting
legal immigration or preventing a mass alien amnesty! and did
sanction a continual flow of 5,000 illegals per month!!) it did not
pass



instead,
congress just passed a $1.2 trillion bill   which funds and
facilitates more legal and illegal immigration. e.g. it doubles the
h2b admittees 




predictably,
as in past years the resulting increase in numbers of and funding for
aliens, the open borders crowd is beginning to again demand amnesty
(and voting rights for) over 35 million illegal aliens and a doubling
of legal immigration

--

"since
president biden took office, over 8.5 million immigrants have been
encountered
at the nationâs borders, with an additional estimated 1.8 million
âgotawaysâ evading customs and border protection. the texas
border comprises almost half of the entire u.s.-mexico border,
stretching 1,254 miles across four mexican states. millions of
immigrants have entered the country through one of texasâ five
border patrol sectors. as a result, the lone star stateâs diverse
environment, divided into ten
ecoregions, has gradually transformed into a dumping ground for
immigrantsâ waste.

biden/mayorkas threaten health/safety environments w. pro- cartel crime, &  public benefits bill for illegals!! -- balance alert! 

7/23/2023 - ohio senator j.d. vance, along with a group of house republicans, have sent a letter to department of health and human services secretary xavier becerra urging the agency to deny the use of obamacare to illegal aliens.
 
first obtained by the daily caller, the letter hammered the biden administration for âissuing a proposed rule that would redefine âlawfully presentâ in the affordable care act (aca) to include beneficiaries of the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program.â
 
authors senator vance was joined by missouri senator josh hawley, and oklahoma rep. josh brecheen was joined by twelve other house republicans.
 
the lawmakers wrote in the letter:
this policy further burdens programs intended to serve u.s. citizens and simultaneously encourages more aliens to enter our country illegally. we find it unimaginable that the government would prioritize providing illegal aliens with health insurance coverage.
 
the daily caller reports, âthe other house republicans who signed the letter include: reps. bob good, paul gosar, lauren boebert, matt rosendale, andy biggs, ken buck, eli crane, brian babin, jeff duncan, glenn grothman, marjorie taylor greene, and tom tiffany.â
 
the lawmakers say the proposed rule is estimated to cost more than $100 million in its first year alone  and it would expose american health care workers and patients to the variety of diseases
carried in by aliens, and to the security threats generated via increased unvetted aliens admissions

immigration, the environment & the election

the  fundamental fact is that for every person added to the u.s. population one acre  of precious farmland (i.e., with rich topsoil) or natural habitat  for wildlife, is converted to developed uses, de facto permanently  (pimentel, et. al. cornell).  and as dr. v. abernethy and dr. anne brattain’s  research has shown, reducing immigration into the usa reduces the fertility  rates in the sending countries, thus reducing the over-population pressures on  wildlife in those countries.

unchecked  population growth and over-population are clearly negatives for environmental  protection. 
population  growth and density also have negative effects on our public health and personal  safety environments. [read further...]

americans  value the natural environment to a degree unknown in much of the world.   we value open space, wilderness, clean air and water, and healthfulness. in  part, this reverence for the environment is learned, and in part the  opportunity for reformation and conservation is an unearned blessing; one that  should not be squandered.

public health environment threatened by heroes act open borders provisions — help balance stop mass immigration

as if  the threat to the job opportunities of the 40 million unemployed americans  posed by continuing mass legal and illegal immigration were not enough, the heroes  act (h.r.6860) recently passed by the house would greatly increase risk to  americans’ health.

if  passed by the senate, as is, the bill would grant deferred action and work  authorization to illegal aliens and allow stimulus checks from the cares act to  be paid to these illegals!

almost  needless to say illegals have not been and are not subject to health screening  when entering our country.

as  well, the bill would extend expiration date for non-immigrant visas and work  permits,  and permit the importation of foreign  health care workers to compete with the 130,000 plus of our own unemployed health  care workers. 

and,  in california, governor newsom has committed $75 million of u. s. taxpayers’  money to support illegal aliens. [read further...]




pandemics "love" population density and mass immigration â the solution

it is  no accident that new york city and environs are the ground zero of the corona  virus in the usa.
new  york city is the most densely populated city in the usa and is a major  hub for international travel and destination for immigrants. consider:
“‘there is a strong  correlation between the risk of pandemic and human population density. we’ve  done the math and we’ve proved it,” said dr. peter daszak, a disease ecologist  and the president of eco health alliance, who examined the link in a 2008 study  published in the journal natureâ¦. looking at contemporary outbreaks  since the mid-20th century, daszak and colleagues found that the  emergent diseases caused by pathogens new to humans has increased significantly  with time, even when controlling for progress in diagnosis techniques and  surveillance â¦.”
“pandemics, population  growth, and globalization,” scientific american, via capsweb.org. 04/11/2020
many  of the newly threatening pathogens emerge where exploding human  populations have intruded on the habitat of non-human species.  separation  that formerly characterized human/animal interactions shifts into more intimate  contacts. the pathogens jump from animal to human. the intensity of  travel and population mixing then spreads disease globally.

californiaâs over-population problem is manifested in its  homelessness, potable water, loss of agricultural land and other crises,  resulting in large part from the 400,000 legal immigrants plus illegal aliens  who settle in california each year. seen over half a life-time, california's  population has grown from 15 million to 40 million, due mainly to mass foreign  immigration.

recently, 11,000 scientists and others around the world issued their joint conclusions on the causes of "climate change." one conclusion stands out — over-population is a major contributing factor to co2 pollution. thus, it is not a surprise that the two most over-populated countries in the world — india and china — account for well over 50% of world co2 emissions. and since allowing mass immigration increases population in the sending countries as well as in the receiving countries, stopping mass immigration is essential to reducing co2 emissions.

mass immigration via s.386 & "population refugees" — the greatest environmental threat — help push the solution

“over one million of mexico's poorest  citizens now live inside and along our border from brownsville, texas, to san  diego, california, in what the new york times called, 'colonias' or new  neighborhoods. trouble is, those living areas resemble bombay and calcutta  where grinding poverty, filth, diseases, drugs, crimes, no sanitation and  worse. they live without sewage, clean water, streets, roads, electricity, or  any kind of sanitation.” (cf tina griego, “what if they left,” rocky  mountain news, 08/26/2019)

population explosion bills threats to pass this september — the solution to  help stop them

s.386 (kamala harris, d. ca) and companion mass immigration increase bills are all a threat to pass as one gigantic composite immigration âreformâ bill when congress reconvenes this september.      
s.386 (the senate version of h.r.1044 which already passed the house) would dramatically increase legal immigration via, inter alia, the h1(b) route to green cards, specifically, e.g., this bill would, inter alia, allow admission of 300,000 h1b indian contract workers annually! (displacing americans from jobs) plus 300,000 of their family-members annually (cis.org and breibart.com).[read more]

mass  immigration drives homelessness, crowding & taxes

legal and illegal immigration is a major cause of  increased homelessness and crowding (and taxes everywhere in the usa) especially in those areas which receive large numbers of immigrants — new york  city, chicago, seattle, portland, and san francisco, silicon valley and los  angeles.

in the usa, about 60% of all legal immigrants and about  70% of all illegal immigrants take advantage of one or more u.s.  taxpayer-funded welfare programs (cis.org) — “free” medical care, welfare, food  stamps, section 8 housing, etc. which costs u.s. taxpayers $330 billion per  year net (after subtracting taxes immigrants pay). this does not include state  and local costs. (see net costs of immigration study.)[read more]


disease-infected illegals flood our border â tb, parasites, pneumonia, dengue et al
as another âcaravanâ of central americans approach our border â [and current asylum law would de facto legalize most of them! â an estimated 100,000 in march, 2019 alone! usatoday, 3/30/19] and it is important to consider yet another negative, in addition to net costs (net costs of legal immigration study), drug running, human trafficking, mass migration of legal and illegal immigrants brings â disease.

massive legal & illegal immigration increase bill introduced â tell congress moratorium now!
hr 6 just introduced in the house by democrat nancy pelosi would dramatically increase both legal and illegal immigration, offer amnesty and citizenship to not only daca recipients, but also those with temporary protected status (tps) and deferred enforced departure (ded) status. even some already-deported illegal aliens would be allowed to apply to legally return under the dream and promise act, announced by house speaker pelosi.

legal immigration adding 50 million to u.s. by 2060 — support balanceâs reduction initiative
legal immigration will add over 50 million to u.s. population by 2060, about three times more than illegal, given current trends (u.s. census/cis analysis, s. camarata, âimmigration to add 75 million by 2060â) with all the negative environmental and budgetary consequences balance has documented.
but if we intensify our efforts now, we can get reductions just after the 2020 election. [read how] 


multi-cultural invasion â environmental consequences
				together, we can stop them.
yet another multi-national caravan is headed north to our southern border and the overwhelming evidence is that illegal migrants/asylum seekers come from scores of different countries and cultures with values which reflect little or no regard for the environment.   [read more here]
