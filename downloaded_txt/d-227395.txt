 african american history month| some sufferings we must refuse to bear

by starlette thomas | february 17, 2025 | opinion | 0 commentsracism is not “my cross to bear.” in fact, it’s not even a cross or a test of endurance. systematic prejudice is social oppression and should not be met with strength and determination.

featured book



parables, politics, and prophetic faith
–by allan boesak and wendell griffen





this is a book about parables for our times. we work with selected passages of scripture, reading and interpreting them as parables as we attempt to understand and discern the signs of our times that we may now, perhaps too benignly, describe as times of great upheaval and confusion.
the challenge this book attempts to confront is how christians, standing in the tradition of the biblical prophets and of jesus of nazareth, and the prophets of today read and discern the signs of our own times. how do we interpret the situations contemporary politics is creating for especially the poor and oppressed, the vulnerable and excluded children of god? how do we reclaim not only our prophetic imagination but also the boldness and courage to enact it in the dismantling of what is wrong, unjust, and inhuman.
