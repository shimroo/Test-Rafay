happiness is blooming






a couple years ago i took the fundamentals of interior design class in my program. i remember that my instructor had a list of five basic elements that every room should have, and that one of the elements was "something alive" - flowers! i believe that this is true. flowers are inviting and can bring so much life and cheer to a room.there are so many wonderful varieties of flowers that you're sure to find something suitable for your room, whatever style it may be. take a look at the chart below for some tips (originally this was a chart meant to help with floral arrangements in wedding planning, but i think it's pretty informative in general!):my favorites are peonies and hydrangeas. what are yours?roses:lilacs:calla lilies:gerbera daisies:  peonies:poppies:tulips:hydrangeas:

george projects: hdc stadium club






hello and happy summer! judging by the weather, beach season has officially arrived! we imagine that along with hitting the beach some of you soccer fans might also be watching the euro cup, which brings us to our next project--the home depot center stadium club. the stadium club restaurant overlooks the 27,000 seat soccer stadium, which is the proud home of mls teams chivas usa and los angeles galaxy. the stadium club is also often utilized for concert events that take place at the hdc. the space needs an updated design, and we've been hard at work brainstorming and planning one for it. take a look at what it currently looks like:and a few sneak peaks at ideas we have for the new space... stay tuned for updates on this exciting project!
