          welcome
  to the flippedbit.net 

this is the homepage of ron hanson and carrie hanson. family and friends will want to bookmark this site since it
          is a good way to see what is happening in our lives. it's our little
          corner of vanity on the web.

please  navigate the site using the menu on the bar above.
          after entering a new area the pages in that section are below the main
          navigation bar. this site is best viewed at 1024x768x65k with any current
          browser. internet explorer does work better but we've tried to make it
          other browser friendly. 

          many of the pages contain pictures which would prove slow for the
          bandwidth challenged. be patient.
