                        oci membership means a lot to us. we feel that we are part of a worldwide family that strives to spread the gospel in this generation. we feel that oci cares about us and is a steady encouragement in every phase of work that we are in.

farm stew, usa



                        oci has been pivotal in the growth and development of our ministry. through the network, i've been coached and blessed by like-minded, mission-committed people. the diversity of resources, knowledge, and skill reminds me of the body of christ!
                    







jason & antionette fournier
kibidula farm institute, tanzania



                        being a part of the oci family of ministries keeps us in touch with what is taking place around the world! it helps us remember that we are not alone and that we are really a part of a big and amazing work that is happening everywhere. it is exciting!
                    
















            attending oci conventions has helped me get to know leaders and workers from other ministries on a personal level. i’ve found these relationships very beneficial as i’ve collaborated on numerous projects with them throughout the year.

from foundation to fellowship: growing in faith in pansoy
"i will build my church, and the gates of hades shall not prevail against it." – matthew 16:18

on january 4, 2025, the essence of health ministry team visited the church they planted and constructed with their own hands years ago, alongside helpers and volunteers, in pansoy, san andres, quezon, philippines. this church, a symbol of hard work, dedication, and faith, continues to grow in the lord’s presence.

during the visit, the team spent the sabbath in worship, fellowshipping with the bondoc peninsula district churches, and strengthening the bonds of faith. the ministry has also sponsored one bible worker, who continues to serve the church and spread the gospel in the area.

as the church remains small, the ministry and its members are witnessing god’s grace and provision. we humbly ask for your prayers for this church’s continued growth, both in number and in faith, as it becomes a beacon of hope and light in pansoy.

may god continue to bless this work and use it for his glory!

evangelism student
sponsor a student for a six-month evangelism training course, so that they can go and be a light to their communities.  many of our students go directly into bible work positions, some become leaders in their local churches, but all leave with a heart ready to share the good news of our loving god, and to help people be ready for jesus' soon coming.

evangelism student
sponsor a student for a six-month evangelism training course, so that they can go and be a light to their communities.  many of our students go directly into bible work positions, some become leaders in their local churches, but all leave with a heart ready to share the good news of our loving god, and to help people be ready for jesus' soon coming.
