 "i salute--from my space helmet--the range rats, the unsung heroes of the space race to the future."  dr. buzz aldrin, gemini xii, apollo xi  ____________________________________
 2025 update please see "news" section
 this website has been created in an attempt to preserve some of the history of the old nasa spacecraft ground tracking  network and other programs that personnel of the former bendix field engineering corporation (bfec) were involved with  and as a central point for matters of interest to these employees. a web scrapbook.  the below "thumbnail" history is just that and a more detailed version is available under the "history" button on the left  column of this page.   bfec ceased to exist in name in 1992 and assumed the identity of another major aerospace company (alliedsignal). the bendix corporation was acquired by the allied corporation in 1982 and shortly thereafter allied merged with the signal  corporation becoming alliedsignal inc. however, bendix field engineering corporation's name did not change until 1992  whereupon it became alliedsignal technical services corporation (atsc) and then in 1999 alliedsignal merged with  honeywell and thus becoming honeywell international and with the old bfec/atsc becoming honeywell technology  solutions inc. (htsi).  the company was originally a part of bendix radio and was formed in 1950 to provide support for a u.s. air force radar  system and other air force equipment. later, with the advent of the space age, the company became an integral part of  the "space race" by providing support starting with the minitrack program and soon after with project mercury and then  on to the gemini, apollo, and skylab missions with the manned space flight network (msfn), the satellite tracking and  data acquisition network (stadan) which supported many of the unmanned scientific satellite programs, and the deep  space network (dsn). the msfn & stadan programs were combined in the early 70's and became the spaceflight tracking  data network (stdn). the last apollo mission occurred shortly after this with the apollo/soyuz test project in 1975.  the 80's seen the advent of the space shuttle program and was supported by bfec until it ended in august 2011. also in  the early 80's, the tracking data relay satellite system (tdrss) came into being and by the latter 80's became fully  operational and at this time most of the spacecraft ground tracking stations were closed, ending an era that was a way of  life for many of those, "range rats" who manned them. also during this time frame, many other programs were being  supported, a few of which are listed below.  in the following we have listed many of the areas of support such as tracking stations, various projects and other items of  interest.     a partial list of current and past tracking stations/ships   antofagasta, chile-------------------guam antigua ------------------------------- guaymas, mexico australia----------------------------- -johannesburg, so. africa perth----------------------------------usns huntsville  carnarvon---------------------------usns mercury  woomera-------------------------- -
