"i used the range last week at the new location, i brought my mother with me to try and get her to shoot. the range staff was very patient and helpful. bud, one of the instructors explained several different firearms to us and suggested a few to try.  he really helped my mom get over her nervousness and went out of his way to make sure we were taken care of, even helping me find a holster for my own pistol. beautiful store and outstanding range staff!"


- jimmy palmer 






"great store, great indoor range, and fantastic staff. i appreciate being able to use the 100-yard tubes anytime. i’ve also taken several classes already, and i love that i can practice holster draws indoors. they have a great selection of firearms to use when i want to try something new. highly recommended "
