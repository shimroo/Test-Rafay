san diego sportfishers since 1935!

2025 season update:
h&m landing is recommending that all customers that are
fishing with us this year need to make their fish processing reservations
as soon as they book their fishing trip. if you do not have a
reservation when you get back to the dock, we cannot guarantee the
processors will be able to process your fish. most boats will be prepared to
fillet your fish for a fee, should you be unable to get a fish processing
reservation. if you are unsure if your boat provides fillet service please call
our office to confirm.

here’s how to make a reservation:
for five star fish processing click here.
for fisherman’s processing text your name/names,
return date, and boat name to (619)-255-3128. 
for sportmen’s seafood call 619-224-3551.

h&m landing vessel “premier” rescues two naval aviators after plane crash in bay

san diego, ca – february 12, 2025 – h&m landing is proud to announce that its vessel, premier, played a pivotal role in the successful rescue of two u.s. naval aviators after their plane crashed into san diego bay earlier today.

at approximately 1015, the two pilots ejected from their aircraft after experiencing a mechanical failure. moments later, the aircraft crashed into the bay. the premier, which was in the immediate vicinity, swiftly responded to the emergency. upon observing the pilots eject, the crew of the premier quickly navigated toward the pilots before they even hit the water.

within minutes, the crew of the premier safely recovered the aviators and provided immediate assistance. both pilots were transported back to shore, where they were met by emergency medical personnel. they were evaluated and are reported to be in stable condition, with no life-threatening injuries.

“we are relieved and grateful to have had one of our vessels in the right place at the right time,” said , frank ursitti, general manager of h&m landing. “captain brandon viets and the crew of the premier acted swiftly, and thanks to their professionalism, were able to bring these pilots to safety.”

the incident is under investigation by the u.s. navy and local authorities. h&m landing is fully cooperating with officials as they work to determine the cause of the crash.

h&m landing is committed to the safety of all those who venture out on the water, and we are deeply honored to have played a part in the safe rescue of these brave aviator’s.
