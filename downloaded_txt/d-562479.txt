making light
my wish is to create a light sculpture of luminous poetry that brings beauty and radiance to life 
welcome to my website.  i make light sculptures and architectural light installations using neon and leds.  light sculptures are luminous forms that radiate colour and light into the surrounding space. architectural light installations integrate light into the architectural envelope using animated colour to transform buildings and structures. i make smaller light sculptures in my workshop and they are exhibited in galleries. architectural installations are site specific and commissioned, working closely with clients, design teams to create poetic light interventions with vibrant animated colour.

form
within the beauty of chaos we create structure and coherence. light sculptures and light installations are a creative synthesis of visual ideas, and technical possibilities. looking for what is exciting in culture and light, giving resonant luminous form to a contemporary moment.
neon is drawing in liquid light. it has a weightless radiant quality, beautiful unique colours and a flexibility to be shaped into sculptural forms. the vibrancy and energy of neon tubes is fire in the heart.

light
light is the medium of our being and imagination. the eye and the brain transform invisible photons into the beautiful visible world we see. electric light and digital technology gives the possibility of imagining totally new reflexive luminous cities and landscapes. 
leds have intense colours of light. mixing red, green, blue and white, leds are able to create millions of shades of colour. combined with digital controls they are an electric paint box to paint the world in subtle reflexive colours.

spirit
as the sunset paints the world pink and the shadows of night return form their hiding place i breathe in the darkness, i breathe out the light.
living in west cornwall surrounded by the atlantic ocean, sunlight is reflected between the sky, sea and land creating a never ending spectacular display of lighting effects. there is a special clarity, intensity and spacious feeling of light and colour that is radiant and uplifting. this is the spirit of light i try to reflect in my light sculpture and the light installations.

vision
light crosses the borders of our bodies in both directions, from outside in and from inside out. there are two kinds of light; the light of the universe and the light of the mind. the light of universe is an invisible energy of photons and electromagnetic radiation and is the source of all life and phenomena in the universe. the other is the light of the mind that reaches out giving form, colour, texture, emotion, and meaning to the universe. both are entwined and if either is absent there is only darkness.this luminous meeting place of universe and mind is the threshold of language and the source of my art, in a dance of light, shadow, form, emotion and ambiguity.
