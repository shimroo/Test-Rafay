							voting for the 2025-2027 jsrc board of directors is open
					
voting for the 2025-2027 jsrc board of directors is now open.
thank you to all who took part in the nomination election process.
election results to be announced at the club's winter extravaganza on february 22nd.
sign up for the awesome winter event here.
 





							2025 winter extravaganza
					





last year the club had such an amazing time and event at the spring lake manor, that we decided to do it once again.
february 22nd will be the club's winter event... and if you're not signed up, then you sincerely don't know what you are missing.
this is an event that would cost you well over $100 anywhere else...but since the jsrc subsidizes this event, you end up paying roughly a wee bit more than half of that amount.
yep, that's right. now - and up until february 20th, it's just $55 for volunteers with 5 events to their name, $65 for members, and just $90 for non-members.
cocktail hour / music / dinner / large 50-50 / gift baskets / open bar... and the camaraderie of your fellow volunteers /runners.
what.....are.....you....waiting.....for.....?????   sign up here.
 






							runner safety is important to us
					





with the large number of scary races, turkey trots, fall clasics and santa runs, this is a great time of year to lace up and hit the streets.  even in our every day group runs, safety is an important topic.  there have been a number of inquiries received lately about our rules and guidelines for races and group runs. as such we should like to share some important information for jsrc runners and event directors from our insurance provider, the road runners club of america.  enjoy the festive running season, but please follow the recommended safety guidelines.   headphones, stroller, and pet guidelines - road runners club of america
 
 
 






							it's nfl playoff time!
					





on saturday january 18th from 4:30pm till 8:00pm, the club held it's first "jsrc nfl playoff-palooza" at birdsmouth brewing. $10 got you entry to the event and boxes for the afternoons playoff game. this was a jsrc members only event, and roughly 40 members came out for some good brew, and some good eats. shout out goes to event coordinator vicki trerotola!  event information can be found here.

wow! if you missed this sunday's hash, you missed a good one!! back for the 44th installment of "the race from h@&#" the jsrc hashathon 6-mile treacherous trail race was electric with quite the buzz across the back woods of cheesequake state park in matawan, nj.  the hash kicked off at 10:50 with a great rendition of the national antem from dave demonico and chik albers. followed by a post hash party with free beer and pizza.  of course, all proceeds go to support matawan/aberdeen first aid squad/bayshore ems. many, many thanks to race director joseph iovelli and his slew of volunteers. check out pictures soon found here.

october 27th in deal, nj at the 2024 trick or trot presented by deal fire company no. 2  & the jersey shore running club was phenominal. the shore saves petwalk or the family friendly kid's dashes were awesome. proceeds of this event benefited deal fire company and the rescued dogs being cared for by shore saves based in freehold, serving monmouth & ocean counties (www.shoresaves.com).  a fun morning with awards for fastest men and women in 10-year age groups, 5 best costume awards (human and pet) and best team costume all were had. thank you to race director barbara hanlon and her entire squad of volunteers!!
