our vision 


to celebrate the life of beatrix potter


explore more










the beatrix potter society has been registered as a charity in the uk since 1980. we exist to promote the study and appreciation of the life and works of beatrix potter (1866 – 1943). she was not only the author of the tale of peter rabbit and other classics of children’s literature but also a landscape and natural history artist, diarist, farmer and preservationist. beatrix potter was responsible for preserving large areas of the lake district through her gifts to the national trust.
the beatrix potter society upholds and protects the integrity of the inimitable and unique work of beatrix potter, her aims and bequests and brings together those who share these interests worldwide.










the artist

beatrix potter was a talented watercolourist, particularly of the natural world, from an early age and her paintings and drawings are now in collections, both private and public, all over the world.







the literature

beatrix potter is renowned for writing one of the most beloved children’s books of all time, the tale of peter rabbit. she went on to write and illustrate many more books in her lifetime, many of which are still sold worldwide in many languages.







the scientist

although beatrix potter had sold some of her artwork for greetings cards and illustrations in the early 1890s, she devoted most of her energy to the study of natural history – archaeology, geology, entomology and, especially, mycology as a scientist. many scientific drawings are saved and can be viewed on appointment.







the gardener

at a young age beatrix potter loved to draw flowers. no wonder she became a keen gardener and you can still view the famous garden of hill top today. it changes every season but you still can recognize the beehive beatrix potter drew for the tale of jemima puddle-duck and the famous green gate.







the farmer

beatrix potter fell in love with the lake district and farming. in 1905 she bought hill top, her first farm and after her death she bequeathed fifteen farms and over 4,000 acres to the national trust – a gift which protected and conserved the unique lake district countryside.







the preservationist

in 1882 beatrix potter and her family began taking their holidays in the lake district. country life appealed deeply to potter and years later she made her home there and wanted to save this land for the future. beatrix potter was a genuine preservationist.







the entrepeneur

beatrix potter was far ahead of her time. as a woman in victorian times it was not custom to do research at kew gardens as a scientist, publish your own books, earn money with selling cards or become a savvy business woman and buy land in the lake district. this, and many more, was done by beatrix potter.







the legacy

beatrix potter was more than the creator of peter rabbit. she left us a legacy which we still can see and enjoy. her books, her art, her herdwick sheep and her indomitable spirit are all part of her enormous legacy.







places  to visit

beatrix potter was born in victorian london, but there are more related places to visit in the uk and even outside the uk. beatrix potter’s original drawings, studies and/or letters are to be found in museums all over the world. some are on permanent display, others can only be seen by appointment. please check the website before going. if you are interested in beatrix potter as a natural historian and artist, you may like to visit some of these locations.
