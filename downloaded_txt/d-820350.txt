   about us  furnace mill fishery was created in 1992 by the owners ed & jane brown and is situated in one of the most beautiful locations in the country, the wyre forest, on the shropshire/worcestershire border. 

in 2008 we developed a fantastic air gun range in the surrounding woodland. this venture has proved to be very successful with the opportunity to host many local and national competitions which have attracted visitors from around the world. 
we also have a fabulous 2-bedroom holiday lodge which you can rent out for that break you've been promising yourself. choose from a weekend, mid-week or full week break.see the "accommodation" page for full details, prices and to book. 
 
furnace mill fishery and air gun range is a great place to fish and shoot both in the summer and winter. our cafe is open wednesday to sunday serving hot sandwiches for breakfast and lunch with hot & cold drinks and snacks available the rest of the day.
