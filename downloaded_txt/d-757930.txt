we looked around for a boat last minute and this was the only place that had one. even though we didn’t have a reservation, pete immediately got one ready for us and the boat was practically brand new. one of my kids left a toy on the boat … more and heather ran after us to give it back. top marks for service.

it was a very fast and easy rental. the staff is professional, friendly and easy to work with. i recommend anyone getting a boat to rent going here. the boat was clean and in great working condition. the overall experience was awesome…. … more
				went out again on july 5th and it was another great experience out of the ft. lauderdale location. the boat ran great…pete and the staff there are awesome and very easy to work with. they show professionalism and care about their customers. every time i have emailed pete about anything he gets back fast and with all the answers to my questions.
				i went out on aug 3, 2023 again and it was another great experience. matt helped me with getting everything ready to go out. he does an amazing job helping you get everything on the boat and setting you free from the dock and on arrival back to the dock he is there waiting and makes sure you have everything and that you had a great time out.
				aug 9, 2023 went out again and the boat was clean and in great working condition. this is by far the best boat club i have ever been apart of and all of the staff here are very friendly and go above and beyond to make sure everything is a great experience. benny, matt, pete all of you are great and the company should be proud of having  guys like you working for them.
				thank you, moe

awesome time. took 24’ center console out on the 4th of july and was everything we were looking for. great staff, relaxed vibe and plenty of room to roam.

the people working at the pompano beach are great. very supportive. it is a pleasure working with them...specifically ruben. boat availability is generally good, but on 3/12 it was limited. most likely as a result of spring break. boats … more are good and everything is well prepared. one piece of criticism.....despite repeated promises to send me an invoice each time after i had taken out a boat, they did not send an invoice; occurred 3 times. this is frustrating and annoying and tarnishes the otherwise great experience.

today was my first day taking a boat out as a member. the boat i reserved was clean and waiting for me when i got to the dock. we had a beautiful cruise for lunch and then came back. as a first time boater mate the owner made it a very … more easy and enjoyable experience even connecting my phone to the bluetooth stereo before we left. they have great availability, when we got back to the dock we reserved the same boat again for next week. the prices are great and they are very personal. i shopped two other boat clubs and felt like i was signing up for tv service or joining a timeshare, they both had many hidden fees. i highly recommend best boat club to anyone thinking about joining a boat club, or even buying a boat

after a long 3 months of quarantine, we were so ready to get out and enjoy a beautiful day on the water. best boat club and rentals is by far the best club we have ever experienced (and we’re fort lauderdale locals that have been renting … more for 20+years).  from their gorgeous fleet of boats, to their impeccable service provided by the guys(the two david’s and pete) and to the amazing owner mate d. that has the best customer service i have ever seen. we love when an owner takes pride in his company and cares about his customers.  i know we will never go anywhere else from now on. basically never rent from a holiday inn when you can pay the same or less for the ritz carlton. thank you best boat club and rentals for an amazing day and a memorable one for our family! ☀️💙

the level of service provided at best boat was incredible. ernest and his team took the time to make sure we knew where to go to see the sights and have a good time. i was able to pick up and drop off my family directly from the dock at … more our hotel on lake mayan, so convenient! we enjoyed the views along the new river, and beaching the boat at whiskey creek park for some exploring and swim time. our boat was a clean 24' / 200hp, new model deck boat that suited our needs perfectly. they even provided us with a large cooler with ice for our snacks and beverages. i look forward to seeing the guys when we return next year. thanks so much for helping to make our trip memorable!

the best boat club in fort lauderdale. they have the best locations and offering a wide variety of vessels to rent. there are options for becoming a boat club member. also they provide trainings for new and experienced boaters to make them … more feel comfortable operating a powerboat. the customer service is a++. highly recommended place for all your boating needs!!

the safe powerboat handling course offered by the best boat club would not be same without captain juan strambini ! he is extremely helpful, very very friendly and most importantly the best man for the job. he has years of experience behind … more his belt and a ton of knowledge which he shares with you the moment you meet him. i really enjoyed my 16-hour course i just completed last weekend (at the pompano beach location). both in-class material as well as practical on the boat training was priceless. my comfort level of steering a boat went from 5% (close to nothing) to 80% the first day of the course, and it only got better the next day! it was really fun, and i highly recommend capt. juan to anyone who is interested in learning how to safely operate a boat.

fantastic place! the boats are always looking good and the staff is very attentive. they put my wife and i on the boat with our kids and showed us where to go for the best experience for the whole family. we absolutely loved whiskey creek … more and stopping at 15th st fisheries to feed the fish. 10/10 would recommend this business every time!
