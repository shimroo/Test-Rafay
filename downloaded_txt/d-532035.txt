                                        as always they knocked it out of the park.  every single time i send her flowers, i get a call, text or short video saying “they are so beautiful.  the whole condo smells like flowers.  thank you!!! xoxoxo”

                                        the website had so many lovely arrangements that it was awhile before i selected this one. i saw a photo of what was delivered and it was almost identical which was a wonderful surprise. the florist at vip flowers did exactly what i was hoping for, a beautiful mother’s day for a dear friend. i highly recommend bloomnation for all occasions at a reasonable price.

                                        vip floral designs has never failed to deliver amazing arrangements every time i’ve ordered. and whether i’ve ordered a few days ahead or ordered on the day i needed them, they’ve delivered just as promised. i won’t go anywhere else for flowers when they have to say, “babe, you’re the most precious thing in my life”.

                                        i had paid for a lily and rose combo, but they had replaced the lilies with some other kind of flower. also they added the valentine's day writing on the rose without notice. at least my wife liked them so i can't complain too much. after contacting the florist, i had not realized this was an upgrade. as i don't know the different varieties of flowers i was unaware. thank you again for my purchase.

                vip floral designs was founded during a time when flower shops were often unprofessional and unskilled. those types of businesses still exist, but vip floral designs has built a reputation for being different. vip is known for offering the highest quality arrangements and best customer service. they only hire highly skilled designers, and they require each designer to have at least five years of experience in the industry. in order to join the vip team, a designer must first undergo a rigorous interview process. in addition to a standard resume, they must create a floral design that is presented in a portfolio. only candidates who can create a design that meets the company’s high standards are hired on. the company also has a rigorous training program for new designers, which lasts at least a year. this ensures that each floral designer is skilled at creating the most beautiful arrangements.
