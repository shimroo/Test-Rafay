webinar announcement: wil(d)flowers
 

 
the wil(d)flowers-webinars aim to bridge the gap between the world of industry and
education. focusing on work-integrated-learning(wil) methods, key experts from industry,
education and related institutions are sharing their experiences in cooperative education.
with the specific point-of-view of german-japanese collaboration, similarities as well as
differences are explored to further expand a common understanding between the two
countries. participation is free of charge and open for everyone, slide decks will be provided
in english and japanese. presentation language depends on the speaker(english or japanese)
but a translation for questions & answers will be offered. free registration for the next event
slots will be possible here.
