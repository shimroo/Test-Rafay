about us


in spring of 1980, jacques amiel, a 20 year veteran sales executive for zenith corporation with a finger on the pulse of the canadian market, recognized what the burgeoning appliance market needed the most: a full service high end appliance distributor with a dedicated sales team, brand and product marketing support and complete after sale service and warranty management.
with a diverse product line-up ranging from mid to high end european and north american appliances, amiel distribution ltd. has grown to become one of the most influential and successful distributors in the premium home appliance industry. leveraging a robust infrastructure to support its discerning clientele, from end consumers to the most trendsetting builders and designers, amiel has become the unmatched point of reference in independent distribution in canada.
