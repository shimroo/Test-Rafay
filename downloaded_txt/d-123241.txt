                            ghostly flight species of baleen whales avoid attracting killer whales by singing too low to be heard                          

killer whales are the only natural predator of baleen whales. more solitary than toothed whales, baleen whales face predatory attacks from killer whales, especially mother and calf pairs. when attacked, some species fight back, while others choose flight. but whale species also produce loud underwater songs…what stops killer whales from homing in on their calls and attacking them? new acoustic research by trevor branch sheds light on why.

snails and their shells:  capstone research in the burke museum’s shell collection
walk along any beach, and you’re likely to find snail shells dotting the sand. in the bering sea, more than 200 species of sea snails exist. they’re an important source of prey for fish and walruses, playing a vital part in the bering sea food web. working with a 50-year-old shell collection sourced from noaa trawls from the mid-late 1970s, jasper nevis is looking at community structure in bering sea snails in collaboration with the burke museum malacology collection.
