undergraduate program


mechanical engineering is one of the broadest engineering disciplines, preparing students for a wide range of career opportunities in industries such as aerospace, automotive, bioengineering, controls, design and manufacturing. the ud mechanical engineering department offers a quality education at an exceptional value. the department is small enough to facilitate direct contact between faculty and students yet large enough to offer a diverse range of resources.

graduate programs

 global, green, and engaged. our job is not finished until our ideas, our expertise and our people make a real and significant difference in the world. join us in multidisciplinary research focusing on the most compelling scientific and technical challenges of our age. the department of mechanical engineering offers three graduate programs; the ph.d., a master of science in mechanical engineering (thesis or non-thesis), and a graduate certificate in composites manufacturing and engineering. while most incoming graduate students have a degree in mechanical engineering or other closely related fields, our graduate programs are also suitable for students with degrees in such areas as physics or mathematics.
