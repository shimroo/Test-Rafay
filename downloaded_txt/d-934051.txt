after nearly 50 years in prison, leonard peltier is free to go home.
he was released tuesday morning from a federal prison in florida.
former president joe biden commuted the sentence of the indigenous activist last month, for his role in a 1975 deadly shootout with fbi agents on the pine ridge reservation in south dakota.
peltier, an enrolled citizen of the turtle mountain band of chippewa indians, will reside on his tribal homelands in north dakota, serving out the remainder of his sentence in home confinement
the indigenous organization ndn collective is bringing him back home.
in a statement, peltier said, “today i am finally free. they may have imprisoned me, but they never took my spirit.”
he also thanked his supporters saying he looks forward to seeing his friends, family, and community.
ndn collective ceo nick tilsen in a statement said peltier never gave up fighting for his freedom so they never gave up fighting for him.
many see peltier as a symbol of racism and oppression against native americans by the justice system.
while the move to free peltier has drawn applause from members of congress and groups like amnesty international, it has been opposed by law enforcement officials.
on wednesday, ndn collective is hosting an event to celebrate his return home, and a community feed in belcourt, n.d.
the event will be live streamed.

peltier is 80 years old and is said to be in poor health.

the chairman of the fort peck assiniboine and sioux tribes delivered the state of tribal nations address to the montana legislature on monday.
justin gray hawk says tribes in the state are healthy, strong, and resilient.
he began the speech by highlighting some successes he says lawmakers and the state have supported in indian country, including a water settlement, economic ventures, and a tax sharing agreement.
gray hawk says bills tribes have supported are funding for law enforcement, addressing missing and murdered indigenous people, and expanding medicaid.
he says among issues tribes will continue to advocate for are indian education, protecting tribal hunting and fishing rights, and bringing back bison to tribal lands. gray hawk ended his speech by encouraging partnerships with tribes.
“this is an important time to come together. it is important to remind ourselves and our surrounding communities that together we are greater than the sum of our parts.”
there are seven reservations and 12 tribes in montana.

nevada’s only sitting indigenous legislator has introduced a bill to recognize indigenous peoples’ day on what she calls the “correct day” – the second monday in october.
the bill was heard last week, as alex gonzalez reports.
gov. joe lombardo (r-nv) issued a proclamation designating august 9 as indigenous peoples’ day in nevada, but assemblymember shea backus (cherokee/d-nv) says it doesn’t pay indigenous communities the recognition or respect they deserve.
she says ab144 would align both dates – as is celebrated across the nation.
“indigenous peoples day isn’t just about a day of recognition, it is about placing indigenous voices at the forefront of decisions that shape the future of this state. it is this deep cultural connection that has shaped the character of the state of nevada, and should be celebrated.”
backus says opponents of the bill see it as an attempt to remove columbus day, a federal holiday, from the books.
she rejects that notion, and says the second monday in october could instead be shared between both holidays.
assemblymember richard delong (r-nv) questioned the precedent the change of date could be setting for the state.
“under state law, there are no overlaps. this would be the first time that the state ever decides to have a period of observance that you have two of them coinciding on the same day. so in that sense, it is unique and different.”
but backers of the bill say banks and other establishments already recognize the october date both as indigenous peoples day and columbus day, and see the bill as a formality to codify the joint recognition into law.
