we had the most amazing experience at flowerfield! lauren, our event coordinator was there every step of the way while planning our wedding. not only is the venue stunning, the staff is amazing. our maitre d, johnny and bridal attendant, debbie were fabulous and went above and beyond to make sure everything was going smoothly. the food was spectacular and our guests were complimenting it the whole night. we are reliving every moment of our wedding, and they made our vision come to life! cheers to the team at flowerfield for making our wedding a night to remember!
