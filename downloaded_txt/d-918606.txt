what our customers are saying...
















service is the key word in describing united site services. we have appreciated their attention to detail in working with us for the planning of our event, the denver marathon, and especially for their services provided on race day.

ron k., denver, co




got a hold of me right away, listened to what i needed and got me what i needed. understood my budget and got me the toilets at a very reasonable price. the staff in the san jose office were very nice and easy to deal with.

matt z., san francisco, ca




united provided an immediate response, and went above and beyond to help me work within the bride's budget. i plan to work with this service many times in the future for my event planning business!

jennifer k., lexington park, md




the port-a-potty was clean and was the hit of the party which was themed "under construction." the delivery was on time and the people i made contact with (including the delivery guy) were very professional. i would definitely call them again should i need a porta-potty.

tom c., st. petersburg, fl




we would like to thank you for your services at this year’s preakness stakes.your equipment that you provided was clean, up to date and well stocked. everything arrived on time and was set up with no problem and to specification.

ben h., maryland jockey club




in my four years as vp of operations at new hampshire motor speedway (nhms), united site services, inc. has consistently delivered excellent service. they've provided hundreds of portable toilets, vip trailers, camper pumping, and 100,000 gallons of septic removal before each event. their dedicated local team ensures event success, rain or shine.

john z., nhms v.p. operations




thank you for your invaluable support at naval air station patuxent river’s air expo ‘09, featuring the blue angels, golden knights, and more. your dedication ensured a safe environment for over 111,000 thrilled guests, making the event a resounding success. congratulations on a job well done!

andrew m., patuxent river, md




united site services delivered as promised, arriving on time, offering friendly and helpful service. despite being a small town, they treated us with professionalism, not hesitating to help. they made us feel valued, regardless of the project's size, providing a wonderful experience. thank you!

janette f., roanoke, tx




at the niles antique fair, i managed a boy scout fundraiser, operating a parking lot. your portable toilets received numerous compliments for their quality and comfort, even from seasoned scouts and adults. your company excels in a service that most people would like to forget.

chris g. new haven, ct




i want to take a second to let you know that i have used united on 90% of our projects for the last 5-6 years and we have been 100% satisfied with the service we have received. i know that with the current market conditions, price is first and foremost in making the decision on who to go with. i do believe if you end up choosing united you will not be disappointed.

scott j., concord, ca




i want to commend your outstanding service during the 2002 sun ‘n fun fly-in. you played a pivotal role in its success, and the low service call rate, despite 500+ portable toilets, is a testament to your excellence.

don h. lakeland, fl




thanks united site services! during our event, we had unexpected rain overnight disrupting our plans, but they swiftly delivered replacement units, saving the day. they'll be our first call for next year's event.

 steve drew, foxborough founders day, ma




united site services consistently delivers 5-star service. over our 5-year partnership, they've never disappointed. whether it's last-minute or after-hours, they're reliable. their customer service team and drivers are professional, friendly, and timely.

bobby w., clackamas, or




we just used two restroom trailers at the landis beer and wine festival and wow the guests loved them.

mike w., landis, nc
