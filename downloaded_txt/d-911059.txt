                                   i can’t express how much of a financial blessing that the lending team have been to me. i went from being in the negative every month and not being able to meet all of my financial obligations. now i can meet all of my financial obligations and extra money that i haven’t had in a long time. this credit union and especially the loan department has renewed my faith and belief that there are people that really want to help. i have referred a few family members and working on getting more people to join river city federal credit union. due to their outstanding customer service and products they offer.

i love river city, from the moment i walked in i was greeted by monique, who sat with me and gave me my debit card within minutes. after speaking to her for a while, i told her my troubles with my old bank. she said “don’t worry, you’re in good hands now.”  within a week, i have opened a bank account and finally have a line of credit and a credit card. i felt hopeless because i never understood how i can establish credit but get denied due to no credit history. well i’m glad to say monique went above and beyond to help me get on the right road. thank you river city and monique for the opportunity.

                           i want to thank dorothy for all her help. she helped me get a debt relief loan that has put me in a much better financial position. i am very grateful for river city federal union for helping me when no other financial institution would. i will refer everyone i know to come do business here.

you have an employee by the name of elaine that helped me figure out a problem with one of my accounts. she was so professional and quickly found the problem and explained it to me. she contacted another department to make sure the corrections were made and she updated me of my new balance. she even offered to send me a copy of the corrections. this is a wonderful example of great customer service!
