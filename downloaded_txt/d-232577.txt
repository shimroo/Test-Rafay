read this before you buy your pos computer.
not every computer is ideal for pos. in a typical point of sale setting, each checkout register or station has its own computer, and all the necessary pos hardware and computer peripherals are connected to this computer. when buying a pos computer, you need to consider the interface ports available on the computer, memory (ram) size, processor type and speed, size of hard drive, etc.
      
why computerize your cash register
computerized pos systems offer many advantages over conventional cash registers. a standard computerized cash register consists of pos computer, touch screen or non-touch screen monitor, bar code scanner, inventory control software, receipt printer, cash drawer, and pole display. optional components such as cash register scale, handheld inventory tracking devices, and payment processing devices can be added as needed.      
       for more details, see the benefits of computerized pos system.
