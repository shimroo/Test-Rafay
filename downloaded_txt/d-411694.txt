• substream 2010 - 2022


			substream is an on-rails shooter for windows pc, which i started developing in 2010. i wanted to make a game where the environment morphs and pulses in sync with the soundtrack. there was no affordable game engine which could make this happen at the time so i coded my own in c++ and directx. development was sporadic and i had to rediscover the project a few times over several years until i eventually released the game in 2022.

• task tracker 2022 - 2023


			some of my past software development roles have required context switching often throughout my days, and then trying to fill out a time sheet at the end of the week. this is difficult combiniation and it's easy to get lost. so i created a simple windows forms application to track my time, save it in a file automatically, and review it at a later date. the only thing i need to remember now is to switch the selected row when i switch task.

• procedural architecture 2005












			for the final project of my masters degree i developed software which procedurally generated indoor architecture. it was inspired by games like grand theft auto 3 where the city buildings are just external walls. the software lets a user draw an outline building shape in two dimensions. then in three dimensions the algorithm fills this shape with walls, doorways, and windows. the dissertation is around ten thousand words.

• toca 3 psp demo 2007


			the playable demo of the first console game i contributed to, toca race driver 3 challenge. i was the sole developer of the demo, deciding which tracks and cars i could squeeze into the strict file size for a psp demo.

• console game credits 2006 - 2011


			i worked at sumo digital as a ui and ai programmer. i'm credited in these console games, which are available now at your favourite second-hand retro games reseller.
		











• gameboy mods 2018 - 2019


			i've been making some gameboy and nintendo ds mods and refurbs. particularly "gameboy macros", which are made by upcyling the bottom half of a broken nintendo ds lite and have a bigger, brighter screen than other gbas. i've yet to sell anything yet, i want to practise and improve my build quality first.
