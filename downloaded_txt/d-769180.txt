poipu beach
hawaii
poipu beach is actually two beaches in one. a tombola (known as nukumoi point) separates the two bays. a tombola is a narrow sand spit that extends from shore to an island. the tombola at poipu beach is the favorite spot for the napping , endangered hawaiian monk seals. the area on the western side of the beach, is a favorite for beginning body boarders. small waves break gently on the shallow sandbar and create a fun area for children to play.
on the left of the sandbar is a lava rock protected and shallow area for swimming. this is usually the play area for families with small children. poipu beach park has been voted the #1 beach in america. during the weekends this is a favorite spot for birthday parties, picnics, lawn games and family activities. the outdoor playground was built by donations from the community. you can find parking , snorkel rental and surfboard rentals near by.

 





 




" we stayed in the seabreeze unit for 2 weeks in late may/early june. the condo was well equipped, clean, and quiet. the beds were very comfortable. the condo is about a 5-minute walk from poipu beach. we were able to drive to the parking lot early in the morning, set up on the beach, and walk back to the condo. it was also convenient for me to be able to walk back to the condo in the afternoon while my husband stayed at the beach. ac throughout. a convenient laundry room at the bottom of the stairs. there are 2 condos downstairs that can only accommodate couples. so, if you are trying to avoid staying in a condo near noisy families, this condo will work for you! i can't imagine that anyone would regret renting this condo!
