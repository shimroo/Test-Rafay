update: the all-new breakfast bowl!





last year we announced that the new and improved breakfast bowl was in development. we have the recipe, but like any dish requiring perfection, good things take time. and, it has taken much longer than expected.

nevertheless, we're getting closer. keep tracking us here or on social media in the coming weeks for the launch of the breakfast bowl version 2.0. after almost 14 years this site will re-establish itself as the most comprehensive source for cereal related news, analysis and cultural musings.

all part of a complete breakfast!

coming soon: a new breakfast bowl!



you may have noticed that things have been somewhat quiet here the last month or so. besides life being extra busy right now, we are also working on an updated, revamped breakfast bowl site.

the breakfast bowl was launched 13 years ago with the commitment to examine the cereal industry and the role cereal has within our culture. since times and technologies have changed it is time for a new platform and a fresh look and feel. in the coming weeks watch for the new and improved breakfast bowl, full of goodness, and part of a complete breakfast!

in the meantime, our postings here may be limited, but be sure to keep up with us on facebook, twitter, and instagram!

lucky charms feeling a little less blue







there was excitement in the cereal world last fall, when it was leaked that general mills would be introducing a frosted flakes version of its highly popular lucky charms. as i noted upon its release at the beginning of this year, this was more than just another variety, but an attempted direct hit at kellogg's iconic frosted flakes brand with the use of an almost identical blue background, and an all-caps white typeface.

if there was any confusion with the two brands, that should now be lessened. i just spotted an updated version of lucky charms frosted flakes with a much lighter blue background and different lettering. these new boxes have begun to appear without any fanfare or announcement from general mills.

so why did they go with this redesign so quickly after launch? most likely kellogg put pressure on them, warning them that it was too close to their frosted flakes design scheme (even though frosted flakes as a name is not a registered trademark). the less cynical might think this was intentional, to create less confusion between the two cereals.

in any case, scoop up some boxes of the original, dark blue version. they could be a collector items some day!

review: goh-goh granolas





last week i reported on the innovative new goh-goh cereals that only require added water because of the powdered milk in the single-serving cups. this is intended to be the ultimate in cereal convenience. sunny crunch foods sent me samples of their four current offerings, and here's a combined review of them.

while goh-goh is expected to be eventually available in other cereal types, at present the focus is on granola. the four varieties are: blueberry greek yogurt, chocolate chip crunch, honey hemp & flax, and raisin & almond. 


the unique selling point of goh-goh cereals is the powdered milk. so, when evaluating taste the issue extends beyond the normal profile of ingredients. the ultimate question is: can goh-goh match the taste of real milk in cereal? in short, the answer is, mostly. i must admit to having been skeptical at first, having many bad memories of disgusting skim milk powders in the past. goh-goh is really clear that they are using dehydrated whole milk, and the difference is noticeable. while i cannot say that the taste is 100% identical to real milk, it comes pretty close according to my taste buds. my wife, however, is much more taste sensitive, and was not as forgiving. nonetheless, i believe that most people will not be distracted by the milk taste, and if anything, will overlook any minor differences due to the convenience advantages. 

as far as the cereals themselves are concerned, they are fairly typical granolas, despite the variance in ingredients. my favorite, clearly, was the blueberry greek yogurt, followed by the chocolate chip crunch. most disappointing was the raisin & almond. there were maybe 3 or 4 raisins in the entire cup, and its incorporation of rice crisps lessened that wholesome granola impact. all said, the taste of these hardly stand out, however, any one would be satisfying for most people on the run.






as granolas, these cereals are fairly predictable as far as texture is concerned. the oats have substance and hold out well in milk. generally, the ingredients were much finer than in typical granolas, and there were virtually no granola clusters anywhere. the only texture disappointment relates to my previous comment on the raisin & almond variety. the rice crisps made for a much less hearty serving.




the convenience of just adding water contributes greatly to a wow experience for those looking to eat breakfast on the run. again, this is what makes this cereal stand out. the packaging highlights this, but i find the overall design of the single-serving cups too cluttered, thereby potentially distracting from the strong message that consumers need to see when seeing these in a store.



goh-goh also wants to position these cereals as wholesome and nutritious. as granolas they meet that standard, for the most part. each serving is in the 220-290 calorie range and with significant fiber. sugar content, as is typical with granolas, is slightly higher than ideal, in the 20-30% range of total weight category; but in reality it is actually higher compared to other cereals, considering that milk is also included in the calculations. nonetheless, you could do much more worse in picking a cereal.





in the end, goh-goh granolas are a solid choice for consumers, especially when considering the convenience factor. having these on the go would be an excellent option for most people, and may keep more people eating cereal in an age when people are turning to other foods for their morning nourishment. 



all you need is a spoon.

goh-goh: just add water



one of the frequently stated reasons for the decline of cereal consumptions is the trend toward greater convenience among consumers. pouring a bowl of cereal with milk seems to be too arduous for some people, prompting them to switch to alternatives like bars and yogurt. for decades, cereal has come in convenient, single-serve packs, but there is always the problem with the milk. there has been some innovation with double-containers to keep the cereal and milk separate until consumption, including an attempt by kellogg in 2005, and a more recent invention last year; but none of these have taken off.



canadian company, sunny crunch foods, has come up with a different approach: individual cereal cups with powdered milk - only water is needed to make your breakfast. branded as goh-goh, this new line of on-the-go cereal has been recently available in canada, but this month is making its u.s. debut in 7-eleven stores, with planned expansion to larger grocery retailers. executive vice-president, jeff wagoner, told me that a challenge they face is that because of the uniqueness of the product buyers do not yet know what to think about it. "but, once they realize the value-added aspect of having the milk already in the cereal (just add cold water), it being shelf-stable and portable (take it anywhere), coupled with the all-natural ingredients aspect makes goh-goh cereal cups an exciting new product entry into the breakfast category!"

to be fair, this is not the first attempt of cereal cups with powdered milk. a few years ago, u.k. cereal maker, mornflake, introduced a similar product, but it is no longer available. perhaps one reason is they used skimmed milk powder, which many consumers do not find palatable. goh-goh uses whole milk, which is designed to come much closer to what people are used to in their cereal.

currently, goh-goh comes in four granola flavors: blueberry greek yogurt, chocolate chip crunch, honey hemp & flax, and raisin & almond. wagoner said that they are planning to introduce other types of cereals (i.e. corn flakes, puffed rice, etc.) as well.

the company sent me some samples, and i will be posting a review of them in the coming days.

so, are you interested in this type of convenient cereal?

is the future of cereal in flavor?





the big question in the mind of cereal manufacturers and marketers is how to bring new life to a food commodity that no longer has the same appeal to consumers. we have frequently discussed this problem and the possible innovations that could make a difference, but perhaps one obvious factor may be overlooked: flavor.

a recent article in food business news examines the issue of flavor in cereal and reveals some of the interesting possibilities ahead for our favorite breakfast food. author, jeff gelski, provides a comprehensive view the various factors behind flavoring cereals, making for an interesting read. he suggests that flavor provides a tremendous opportunity for innovation, and that new flavors are about to hit the market, like mango, chili pepper and honey, and candy.

the point in all this is that there is much room for creativity and pushing new boundaries when it comes to cereal. most of what we see out there is a re-hashing of what has been done before: marshmallows, fruit flavors, chocolate, peanut butter, cinnamon, etc. rarely do we see something that completely disrupts the market, and yet the industry is in desperate need for something that captures the imagination of consumers. and, with many people eating cereal outside of breakfast, there is probably a real market for such varieties as spicy and savoury.

back in 2016, i highlighted kellogg owned bear naked's foray into cereal customization. modeled after germany's mymuesli, bear naked allows online customers to create their own combinations, now with such wild options as lavender, pale ale, jalapeno, bacon, bourbon, coffee, chipotle, beets, wine, olives, kale and curry, among more conventional choices. it's hard to say how popular these choices are, and this approach is still far from the mainstream.

maybe it's time for a startup to take this on, or better yet for the big cereal companies to step outside of their comfort zone and present consumers with some choices that will truly get their attention.

what cereal flavors would you like to see?

copy if you're lucky



there are more exciting things to report on here than every time a cereal manufacturer changes a color, shape or marshmallow. that happens all the time, and for the most part is just gimmickry.



so, last week's official announcement that lucky charms would be introducing a permanent, new marshmallow in the shape of a unicorn immediately generated an eye roll from me. this followed another announcement less than two weeks earlier that the hourglass marshmallow would be discontinued. big news, huh?

normally this would be overlooked (despite the fact that some people actually care about this), but there appears to be something else going on here. this is the second time in the last few months that general mills is stealing a page from the kellogg playbook and incorporating it into lucky charms. this seems to be more than just coincidence. 

late last year we reported on the new kellogg's unicorn cereal that is coming out this march. with all the hype over unicorns lately, we should not be surprised that general mills wants into the action as well, hence the new marshmallow and new boxes highlighting a unicorn!

and, of course, there was the other kellogg moment at general mills when they recently introduced frosted flakes lucky charms, blue box and all, playing off of kellogg's successful frosted flakes cereal.

they say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but it makes me wonder if general mills has given up on true innovation, and now is just reacting to whatever other good ideas they see out there?

the art of box redesigns



i have long argued that the box has been the most important aspect when it comes to breakfast cereal. no other food has been sold more on the basis of its packaging than with cereal, and the designs and characters found on cereal boxes have had a profound effect on our psyches and the larger culture. 

over the years we have seen every cereal brand update its boxes with fresh designs and artwork; however, most of the time the changes are incremental, providing more of an evolution than a true transformation. it is recognized that boxes have to keep up with the times (and competition), keeping consumers engaged.

so, while change is a constant, two recent prominent cereal box redesigns have caught my attention. very recently, actually in the last few days, i came across a fresh new look for kellogg's froot loops. up to this point, most of the heavily sugared, "fun" cereals have been cartoonish, touting largely flat designs and solid colors. this latest edition is bold and energizing, placing emphasis on the mascot (i.e. toucan sam) and not on the cereal name, and giving him a much more realistic 3-d look. even the bowl of cereal is different than what is typical, showing a side view of a glass bowl, jumping with excitement. i'm assuming we'll see many other kellogg cereals adopt this style, and that should really make them pop on the shelves. good job, kellogg!

another redesign has also recently been noted. this time it is not one of the big brands, but a smaller company that focuses on organic, health food cereals. canadian-based nature's path is the leading independent brand in this segment, and has carved out a significant presence in most grocery stores across north america. obviously, they are going for a different look than froot loops, focusing on natural ingredients and messaging that reinforces their health orientation. with the changes they have announced, they are moving away from a more serious look to one that is somewhat less stuffy. this is accomplished with new layouts, stronger colors and more irreverent typeface. while in an interview with packaging design they gush over the changes, i'm not convinced the new boxes are all that they could be. in many ways, the new design is too busy, distracting from the serious cereals that nature's path is selling. the company also has a sub-brand, envirokidz, targeted to children. these boxes are getting a new look as well, and these seem a much better fit.

again, these are just two examples of many box redesigns we have seen over the years. but, they illustrate the challenge that companies have in doing this. it is certainly not as easy as it seems, and the ultimate tests will be consumer reaction and sales. having said that, however, very few of these design changes really make a big difference, as most companies are much too timid to try something truly "out of the box." there are some exceptions, however. two of the best cereal box transformations that i have seen in recent years come from kellogg-owned kashi and britain's good grain. kashi went super simple focusing on a super-enlarged cereal piece on each white-spaced box, giving a distinct appearance. good grain demonstrated how to move away from a conventional cereal box also with greater simplicity, and pronounced color schemes.

changing cereal boxes is not by itself going to turn the tide of declining sales, but if cereal companies want to revitalize this industry, one important strategy is to focus more on the box, and the messages these important vehicles send to consumers looking for something interesting.

are cereal companies waving the white flag?






we all know that breakfast cereal is gradually losing its appeal among consumers. sure, a large proportion of the population still enjoy a bowl most mornings, but increasingly, consumers are turning to other options. this is not new, and the big cereal companies, mainly general mills and kellogg, have long felt the trend first-hand, prompting them to diversify their brand portfolios to include a wide range of other food products, ranging from yogurt to cookies to meat alternatives.

last week, during kellogg's quarterly earnings call, we not only saw further evidence of this diversification, but a blatant admission that the future might not be centered around cereal. according to food industry news, ceo stephen a. cahillane said, "you shouldn’t look at u.s. morning foods and say this is going to be the growth engine for the kellogg co." despite all their efforts, net sales for breakfast foods fell another 5%. cahillane did state that they have to do more. in fact, he owned up to the fact that "getting people excited about it is our job to do. and we can do better in brand building in the united states."

again, these trends are no surprise, but stating outright that breakfast foods (i.e. mainly cereal) are not the growth engine for kellogg is evidence that the company is already looking past cereal, to greater opportunities in other food sectors. callihane confessed that they are moving "from primarily a cereal business to much more of an innovative snacking business." certainly, this does not mean they are abandoning cereal at this time, as it still is their core, but it does suggest they may be resigned to allow it to shrink while focusing on areas which they believe have greater potential.

it appears that the white flags may be reluctantly coming up, and that in the process the big cereal companies will no longer drive true cereal innovation.
