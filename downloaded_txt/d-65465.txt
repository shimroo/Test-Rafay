baseball glove relace and glove repair testimonials...
"i wanted to take a moment and thank you for the prompt service & the excellent quality of the omaha infield glove you just did for us. as a high school varsity coach, i appreciate quality gloves & glove repair; after reviewing this repair job you did, i can assure you that you will have my baseball programs glove repair from this point forward. thank you again rick for the quality service & repair....raymond b. in oregon

"i can't remember being this happy sliding a glove onto my hand since i bought this one brand new in 1962. that old expression, "they don't make 'em like they used to" is very appropriate in this situation. having tried on several expensive gloves last season to replace this one when the laces broke,,,, nothing looked or felt like my old '62 roger maris. 

now, thanks to you, it once again looks terrific and feels as good as it ever has. thank you for bringing back a piece of my childhood. feel free to use my name and photos of my glove if you like. i am a believer in you and your service and will recommend you to all my friends. (there are a lot of us baby-boomers out there holding onto our old gloves)." ...edward l. in new jersey
