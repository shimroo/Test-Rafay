about south valley civic theatre 
 south valley civic theatre entertains, enlightens, engages, and inspires through the magic of live theater. we have been a fixture in our south valley community for over 50 years!
we offer two performance venues. our limelight theater is an intimate performance space where we produce 2 plays a year. we are also the resident company of the morgan hill community playhouse, where we present 5 larger shows a year — typically a children’s musical, a teen musical, a third, larger play, a family musical, and a smaller adult musical.
