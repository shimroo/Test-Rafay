you can bring feng shui into your home by hanging feng shui paintings with certain colors or subjects. for example, a picture of a goldfish can draw wealth. this fish is associated with the east sector of the home and should be placed on the east wall of the living room. you can also hang a family portrait on the east, which is linked with vitality. the south wall, on the other hand, is associated with fame, reputation, rank, and wealth, and you can harness the positive energy of fire with water fountains.
when deciding what to hang on your bedroom walls, keep in mind that the wall facing the bed is the first thing you see in the morning and the last thing you see at night. you can hang paintings of places you’ve visited, paintings of people you like, or even framed diplomas. the right feng shui wall decor can bring you good fortune. however, you should take care to avoid putting mirrors on the west wall, as they bring negative energy.

when choosing what to hang on your walls, keep in mind that feng shui is a personal practice. the wrong kind of art could harm your health. learn feng shui tips before hanging artwork.  a painting that brings sadness or depression can have an opposite effect. similarly, a picture that evokes anger or depression should not be hung next to a window, as it can create negative energy. and make sure that your pictures face the right direction in the room!
if you want to bring good feng shui into your home, you should hang beautiful paintings on the walls that face the direction of your bed. the yang energy generated by the paintings can bring you good fortune in your daily life. it can help you achieve success in your career and love life. if you’re looking for ways to make your living space a better place, you can hang the right kinds of pictures on the walls that face the north and the south.

you can choose feng shui wall decor that includes paintings with different colors and elements. for example, if you want to attract recognition and fame, hang a painting of the red element. its color represents passion and joy. the right picture will bring good chi to your home. if you are planning to sell your house, then you should choose one that is close to the location of your business.
another important part of feng shui is the placement of your paintings. ideally, the paintings should be placed opposite your bed, preferably in the southwest part of the main bedroom. it is also important to place your paintings in the right places. for example, in your living room, a picture of the mountains should be placed near the east doorway. these are a few of the tips on how to use feng shui wall decor in your home.
