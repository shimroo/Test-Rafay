musician and composer

imagine bach on the banjo.

 









magic of then. passion of now.



imagine the composer/musician— grows up in chicago. his irish family sings with the player-piano, and talks politics and poetry. his inner jukebox spins with 500 years of pop songs on late night radio. these songs turn into set lists—curtis mayfield, dave brubeck, pete seeger, j.s. bach. these conversations turn into shows and compositions. and there is michael j. miles. musical hunter-gatherer. electrifying performer. boundless bender of genres. you simply have to hear him play.
