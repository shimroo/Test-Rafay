welcome to fairfax shelties!





















at fairfax, shelties 
are our passion.
we have devoted the last 
30 years to breeding 
quality shetland 
sheepdogs.
a small but dedicated hobby 
breeder, we average only one 
or two litters per year.  that being said, we have done what no 
other breeder in north america has done with such a small 
breeding programme; 90 canadian & american champions, including 
best in show, best puppy in show, best in specialty show, best 
puppy in specialty show, and multiple romc’s - all accomplished 
with just a small handful of quality breeding dogs.
many top winning & producing kennels in canada, the u.s., china & 
korea have been founded on our bloodlines.
we are now in our “twilight years”, but still occasionally have 
puppies available to good homes.  
whether you are looking for a healthy family pet, or a promising 
show prospect, you have come to the right place!
we hope you enjoy your visit!  we have just re-vamped our site, 
adding many new pages and features for your enjoyment.  stroll 
through our gardens, check out our “links”, “horsin’ around” and 
new photo albums.   grooming dvd for pet owners available soon! 
visit our “”what’s new” page for the latest updates .
