welcome to















home of team hayes, led by trainers ben, will & jd hayes.
























































where hard work, hands-on horsemanship, a history-making family dynasty and world class facilities combine to achieve racetrack success.














based in creightons creek, just out of euroa in victoria, lindsay park is built on 1500 acres of lush pasture and features world-class, purpose-built private training facilities. this is where the hayes brothers continue their family’s incredible legacy of racetrack success following in the footsteps of their father david hayes and their grandfather colin hayes, both hall of fame trainers. with satellite stables in flemington and pakenham, horses trained under the lindsay park banner get the best of all worlds and are set up to succeed at the highest levels.


























the hayes name has been synonymous with racetrack success since 1947 when colin hayes first began his stellar career in south australia. after producing champions such as dulcify, rory’s jester, beldale ball and at talaq, in 1990 colin handed over the reins to son david who went on to have his own extraordinary training success becoming the youngest ever trainer to be admitted to the racing hall of fame. david is acknowledged as one of australia’s most successful trainers with horses like better loosen up, miss finland and fields of omagh and has continued to add to his successes during two tenures in hong kong.
