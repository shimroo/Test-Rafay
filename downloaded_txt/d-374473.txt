47 years and counting of yours truly! that is wild and crazy, kids. wondering what's been happening with keenspot's animation development? check out the latest videos on our youtube channel!












year twenty-five ends, year twenty-six begins.
march 1, 2024
holy shit. happy 25th anniversary, superositites! the silver anniversary of superosity is somehow here! that's a madness-inducing 9,133 strips and counting. it's lasted so long, we've literally reached the point where now advanced art-generating artificial intelligence is (illegally) trained on my drawings! when the singularity happens in 2027 it's gonna be really weird, i'm guessing. on a happier note, while we are still in no way closer to a superosity cartoon, we have recently teamed with the awesome kate micucci and the amazing tobi wilson to develop a cartoon based on another keenspot comic! read all about it here!

september 15, 2023
46 years and counting of yours truly! and oh hey, i was quoted in another deadline article since i last updated this page! oh, and i'm now on an exciting new social media platform called x (?!?).


year twenty-four ends, year twenty-five begins.
march 1, 2023
happy 24th anniversary, superositites! that's a senses-shattering 8,767 strips and counting! and we're still not much closer to a superosity animated tv series happening, but we're now in production on a star-studded animated show based on another keenspot comic that i'm producing and did the casting on! (that's why bobby has a bit part in it!) anyway, only one-year to go until a full quarter-century of superosity! holy shit.


45...
september 15, 2022
45 years and counting of yours truly! and hey, a webcomic i created (not this one, sadly!) was optioned for tv! follow me on twitter for updates!


year twenty-three ends, year twenty-four begins.
march 1, 2022
happy 23rd anniversary, superositites! that's a maddening 8,401 strips and counting! but are we any closer to a superosity animated tv series happening? no... but my company is co-producing animated tv serieses now, so maybe someday? read about our first one in variety.

44...
september 15, 2021
44 years and counting of yours truly! to be continued... (remember to follow me on twitter!)


year twenty-two ends, year twenty-three begins.
march 1, 2021
happy 22nd anniversary, superositites! that's an insane 8,036 strips and counting! will we hit 10,000? probably!



43...
september 15, 2020
43 years and counting of yours truly! the adventure continues. (remember to go see marry me in theaters everywhere valentine's day 2022!)


year twenty-one ends, year twenty-two begins.
march 1, 2020
happy 21st anniversary, superositites! that's a whopping 7,671 strips and counting! so, how have you been doing this past 21 years? e-mail me at superosity@keenspot.com and let me know!

september 15, 2019
42 years and counting of yours truly! so weird. (trillionaires:  click here.)

year twenty ends, year twenty-one begins.
march 1, 2019
happy 20th anniversary, superositites!  can you believe it?  holy wow, 20 years and 7,306 strips.  that's nutso.  if you feel like being a real weird person and celebrating this, you can go out and buy a cringe-inducingly stupid parody comic book called fartnite on march 6th.  i had a hand in creating it, and there's even a 3-page 20th anniversary tribute to superosity in the back.  the backside of a comic book called fartnite is surely the most fitting place for a 20th anniversary celebration of this little comic strip.  if your local comic shop doesn't carry it, you can order it online right here.

they say it's my birthday!
september 15, 2018
41 years and counting of yours truly!  if you want to give me a birthday gift of a large sum of cash money every month, click here.

was too sick to draw! now feeling better and i'm back!
june 26, 2018
sorry for the missed strips (but thank you for noticing)!  been really sick since saturday, but i'm mostly better now and i'm gonna try to do two strips a day until i'm caught up.

year nineteen ends, year twenty begins.
march 1, 2018
happy 19th anniversary, superositites!  today's strip is #6,941... less than 60 strips to go until the big #7,000!  in your country, how do you celebrate 7,000 superosity comic strips?  let me know on twitter (@chriscrosby)!

trust everyone over 40!
september 15, 2017
we're impossibly wise. (billionaires:  click here.)

year eighteen ends, year nineteen begins.
march 1, 2017
happy 18th anniversary, superositites!  today's strip is #6,576.  have you accidentally discovered the password to our universe yet?  if so, e-mail me and let me know!  i could really use it.

i say it's my birthday yet again!
september 15, 2016
39 years and counting of yours truly!  because it's 2016, why don't you put some of your money into my bank account via the wonders of patreon?

year seventeen ends, year eighteen begins.
march 1, 2016
happy 17th anniversary, superositites!  today's strip is #6,211.  hey, have you heard about my patreon?  i hope not, because it's very embarrassing!  but if it helps me find that one generous multi-millionaire i just know is reading and mildly enjoying my work, it'll all be worth it.  fingers crossed!

i forgot to wish you a happy new year, so instead i will ask you for an obscene amount of money.
january 6, 2016
yes, because one person kinda suggested that i should do it, i made a patreon.  if you read superosity and are also super-rich, click here and prove me right once and for all. (you must be a fan if you're reading this, the section of the site that is updated like twice a year!)
