understand the regulations - appoint a  compliance officer
â  by  tom mccurnin, retired attorney


(this is a 2019 article by tom, but fits today’s laws and  politics. editor)
i  don’t want to dive into politics but since the election of donald trump, the  present administration has abandoned federal regulations for financial  institutions. at first blush, this sounded like a great idea but there were  unintended consequences. the abject failure of the consumer financial  protection bureau (cfpb) to regulate the explosion in finance companies has  caused two states (california and new york) to undertake their own regulation  of the financial services industry.
california has a comprehensive  licensing statute with interest rate disclosure, to be further developed this  year by the california department of business oversight. new jersey is to  follow. new york may have interest rate disclosure by 2020. 
the  california department of business oversight (dbo) has enacted licensing  requirements and interest rate disclosure.  it is aggressively policing  its requirements as a direct result of the federal government backing out of  the space. with licensing, there are a number of other regulations which  must be understood by licensees. 

âª appoint a compliance officer. most  financial institutions have appointed a person to be in charge of regulatory  compliance. it is this person’s job to make sure that the company complies with  all regulations. of course, this person should consult appropriate lawyers who  know regulations and should attend conferences on the subject. 
âª timely file annual reports in  california, these reports are due in march. if you’ve moved or not received  your reminder card, you still have to renew your license. there may be  significant fines for letting the license expire. 
âª deals done without a license will subject you to fines. if your  company has done california loans without a license or while the license was  expired, expect to be fined. the fine can be as large as $2,500 but is usually  significantly less. nevertheless doing a couple hundred deals will probably  warrant a five figure fine. 
âª understand the regulations. along  with your license, the dbo has enacted about 20 pages of regulations.   they are not difficult to read and understand. somebody at your company should  read them and report back to management. the current trip wires for the  dbo are paying commissions to unlicensed brokers or if you are a broker,  receiving commissions while not being licensed. 
âª understand the regulations of other states. most  good leasing attorneys can conduct a 50 state survey of licensing  requirements. some states have no lending license requirements, except for  small dollar, less than $10,000 commercial loans. other states have that  threshold at $5,000. your compliance officer should know all the requirements  for loans and leases made by your company in the states you operate.

the  u.s. dollar under every president since 1967
visual capitalist

these  high rates made holding u.s. dollars more attractive and america’s relative  economic strength played a role in driving investor sentiment.
at  the time, the sharp appreciation of the dollar contributed to a substantial  trade deficit as american goods became increasingly expensive while imports  were cheap. to curb the dollar’s rise, global leaders struck a deal in 1985  called the plaza accord, which contributed to its 40% decline over the next two  years.
by  contrast, the dollar hit all-time lows in 2008 during the global financial  crisis under george w. bush. at the end of 2008, the federal reserve cut  interest rates to near-zero amid deteriorating labor market conditions. amid  concerns of a slow economic recovery, investors looked to gold and other  higher-yielding currencies.

rates
  by  scott wheeler, clfp

top  originators in the commercial equipment finance and leasing industry embrace  rate questions because they fully understand that:

industry yields are  determined by the correlation between risk and reward. the market sets the rate  - not individual originators. the industry provides a broad range of yields  based upon the strengths of each opportunity.


if the originator's  offered yield is significantly above market, for the risk they are willing to  assume, then their business activity will quickly be reduced to near zero  activity.


    if the originator's  offered yield is significantly below market for the risk they are willing to  assume, then their business activity will quickly increase. however, profits  will be reduced and potential write-offs may increase over time.


there will always be  competitors with lower rates or lower credit requirements, but rarely do  competitors have both. if they do, it will usually be for a temporary period.  (the market does not allow absurdity.) the market works.


industry participants  have minimum yield requirements and maximum risk tolerance matrices which  originators must work within. not every opportunity will fit properly within  the specified box. the originator's responsibility is to fully understand their  tolerance box and to find, win, and fund transactions within those parameters.


rates are important.  however, cash flow considerations are also influential in an end-user's  decision-making process. structure can often be of greater cash-flow savings  than the rate. as market rates have increased from historical lows, structure  has re-emerged as a primary factor in winning or losing transactions. top  originators understand the market (and competition) and often suggest  structures which address cash-flow benefits.

ï»¿it  is the originator's responsibility to maximize returns by providing a superior,  value-added service. it is the originator's responsibility to provide the best  program that the client deserves based upon the strength of the transaction  (including the financial strength of the client, the collateral being acquired,  the term being requested, and the current market conditions).

judge  refuses to release kris roglieri on
bond  due to angry, vengeful threats
          by bob coleman, colemen reports

the  accused $100 million ponzi schemer was ruled a danger to himself and to the  community. 
on january 29, the  federal appeals court denied kris roglieri's appeal for bond and ruled he is to  be jailed until his trial on five counts of loan defaults.
the judge writes: "the  court has rarely seen such degrading, threatening, and worrisome communications  in the context of a financial fraud case. defendant did not mince words in his  text messages; he communicated precisely how he was feeling: angry and  vengeful. he stated he did not care about authority and discussed the use of  guns and physical violence against the specific individuals he was angry  toward."

the  former concealed gun carrying permit holder has been held in a county jail  since may of last year.        he  is also facing additional new york state weapons charges after the fbi seized  an ar-15 assault rifle with a high-capacity ammunition magazine.
the  specific loan fraud charges stem from a $5 million cash deposit that was  supposed to be used as prepaid interest for the construction of a $100 million  minnesota egg farm. prosecutors  have alleged kris diverted millions of customer deposits to support his  lifestyle:        
$11 million in luxury vehicles
          $4.4 million in luxury watches, jewelry and  antiques
          $835,000 in private jet travel
they  petitioned, “how can uncorroborated claims of unrecorded statements from an  antagonistic witness overcome mr. roglieri’s 44 years of consistent history of  non-violent behavior and having been professionally assessed by two  psychiatrists who found that he represents, at most, a minimum risk of violent  behavior?”
says  the judge, “the answer is simple: the court is taking defendant at his  word."
kris  roglieri's word includes threatening to kill an fbi agent. a  trial date has not.
