land acknowledgement
the land on which we gather is the unceded territory of the awaswas-speaking uypi tribe. the amah mutsun tribal band, comprised of the descendants of indigenous people taken to missions santa cruz and san juan bautista during spanish colonization of the central coast, is today working hard to restore traditional stewardship practices on these lands and heal from historical trauma.
the land acknowledgement used at uc santa cruz was developed in partnership with the amah mutsun tribal band chairman and the amah mutsun relearning program at the ucsc arboretum.
