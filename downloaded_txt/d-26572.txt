welcome to the borough of wanaque

welcome to the official website of the borough of wanaque, new jersey, a residential suburban community located in passaic county. made up of both wanaque (formerly midvale) and haskell. the word wanaque, in the language of the lenni lenape, may come from an algonquin root meaning “rest and repose.” a more popular interpretation is “place of sassafras.” wanaque was incorporated as an independent borough on february 23, 1918, when pompton township was split up into three boroughs, along with bloomingdale and ringwood, based on the results of a referendum held on march 22, 1918.
