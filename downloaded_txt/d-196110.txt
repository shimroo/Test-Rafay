“ foster’s market is popular not just as a place to buy beautifully prepared, delicious foodstuffs, but also as a relaxed carefree gathering place where a cup of latte and a huge piece of crumb cake or a giant sticky bun or a bowl of steaming soup can be savored quietly with a book or newspaper or with a group of friends.” martha stewart
