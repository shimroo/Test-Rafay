candy from france





i got a box today from my friend captain destructo. he lives in france. we are best friends but we can't play because we live far away from each other. he sent me candy.i like all of them. i also got a post card that shows things from where he lives in france. he lives in lyon and likes to go to puppet shows. i went to a puppet show last summer at the park with "punch and judy". it was really funny and it had an aligator in it. captain destructo likes aligators. thank-you captain destructo!!!!
