i'm elbert price, a 92 year old painter/sculptor.  making art gives me joy.  i've practiced my art all my life and feel most alive when sketching, painting, and sculpting.  my pieces are representational and totally comprehensible, and owned by people around the globe.
i'd love to see the remaining works from my long and prolific career go to collectors who will love them as i and others have. the paintings are oil on canvas and the sculptures are fired stoneware, some glazed.
