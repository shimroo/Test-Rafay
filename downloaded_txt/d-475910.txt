what's up


this is the home page of craig hayslip. i
made this website so i could show some of my photographs of nature and
the places i have traveled around the world. i appreciate your coming
here so i can share some of my experiences with you. i hope you enjoy
what you see.


please note that i have rescanned many of my older photos from trips to
africa and asia. i have a new scanner that does a much better job than
my old one so please take a look at the difference it makes. 
i have also added many more photos to the african galleries.


please excuse the lack of cohesion from page to page on this website. i
use it to explore different ways of exhibiting photos on the web so
there are many styles of galleries here.
