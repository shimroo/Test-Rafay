history




our services
all services are in english and sung a cappella.  the divine liturgy begins at 10:00 am on sundays and is approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes long. a luncheon pot-luck coffee hour immediately follows liturgy.  all families and guests are encouraged to enjoy a light meal and, more importantly, share in fellowship.
for first-time visitors to the orthodox church, a good service to attend is the saturday evening great vespers starting at 5:00 pm which is about 45 minutes long. at vespers, one will hear the beautiful melodies of the byzantine and russian traditions, prayers of petition, psalmody, and seasonal topics of celebration.
inquirer’s class is generally held every week at 3:30 pm before great vespers (check calendar for exceptions).  this informal q&a is a great opportunity to meet our priest, ask questions, and meet parishioners and other inquirers.
