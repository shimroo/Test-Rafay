meetings
the mas holds its meetings the first thursday of each
month at 7pm at the mobile public schools' environmental studies center
on girby road. these meetings normally include both a business meeting
and an informative presentation.  occasionally, we will observe
after a meeting, but we reserve most of that for the mosps. see the
scroll at the top of the page for the date of the next meeting.

members only star parties (mosps) 
once a
month we come together for a group observing session. these monthly
dark-of-the-moon "mosps" have in the past been held on the secure and
comfortable grounds of the esc. recently, however, we've been using a
dark site in the tanner-williams area for our deep sky observing (the
esc is situated in the midst of heavy light-pollution). 
if
you're a  paid member of the mas, you are welcome to attend
mosps. for details, please email rod at the address above.
are you a new member who wants to stay informed about
mas doings? if so, email rod at the address above to be put on the mas
mail-alert list!
