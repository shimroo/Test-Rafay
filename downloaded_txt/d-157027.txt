  walking through the exhibits gave me a very good-quiet and vintage-giving vibe, with all the photos of the past, bits & pieces of architecture and technology, old-fashion clothing, and a couple of vehicles left and right; despite the renovations that were there at the time of my visit, i certainly recommend giving this place a checkout!
