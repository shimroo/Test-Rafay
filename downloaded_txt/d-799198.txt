black history and voices for adults
















king: a life


winner of the 2024 pulitzer prize for biographya finalist for the 2023 national book critics circle award | named one of the ten best books of 2023 by the washington post, chicago tribune, and timea new york times bestseller and notable book of 2023 | one of barack obama’s favorite books of 2023one of the new yorker’s essential reads of 2023 | a christian science monitor best book of the year | one of air mail’s twelve best books of 2023a washington post and national indie bestseller | one of publishers weekly’s best nonfiction books of 2023 | one of smithsonian magazine’s ten best books of 2023“supple, penetrating, heartstring-pulling and compulsively readable . . . eig’s book is worthy of its subject.” —dwight garner, the new york times (editors’ choice)“[king is] infused with the narrative energy of a thriller . . . the most compelling account of king’s life in a generation.” —mark whitaker, the washington post“no book could be more timely than jonathan eig’s sweeping and majestic new king . . . eig has created 2023′s most vital tome.” —will bunch, the philadelphia inquirerhailed by the new york times as “the new definitive biography,” king mixes revelatory new research with accessible storytelling to offer an mlk for our times.vividly written and exhaustively researched, jonathan eig’s king: a life is the first major biography in decades of the civil rights icon martin luther king jr.—and the first to include recently declassified fbi files. in this revelatory new portrait of the preacher and activist who shook the world, the bestselling biographer gives us an intimate view of the courageous and often emotionally troubled human being who demanded peaceful protest for his movement but was rarely at peace with himself. he casts fresh light on the king family’s origins as well as mlk’s complex relationships with his wife, father, and fellow activists. king reveals a minister wrestling with his own human frailties and dark moods, a citizen hunted by his own government, and a man determined to fight for justice even if it proved to be a fight to the death. as he follows mlk from the classroom to the pulpit to the streets of birmingham, selma, and memphis, eig dramatically re-creates the journey of a man who recast american race relations and became our only modern-day founding father—as well as the nation’s most mourned martyr.in this landmark biography, eig gives us an mlk for our times: a deep thinker, a brilliant strategist, and a committed radical who led one of history’s greatest movements, and whose demands for racial and economic justice remain as urgent today as they were in his lifetime.includes 8 pages of black-and-white photographs











a passionate mind in relentless pursuit


an intimate and searching account of the life and legacy of one of america’s towering educators, a woman who dared to center the progress of black women and girls in the larger struggle for political and social liberationwhen mary mcleod bethune died, tributes in newspapers around the country said the same thing: she should be on the mount rushmore of black american achievement. indeed, bethune is the only black american whose statue stands in statuary hall in the us capitol, and yet for most, she remains a marble figure from the dim past. now, seventy years later, noliwe rooks turns bethune from stone to flesh, showing her to have been a visionary leader with lessons to still teach us as we continue on our journey toward a freer and more just nation.any serious effort to understand how the black civil rights generation found role models, vision, and inspiration during their midcentury struggle for political power must place bethune at its heart. her success was unlikely: the fifteenth of seventeen children and the first born into freedom, bethune survived brutal poverty and caste subordination to become the first in her family to learn how to read and to attend college. she gave that same gift to others when in 1904, at age twenty-nine, bethune welcomed her first class of five girls to the daytona, florida, school she had founded and which would become the university that bears her name to this day. bethune saw education as an essential dimension of the larger struggle for freedom, vitally connected to the vote and to economic self-sufficiency, and she enlisted eleanor roosevelt, harry truman, franklin d. roosevelt, and many other powerful leaders in her cause.rooks grew up in florida, in bethune’s shadow: her grandmother trained to be a teacher at bethune-cookman university, and her family vacationed at the all-black beach that bethune helped found in one of her many community empowerment projects. the story of how bethune succeeded in a state with some of the highest lynching rates in the country is, in rooks’s hands, a moving and astonishing example of the power of a mind and a vision that had few equals. now, when the stakes of the long struggle for full black equality in this country are particularly evident—and centered on the state of florida—it is a gift to have this brilliant and lyrical reckoning with bethune’s journey from one of our own great educators and scholars of that same struggle.











gather me


a “dramatic [and] ingeniously crafted” (los angeles times) memoir of family, community, and resilience, and an ode to the power of books to help us understand ourselves, from the renowned founder of well-read black girl.“a beautiful portrait of a full life that has been buoyed by an expansive and ever-growing love for words and for language.”—hanif abdurraqib, author of there’s always this yearan npr best book of the year“she is a friend of my mind. she gather me, man. the pieces i am, she gather them and give them back to me in all the right order.”—toni morrison, beloved for glory edim, that “friend of my mind” is books. edim, who grew up in virginia to nigerian immigrant parents, started the popular well-read black girl book club at age thirty, eventually reaching a community of half a million readers. but her own love of books stretches far back. edim’s father moved back to nigeria while she was still a child, marking the beginning of a series of traumatic changes and losses for her family. what became an escape, a safe space, and a second home for her and her brother was their local library. books were where edim found community, and as she grew older she discovered authors and ideas that she wasn’t being taught about in class. reading wherever and whenever she could, be it in her dorm room or when traveling by subway or plane, she found the black writers whose words would forever change her life: nikki giovanni, through children’s poetry cassettes; maya angelou, through a critical high school english teacher; toni morrison, while attending morrison’s alma mater, howard university; audre lorde, on a flight to nigeria. in prose full of both joy and heartbreak, edim recounts how these writers and so many others taught her how to value herself by helping her to find her own voice when her mother lost hers, to trust her feelings when her father remarried, and to create bonds with other black women and uplift their stories. gather me is a glowing testament to how the power of representation in literature can gather the disparate parts that make us who we are and assemble them into a portrait of discovery.

becoming ella fitzgerald


ella fitzgerald (1917-1996) possessed one of the twentieth century's most astonishing voices. in this first major biography since fitzgerald's death, historian judith tick offers a sublime portrait of this ambitious risk-taker whose exceptional musical spontaneity made her a transformational artist.becoming ella fitzgerald clears up long-enduring mysteries. archival research and in-depth family interviews shed new light on the singer's difficult childhood in yonkers, new york, the tragic death of her mother, and the year she spent in a girls' reformatory school--where she sang in its renowned choir and dreamed of being a dancer. rarely seen profiles from the black press offer precious glimpses of fitzgerald's tense experiences of racial discrimination and her struggles with constricting models of black and white femininity at midcentury.tick's compelling narrative depicts fitzgerald's complicated career in fresh and original detail, upending the traditional view that segregates vocal jazz from the genre's mainstream. as she navigated the shifting tides between jazz and pop, she used her originality to pioneer modernist vocal jazz. interpreting long-lost setlists, reviews from both white and black newspapers, and newly released footage and recordings, the book explores how ella's transcendence as an improvisor produced onstage performances every bit as significant as her historic recorded oeuvre.from the singer's first performance at the apollo theatre's famous "amateur night" to the savoy ballroom, where fitzgerald broke through with chick webb's big band in the 1930s, tick evokes the jazz world in riveting detail. she describes how ella helped shape the bebop movement in the 1940s, as she joined dizzy gillespie and her then-husband, ray brown, in the world-touring jazz at the philharmonic, one of the first moments of high-culture acceptance for the disreputable art form.breaking ground as a female bandleader, fitzgerald refuted expectations of musical blackness, deftly balancing artistic ambition and market expectations. her legendary exploration of the great american songbook in the 1950s fused a black vocal aesthetic and jazz improvisation to revolutionize the popular repertoire. this hybridity often confounded critics, yet throughout the 1970s and 1980s, ella reached audiences around the world, electrifying concert halls, and sold millions of records.a masterful biography, becoming ella fitzgerald describes a powerful woman who set a standard for american excellence nearly unmatched in the twentieth century.

overground railroad


this historical exploration of the green book offers “a fascinating [and] sweeping story of black travel within jim crow america across four decades” (the new york times book review).

published from 1936 to 1966, the green book was hailed as the “black travel guide to america.” at that time, it was very dangerous and difficult for african-americans to travel because they couldn’t eat, sleep, or buy gas at most white-owned businesses. the green book listed hotels, restaurants, gas stations, and other businesses that were safe for black travelers. it was a resourceful and innovative solution to a horrific problem.

it took courage to be listed in the green book, and overground railroad celebrates the stories of those who put their names in the book and stood up against segregation. author candacy a. taylor shows the history of the green book, how we arrived at our present historical moment, and how far we still have to go when it comes to race relations in america.

revolution in our time: the black panther party’s promise to the people


a national book award finalist
a coretta scott king author award honor book
a michael l. printz honor book
a walter dean myers honor book 


with passion and precision, kekla magoon relays an essential account of the black panthers—as militant revolutionaries and as human rights advocates working to defend and protect their community.

in this comprehensive, inspiring, and all-too-relevant history of the black panther party, kekla magoon introduces readers to the panthers’ community activism, grounded in the concept of self-defense, which taught black americans how to protect and support themselves in a country that treated them like second-class citizens. for too long the panthers’ story has been a footnote to the civil rights movement rather than what it was: a revolutionary socialist movement that drew thousands of members—mostly women—and became the target of one of the most sustained repression efforts ever made by the u.s. government against its own citizens.

revolution in our time puts the panthers in the proper context of black american history, from the first arrival of enslaved people to the black lives matter movement of today. kekla magoon’s eye-opening work invites a new generation of readers grappling with injustices in the united states to learn from the panthers’ history and courage, inspiring them to take their own place in the ongoing fight for justice.











black birds in the sky


a searing new work of nonfiction from award-winning author brandy colbert about the history and legacy of one of the most deadly and destructive acts of racial violence in american history: the tulsa race massacre. winner, boston globe-horn book award.
in the early morning of june 1, 1921, a white mob marched across the train tracks in tulsa, oklahoma, and into its predominantly black greenwood district—a thriving, affluent neighborhood known as america's black wall street. they brought with them firearms, gasoline, and explosives.
in a few short hours, they'd razed thirty-five square blocks to the ground, leaving hundreds dead. the tulsa race massacre is one of the most devastating acts of racial violence in us history. but how did it come to pass? what exactly happened? and why are the events unknown to so many of us today?
these are the questions that award-winning author brandy colbert seeks to answer in this unflinching nonfiction account of the tulsa race massacre. in examining the tension that was brought to a boil by many factors—white resentment of black economic and political advancement, the resurgence of white supremacist groups, the tone and perspective of the media, and more—a portrait is drawn of an event singular in its devastation, but not in its kind. it is part of a legacy of white violence that can be traced from our country's earliest days through reconstruction, the civil rights movement in the mid–twentieth century, and the fight for justice and accountability black americans still face today.
the tulsa race massacre has long failed to fit into the story americans like to tell themselves about the history of their country. this book, ambitious and intimate in turn, explores the ways in which the story of the tulsa race massacre is the story of america—and by showing us who we are, points to a way forward.
