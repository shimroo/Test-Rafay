customer feedback 










						‚Äúour oroboros is first edition and we are very fond of it. it has worked beautifully all these years and we would like it to stay that way.‚Äù‚Äã					


maria stollcase western reserve university school of medicine, cleveland, usa 






						‚Äúand now we are so excited to begin using this module [o2k-fluo smart-module] in my lab!
 
i would like to thank you and the rest of the team at oroboros once again for your excellent service and getting this module for the o2k sent with such a fast turnaround. i appreciate it so much. "					


nathan n alderuniversity of connecticut, usa 






						‚Äúthis workshop is great for people who want to get started with o2k as well as for people like me who are already using o2k but are not sure if they are doing everything right. i left the workshop feeling much more confident about using o2k and analyzing data from o2k. 

for me, the balance between theory and practice was just right, the location of the workshop was amazing and the team was awesome. erich, eleonora, sabine and alba, thank you so much, not only for the presentations and demonstrations, but also for being so friendly, approachable and patient with us. 

i highly recommend this workshop to anyone looking to improve their understanding and use of o2k.

						the video support describing the technical aspects of operating and servicing the o2ks are a fantastic resource for users.  i have also used the troubleshooting flowchart to diagnose and self-service routine issues.  the active user forums and o2k-network serve as a rich source of protocols, shared knowledge, and information on all topics related to bioenergetics and mitochondria.

						‚Äúthe teachers handling the virtual on-site visit were really good. tips regarding reagents and know-how on situations one can face while carrying out mitochondrial experiments were really useful‚Äù

						our o2ks rosie and rupert returned to service today. the best kind of equipment is the reliable, robust, low maintenance kind.					


terri pietkawashington university st. louis, usa 






						it has been a pleasure to work with your oxygraph-devices during the last 13 years. extremely robust machines.					


ib therkelsen arentuniversity of copenhagen, denmark 






						i would like to thank you for your fast reply and your clear explanations. we followed your advices; improving the way we were collecting the fibers and oxygenating the medium definitely solved our problems! thank you for your excellent support!!

						"the workshop was incredible. it was a good mix of presentation and hands-on experience. meeting the oroboros team was fantastic. they were helpful and open to all of our questions. it was also great meeting the other participants. all-in-all a 5 out of 5 experience in a beautiful setting!" - in reference to the o2k-workshop in schroecken, at
