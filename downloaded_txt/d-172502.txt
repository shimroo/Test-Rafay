storytelling is natural for humans! don’t let yourself be discouraged about telling stories—especially by simple misconceptions!













the six most common misconceptions about storytelling! and how can i help you overcome them?far and away, the most common problem for storytellers is that they think of stories as fixed objects! this misconception leads you to think of stories as a series of “parts,” rather than what they are: vehicles for dynamic interactions between minds!the falsehood: too often, we think of stories are “objects” made of parts (like a pencil made of a piece of lead, a wooden or metal barrel, and an eraser). the truth: stories are vehicles for dynamic interactions between minds.everything i have taught, written, or practiced about storytelling (in my decades as an award-winning professional teller, teacher, and coach) is based on my understanding of the interactive nature of storytelling. in a live performance, of course, the interaction goes both ways in real time. but written stories are also interactive, in the sense that each reader’s response to one part of the story influences that reader’s responses to the rest of the story.every live, oral performance of a story, of course, takes place at a unique time, with a particular group of listeners and their unique set of expectations. yet even written stories, with their unchanging words, must engage each reader’s dynamic, individual imagination.my role as teacher and coach, then, is not to tell you the “one right way to tell,” but to assist you to understand and become fluent in the fascinating dynamics of transformative storytelling!the key concept behind storytelling mastery: stories are not best seen as “objects” to  be observed, but rather as vehicles for mutual interaction via the imagination. but why aren’t we all great storytellers?given that storytelling is natural to us as humans, why do so many of us struggle to develop it fully?sadly, our society and its institutions usually conspire (unintentionally but all too powerfully) to erect roadblocks between most of us and the full possession of our storytelling powers.in some ways, it seems that storytelling—a shining jewel in the crown of humanity—is, at best, left to tarnish—and, at worst turned into an object to be studied (rather than processes to be learned and engaged in). there are likely many causes for this, but chief among them, i believe, is a series of fallacies that are consistently reinforced—and rarely challenged.below is my list of the six most common and pernicious fallacies that prevent so many of us from fully developing the storytelling abilities that are the birthright of every human.these fallacies seem to be omnipresent (except in some traditional cultural enclaves and in the teaching of enlightened storytellers).fortunately, each fallacy can be avoided—but only if you are fortunate enough—and determined enough—to  learn and follow through with three commitments :to recognize the fallacies you’ve absorbed from contemporary society; to find your way to the unheralded but ultimately natural and energizing principles of storytelling; andto commit to reconnecting with (and working to develop) your built-in capacity to learn the skills of highly effective storytelling.all that is required is to learn to recognize the roadblocks—and then to find competent help in a) avoiding them and b) finding your way past them to the highly effective storytelling skills that are, after all, the birthright of every human!six common fallacies to avoid…much of what is parroted around the web (and in  too many  books, articles, videos, and courses about storytelling) is based on reasonable-sounding but limiting ideas, such as these six common fallacies, whether explicit or assumed:fallacy #1: “stories are made of words”better idea: stories are made of images! stories start with powerful images in the teller’s mind, and, when successfully transmitted through language (oral or written), they stimulate listeners and readers to create their own unique images in their own minds! fallacy #2: “a story is an object with a set form”better idea: stories are relational interactions between the imagination of the teller and the imaginations of the listeners or readers!in the case of written stories, of course, the printed form is fixed, but what the story evokes in each listener is dynamic!you may wish you could force listeners to imagine exactly what you imagine. unfortunately, that reduces their commitment!  why is that? because the ideas that stick best in a listener’s mind are not parroted, but discovered!fallacy #3: “there is a right way to create or learn stories”better idea: each teller’s process will be unique, but the most effective processes all include, at some point, the basic elements of:• imagining your story,  • trying it out on others, and   • progressively fine-tuning it, in response to your listeners’ (or readers’) responses!fallacy #4: “the job of the teller is to present the story exactly.”better idea: the job of the teller is to stimulate listeners or readers to imagine and interpret the story, each in their own unique way! when this happens, the listener feels ownership of what they’ve imagined or realized! you’ve not induced them to borrow your images and understandings, but have helped them make their own!fallacy #5: “stories are best created by starting with plot structure.” better idea: because stories are organic, the plot grows from the story—not the other way around! that said, of course, there are cultural expectations for plot structure. (these expectations are not innate or universal. in fact, they evolve endlessly in any given culture, over time.)the best tellers and writers, then, respond to those expectations with a mixture of both meeting and defying such expectations! meeting the expectations helps people enter into and feel satisfied with your story; defying those expectations can, in appropriate doses, intensify their interest even more!fallacy #6: “stories are things you assemble”better idea: stories are things you grow! they are dynamic, living things, more like plants than craft projects!in fact, like the plants you eat, stories grow dynamically and then are absorbed dynamically by those who hear or read them!given the extraordinary heritage of stories present in every human culture, you can’t really make stories completely from scratch—but you can live with them, share them, and enjoy them, not as piles of sticks you gather together, but as living things you help to come alive and eventually mature!—————————————————————-how can i help you?avoiding all six of these “fallacy traps” is essential to your storytelling development.but, of course, you must not only stay off the many popular but ultimately unhelpful paths: you must also find your way to storytelling roadways that are consistent with your own nature and preferences!the principles described on this page can be applied to storytelling education of all kinds, offered by me or by others offering thoughtful help with your storytelling development.here’s what i offeras a means to the goal of fully claiming and developing your storytelling potential, then, i offer my approach, as exemplified in my numerous: articles, books, recordings, coaching options, and courses.i have long offered a free storytelling email newsletter, “etips from the storytelling coach.” in fact, as i write this 2023, i have sent out well over 200 roughly-monthly issues of it!want to subscribe? i send an article about once a month, along with intermittent ads for courses and the like: http://storydynamics.com/sign-upto learn what is currently available for purchase, please visit my products pag…..e:want something more specialized? i am available to come to you, via zoom, etc., or even in person.if you are interested in a particular aspect or application of storytelling, please contact meincisive, often unorthodox information about stories and their uses, in four areas:learn storytellinginstructional materials about storytelling, in many formats;workshops - in person, via telephone, and via correspondence - to register for.individual coaching - in person, via phone, skype or gotomeetingmarketing and storytellinginstructional materials about using storytelling to spread the word about you, your organization, or your products;instruction materials to help you use storytelling as part of marketing. storytelling recordingsstories for adults, older children, and also for young children;stories to enjoy and to use in your work—in written and recorded forms.subscriptionsthings you can pay for over time:products that can come monthlyweb hosting and domain name registrationsongoing servicesyours,doug lipman————————————read now:the six most common misconceptions about storytelling! and how can i help you overcome them?
