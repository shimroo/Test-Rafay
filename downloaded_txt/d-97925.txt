signs and symptoms that your indoor living space contains mold 
posted on april 27, 2018march 19, 2019 by givercare 


 
everyone has a general idea of what mold is and the basic health risks it poses.  mold is a fungus that sprouts from particles floating in the air; when those particles land in dark, damp locations mold grows.  mold can cause a whole host of health problems, ranging from cold symptoms to permanent health damage. what makes mold dangerous is that it cannot always be seen, and it is not always easy to find.  because of the risk it is important to always be on the lookout for signs and symptoms of mold grown in your home.
 
just because you cannot see mold does not mean that it is not there.  mold will sometimes give off a musty odor. if you are able to smell mold, it is very likely that mold is under or in something in your home.  smelling a musty odor is usually the first sign that there is mold in the home. many people mentally ignore this smell, especially in basements, as just part of an old home, especially in coastal communities such as long island.  don’t do this! if you are noticing a musty smell, have your home inspected by a long island exterminator  to remedy the problem before more damage is done to both your home and your health.
 
when mold is present in a home, many inhabitants begin to suffer allergy or cold-like symptoms.  if you feel better when you are away from home than you do when in your home, those symptoms may be caused by mold growth.  even mold hidden in walls or under the carpet may trigger sneezes and scratchy throats, as mold is a powerful allergen and does not take much to make someone feel under the weather.  if your symptoms, such as runny nose, inflamed eyes, chest congestion and sneezing, worsen at home, have your home inspected for mold by bulovas mold removal long isand.
 
because mold thrives in damp areas, signs of condensation may be warning signs of mold growth.  condensation signals that your home had a great deal of moisture and odds are mold will grow if it has not begun to do so already.  it is important to have a professional mold removal company check your home for mold if you notice damp areas. in addition, it is important to deduce the source of the moisture and remedy it if it is an ongoing problem.  condensation and damp areas can be produced from environmental events, such as rain, floods or snow, as well as internal problems, such as water leaks.
 
lastly, sometimes you do in fact see the mold, which often appears as a dark greenish area or slimy texture.  however, if the mold spores are not large, they may appear to be regular dirt. if you see either large obvious mold spores or smaller ones that you learn to be something other than dirt, you should take immediate action to remedy the mold problem.
 
mold can cause havoc to both your pocket and your health.  if you fear your home may be growing mold, contact a long island mold removal company immediately.
