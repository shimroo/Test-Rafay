clayton concrete

since its inception in 1951, we have grown to become the largest ready-mix concrete supplier in new jersey.  ten ready-mix plants service the areas of operation.  within 5 years, three new state-of-the-art concrete production facilities will have either replaced existing locations or opened in areas never before served by ralph clayton & sons.

these investments demonstrate the company's dedication to its customers through increased service capabilities, to its employees with emphasis on quality and safety, and to the environment through energy-efficient manufacturing and production facilities.

ralph clayton & sons offers the full range of ready-mix products including high strength concrete, flowable fill, permeable and high performance mixes.  with a staff of aci-certified technicians and highly-trained quality control personnel, all mixes are reviewed for accuracy and delivered in accordance with project specifications.
