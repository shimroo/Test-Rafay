a final flight

august 9, 2014 jim diamond 11 comments



it is with great sadness that we announce that jim diamond, the b-47 association’s longtime webmaster passed away on 3 july 2014 after a short battle with cancer. jim, a retired master sergeant served his country and from the very early days of the b-47 association served on its board of directors. he also served as the president of the 40th until his untimely death. in honor of his service the b-47 association board of directors has made a contribution to the strategic air and space museum toward the refurbishment of their b-47 and a brick reading “msgt jim diamond, 40bw c/chief, b-47 assoc board” will be placed in the memorial plaza at the museum.
