the dive package and dive centre being onsite made it super convenient and was a great experience.the option to go on excursions was a great way to see more of bali and experience once-in-a-lifetime sights- manta point was truly incredible.

it was perfect beacuse everything was aligned and organised like clockwork. the highlight for me was seeing the wrecks and having short swim-throughs. it was all new to me, so i was very pleased to safely experience this.

i enjoyed fulfilling a lifelong dream to go to the galapagos. the diving was so wild! i saw baby hammerhead sharks, penguins, mola mola, a port jackson shark, sea lions, blue-footed boobies, marine iguanas and a pod of sperm whales.
