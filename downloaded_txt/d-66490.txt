our story

 









 

1948-1968upon his discharge from the army in 1948, harry d’ercole sr. worked in the family grocery store in blue island, where he met his wife, shirley. together, they had two boys, harry jr. and robert (bob). harry sr., in partnership with his brother don, opened his first restaurant, the d’ercole riviera supper club, in midlothian in 1957 where he served as the owner/chef and welcomed politicians, entertainers and other chicago-area notables on a regular basis.



1969-1973: the beginningin 1969, harry sr. & shirley saw a new business opportunity in frankfort, illinois and purchased the iconic “o’aces” truckstop. in 1971, they purchased two more buildings along route 30, a warehouse and a small ice cream shop, and relocated them to the corner of lagrange road and lincoln highway.harry sr. had always loved hot dogs and dreamed of opening a stand, so *dirk’s dog house opened in the old ice cream shop and quickly became known for “the best hot dogs in town, bar none.”*“dirk”, short for d’ercole, was the nickname given to harry sr. by meat purveyors at fulton market.

































late 1973-early 1974: a new dreamby mid-1973, harry and shirley sold the “o-aces” truckstop to focus on running the hot dog stand. their son, harry jr., was attending college but expressed interest in the pizza business. harry sr., who had always wanted to open a pizza place, agreed. the d’ercole family started selling pizzas from the storage garage out back. in april 1974, enrico’s carry out opened its doors, offering pizza, italian beef sandwiches, and torpedo sandwiches. 

































1976-1977: expanding the businessby 1976, the restaurant was thriving, especially with its popular italian beef sandwiches. in january 1977, to accommodate the growing business, the family moved to frankfort and built a full-service, sit-down restaurant in the style of a train depot. the new space was designed around the original carry-out, adding a boxcar and caboose for a unique outdoor beer garden. in july 1977, the new enrico's opened with a cozy 80-seat dining room. harry sr. and shirley's younger son, bob, also joined the family business, becoming the butcher for enrico’s and eventually running his own wholesale meat business.











































1979: more growthas business continued to grow, the family added a 20x20 link building to connect the restaurant to the train and provide more seating. they also enclosed the front porch to create a waiting area and expanded the train's interior for diners. this addition increased the seating capacity to 140. the improvements continued in the 1980s as enrico’s evolved into a well-loved neighborhood restaurant.













1981: the bar lounge expansionin 1981, the family planned another expansion to add a sit-down bar and more seating. the bar lounge, with its rustic wood theme, opened later that year and was well-received by guests. with this addition, enrico's seating capacity increased to over 200. from this point until the late 90s, there were few changes to the restaurant’s footprint, though a major remodel updated the main dining room with a warmer, more inviting atmosphere.

2002: the train movesin 2002, development in frankfort led to the construction of a walgreens pharmacy, forcing the relocation of the beloved train. enrico’s sold the train to aladdin landscaping for $10, and the train was moved to their location in frankfort, where it was refurbished. despite losing the train, enrico’s continued to enjoy a strong relationship with the local community, catering numerous events and maintaining a loyal following.



2012: closing the original location & reopening in dad’s honorin 2012, the family sold part of its land to make way for a new mariano’s grocery store, which led to the closure of the original enrico’s location in august of that year. harry jr. began searching for a new location that would serve the frankfort community. after exploring several options, the family signed a lease in the vineyards of frankfort in september 2015. after extensive renovations, the new location opened on may 11, 2016, what would have been harry sr.'s 88th birthday. sadly, harry sr. had passed away in july 2015, and the family chose to honor him by holding off the grand opening until his birthday.













2021: celebrating milestonesin 2021, enrico’s launched its first annual spaghetti eating contest, adding a fun new tradition to its legacy. this event, along with ongoing community support, demonstrated the restaurant’s continued commitment to offering great food, excellent service, and a welcoming atmosphere. 











































2024: 50 years of enrico’sas of 2024, enrico’s has celebrated 50 years of serving the frankfort community. the restaurant has become an integral part of many families' lives, providing not just great meals, but cherished memories. harry jr. reflects with gratitude on the many stories shared by guests, from their favorite dish to fond memories of dining in the train. as enrico’s looks back on five decades of success, the family is proud of their accomplishments and grateful for the support of the community. special mention is made of key team members, such as chef frank, who retired after 38 years, and longtime employees like sue wallace and delliah kuse, who have been with the family for over 50 years. their dedication has played a crucial role in enrico’s success.













2025 and beyondlooking to the future, enrico’s is preparing for its next chapter. the restaurant industry is ever-changing, but one thing will remain constant: enrico’s commitment to providing delicious food and excellent service. the family is excited for what lies ahead and remains deeply appreciative of its loyal patrons. as they move forward, they’re reminded of their core mission—great food, superior service, and a warm, family-friendly atmosphere.as harry jr. says, "in this business, change is necessary, but the food will always be the heart of what we do."
