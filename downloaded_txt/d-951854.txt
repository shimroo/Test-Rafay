the
              stardust drive-in theatre offers our patrons a new
              option in affordable family entertainment. 
              come out and enjoy an evening of double feature first-run
              movies under the star filled skies of middle tennessee  all for
              less than the price of a single ticket to the indoor cinemas.
originally
              constructed in 2003, the stardust has become middle tennessee's "family
              fun place - under the stars".   as middle
              tennessee's first drive-in theatre to feature barco digital
              projection technology, the facility combines all of the
              "nostalgic" era of entertainment from the past combined
              with the latest technology of sound and projection.  gone are
              the days of speakers hung on your window, as all of the movie
              sound at the stardust  is
              "broadcast" via crystal clear fm stereo directly to your
              car stereo or favorite portable radio. 
              located
              in the heart of historic watertown
              tennessee, the stardust
              drive-in theatre is a short 20-30 minute drive from the
              cities of nashville, mt. juliet, murfreesboro, lebanon,
              alexandria, gordonsville, liberty & smithville.
