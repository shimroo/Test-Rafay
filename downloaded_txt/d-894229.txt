have
                you ever been fired or dismissed from a job? in january of 2000
                it happened to me and i had the opportunity to put into practice
                what i had been telling my clients for the previous 15 years.

                i had come back to work after the christmas break and was
                informed i no longer had a job. it felt like my world was
                falling apart. have you been there?

                this event set me on a new path. a path to be the one that
                controlled my destiny. a path where i could help others learn
                what i had learned. a path to becoming a career coach to help
                others deal with managing their careers.

                i know you have plenty of potential, so let me help you achieve
                all of your goals.
