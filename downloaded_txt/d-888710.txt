we had a great day on the weber with angelo! 5 fish including 2 on a dry fly that angelo matched perfectly to an intermittent caddis hatch. my son and i also enjoyed learning about the ecology of the river, which angelo was an expert on.

i went with jeremy to fish on the weber river and had a great time.  i always look forward to guided trips to learn more from the guides.  jeremy was better that most i have fished with around the country.  i will definetly book another trip with park city outfitters when i come back to the area.
