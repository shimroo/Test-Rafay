the residents official site











		i keep having these dreams.
	running dreams, climbing dreams.
	and they're after me.
	i run and i climb through a hole in the top of a closet
	and hide under a pile of dirty clothes.
	and they find me and just stand there.
	they don't say anything.

	i wonder what it's like to be them.	

		i wanted to be a butcher, a jolly butcher
	why doesn't everybody wanna be a butcher?	

		don't you see there is no 'she' now?
	don't you see there is no 'she' now?
	don't you see there is no 'she' now?	

		we are simple
	you are simple
	life is simple, too	

		we were just the nameless
	souls that sit inside	

		is obscurity itself the test tube of tomorrow,
	or is just the testing done to pave the way for sorrow?	

		do you ever
	do you ever
	wonder who you are?	

		i told myself there must be some way i can make them just be who i want to be with all the time,
	'cause it kept me at a distance, but my senses kept insisting it was much more interesting inside.
