                                        it was for my mother in law's birthday (same day as valentine's day) and she loved it. thank you ford flowers. the only reason this is not a five star review is in the picture there are six roses she only received five :(

                                        the flowers were great.  i accidently ordered from another local company last year and there was no comparison.  would have been 5 stars if the price was a bit lower.
