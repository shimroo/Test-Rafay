   february 13, 2025




we are very proud to announce our very first live album 
live in sacramento was recorded ( surprise...) live in sacramento on our tour we had october '24
we would like to dedicate this album to the international surfmusic scene : the album artwork was done by joris from stories from shamehill (nl), the frontcover was taken by kyle from the verbtones in portland oregon. the back cover by tedd on the show in sacramento (10-10-24).
the show in particular was made possible thanks to our friends from the bloatfloaters and dangerforce 5 (who made fantastic footage btw)
live in sacramento is brought out on a very limited edition of 200 numbered vinyls.
you can buy it via our band camp or on our upcoming shows (vinyl only, no cd's or streaming)
https://santannabaycoconuts.bandcamp.com/album/live-in-sacramento
we would especially like to thank everyone who came out to our shows, and still do
big thanks for those that tune in and listen to our music, and all those that support us along the way ! you all are amazing !
we love you
big hugs
sant anna bay coconuts

a touch of terror - the sea-jays


   submitted by corkyjames
 on
   february 13, 2025




an ep release from the sea-jays delivers a soiree of surf rock color and approach with such addictive and warm textures that somehow can give off moods and as the record unfolds you start to become more and more attached to the overall atmosphere that the record puts out there because it's addicting and feels amazing to listen to honestly.
the a touch of terror ep has some incredible performances by all parts. the surf rock element is so strong here but it also brings in those classic jazz and rock elements in the mix while remaining cinematic as well.
just as you might expect, the guitar work is astounding throughout this whole record. there are tons of great performances but there are also a slew of musical hooks that stick around in your brain for hours or even days after the songs have ended, and the only way to really satiate that is to go back and listen to this record all over again.
this is indeed the kind of ep that you listen to from beginning to end. the songs have ways of telling stories or interconnecting with each other and it feels like it's a concept album.
i love this aspect about it because you can kind of feel the vibes each song gives off and if you listen to the whole thing. this record pulls you away from wherever you are and whatever you're doing and it puts you in this other kind of mysterious and colorful world for a little bit.
there is that noir film aspect going on throughout this record. that whole aesthetic kind of floats around to the atmosphere and ethers of the songs.
now, the performances from all aspects of this record were incredible. you can tell that these guys have a real love for their craft and that love is for writing songs together and putting them out into the world. all the drum performances and percussion are amazing. they really added the drive but also had a lot to do with the aesthetic and the feel of these tracks and how they came across. whether they were going to be a little bit more intense or laid back.
this record seems to actually have two drummers, (dave klein & matt laug) involved along with the bassist (sam bolle) and guitarist (corky james) who all come together to put something special out.
of course, tons of great effects add to the surfness of this record. a lot of the guitars have that classic tremolo or reverb that has more of a twang and builds on that vibe even more but again, all elements of this come together perfectly.
there's something about this record that almost feels like it was recorded live on the floor to an extent. it feels almost like everyone involved was feeding off of each other's energies the whole time giving this record a kind of live performance vibe.
it was a gorgeous record that had so many layers of textures that came with it and it does indeed put out this aesthetic that you end up getting engulfed in. it feels great to get engulfed in it though.
not only would i suggest listening to this album in full, but also doing it with headphones on because it's one of the best ways to soak it all in.
again, some great layers and textures going on and it's quite an experience to listen to the whole thing with headphones on so you can catch all of that the way it was meant to be caught.
take a deep dive into this record as soon as you can and remember where you heard it first. - buzz slayers

capital city surf clash 2 date and lineup!


   submitted by onedingiraldo
 on
   february 04, 2025




proud to announce this year's lineup for the capital city surf clash!
we were wondering how are we going to equal last years event, but i think we did it. no beating around the bush, this years event we are bringing you:
slacktone
the pyronauts
the me gustas
surf monster
a four band bill that will satiate even the most reverb hungry fan of the surf/instrumental genre. what can we say about slacktone that hasn't been said before. formed in 1995, this band houses three individuals that should not be in the same band. that is too much talent for one group! ha. members, dave wronski, dusty watson and sam bolle bring you what is arguably the modern surf band. energetic, tight tunes that'll have your ear holes ringing with delight.
hailing from nor cal and joining us for this years edition, the pyronauts. this was the band that made us realize, hey, we can be ourselves and play surf/instrumental tunes?! you never know what you are going to get with these guys. stage outfits and antics is par for the course, but it is the incredible playing that'll draw you in.
opening this years event, surf monster, coming to you from san francisco. these guys know how to put a show on and will have the crowd swaying and moving with original tunes and their take on tunes we all know.
we will get an advance ticket link up asap, you do not want to miss this years event. now, make sure to put this on the calendar and we will see you at the sacramento surf/instro event of the year!
reverb, set, capital city surf clash!!

surf beat '23 - los grainders


   submitted by emilien03
 on
   january 08, 2025






there are plenty of modern day surf artists that pen songs that have a western twang or take on some south american vibes, but los grainders turn the table on their northern counterparts, with a classic approach to surf. focusing on “that” socal sound, this outfit from mexico city knows their stuff and backs it up with the latest release, surf beat ’23. we've teamed up with musick recordings for this limited edition red 10" vinyl.
“the guitars sparkle and shine against the backdrop of some mellow basslines and beautiful drum work. the album starts off with the fast-paced storm surf and settles into a nice groove, trading tempos back and forth between tracks. the balance makes for a fantastic listen, never falling into one groove. it’s tough to pick a favorite track, but nomoro with its quick picking is a frontrunner, but i also love the deep and dreamy track santa ana winds. while many surf bands shoot for a traditional surf sound, los grainders have done their homework.”
