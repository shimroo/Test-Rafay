welcome to
clooney's pub softball, 
					a slow pitch softball team located in burlingame, ca.  
					we've been playing together since march, 1996 and began 
					our 17th year playing together in march.


we've 
					progressed into a pretty decent team, with 19 playoff 
					championships and and 29 league titles.  still, we try to 
					have fun along the way (someone once said that we were a "drinking team 
					with a softball problem").  
					in 2011 we began playing co-ed on monday nights in san mateo 
					and currently have two teams active on monday.  our 
					only remaining men's team is our backward's k squad in 
					foster city on thursday nights.


					we have three sponsors: 
the dan lyons team 
					w/keller williams in burlingame, clooney's 
					pub in san francisco and 
					the patio 
					bar in san carlos, with the patio bar the 
					home of our semi-regular gatherings.
