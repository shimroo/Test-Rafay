barcroft school &civic leaguea historic south arlington neighborhood

 













about barcroftbarcroft is a friendly, quiet neighborhood originally established in 1903. it is host to about 800 mostly modest single-family homes, and about 400 apartments along the outer edge. most of the houses were built in the 1930-1970 era, with a growing number of newer, larger homes. barcroft is represented by an active civic association, the barcroft school & civic league. the neighborhood hosts the historic barcroft community house built in 1908, originally as a church, then as a school (a genuine arlington one-room school house), and then as barcroft's community home. the barcroft school & civic league publishes a monthly neighborhood newsletter, the barcroft news, first published in 1903.the barcroft school & civic league sponsors neighborhood events ranging from its annual fourth of july parade and picnic to a holiday program with a visit from santa claus, meet-the-candidates nights before elections, spaghetti dinners, easter egg hunts and national night out ice cream socials. these events retain the strong spirit of community first developed here over 100 years ago.this is a good place to live.
