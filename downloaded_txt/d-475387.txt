cbd gummies are not drugs! fight for your right to cbd edibles!

 rick caldwell march 6, 2018march 6, 2018 


we were shocked to see in the new lately about small vape shops being shut down all over the state of kentucky for selling thc free cbd. thats why we put together this article about the benefits of cbd oil and cbd gummies and why they are perfectly legal to purchase and consume.
the benefits of using hemp derived cbd oil gummies

cbd oil is an oil that contains concentrated cannabidiols, or cbd. it is commonly extracted from the cannabis plant, but there is an increasing trend towards hemp-derived cbd – with the idea being to produce cbd that has no relationship with cannabis and is clearly totally thc free (cannabis-derived cbd should also be so low in thc as to be classified as thc-free, but lawmakers in some parts of the world still consider it to be a part of the plant and therefore illegal).
there are many benefits to hemp-derived cbd gummies. for one, their legal. cannabis oil preparations have been a part of medicine through history, but medical marijuana was banned in the 1930s out of fear of the plant being abused. cbd oil offers many of the health benefits of cannabis preparations, without the risk of abuse because cbd itself does not have any psychoactive properties – and therefore it is not something that people use recreationally and medicinally.
cbd oil has incredibly low toxicity. to date there are no records of people overdosing on cbd. the ‘effective dose’ is very small, but the only recorded negative impact from taking significantly higher doses appears to be on the wallet of the person who wasted the dose.
what do cbd gummies do?
cbd has been found, through recent experimental models, to be an anti-inflammatory, an antioxidant, anti-convulsant, antypsychotic and anti-emetic. there is hope that it could be used in the treatment of everything from epilepsy to schizophrenia, as well as nausea and neuroinflammation. many athletes make use of every day optimal cbd gummies and oils as a recovery aid.
there are numerous cannabinoids in the cannabis plant. these cannabinoids act as ligands. they dock onto the binding site of proteins, and they can modulate the behavior of the receptiors. there are cb1 receptors all over the body – in the brain and in the nervous system, and they play an important role in the senses, memory, endocrine functions, co-ordination, movement and pain perception.
there are cb2 receptors all over the body. these receptors are particularly abundant in the immune system, and they can help to reduce the perception of pain, and also inflammation. it appears that cbd does not have as much of an impact on cb1 and cb2 receptors as certain other cannabinoids. thc positively regulates the cb1 receptor – and this is what creates the mind-altering impact of marijuana. most marijuana that is grown to be used recreationally is bred to be low in cbd and high in thc.
just because cbd does not impact the cb1 receptor much, it does not mean that it is not beneficial. cbd helps to supress chronic inflammation and reduce pain, while not producing an analgesic toleranc. it is useful for people who are suffering from chronic pain. in addition, it can have an anti psychotic effect, with some trials on patients with schizophrenia offering promising results. it can also help to reduce anxiety, meaning that it has potential to help people who suffer from panic disorders, ocd and ptsd.
there have been some promising early trials into the idea of using cbd to help wtih cancer treatments. in particular for breast cancer. there are some promising options for inhibiting lung and colon cancer as well. these trials are in the early stages, and there is not quite enough evidence to allow marketers to claim that cbd is a viable cure for cancer. with that said, it’s one extra piece of evidence to show that there are a lot of potential upsides to using the supplement, and therefore it is worth considering adding it to a general nutrition routine.

how cbd oil works for pain

 rick caldwell january 11, 2018february 4, 2018 


cbd oil is a derivative of the hemp plant and has no thc in it that would get a person high. the cbd, when ingested, attaches itself to the pain receptors in the body and reduces or eliminates pain.
many people suffer from painful conditions and doctors prescribe pharmaceuticals to deal with the pain. from high doses of ibuprofen and acetaminophen to addictive pain medications such as oxycontin, percoset, and hydrocodone, people are taking pain medications that can be addictive and have serious side effects. 
since cbd oil works with the receptors in the body naturally, there are no known side effects. in fact, cbd oil can often treat the side effects from other medications.
painful conditions such as arthritis, chronic regional pain syndrome or reflex sympathetic dystrophy, injuries, and other medical conditions that may cause pain all appear to respond well to cbd oil as a pain medication.

for patients who don’t want to take harsh or addictive pain medications cbd oil is an ideal alternative. cbd oil also works on the pain neurons in the brain and helps the patient to feel less pain and gain more motion when muscles are sore and achy. 
cbd oil doesn’t require a prescription and it’s legal in all 50 states. for this reason, more people are trying it than ever before. it can literally save thousands of doctors visits and prescription costs. 
depending on the method in which cbd is taken, it can take from a few minutes (oil that is taken sublingually) to an hour or two (for cbd oil that is ingested with food) to take effect.â  when it goes in sublingually (underneath of the tongue) it immediately hits the bloodstream and takes effect faster.
when it’s ingested via food, it has to go through the digestive system and will take up to 2 hours to take full effect. many people misunderstand this and take more and more not realizing that it is simply working its way through the digestive system. taking more isn’t harmful and won’t have any ill side effects, it’s just using the supply up more quickly than is necessary. 
cbd oil also works on the inflammation that many conditions such as arthritis and other pain conditions may include. by reducing the inflammation, it helps to lower the pain level and ultimately gives the user pain relief as well.
since cbd works on so many different conditions, it’s almost a miracle drug. it can help to reduce pain in injuries and other conditions and it’s readily available at a fraction of the cost of other pain medications. 
as it attaches to the pain receptors in the brain and body it gets to work reducing pain and inflammation and offering relief to the millions who rely on it for pain relief. 
it can be found in gummies, oil, and other edible forms as well as tea and other herbal beverages. legal in all 50 states everyone who uses it has their own personal experience of pain relief.
