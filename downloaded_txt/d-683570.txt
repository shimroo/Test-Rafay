	 a house?!
	 
    


so we went to look at a  house tonight, and we actually might put in an offer!!! it has a new roof and a new a/c unit.  3/2, 1089 sq ft, biiiiig back yard.  it has a one car garage, and comes with range, refridge, dishwasher - no washer and dryer though.  we are going to see it during the daylight on friday.  very excited right now!  but not getting my hopes up yet.  it is listed at $164,900, and we can only pay between $155 and $160k... and we really need them to include closing costs.  so we'll see... more to come!

hi nana - happy tuesday :o)just met with the mortgage broker. we can't afford anything. well, we can, but we have to rebudget (and together, which is wierd). we can't eat out 4 times a month. we need to free up $400 extra each month so that we can afford a mortgage. i am sad.
