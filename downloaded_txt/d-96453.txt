bradenton, along with sarasota and her islands, about 60 miles south of tampa and southwest of orlando, provide miles of idyllic white sand shoreline lapped by azure waters of the gulf coast.  island life centers on longboat key, lido key, siesta key, casey key, venice, manasota key, englewood and north port, yet attractions extend well beyond basking on sarasota county's beaches. myakka river state park attracts birders, bikers, hikers, and boaters. sarasota also reaps recognition as florida's cultural coast, with john & mable ringling museum of art serving as florida's state museum. anglers head for the englewood public fishing pier, ken thompson park pier, osprey fishing pier, tony saprito pier, turtle beach pier and venice fishing pier, or any of more than a dozen area marinas and public boat ramps. diversified shopping ranges from downtown sarastota's towles court, with artists in residence on the job of producing more showcased works, to the upscale st. armands circle on lido key and bradenton's red barn flea market plaza. dining is equally varied, ranging from the columbia restaurant sarasota in st. armands (an offshoot of  tampa's century-old spanish cuisine icon) to the area's amish family restaurants such as yoder's. sarasota - bradenton lodging ranges from family-owned motels to upscale resorts.
