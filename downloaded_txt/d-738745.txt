wild alaskan seafood









black cod








3lb package - gulf of alaska black cod (sablefish) fillet  - shipping included!
harvested fresh from the icy depths of the gulf of alaska, black cod is a succulent white-fish with loads of flavor. black cod, also known as sablefish or butterfish, has been increasingly popularized by renowned chefs for its versatility in the kitchen and its flaky, silky-textured flesh. the moist, white fish is loaded with omega-3 oils and can be baked, broiled, poached, or grilled to prepare a savory fish-lovers meal.for years most of the alaskan catch of black cod was exported to japan. recently however, domestic seafood connoisseurs have begun to demand that more of the catch be distributed locally. at our dockside processing facility fresh sablefish is quickly hand filleted and portioned in pieces ranging between 3/4 to 1 pound, vacuum packaged, and blast frozen to lock in the pristine flavor and texture of this unique fish.
