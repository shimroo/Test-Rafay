newcomers to silveridge know exactly what he meant by “old friends who’ve just met.”

what does it mean to be the friendliest park in the west?


silveridge has 688 lots, an ideal size -- big enough to have plenty of activities to choose from and all the amenities of the giant parks, without the big crowds; allowing you to make great friends and lasting memories.
plus, we have a sister park, the resort rv park, a few blocks away, and residents invite each other to their events and facilities.
meet the people of the park









silveridge isn’t owned or run by some anonymous corporation in manhattan or shanghai; ; the owner and the members of the management team for silveridge and the resort are all local and regularly meet with residents.  





 




we think silveridge is so special that we welcome comparisons to other parks… 
price value comparisons

when comparing parks, what you’ll see is that silveridge is not the cheapest park in town, but it compares favorably to neighboring parks. and that’s true even though the density of silveridge is far lower than other nearby parks. 
when you visit silveridge you’ll quickly notice the wide streets and how the place is not crowded with homes squished in together. silveridge has fewer than 10 lots per acre, which is half the rate of some neighboring parks.

holiday events, like the mardi gras parade, and the christmas parade of decorated golf carts.
