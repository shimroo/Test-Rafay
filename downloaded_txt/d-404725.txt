"happiness is a decision." by lionel r. ketchianas quoted in the oxford dictionary of american quotations. in the book: food for thought published in 1989 and quoted in the new york times article on april 17, 2005.﻿watch:  ths 79. happiness decision by lionel ketchian - youtube"and there were always choices to make. every day, every hour, offered the opportunity to make a decision, a decision which determine whether you would or would not submit to those powers which threatened to rob you of your very self, your inner freedom; which determine whether or not you would become the plaything of circumstance, renouncing freedom and dignity to become molded into the form of the typical inmate.""...in the final analysis it becomes clear that the sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision, and not the result of camp influences alone. fundamentally, therefore, any man can, even under such circumstances, decide what will become of him - mentally and spiritually. he may retain his human dignity even in a concentration camp."- viktor frankl from man's search for meaning********﻿happy u - free classes!
