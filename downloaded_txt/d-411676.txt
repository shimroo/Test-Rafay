		since 1968, trap falls kennel 
		club (tfkc) has been an active non-profit all-breed member club of the 
		american kennel club®. tfkc is devoted to the betterment of the purebred 
		dog and is an advocate for the purebred and mixed breed dog as a family 
		companion. additionally, trap falls strives to promote responsible dog 
		ownership in the community through public education programs and events.
our members are interested dog lovers, pet owners; breeders; 
		trainers, participants in therapy dog programs, and exhibitors in 
		conformation, obedience, rally, agility and other competitive dog 
		sports. two big events on which trap falls prides itself are its 
		annual akc all -breed dog show in springfield, massachusetts and 
		responsible dog ownership day in september, which celebrates the joy of 
		dog ownership in a fun family-friendly atmosphere. trap falls has 
		received the akc® community achievement award for hosting a successful 
		responsible dog ownership day, multiple times.trap falls also 
		has a long tradition of community service and public education – 
		offering training classes in obedience, canine good citizen® (cgc) 
		training and testing, and tdi® (therapy dogs international) testing; 
		hosting free programs on doggie safety; donating supplies and funds to 
		local shelters and hurricane sandy victims, and sending needed supplies 
		overseas to k-9 units based in afghanistan and iraq. most recently tfkc 
		helped fund, with akc reunite, the purchase of a new k-9 officer in 
		newtown ct. monthly meetings are held on the first tuesday of 
		every month, and outside guests are encouraged to attend, as there are 
		often speakers and programs of interest to dog owners and dog lovers. 
		recent presentations have included everything from first-aid; creating 
		wills and trusts for your furry companions; to massage techniques to use
