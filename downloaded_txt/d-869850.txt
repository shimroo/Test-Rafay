   quality solutions since 1946 nachurs alpine solutions is a north american specialty liquids chemical manufacturer.


    committed to the marketplace with 
over 75 years of experience and growth
 
built on quality, integrity, and innovation, we pioneered precision-placed liquid fertilizer in 1946 – formulated to meet the nutritional demands of crops and growing conditions on both sides of the border.our two founding companies, the na-churs plant food company and alpine plant foods corporation, captivated growers’ attention and revolutionized farming practices by developing precision-placed, seed-safe, liquid phosphate starters that kick-start strong, early root growth and maximize crop yields. in 1998, the na-churs plant food company acquired alpine plant foods corp. and formed nachurs alpine solutions.
