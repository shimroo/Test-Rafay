    karen leary

i feel like our family is now part of the st. francis borgia family. it takes a village & i feel like the teachers and staff of st. francis borgia care about what is best for my child.




    

      







   





    carly richards

i cannot say enough about how amazing st. francis borgia truly is and what it means to my family and me. on our drive from west mobile to st. francis borgia we pass several good schools to get to the best. this school doesn‚Äôt just have the best staff; it also has the most amazing families. most importantly, my kids are taught to love god and love each other.





    

      







   





    thomas williams

st. francis borgia is a place of safety and nourishment for my son so that he will grow to take that love out into the world. it‚Äôs also a wonderful education academically. he will be able to share his gifts and education with the world at large.






    tradition¬†

our school stands out due to its rich traditions and profound connections within the community. this year, we proudly welcome families with up to five generations who have attended or are currently attending as we embark on a new academic journey. while we remain dedicated to providing a cutting-edge education and embracing technological advancements, our core values remain steadfast. god is at the center of our mission, and our faith will remain resolute as we adapt to the changing times. additionally, our student-to-teacher ratio fosters meaningful interactions, allowing educators to engage deeply with each student.

  who are we? we are children of god. our potential is unlimited. our inheritance is sacred. may we always honor that heritage - in every thought and deed. -russell nelson





    

  what to do tonight?
take the kids outside and catch a firefly and then go online to learn more about fireflies or read a book, such as fireflies by sally m. walker, to learn more about them.
fireflies are really beetles because they have four wings; true flies only have two wings.
scientists believe fireflies use their ability to flash as a warning signal to predators and to attract mates.





    

  did you know cats spend 66% of their life asleep??

  national camping day - june 25th (national camping week 6/23-6/29) some fund ideas to celebrate camping...

camp at home-
it‚Äôs not always possible to go camping but you can always camp at home. camping in your backyard and minimizing screen time is still a wonderful way to enjoy the outdoors.
enjoy classic camp foods-
camping means delicious food! serve up some barbecue, roasts, and s‚Äômores for dinner and celebrate camping without actually having to leave the house.
go camping-
pick a weekend during national camping month to go camping with your loved ones. remember to pack adequately and enjoy your time outdoors!






     

  june 24th is celebration of the senses day is a special day that celebrates all of our senses. a day to appreciate the amazing things our senses allow us to experience. today, we take time to appreciate the taste of good food, the smell of a fresh rain, the feel of a soft blanket, the sound of waves crashing on the shore, and the sight of a beautiful sunset. we also use our senses to enjoy the company of friends and family, and to create new memories.





    

  is anyone reading to beat the heat? tell us about your favorite summer read. suggestion welcomed!!





    

  we know you are having a great sumer, but, we miss you! it's quiet here, without you.

  struggling to find, god/work/life/church/kids/summer balance? us too! a few great and simple tips for keeping god as the center of it all. 

specific ways to keep god as the focus during the summer
reading a book of the bible every month as a family.
the kids attend vbs, summer camp, and youth group.
pray at meals. (more than just 'grace', gratitude prayers)
play christian music at home.
playing christian games together. the hilarious ‚Äúchristian life game.‚Äù is one good one.

it‚Äôs the simple, ordinary moments that mean the most to kids as they grow. incorporating god‚Äôs truth makes it that much more meaningful to them.
