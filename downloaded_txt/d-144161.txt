“this park is in a beautiful setting, is well maintained, and the staff could not be more helpful and pleasant. we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend kamp klamath! we will be back.”— kim l. on october 14, 2024

 

booked this spot last minute as all of the state parks nearby were completely full. we absolutely loved this place! the staff is friendly, the tent camping area is beautiful, the showers were the nicest and cleanest that i’ve experienced while camping, it is very quiet at night, and the location is incredible! staying here gave us a unique experience near the klamath river with dozens of trails, beaches and overlooks within a 5 minute drive. if you stay here, be sure to check out the high bluff overlook nearby. absolutely stunning.— glenn c. on august 26, 2024
