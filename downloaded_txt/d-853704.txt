understanding tmj disorders 



							for over 10 years, dentists have provided quicksplint® for acute jaw pain, and as a diagnostic tool to differentiate between over 30 types of chronic tmj disorders. the use of quicksplint® and the speed2treat® home healing kit is not a substitute for professional care, however in our experience patients often wait too long for treatment or are unsure what to do and where to go. trial use of our simple treatments help you and your medical/dental team determine next steps.						



















 







holistic healing 



our products are non-narcotic and address common jaw pain and headache conditions before they become chronic tmj disorders. most people will make a full recovery in 4 weeks with diligent self-care. every person’s response to pain is different however, and you might have ups and downs. we have designed supportive online videos with helpful information on returning to normal jaw function.
