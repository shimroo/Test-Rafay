how to test gimp 3.0 development version quickly on ubuntu
happy news to us that gnu image manipulation program now almost reaches version 3.0. this long time favorite application of us, also known as gimp, is in rapid development stages and the release candidate or rc versions are already available for us to download and test (and report bug if we found any issue). as a part of the happy news, now gimp 3.0 is officially available also as appimage! for that reason, we can try it out as quickly as downloading and double-clicking it without removing the existing version installed. while we're all waiting for gimp 3.0 rc to finally reach 3.0 stable, now let's start trying it out!
