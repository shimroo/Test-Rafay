years
ago we spiced apple cider at our orchard & mill
 and visitors asked about
taking it home to brew on their own.
 over time we came to offer
in tea bags or "loose pack"
j.crow's®
mulled cider mix.
spices apple cider, juice or wine
taste tested on mount
washington, where you will find some of
the highest wind speeds and coldest
temperatures on earth.
 orderxand
enjoy highly aromatic,
relaxing & soothing benefits:
when baking
as a spiced friendship tea
-hot or cold with a bit of honey-
in a simmering potpourri
someone once wrote about using
the tea bag as a sachet!
( what?..good idea!)
"you inquired, 
as i recall,  whether one may permissibly manufacture sweet cider
and then, after  natural fermentation has occurred,
sell the finished product, 
without complying with the statutory provisions and local regulations governing
the sale of alcoholic beverages."

thunderbolts
of the gods
recent discoveries in space have amazed and perplexed 
scientists. current popular theories in the sciences
can 
neither predict nor explain the phenomena we are now 
observing. in thunderbolts,
american mythologist 
david talbott and australian physicist wallace thornhill
and their associates propose a new theory which can
both 
predict and explain these phenomena.

5,000 year old rock art, the origins of world mythology,
planetary history, spectacular nebular forms in deep 
space, and high energy electric discharges in the
plasma 
laboratory -all are inextricably linked by the electric
model. 
in an extraordinary synthesis of the scientific disciplines 
thunderbolts
presents us with an astonishing new 
perspective on ancient history and leading-edge astronomy.

the religion of the future will be a cosmic
religion.
it should transcend personal god and avoid
dogma 
and theology. covering both the natural and
the 
spiritual, it should be based on a religious
sense 
arising from the experience of all things
natural 
and spiritual as a meaningful unity. buddhism 
answers this description. if there is any
religion 
that could cope with modern scientific needs
it 
would be buddhism. -albert
einstein

that is 
stronger than cement and six times lighter? better
yet, one of its main ingredients 
is the waste product of a plant that literally grows

the way a crow
shook down on me
the dust of snow
from a hemlock tree
has given my heart
a change of mood
and saved some part
of a day i had rued.

scene near northwood narrows, nh circa 1918
"do not believe in anything simply because you have heard it. do
not believe in anything simply because it is spoken and rumored by many.
do not believe in anything simply because it is found written in your religious
books. do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers
and elders. do not believe in traditions because they have been handed
down for many generations. but after observation and analysis, when you
find that anything agrees with reason and is conducive to the good and
benefit of one and all, then accept it and live up to it.
