cade museum for creativity & invention




gainesville, florida
science, specialized
to inspire creative thinking, future inventors, and early entrepreneurs. the cade museum for creativity + invention - located in gainesville, florida - is named for dr. james robert cade, the physician, musician, researcher and inventor best known for leading the university of florida team that created gatorade, to honor his creative spirit and passion for new ideas. the cade museum is a hands-on solution to some very real problems. american creativity quotient (cq) scores have been steadily and significantly declining since 1990*, coupled with falling academic performance in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (stem). we propose to help change that by highlighting the link between creative thought and breakthrough ideas.

2025 conference theme: looking back to the future
 
for the past several years, many museums have been deeply involved in planning programs and events to observe the 250th birthday of the united states of america. while this is certainly an occasion to celebrate, this anniversary also forces us as a society to reckon with ongoing inequities and challenges within the us that go back to its inception. 

as museums ask their audiences to look to the past to understand the present and shape a better future, perhaps now is a good moment in time for virginia’s museum community to take pause and look back at its own history. 

we are excited to see you in blacksburg in march 2025 as we take a moment in our hectic schedules to take pause and visit our diverse pasts. let’s uncover and share our histories to build a more resilient virginia museum community.

"innovation: museums and reaching our potential

the heart of innovation is transformation – shaking up our established way of doing things by introducing new methods, new ideas, and new approaches to both obstacles and opportunities

museums across ohio are not just adapting, but innovating to reach their full potential and better serve their communities. no matter their role, museum professionals are introducing forward-thinking perspectives and initiating creative solutions to launch the field into a future where museums can remain trusted and relevant community cornerstones

how can your museum stay true to mission and serve your community in new and meaningful ways? how can we as museum professionals meet the challenges of the future with reinvigorated enthusiasm

join us in athens, march 29-31 as we explore these topics and more at the 2025 ohio museums association’s annual conference: innovation: museums and reaching our potential.
