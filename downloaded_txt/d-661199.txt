transforming the science of transfection since 1995 



mirus was founded in 1995 to address the limitations and risks of viral gene transfer. we developed the first pdna transfection method that combined high efficiency with low cellular toxicity, and since that time, we’ve focused on applying intentional design to nucleic acid delivery systems.
