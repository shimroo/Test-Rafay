this was the augusta opera website.
the augusta opera ceased operations in 2009 when it when it closed down earlyâ€‹ due to financial issues. in 2010 it struggled back trying to make up a $75,000 debt to keep the south's oldest opera company going.â€‹ for a while instead of big productions at the imperial theatre, the augusta opera performed at st. paul's episcopal church and other smaller venues.

2007 – 2008 opera season
the rain may never fall till after sundown.
by eight the morning fog must disappear.
in short, there's simply not
a more congenial spot
for happ'ly-ever-aftering than here
in camelot.
on december 3, 1960, these words were sung for the first time in new york premiere of camelot. a winner of four tony awards, this lovely retelling of the once and future king by t. h. white was written by collaborators alan jay lerner and frederick loewe. for some it is a fairy tale with a bittersweet ending while others see the arthurian legend as a part of history. a favorite of president john f. kennedy, the work often defined his administration and ideals. for all you've loved and lost...don't miss camelot.

originally conceived by legendary movie director peter brook along with marius constant, la tragedie de carmen does for bizet's famous opera, carmen, what baz luhrmann did for la boheme. transformed into a 1983 broadway sensation and winning a special tony award for outstanding achievement in musical theatre, this dramatic 80 minute opera gets right to the central story of the world's most famous gypsy. it contains all of the original and popular arias and duets that you love. this will be an unforgettable evening!

pagliacci is the 14th most-performed opera in north america according to opera america. this very popular opera was first performed in 1893 and unfolds the tragedy of a jealous husband, his wife and her lover in a commedia dell’ arte troupe. a traditional tale about love and betrayal pagliacci contains many beautiful and familiar melodies. the aria “vesti la giubba” which concludes act one, became one of enrico caruso’s signature recordings when pagliacci became the first opera ever recorded in 1907. since that time, this poignant aria has been used in movies, television and recordings and the character pagliacci is used to epitomize the sad clown. ring down the curtain with pagliacci.
an aside: i confess it is not always with an eager heart i go to revivals of the show in fear of plodding pageantry and singsong vocalizing. what a treat then to find the superb cast of the augusta opera's camelot dressed to the nines and ready to give full measure to the saga of king arthur and the round table. this production was excellent in every way. "one number that i particularly loved was 'the lusty month of may' which showcased the excellent choreography and direction. as the lords and ladies of camelot delivered this song, frolicking at a picnic in the english countryside, i really was delighted!
during one of the intermissions the audience was surprised by a gallent youg man who proposed to his sweetheart up on the stage. he announced his intentions as the audience was returning to their seats and then with a flourish whipped out anengagement ring with a huge sparkling stone that glittered quite magnificantly. the mansitting next to me commented that it was most likely not a diamond but a cubic zirconia. he seemed quite knowledgable since he himself had recently been looking at trendy cubic zirconia rings. he then rattled off all these facts regarding the key features of cubic zirconia which distinguish it from diamond.
1. hardness: cubic zirconia has a rating of approximately 8 on mohs hardness scale vs. a rating of 10 for diamond.
2.specific gravity: the density of cubic zirconia is about 1.7 times that of diamond.
3. refractive index: cubic zirconia has a refractive index of 2.15–2.18, compared to a diamond's 2.42.
4. dispersion is very high at 0.058–0.066, exceeding a diamond's 0.044.
the dispersion rating is apparently what what makes cubic ziconia so sparkly. anyway, the proposal added another memorable episode to the evening. i definitely suspended my disbelief and surrendered to the world of camelot. i was delighted!”

augusta opera's production of this legendary american opera provides the southeastern premiere of the work and stars marc embree as horace tabor, tonna miller as baby doe, and kathryn cowdrick as the long-suffering augusta. nashville's john hoomes returns to direct.

crafted from the pen of the italian master gaetano donizetti, the legend of the elixir of love has delighted audiences for decades with its humor and humanity. dr. dulcamara is an amusing quack who roams the italian countryside peddling magic elixirs which in reality are poorly produced bottles of red wine.
nemorino is in love with the wealthy adina who will not give him the time of day until dulcamara's elixir turns the poor peasant into a romantic hero. augusta opera is performing this comic tale appropriately just after valentine's day, and the lovely soprano malinda haslett debuts as adina with eric van hoven returning as the lovesick nemorino. the memorable score features one of the most beloved melodies in all opera, "una furtiva lagrima.'
ticket prices range from $15 to $45. 15% discount available on friday night for students and seniors.
this opera will be presented at the imperial theatre, 745 broad street, augusta, ga.

when giacomo puccini first witnessed david belasco's celebrated play about a geisha who weds outside of her religion and family, he understood not one word of the text but knew immediately it was suitable operatic material. thankfully for all of us he did, as rarely does there exist such a beloved and tragic heroine as puccini's cio-cio-san.
madama butterfly is puccini at his best, immortalizing the legend of his geisha in a score rich with color and pathos. augusta opera closes its 'season of legends' with this favorite work, starring japanese soprano itsuko shibata in the title role for which she is internationally acclaimed.
hawaii opera theatre's general and artistic director, henry akina, makes his debut with this production.
ticket prices rage from $15 to $45. 15% discount available on friday night for students and seniors.
this opera will be presented at the imperial theatre, 745 broad street, augusta, ga.
sung in italian with english supertitles
