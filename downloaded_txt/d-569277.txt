	do something extra
	
  
currently still just a concept, somethingextra allows for everyone to help, to do that little 'something extra' for the benefit of themselves, or their community, or even the world.
real life, as it always seems to, is preventing the jump to being fully-functioning but we'd still want to hear from you with ideas, suggestions, comments, anecdotes and helpful hints. if you want to do your part, feel free to leave a comment or visit the main site.


have you done somethingextra today?

	 green theatre initiative
    


a little bit of good news from the world of theatre.the mayor of london's office has announced a 'green theatre initiative' to help london's theatres drop 60% of carbon emissions by 2025.more details including the press release, more info and a carbon calculator can be found at the theatres trust webpage.green theatre initiativeas a side note, i'm refusing to give boris johnson any credit for this one. i'm guessing that all he's done is add his signature to an existing plan. it's a little too sensible for the buffoon to have had a part in

	 arcola energy
    


nope, not a sci-fi pipe dream but one very firmly based in real life.the arcola theatre in dalston, london have recently announced their intention to become a carbon-neutral theatre - one i back them 100% percent (no waste with that figure!)have a look at arcolaenergy.com to get more details - the links to the articles in the guardian are particularly worth checking out also, especially to those of us in the world of theatre.expect this one to reappear in my posting in the futurelabels: arcolatheatre, carbonneutraltheatre

	 live messenger adds charity to it's feature list
    


now, this is an odd onei never thought i'd be supporting microsoft in something that was environmentally positive (must be the power of the green shares and stocks at the moment ...)anyway, for users of live messenger 8.1 and above, microsoft will now make donations to a (mainly us) clause of your choice just for adding a code to your name.i'm hoping that there's no catch to this one have a look for yourselves:http://im.live.com/messenger/im/home/

	 pace of progress part 2
    


5 months since the last update and what has my workspace managed to do?well the water coolers have finally been connected to the mains supply - which means that we are now filtering our own spring water for drinking. bins have arrived next to the new coolers that for just for plastic cups, which is also good.i'm a little worried about the collection for these cups though - the pile of lightbulbs containing tungsten, mercury and other metals is growing ever greater and no battery collection has yet been arranged (other than the odd freecycle pickup ;))thinking i might have to start pushing again a little - the environmental committee has met a grand total of zero times - hmmm.we have changed to glh cars for our transport needs though. all their cars are now hybrid engines.things are happening but it does seem like red tape and beureacratic guidelines are not helping an awful lot.sigh ...

	 local works
    


local works is the home site for supporters of the sustainable communities bill.in essence, it's wanting to promote more control of local communities by those communities, supported by the government, and promoting sustainability.more details can be found at the link above but this is one campaign that i'm really rooting for
