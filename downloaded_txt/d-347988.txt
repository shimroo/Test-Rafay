“after living & tasting wine in oregon moving to michigan was a letdown since i missed the great red wines of the willamette valley. we were delighted to find ciccone vineyard & immediately joined the wine club & bought several bottles. plus, their patio is beautiful & staff is super friendly!”

— sandra b




“we really loved all the wines we tried here. they are known for their dry reds which are my favorite. they have a good variety of whites as well.”

— nicole m
