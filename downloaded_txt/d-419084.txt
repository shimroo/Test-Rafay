there are a number of ways that you can find discount vitamins. the most common is to wait until your favorite vitamin store has a sale but this can be a rather difficult way to get a discount vitamin. the problem is mainly due to the discount time. most discount vitamin offers only have a limited amount of stock available and it is a case of first-come, first-served. the other issue with trying to get these discount vitamin offers is that they are strictly time limited and again, you may miss out unless you find out about the sale in advance.  a large number of stores produce coupons that offer discount vitamin purchases. these coupons are often distributed in newspapers and magazines - the sunday newspapers are so full of coupons that it may be time-consuming looking for the discount vitamin offers but it is worth the effort. you may find that some of these coupons do not give an instant discount vitamin purchase but you can claim the appropriate money back through a rebate system. beware that some of these rebated discount vitamin offers require you to purchase additional equipment or accessories to qualify for them. one extremely good source for discount vitamin offers is look for bulk purchases. this is an extremely underestimated resource, as many people do not actually understand what a bulk purchase discount vitamin really is. in all honesty, you are likely to get a better discount vitamin offer if you opt for a bulk purchase from your local outlet. this is because the bulk purchases offer the best discount vitamin prices possible. this is especially the case for vitamins that you may want to take on an ongoing basis. vitamin c, for example, is a great choice to buy in bulk and obtain a discount vitamin price. it is extremely important, however, to ensure that the bulk discount vitamin purchases do not include vitamins that may have an expiration date that could be exceeded before they are all consumed. do not be tempted to purchase bulk amounts of vitamins simply to obtain a discount vitamin price unless you are sure that you can consume all of the vitamins within the expiration dates given. one of the major mistakes that people make when looking for a discount vitamin is to overlook the expiration date. there may not be any danger if the discount vitamins are a few days past their sell by date but it is not worth the risk just to save a few pennies.  for more information about vitamins, visit these links: http://www.dietarysupplementsinfo.com and http://www.vitaminsupplementsinfoguide.comabout the author david chandler for your free stock market trading mini course:  "what the wall street hot shots won't tell you!" go to: http://www.stockmarketgenie.com
