		this week large areas across far north queensland experienced heavy rainfall and significant flooding, with some regions receiving six months’ worth of rain in as few as three days. we should expect to see a significant recovery process from this event, with widely circulating footage of collapsed and submerged bridges and roads reconfirming the need for resilience to be embedded in future infrastructure development projects throughout queensland, especially so in flood-prone areas such as the state’s far north. qff’s peak body members including canegrowers australia, queensland fruit & vegetable growers (qfvg) the nursery & garden industry queensland (ngiq) and eastausmilk are working with their grower members as they work through the immediate response and begin their initial assessments of crop losses and infrastructure damage.as we get a better sense of the overall impact of this event on far north queensland’s farmers, qff will advocate for the timely disbursement of relief and recovery funding to ensure farm businesses can return to business-as-usual as soon as possible, as well as the age-old issue of changing eligibility criteria to allow for crop replacement support for growers. qff will also continue to advocate for government to embed skilled industry resilience officers in the local communities impacted by this event for the most efficient delivery of on-the-ground recovery. read more in our president's column below 👇bit.ly/4andud0

                    qld gov must prioritise replanting in disaster recovery 
when disasters strike, recovery grants are essential for growers to clean up and rebuild. but the real goal is getting businesses back on track, and in farming that means crops back in the ground. 
in other states, farmers…
