astronomy adventure camp
observing in pristine skies!

 
 
if you want super fantastic observing under a pristine night sky, you’ll want to go to sumner, maine. the milky way on a pleasant august night extends from horizon to horizon. one of the darkest sites in new england.  marion hochulli: past president atmob.org .
*astronomy adventure camp is located in western maine near sabago lake paris /norway area  the campground is on 26 acres of land. currently about two acres have been cleared for camping but you can camp anywhere. we are fully insured. the cmpground is rustic but has solar power, a shower, rest room and a small pavilion for talks. we also have scope lessons, rentals, repair shoppe, and music.
   this is gerry, performing on a theorbo music from galileo!
