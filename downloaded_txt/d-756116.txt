shock and awe has moved!





shock and awe has moved out of the apartment complex and into it's own house in the urban sprawl suburban community of cyberspace. here is our new permanent home. we now have room and capabilities for you to advertise your business. like the characters george and weezie jefferson of the 1980's television sitcom the jefferson's "well, we are moving on up!"

sheriff jones influence goes worldwide





this news item i have borrowed and republished from the knox county sheriffs department website. 

knox county sheriff jimmy “j.j.” jones returned from a 7 day trip to taiwan on monday.  he and assistant chief lee tramel visited the country at the request of fang-chin-chiu, the acting speaker of chia-yi city council. they toured police agencies and the court systems in chia-yi and taipei.  chiai-yi is a city of 270,000 people and taipei has just over 2 million.

sheriff jones said drugs are becoming a problem in taiwan as they are in the united states.  he said a drug called “ice” is becoming very prevalent.  “it’s similar to our meth problem.  one of the components of ice is pseudoephedrine which is found in cold medicines and also used to make meth.  the police officials were very interested in how we control the cold medicines, the data bases, and cracking down on how much medicine can be sold to one person,” said sheriff jones.

the media found the visitors very newsworthy.  the sheriff topped their newscasts and made the front page of their newspapers.  sheriff jones said he found the trip to be highly educational and a good informational exchange.  “i found the police agencies to be very community oriented and progressive,” said the sheriff.  sheriff jones added that there are over one hundred taiwanese families living in knox county and several students who attend the university of tennessee and knox county schools.

several police agencies in taiwan are planning to visit knox county next august to take a look at law enforcement agencies and correctional system.

sheriff jones said thanks to the generosity of acting speaking fang-chin-chiu and the other law enforcements agencies in taiwan, the trip was not at the expense of knox county taxpayer.

is south knoxville getting screwed again?





south knoxville got screwed when the henley street bridge had to close, get torn down and is bring rebuilt. many businesses have not survived while the remaining ones are barely hanging on until the bridge is completed and the world can once again visit south knoxville. 

sources now indicate that the state of tennessee is saying that they plan to complete the james white parkway. the next phase will take it from where it ends at moody avenue to then connect at the john sevier highway and chapman highway area. it would create a complete south knoxville bypass. 

i hope governor haslam will stop this in the tracks. south knoxville does not need a bypass to make chapman highway a ghost town drive.

post removed





the hpud and mayor's boy post was removed early this morning for the reason that a lot of comments had criticized or asked the question about cook being at a board meeting on monday during normal business hours. a comment was posted that pointed out that monday was veterans day and a holiday for knox county. while that issue wasn't raised in the blog post itself, i made the decision to remove the entire post.

rip mayor leonard





farragut mayor robert "bob" leonard has passed away, mayor leonard was the first mayor of farragut when it was incorporated in 1980. he served for many years before stepping down and the town selected mayor eddie ford. a few years ago, mayor ralph mcgill was elected and is in his first four year term. 

while i have never owned property or resided in the town of farragut. i still consider it home because i live so close and have participated in so many things within the town. 

rip, mayor leonard!

a post election analysis





my friend sean over at meat and potatoes blog has a post election analysis that he posted a couple of days ago. 

while i probably don't agree with everything he posted. especially with his analysis that everyone on food stamps or welfare automatically voted for president obama. he makes some commentary that is worthy of our consideration. read it here.
