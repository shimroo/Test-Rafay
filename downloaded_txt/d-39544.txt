highland hardware has been helping customers since 1946
in 1946, harry craven sr. and his wife mary opened “highland variety” located in holyoke, ma in hopes of establishing a family run, friendly neighborhood variety store. highland variety originally opened as a gift store, but soon expanded to become a full service hardware store years later. in the mid 1960’s, highland variety brought in bikes, trikes, and wagons which eventually led to the opening of the bicycle shop. today, harry craven jr. has picked up where his father left off and has been running what is now highland hardware and bike shop for the past 30 years. we strive to serve our community through customer care and are grateful for the constant support that we are given.
