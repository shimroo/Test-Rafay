of sin is death, but the gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our
lord."

register






this is a big one! 85 years of sturgis and 35 years of bfc! this will be our best national rally yet. you don't want to miss it!
bfc registration includes admission to all bfc activities during our event which includes speakers, bands, and training meetings in the large 500 seat sanctuary, as well as meetings in breakout rooms. it also includes a special "bfc sturgis commemorative shirt" (unisex) for all adults, & married couples.
we’re working on a new design for the event.  some additional event shirts will be available for sale at the event.  other bfc member and support gear will also be available for sale…  cd’s from the bands may also be available to purchase.
bfc registration also includes beautiful group rides to the amazing attractions that the sturgis black hills rally experience offers like mt. rushmore, crazy horse, deadwood, the badlands, spearfish canyon, downtown sturgis, rapid city harley davidson with hundreds of vendors, and many others.
please note:


bfc registration does not include meals, or lodging. after you register with us, you must register directly with cedar canyon camp for meals and lodging. click here to register with cedar canyon.


cedar canyon offers modern rooms, economy rooms, bunkhouse rooms, etc., as well as rv sites, and tent spaces. check their website for more information.


no refunds can be given for the bfc registration for no-shows, etc. because we are in a legal contract with cedar canyon, and we'll be using its main sanctuary (500 seats), as well as other meeting rooms, and facilities.  (if you can't make it, we will of course pray for you & yours, and the event t-shirts will be mailed to you.)


please pray with us – pray that the bfc sturgis national rally 2025 will be a blessed event. we’re excited to be gathering again.
love and respect, bikers for christ m/m international hq
