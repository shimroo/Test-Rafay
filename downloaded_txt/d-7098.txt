all abuzz about bugs!

we are an online community of naturalists who enjoy learning about and sharing our observations of insects, spiders, and other related creatures.

we enjoy the opportunity to instill in others the fascination and appreciation that we share for the intricate lives of these oft-maligned creatures.

our mission

using the best resources we have access to, we are creating a knowledgebase to help each other and the online community.

our method

we collect photographs of bugs from the united states and canada for identification and research.

we summarize our findings in guide pages for each order, family, genus, and species.

making new discoveries

more than just a clearinghouse for information, this site helps expand on the natural histories of our subjects. by capturing the place and time that submitted images were taken, we are creating a virtual collection that helps define where and when things might be found.

we capture never-before-seen behaviors and we have photos of species that you won't find anywhere else on the web.
