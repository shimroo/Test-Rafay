motorola moto g (1st and 2nd gen) android 5.0 lollipop update starts rolling out in india






motorola has announced that it has started rolling out android 5.0.2 lollipop update for the first and second generation moto g smartphones in india. it is also rolling out lollipop update for the moto g (2nd gen) in the us and for both the moto g variants in brazil. the lollipop update brings all-new material design, better touch screen interactions, quick notifications on the lock screen and more. motorola moto x (2nd gen) got the lollipop update in india last month.







check out the official changelog       


material design – you will quickly notice a whole new colorful look 
and feel to your device – from fluid animations to new application and 
system themes, colors and widgets.
notifications ui & priorities
new interruptions & downtime settings: you can tailor how 
interruptions behave, choosing to allow all, none, or only priority 
interruptions. you can personalize what counts as a priority 
interruption (reminders, events, calls, messages) and even tailor them 
to be from only contacts you specify. the downtime setting will allow 
only priority interruptions during the times and days that you specify. 
e.g. allow only priority interruptions on the weekend.
recent apps (multi-tasking): the redesigned overview space (formerly
 called recents) will include both applications and separate activities 
within those applications. for instance, each open tab in chrome will 
also appear here along with recent applications; both your gmail inbox 
and a draft email message will appear as separate cards. this provides a
 consistent way to switch amongst tasks.
moto display and ambient display: while your phone’s display is off,
 moto display will continue to surface relevant notifications to you 
using the low-power contextual computing processor. it will also 
intelligently react when you use the approach gesture under moto 
actions.
moto assist and downtime: moto assist integrates the new downtime 
feature within android lollipop to control when you don’t want to be 
disturbed. moto assist also now uses the new interruptions settings so 
that you can customize exceptions, such as letting only people on your 
starred contacts list get through.
flashlight: lollipop includes a new flashlight option as part of 
quick settings (swipe down with two fingers from the status bar to see 
it).
share your device: you can now set up multiple user accounts on your
 phone. guest mode is enabled by default. you can give calling and text 
privileges to other users of your device, or restrict them as you like 
in the users menu under settings.
pin a view/app: screen pinning allows you to keep a specific app or 
screen in view. for example, you can ‘pin’ a game and your child will 
not be able to navigate anywhere else on your phone.
battery: the battery settings panel now shows an estimated 
projection for how much time you have left while discharging or 
charging. you can also enable a new battery saver mode that will save 
power by reducing performance and most background data operations to 
extend your battery life.
smarter internet connections: with android lollipop, your phone will
 not connect to a wi-fi access point unless there is a verified internet
 connection.
performance: your phone now uses the new android runtime to help 
optimize application performance. after upgrading to lollipop, your 
applications will undergo a one-time optimization process.
smart lock (trusted devices): android lollipop adds native support 
for allowing trusted devices to keep your phone unlocked (such as your 
moto 360, a bluetooth car kit or headset, etc.). smart lock replaces the
 prior trusted device capability in your motorola phone.


you should get ota update notification on your moto g (1st and 2nd gen). you can also go to settings, about phone, system updates and select download manually. motorola already confirmed android 5.0 lollipop update for the moto x (1st gen) and moto e, which should be rolling out soon.
