about us

		lexington school for the deaf has been providing educational services to deaf students since its founding in 1864. originally located on lexington avenue in manhattan, the school relocated to east elmhurst, queens in the late 1960s. because lexington is a non-profit, new york state-supported 4201 school, we are able to offer a tuition-free education to our students.
