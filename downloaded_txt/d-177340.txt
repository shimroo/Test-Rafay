noreascon four officially ended on september 6, 2004, at

 we would like to thank our members, supporters, volunteers,
			   and friends for making noreascon four a wonderful convention. 
 we'll keep posting convention reviews and information to
			   this web site (although not at the rapid pace of august!), and we hope you'll
			   stop by again. 
 for information about all of the upcoming worldcons, the

 with warm regards,

things you might have missed
noreascon 4 was on the radio! we aired a number of
		  spots on wbz (1070) in boston during the two weeks before the
		  convention. if you missed it then, you can still 
listen to
		  the file. 

the
		  boston globe also had a write-up about noreascon.
		  
like books? nesfa press produced 
books by
		  each of our guests of honor for noreascon four.
		  
some people were confused about 
the differences between
		  noreascon four and a major political convention. we
		  offered some suggestions on ways to tell the difference between
		  a worldcon and a major political convention. 
prepare for your trip to boston—work on your 
		  fannish
		  language skills or learn how to 
pronounce things
		  boston-style.
what next?
talk back to us! we've got web logs for general
		  noreascon 
		  news and 
		  meeting
		  minutes. 
if you're local to boston (or even if you'll just be visiting), please feel
     free to come to our open meetings.
noreascon four was run by 
		  massachusetts convention fandom,
		  inc., a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded to promote
		  science fiction fandom and education.
