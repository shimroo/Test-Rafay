there is no mistaking it—drug abuse is a planetwide epidemic. if you or someone you know is caught in the grip of addiction, you are no doubt living in your own personal nightmare.
at narconon, we do not believe an addict is an addict for life. we do not believe addiction is an incurable disease. we believe in getting better.
we believe a person trapped in the dwindling spiral of substance abuse can take their life back and live drug free. how do we do it? that’s the narconon difference.




the narconon program is unique:



drug-free withdrawal


new life detoxification


life skills




drug-free withdrawal


                the program begins with a drug-free, nonmedical withdrawal process designed to assist the individual to come off drugs as rapidly and comfortably as possible.
                read more



new life detoxification


                an amazingly effective regimen of nutrition, exercise and sauna—designed specifically to help drug users eliminate the harmful drug residues that drive cravings.
                read more



life skills


                the final component of the program consists of a series of life skills courses. these courses give the individual the tools he needs to remain drug-free.
                read more




the result is freedom from addiction.
