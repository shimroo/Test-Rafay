the answer is simple... it is outstandingly beautiful, has great subtropical weather, the lunar landscape is extraordinary, the subtropical beaches are sublime and the hotels are first-class. the riches on offer are endless...the island is bursting with striking contrasts. although the whole canarian archipelago is volcanic, it is on lanzarote where the recent volcanic history is most evident. there are around 300 peaks, the majority of which are extinct but some are just taking a nap… learn more about the stunning timanfaya national park here.the island, with almost 140.000 inhabitants, is full of life, with its own extraordinary and unmistakable character. many lanzaroteños did not give up following the tremendous eruptions in the 18th and early 19th century, which devastated their fertile land. instead, they found an ingenious way of cultivating the barren lava fields and made every effort to preserve their natural heritage, culture and traditions.lanzarote is also a unique example of how one single man can have so much influence on the landscape, developing it for tourism while maintaining its natural beauty and history. césar manrique is hailed as the island’s internationally renowned son. he left his signature everywhere… as sculptor, painter, architect and environmentalist. except for one hotel in arrecife, all buildings on the island are low-rise – not taller than a canary palm – and you won’t find any advertising hoardings at the roadsides either. because of its natural value and beauty, lanzarote was declared a biosphere reserve by unesco in 1993.being connoisseurs of travel, spain-lanzarote has put together an easy to follow guide for everything you need to know about the fourth largest canary island, which is located around 77 miles (125 kilometres) off the coast of africa.we specialise in giving you all the information required to plan and prepare for that all-important holiday. and, above all, where are you going to stay?
