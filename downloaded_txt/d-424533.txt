the “official” stinson beach 











this is the “official” stinson beach site for visiting friends and family. it is intended to keep everyone up to date on stinson beach. i hope that you enjoy it.stinson beach is one of northern california’s best kept secrets. it’s located about 20 miles nw of san francisco alongside mt tamalpais state park. being only a 35 minute trip from the golden gate bridge, stinson beach is a very popular day trip for residents and tourists of the san francisco bay area.the following pages contain information about the area as well as the latest photographs of our activities. 





this website is maintained by sagapixel, a website design company. our founder spent much of his childhood visiting stinson beach; when this website went down, we decided to put up a new and improved mobile-friendly version back up and host it at our own expense. we hope you enjoy it.
