core certification programs
core myofascial therapy is a 48-hour certification program that focuses on improving structural alignment, balance, flexibility and movement patterns, while reducing chronic pain and soft-tissue restrictions. core "myo" is practiced as a full-body technique in either 60-minute or 90-minute sessions. certification in core myofascial therapy is a prerequisite for the study of core structural integration. certification is also available through attendance of the xpecore sports bodywork mentorship program.
core structural integration is a 350-hour certification program in the study of the 10 sessions of structural integration. this program teaches the theory, anatomy, clinical strategies and treatment protocols of region-specific 90-minute sessions that work with extrinsic and intrinsic layers of fascia and musculature. core "structural" is the deepest, most profound bodywork system that has been developed in the 65 year history of the discipline of structural integration. 
core sports & performance bodywork is a 24-hour certification program that utilizes the foundational techniques of core myofascial therapy to improve the recuperation time and performance levels of elite athletes during their intensive training and competition periods. core "sports" has been used for international olympic athletes, professional athletes, college teams, and performance specialists in dance and theater.
core institute ce programs are sponsored worldwide by leading state and national professional associations, massage therapy schools, and international ce providers. 
core institute is approved as a ce provider by the florida board of massage therapy and the national certification board of therapeutic massage & bodywork.
