	 strawberry jelly
	 
    


strawberry jellyone of classic kiddies’ all time favorite. i always have some jelly in the fridge when i was a kid. i buy packs of “jelly ace” and store in fridge. i can easily be bribed with a pack of jelly. those were the days when things are not so complicated! i didn’t realize that it is that easy to make! now, i can have loads of flavors! i should have known this before eyyh? i guess i wasn’t that smart and clever yet!ingredients:1 pack (24 g) unflavored gulaman powder2 teaspoons strawberry flavoring½ teaspoon red coloring1 liter water2 cups sugarprocedure:in a casserole, put 1 liter of water (not warm or hot), add sugar, flavoring and coloring. stir until sugar is completely dissolved. gradually sprinkle 1 pack of gulaman powder while stirring constantly until gulaman has completely dissolved. stand for 5 to 10 minutes. heat the mixture and stir constantly until it thickens and comes to a near boil. remove from heat and pour into molding container.

	 stewed pear
	 
    


stewed pearthe original recipe from a dutch cookbook requires blackcurrant liqueur which, honestly i don’t know, i  like gin, so i put gin instead.  whisky would have been better i think coz its quite sharper taste than gin but i don’t have. i used corn flour instead of potato flour as suggested in the recipe.  i love the vibrant color of this dessert!!  its my first time doing this, but its good…  hmmm, i ‘m gonna keep this one! or maybe even try with other fruit like apple, which absorbs flavor a lot.ingredients :4 pears4 cloves3 cinnamon sticks5 tablespoons sugar200 ml red wine50 ml gin1 tablespoon corn flourlemon zestpreparation:peel the pears and leave them whole.  in a medium size saucepan, mix red wine, sugar, cinnamon sticks and lemon zest. add the pears into the mixture then add enough water just to cover the pears. bring to boil and leave to simmer, covered for 2 ½ hours until tender.to serve, lift the pears carefully out of the pan. pass the remaining liquid through a fine sift to get rid of sediments.  mix 1 tablespoon of corn flour with the pear juice and bring to boil stirring all the while with a wisk until the wine sauce thickens.  pour this over the stewed pears and serve individually hot or cold.

	 chocolate cake
	 
    


chocolate cake2 cups cake flour (sifted)1 ½ cups cocoa powder (sifted)100 g. butter1 cup sugar (sifted)1 cup water2 t. coffee3 eggs1 tsp baking powder1 tsp baking sodachocolate icing2 bars dark unsweetened chocolate3 t. butterprocedure:preheat oven to 200 degrees c. prepare the baking pan. combine flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and baking soda. dissolve coffee in water and set aside. in a separate mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar until well blended, add eggs one by one while continue beating, and add the flour mixture to the egg mixture, add the coffee mixture. continue beating until smooth. pour the mixture into the pan and bake for 20 to 30 minutes. let cool in a cooling rack and prepare the icing.to prepare chocolate icing:in a deep saucepan, boil 2-3 cups water. cut the bars into smaller cubes. in heatproof mixing bowl or saucepan put the butter and chopped chocolate and place the saucepan over the boiling water. the chocolate must melt gently with the heat of the steam coming from the boiling water underneath. this is to avoid direct heat to the chocolate coz it easily burns. when the butter and chocolate has melted, mix thoroughly until well combined.when the cake has completely cooled, invert the cake and divide into two layers. cover the first layer with the icing and place the other layer. spread the remaining icing on the top layer.i lost the recipe i used to follow for chocolate cake, and all of a sudden i am craving to have a bite of something chocolaty with dark coffe... well, i made one, i wasnt sure if the proportion would work, but thanks god it did! luckily i took some note, he he..this is one of my favorites!!! with dark coffee please???
