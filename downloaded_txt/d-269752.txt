championing diversity in the outdoors
our work to create champions of nature through education and inspiration cannot be achieved without racial and social justice as well.
we stand in solidarity with those seeking justice and change, and are committed to doing our part to ensure diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility are at the forefront of our work. everyone should feel welcome and safe to enjoy the outdoors.
we recognize we have work to do. it is not news that environmental organizations often lack in diversity, ourselves included. we are not a leader in this movement, but our goal is to be an ally. we are showing up by listening and educating ourselves, as well as taking action to be more inclusive and equitable in our work. in july 2019, we began a multi-year staff training and educational program in diversity, equity and inclusion. we are continuing those necessary and important conversations and applying what we learn in the work we do. we continue to ask ourselves what we can do to combat racism and inequality and are taking steps to diversify our opportunities and programming.
