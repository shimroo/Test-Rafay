about texas hero*:it occurred to me many years ago that the graphic arts community might find useful a digital typeface that mimicked the classic look of nineteenth-century handwriting. conveniently, my mother was then volunteering at the center for american history at the university of texas at austin, my hometown. she made copies of the letters of a few famous texans—houston, austin, travis, lamar, rusk. thomas j. rusk’s penmanship caught my eye as the most accessible of the bunch. i hadn’t realized at the time what a challenge it’d be to render a script face, but the result has, in fact, filled a niche. full release has complete character set.
