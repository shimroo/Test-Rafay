"honesty, service, trust. three main reasons i have entrusted my cars to the sports car shop since 1985. i know that i can rely on them to expertly repair and service my vehicles, using quality parts and stand behind the work they do."
  







  pam nelson

"i hit a tire on the freeway and damaged the rain guard under the car. i managed to limp into the shop and they instantly put my car up on the rack and repaired it. never even charged me a cent. super nice people. highly recommend."

"a relaxed no bs shop with extremely nice employees. brought in (was towed in haha) my 1998 bmw 528i for a new alternator and valve cover gasket replacement and could not be happier about how i was treated. my car has found a new home."
