our story













at its core, barndiva is a family business. jil and geoffrey hales, and their son lukka feldman opened the healdsburg restaurant in 2004, well before the town became a renowned travel destination at the very heart of northern california wine culture. the family farm in philo, high on a ridge above the pacific, with its heritage orchards and extensive flower gardens, is still the heartbeat of the enterprise.barndiva’s catchphrase "eat the view," resonates now more than ever. over the past two decades barndiva and studio barndiva have grown into beloved destinations for elegant farm to table dining, unique public and private events, weddings, and regenerative corporate events. while fortunate to benefit from healdsburg’s flourishing visitor population, it is the loyalty of the stalwart local population, reflective of the incredible diversity of sonoma and mendocino counties, which is their greatest pride.
