what our members are saying about us:




i have always had excellent interactions with the iucu staff for over 40 years. i love that the credit union is a member-owned non-profit. i had my mortgage and have my heloc and my mastercard there. i love the credit union.
- stephen a.


hometown banking puts my mind at ease. it's very important to me to be able to bank locally and not with an out-of-town, out-of-state, or perhaps even out-of-the-country huge corporation
- kathy f.


i love iucu! i've never had any issues here and everyone is always professional, friendly and very efficient. thank you so much for everything you do!
- tanya d.


the staff is top notch. everyone has been incredibly friendly, professional, and knowledgeable from day one.
- tammy p.


iu credit union is more like a family than a large institution. always welcoming, smiling and helpful to our concerns.
- kathleen y.


staff at all locations are great, i have used all locations in bloomington and have never had a bad experience in 32 years.
- paul l.


all staff that were a part of my loan worked hard to take care of my needs and keep me banking with iucu. i believe they deserve recognition for their hard work to get me and i'm sure many others through the loan process.
- jarod t.


i enjoy the first name attention i get when i'm there. that's important in a client relationship. customer satisfaction at its best.
- richard c.


i recommend the iu credit union to all my friends.
- sally c.
