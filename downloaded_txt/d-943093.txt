	 no need for uber in salem
	 
    






just
as in mexico, salem now suffers from numerous taxi service businesses.  we also enjoy an over abundance of limo services and i suspect that as usual a good number of them as the taxis
services

are involved with the sex trades where cash is preferred and mum is the word.   



most are using older and
dirty chrysler minivans and i know some
to be single-car operators where the drivers take their own calls.  it’s also common to see drivers smoking in their
taxis with or without fares on board.



and i
have seen one operator doing his own brake repair work
on the parking lot of a dumpy motel
where he resides in mexalem.



in the past ten years i have watched as our once neat, clean andwell behaved city has steadily degraded itself into a third world level society.  most of that change has been brought about by
the 

influx of illegal aliens who have become the majority in several areas of town where mexican style culture and morals are usual.

	 they aren't all that stupid!
	 
    






i
suspect that many of those protesting the shooting in furgeson well understand the facts surrounding the case that prove officer wilson is innocent of any crime.



i
also suspect that most of them well understand that violence or just a threat
of violence can deliver them even greater un-earned government benefits.

	 athletic supporters everywhere!
	 
    






it’s amazing to see all the ‘o’ flags and signs
everywhere supporting the oregon ducks.



proof again that everybody loves a winner as
promoted by the media.



and that also the reason kitzhaber won the
election over richardson as most in the media promoted dr. no as the winner and
overlooked his transgressions as if they were just another insignificant post-game
event that occurred in the locker room.

	 the absurdity of raising minimum wages! 
	 
    






absurdity best defines the liberal’s
effort to
help lower-income earners improve to their
economic ability by raising the minimum wage.



this while at the same time welcoming even more low-skilled
illegal aliens to invade the us who are known
to accept lower wages, to work in
unsafe conditions and almost
never demand over-time when paid in cash.



the better way is to close the border to the illegal intruders and start deporting those here until the demand for low-skilled labor is greater than the supply and to the point wages begin to increase.

	 what's to come next!
	 
    






we
have learned how odot had made plans for after the election to
deliver driver privilege licenses to illegal aliens and have since ended
the effort with oregon ballot measure 88 winning. 



my
questions is, have the oregon state police made any plans to deal
with the illegal aliens certain to come violence or what the liberals
call civil disobedience? 



we
have seen them gathered on our capitol steps before, loudly voicing
their demands, parading their mexican flags and i suspect we
will see that again and more in our neighborhoods when our legislature reconvenes.

	 more to the story on oregon’s recent ballot measure 88’s success.
	 
    


i understand the measure to deny illegal aliens
from gaining oregon diver permits was supported at a 2 to 1 margin of
voters across the state which is amazing as the effort was out funded
by a $ ratio of 11 to 1. 



proof again that business wants to keep a malleable
and exploitable work force whereas the average voter-citizen
does not and that because the trade-offs run counter to maintaining our
advanced society.



another interesting point is how portlanders were
supportive of giving illegals driving privileges.  i suspect that because most illegal aliens can’t afford housing in portland and as a
result residents there have not yet suffered the harm their 3rd
world culture inflicts on a community as others living outside of the city have.
