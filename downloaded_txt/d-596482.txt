quoteworthy



the links between ecosystem and human health are many and obvious: the value in wetlands of filtering pollutants out of groundwater aquifers; the potential future medical use of different plants’ genetic material; the human health effects of heavy metal accumulation in fish and shellfish. it is clear that healthy ecosystems provide the underpinnings for the long-term health of economics and societies.
