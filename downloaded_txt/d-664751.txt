our history



the ceilidh place in ullapool grew out of broomview cottage and was started in 1970 by the actor robert urquhart, who was born there in 1921.




he started a small café in the boatshed with aspirations that it became a place for eating, meeting, talking and singing. a place to be.




there were no guarantees, no promises, but maybe life could change here; that was the hope. there were magical nights when musicians played and hearts were broken. there were magical days when the summer sun shone on ‘til midnight. there was, it seemed, all of life in one small ceilidh place.
