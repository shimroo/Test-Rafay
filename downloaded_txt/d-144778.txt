renovation tips






busting the budget is everyone's biggest fear when it comes to renovation. the universal truth about renovations is that every little thing adds up. so save a little here, save a little there, and pretty soon you're talking about real money. 
 get your dream home at a price you can afford without cheaping out. with some strategic thinking about design, materials, and timing, you can cut costs without cutting corners.


strategic design
cut costs - not corners





 increase efficiency, not size.
if you can reorganize and equip your kitchen for maximum utility, you may not need to blow out the walls to gain square footage.
start by outfitting cabinets with upgrades like dividers, pullout pot trays, and lazy susans. replace spacehogging shelves with cabinetheight pullout drawers 8 inches wide, containing racks for canned goods and other items. 


increase efficiency
maximize the utility of space





 before cutting a big hole in the side of your house and rearranging the framing, consider less invasiveand less expensiveways of capturing light. to brighten up a windowless bath or hallway, for instance, you can install a "light tube" which slips between roof rafters and funnels sunshine down into the living space.
cost to add a doublepane insulated window: $1,500 - cost for a light tube: $500.


reduce energy costs
bring natural light into the home





 when it comes to things like flooring, check the clearance aisles at flooring suppliers. you can also check local building supply auctions for low cost scratchanddent, misordered custom items, or new overstock supplies. you may find inexpensive upgrades or lower cost flooring similar to what you need that fits perfectly with your decor.
you can also ask your agent advocate if he or she has stock left over from other jobs.
