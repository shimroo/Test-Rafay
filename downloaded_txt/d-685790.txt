the putnam humane society is a not for profit animal shelter located in putnam county, ny. we were founded in 1957 as one of the first no-kill shelters in the country by marjorie jenkins who started the society in a small barn on nichols street. we have since moved to our current location on old route 6 behind putnam plaza and have expanded and improved throughout the years, and continue to grow to meet the needs of our community and pet population as funds permit.

phs has developed a great resource page to help you! from links to websites to post pictures of your pet, advice on who to notify or call, and what to do to help prevent a lost pet, like micro-chipping and making sure your pet is wearing their id tags and vaccination tags. we at phs developed this page for you, knowing that it is a very stressful time, and we are here to help. click here to learn more!
