  this website is maintained by larry d. smith, historian, registrar and newsletter editor for the frontier patriots chapter, sar, (and a devoted native son of mother bedford).

  much of the information presented in this website is excerpted from the books, mother bedford and the american revolutionary war, and 150th anniversary history of blair county, pennsylvania, published by closson press. if you are interested in history and want to purchase books on history, please visit their website at (www.clossonpress.com).
  this site should be able to be viewed equally well with internet explorer, mozilla foxfire, google chrome, safari, opera, maxthon cloud, torch, avant and seamonkey. note: certain of the "powder horn" icons provide live links to additional pages. when you hover your cursor over an icon or button, if it changes from an arrow to a pointing finger hand, it is a live link to another page.
  may 2022 note: this website was created twenty-three years ago (1999), and although having since been updated to newer html and css standards, its pages were not made 'responsive' and capable of reducing down to accommodate being read on cellphones due to my busy schedule. for the past seven years i was writing a book (bedford county, pennsylvania ~ two and one-half centuries in the making) and chaired the sestercentennial (250th) anniversary of bedford county, pennsylvania for 2021. with the conclusion of the sestercentennial activities at the end of 2021, i can now foresee being able to update this website. your patience is requested while the changes are being made. 
 


 




   mother bedford refers to a part of the region in south-central pennsylvania which was erected as a county on 09 march 1771 out of lands obtained by treaty from the indians in 1754 and 1768. the region had originally been formed as barree, bedford, colerain and cumberland valley townships within cumberland county (in 1767).
   when bedford county was erected out of cumberland county in 1771, she encompassed the present-day counties of huntingdon, fulton, blair, bedford, cambria, somerset, westmoreland, fayette, washington and greene, along with portions of the present-day counties of centre, indiana, armstrong, allegheny and beaver.
   in 1773 the county of westmoreland was erected out of the western half of bedford. the county which retained the name of bedford was left with the region encompasssed by present-day huntingdon, fulton, blair, bedford, cambria and somerset counties. it is that region that is mother bedford.
