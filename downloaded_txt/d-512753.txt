i am on fire!!





i can't believe i am blogging so much lately. it is so exciting! okay, so one of my 2 (two) dresses i bought for steeplechase arrived today. the thing is that i bought one i kind of like, and one i really like. the one i kinda like arrived today, and i think i might be in love with it a little bit. if i could marry it, i just might. so this worries me, because i am not good with decisions.got a pretty exciting phone call yesterday.  seems a very fab department store wants to buy lots of our cards (retail mind you, b/c it's not a resale thing) for an event they are having.  sometimes it's quite nice to make cards with shoes on them  :)tonight is wednesday.  tony bennett will be on american idol and probably so will sanjaya.  (sigh) oh, didja know?  melinda doolittle is from brentwood, tn.  and i do believe that i live in brentwood, tn (only about 10 minutes from nashville).  i swear, fame surrounds me.  i can't help it.

an october road quickie





has anyone caught the new abc show 'october road'?  it has been coming on after grey's anatomy,which i know everyone in america watches, so i'm sure you have heard about it.  well, i have been watching it the last couple of weeks.  i have been dissapointed.  i don't know what i was expecting, but the acting and dialogue is kind of cheesy i think.  and predictable.  so, my friend rings me up and asks me if i have seen it and what did i think of it?  she hasn't watched it yet, but wanted to know what it was about, etc.  i told her the gist and what i thought.  i also explained it like this: "ya know?  it's kind of like the premise of beautiful girls,  (which, btw is the most fabulous movie ever made).  although bg was so, so much better."well, ironically, i was reading korbie's cheat sheet on eonline.com.  and guess what??? the same writer that wrote beautiful girls (scott rosenberg) is writing october road.  i about fell out of my chair.  i mean, what a kawinky-dink! (although not really, because the storylines are somewhat similar minus natalie portman and a piano)  okay, so here in lies the issue: why does october road suck?  beautiful girls is famous for its completely wonderful dialogue and writing.  that is what made the movie - hands down.  so, now that i know this bit of info, i might give october road another chance.  mostly b/c i love beautiful girls, and if this show is anything like it, then it must have promise.  it just needs to hurry up and get it quickly.
