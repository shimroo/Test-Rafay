i have used ships chandelier for boat maintenance for the past 4 years.  my every experience has been a good experience with them.  mack, jake, todd and others have been professional and have done their work with excellence and integrity. … more i am a former port engineer who worked in boat maintenance on river boats in my younger days.  and presently, in my similar-retired days, i captain tour boats on the emerald coast. i am not a novice when it comes to boat maintenance and repair.  i highly recommend this business.   they are leaders in this industry in the panhandle of florida.
captain mark,

i’ve been looking for a good place between fort walton beach and panama city to take my boat when repairs are needed.  i found a few average places and a few below average places over the years.  i finally found a boat mechanic/repair shop … more that i can trust!  the ships chandler in destin exceeded every expectation i had!  they are the real deal!   i highly recommend them!!
