reserve at bistrot du coin on yelp 

il était une fois…bistrot du coin opened its doors on memorial day in 2000. michel verdon and yannis felix had three words in mind at the time; french, fun, and friendly. three words that would emphasize what bistrot du coin is all about. for over two decades, it has been about enjoying an authentic french meal, surrounded by friends and family in an original french bistrot ambiance. from our homemade cuisine du terroir to our curated wine list, pass our doors, and we will take you to the other side of the atlantic.
