news and updates



i blog intermittently at oxford blog and post links to my link blog pathologically polymathic (also available on facebook and twitter).  and i'm still writing book reviews, though not as many as i once did.

nothing else gets updated much.  the search (left) is probably the easiest way to find anything.




while in the uk i've visited 
western turkey,
switzerland
and
east africa.

 i've built a $150
computer as a "smart nas" to hold our backups.  i've built
a quiet computer for camilla and got myself an acer aspire one
netbook.


i have a new site
for travelogues.  

photos and stories from trips to hong kong,
beijing 
and vietnam + cambodia are now complete.
a travelogue from brittany 
is
partly completed.

i've updated my mongolia trip report (2005), adding an account of our experiences during naadam.


writeups of old trips to barrington tops and corang peak and lagoon.
photos and notes from a return to the box vale track.


a quiz: which languages have over 100 million native speakers?
miscellaneous: i have a privacy policy.
