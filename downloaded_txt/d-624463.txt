classic chambered exhaust manufactures a series of  unique mufflers called powersticks -based on the original concept of chambered exhaust that first appeared on high performance gm vehicles of the 1960âs.  chambered exhaust produces a very unique & aggressive note â unlike anything else used in exhaust tuning!  several years ago, the turbo tube muffler went away, a victim of corporate consolidation.  this created a void in the marketplace for a reasonably priced true chambered muffler.â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.until now.
located in the metro detroit area, we manufacture & sell directly to car enthusiasts worldwide â you can buy direct from us â the manufacturer!  we also sell to wholesale automotive distributors, high performance dealers, exhaust jobbers, & special vehicle builders anywhere in the us or canada.   contact us if you are interested in becoming a distributor â we have a program for you.
aside from the technical aspects of exhaust backpressure, flow, sound attenuation, etc., we are also true automotive performance enthusiasts.  owning hemi mopars, trans-am mopars, gtoâs, mach 1âs, amcâs, etc., we are true hands-on musclecar people!  we also have an eye on current & late model vehicles, which are perfect candidates in need of some serious exhaust tuning.  because of todayâs multiple catalysts used on so many applications, sweet v-8 sound is robbed because of so much going on upstream of the muffler.  oval & box muffler designs cannot produce results like true chambered exhaust can.  we can offer experienced advice & technical information about exhaust you may be contemplating.  you can determine if powersticks   are right for your application.
find out why chambered exhaust is so unique & legendary among enthusiasts that have âbeen there.â  also, find out how powersticks  are improved & different than older designs.  chambered exhaust is functional.  our mufflers flow very high cfm, and they sound crisp, sharp, & aggressive.  you now have an alternative in performance to whatâs already out there!
