an ecosystem for the creative classwith 17 apartments, a private courtyard, and reserved parking — all within a convenient walk to fsu, famu, state offices buildings, a publix, and local bars and restaurants—the freight yard is much more than just another apartment complex in downtown tallahassee.  the freight yard is a boutique residence built with a singular vision to provide a home where the next generation of creators and disruptors can thrive.  the vibe is civil, sophisticated and a little bit edgy.  the details matter.  our residents appreciate the oversize doors and windows, the concrete floors throughout that dampen sound, and a design aesthetic that showcases modern craftsmanship and world-class street art. the freight yard never will be party central for undergrads.  it’s a place where creators and thought workers can mingle in a meticulously  designed urban sanctuary that is powered almost entirely by one of tallahassee’s largest solar arrays.  there’s a reason the freight yard has since its launch had 100% occupancy with a waiting list of prospective residents.  we provide something that can’t be found anywhere else in tallahassee:  the perfect refuge for the creative class.
