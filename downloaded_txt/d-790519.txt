“flying for freight runners express was one of the best jobs i ever had, and continues to underpin my career as a professional pilot. freight runners express management really empowers their pilots to meet any demand, from flight planning to customer satisfaction. beyond the operations, mentorship, and career opportunities, freight runners express is a wonderful group of people – five years later, and i still get an invitation to the summer party.”
