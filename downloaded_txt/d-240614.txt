all across north america, people learn that millions of dogs
and cats are in shelters, and that they must spay and neuter their cat or dog...
but spaying and neutering is just as essential for your smaller freinds, and even more important for their health.


























































spay: to remove the ovaries of a female animal.   neuter: to remove the testicles of a male animal (castrate)
 neuter can be used as a unisex term. 'altered' and 'fixed' are other common synonymous terms.
