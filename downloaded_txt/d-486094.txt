gracehill fine art and basketry
i would like to thank the wonderful guests from the last twenty years who contributed to making gracehill b&b a success. i sold my home, the b&b, as a private residence.  for those now looking for a new place to stay, i suggest going to www.smokymountainbb.com.
on a personal note, i’ve built and opened an art gallery in townsend called gracehill fine art and basketry.  it’s located at 110 mountain ave in townsend, tn 37882, a corner lot on hwy 321 and mountain ave across the highway from the gulf gas station.
my new website is www.gracehillart.com, where my artwork is available for sale. it is divided into four categories, basketry, alcohol inks, photography, and a lot of misc!.  if you are hankering for a memento from your time at gracehill, check out the photography link. there you’ll find a couple of dozen of my favorite sunset photos taken from the top veranda at gracehill printed as giclees on canvas. i’d be happy to drop ship one to you! again, thanks for the memories. kathy@
