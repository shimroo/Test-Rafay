thread 'world war three updates'


									
										
		

		
			every war is different. back in 1914 nations formally declared war on each other over the assassination of some prince. it was all very gentlemanly. this war is different. the world is different. this war, call it ww3 or the last war prior to armageddon, is a hybrid war. in actuality, it began imperceptibly with...

thread 'natural home health remedies'


									
										
		

		
			i thought that a thread on natural health remedies would be a good topic to help those coping with colds or flu this winter, as well as covid and other things. this thread if for things that can be made from ingredients at home, or for inexpensive helthful remedies that can be otherwise obtained for treatment of...

thread 'music with a message (positive please)'
