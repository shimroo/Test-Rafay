poor blood circulation problems:
many people have circulation problems. 
it may often feel like it is just a part of the body that is affected, such as your leg circulation, 
or perhaps in the hands, fingers or feet. usually this is just an indicator and in fact often other areas also have blood flow difficulties.
whilst this is often very noticeable in the colder months, but it also happens 
throughout the year. 

having bad circulation not only makes one feel uncomfortable but it can also be a major contributor to some very serious health issues. 
 circulation problems affect people of both sexes and all age ranges, not just as we get older.

if you suffer from any symptoms of reduced blood circulation there are a number of articles on this site, backed by science, which you may find helpful. this is a good one to start with:

there are many ways you can improve this issue and having good blood flow is a fundamental part of maintaining a healthy body. 


a great way to give yourself a boost is by cleansing and detoxing your body
doing a cleanse is one of the 
most important natural health steps you can take.

there are quite a lot of colon and detox products on the market, ranging 
from ineffective one day cleanses all the way up to hard to follow starvation 
methods.
 neither of these two extremes is sensible. a common sense approach is usually the best and it usually turns out to be the most effective method too. our easy to follow, step 
by step program will guide you through from start to finish. this system includes the basic detox 1 & 
2 program, as well as organic nutrition's superfood, supertonic and continues with detox 
3 and 4. here are links for more information:

boosting your immune system:
when your body is healthy, it is better able to fight off illness 
and disease.

you are less prone to falling victim to colds, flu's and other viruses.
the immune system of the body is a fantastic self defence mechanism.
 however, various factors can lead to it becoming weaker. stress, 
poor diet, lack of sleep and other factors make this worse. you can 
improve and boost your immune system.
