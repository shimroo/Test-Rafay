click on the video above to hear a message from dr. vipin garg.
getting a good night's sleep is an essential part of healthy living. still,
	 millions of americans suffer from sleep disorders, such as insomnia, sleep
	 apnea, restless leg syndrome, and narcolepsy, which can make getting enough
	 rest seem impossible. left untreated, sleep disorders can have harmful,
	 even life-threatening effects on health, wellbeing, and safety.
sleep disorders can be treated in a variety of ways once they are identified.
	 depending on the disorder we diagnose, many effective approaches can solve
	 the problem. we recommend an overnight sleep study to pinpoint the exact
	 sleep disorder you have, because listing your symptoms isn’t enough
	 to narrow down the possibilities.
comfortable, convenient location
the trinitas comprehensive sleep disorders center provides a monitored,
	 fully attended diagnostic sleep study designed to rule out physical, non-stress-related
	 symptoms that may prevent restful sleep. our sleep center is conveniently
	 located at the homewood suites by hilton in cranford, new jersey, and
	 is the first-ever hotel-based sleep center in the state. the private,
	 comfortable testing is performed in home-like suites with soft designer
	 sheets, pillows, and a private shower, and all overnight sleep studies
	 include a complimentary breakfast.
our team
sleep-related problems can wreak havoc on your life, but our team can help
	 you achieve what you might think is impossible: a good night's sleep.
	 a team of trained sleep specialists are led by board-certified physician
	 and sleep specialist dr. vipin garg, m.d. state-of-the-art diagnostic
	 sleep studies are performed by specially trained sleep pulmonologists,
	 registered polysomnographers, and licensed, credentialed respiratory therapists.
	 they can quickly diagnose any sleep problem and, working closely with
	 each patient's primary physician, provide expert treatment and follow-up.
