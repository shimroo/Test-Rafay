ssssssssppppppptttttttt!!



sorry i have been slacking on the posts and comments to your blogs...same old shit...busy, busy, busy...add to that about 10 fuck sessions, and you can see why i have been gone! lolso, what to talk about....oh!! i tried the different flavors of nipple lickers that the love bud brought home...can i just say...nasty and fucking gross!!!i applaud the man for trying, but...damn!! whoever makes that shit should be dick slapped...and not in the good way either, like when you are going at it and he starts lightly slapping your hoohaa with his dick......what? who? oh uhmmmm,,,where was i?? oh yeah...they should be beaten is what i am getting at here. just the idea that your man has gone to the trouble of going and getting the nipple lickers is usually enough to get ya going...so, you are hot, he is hot, you are both fucking hot!!foreplay begins...a little rubbing, some licking, a little light slap here and there ...again with the dick slapping, you can see where my mind is at right? lolback to the foreplay...clothes are now completely gone, and, what is that i see??  yes!! he is reaching for the nipple lickers...we are gonna have some fun now!!  he proceeds to squeeze some of the wanton water melons onto my wanton water melons, and...down goes his mouth...he is in it to win it!!!  then, i hear..."bllleeeccccckkkkkkk...what the fuck??!!"followed by"ssssspppppptttttt...sssssppppttt..ahhhkkkkk....uuuugggghhhh...sssssppppptttt!!"not necessarily the most flattering thing to hear going on when he is lapping at your tits huh?so, me being the asshole that i am, i immediately start laughing when i realize that he is gagging and about to puke...laughing and shoving his puky ass away from my tits i should say!love bud dashes out to the bathroom and starts frantically swishing water in his mouth trying to get the taste out.  after about 5 minutes of this, and after i called him a pussy about 10 times...in a sweet, loving way of course...he staggers back to the bedroom.and what does miss brilliant do next??  yep, thats right, i just had to try the shit myself...like his gagging and spitting was not enough evidence...nope, i had to get me some!and................."sssssspppppppppttttttt...ahhhhkkkkk...ssssspppptttt..."and...................repeat the earlier water swishing and name calling, only reverse the roles...gah!! whoever told those people that putting cough syrup into smaller bottles and slapping a "nipple lickers" label on them was a good idea...cause thats exactly what that shit tastes like...nasty, nasty cough syrup!! yuck!!now, he has lived with me long enough to know that it is alright for me to laugh at him, but it is certainly not  alright for him to laugh at me!!! no sir!!for cruelly laughing at me, i made him do 50 push ups...i just happened to be lying under him at the time!! hahahahah when we were done with his punishment, we threw that damn nipple licker shit away...just gives us an excuse to go back to the sex shop and buy something else right??

but, mommmmmm!



hey there, hi there, hooooooooooooooooo there!!so, you all may just have to bail my ass out of jail...no, really!!i may or may not kick the shit out of the 15 year old boy up the street cause he may or may not be spending too much time trying to get close to my 12 year old daughter!!in the world of big people, a 3 year age isn't shit, right?? buttttttttttt...when we are talking about a 15 year old boy and a 12 year old girl, 3 years suddenly seems like 100!my daughter comes home with this sappy, love struck, dreamy look on her face a couple of days ago..."oh mom, ricky is the cutest boy ever!!!"i'm all "that's nice dear.................. hold up!! wait a minute!! isn't ricky that kid who lives in the blue house down the road?""yes" she sighs, all the while with a rapturous look upon her glowing face"isn't that the same little punk who happens to be 15?""nope, uh uh...he is only 13" (there she goes with the first lie...has to be that damn ricky's influence!! lol)"what school does he go to?""wyo...i mean jackson park." ha!! got her little ass!! wyoming park is the high school, and jackson park is the middle school...where she goes."oh, so he's in dustin's grade then huh?" (dustin is my son who is 13 and in 7th grade)"uhhhhmmmm yeah""dustinnnnnnnnnn!!! would you come in here please" i yell through the house, noticing the panicked look come across her formerly glowing face.. hahahahaha don't play with mama girlie, i have been playing the game a lot longer! hahahawell, before dustin could even think about coming into the room, my daughter starts talking so fast, i was sure her head was gonna pop off! lol"ok, ok, he is not really 13, but i reallylikehimandididn'twantyoutotellmenoooooooooooo!"so, little miss liar is grounded and even though i am not gullible enough to believe that i have totally squashed this little crush, threatening to show up at her school in curlers, wearing a bathrobe and her dad's combat boots went a long way towards accomplishing just that!and my kids know damn well that i will totally carry through on my threat! hahahahnever mess with the mama!

"you know, fuck face, i wouldn't be playing fast and loose with that word if you plan on getting anywhere near that word later on tonight!"oh yeah, the love was definately flowing, let me tell ya! hahaha...some couples show their love by giving each other little gifts, some write their partner love poems...not us...we go with calling each other cunty and fuck face...its the kind of love that lasts!! loli have no idea what i was dreaming about...sometimes i can remember my dreams, but i forget most of them.i bitched at the love bud a little bit for that jab about my family too...only i get to talk about them being a bunch of crackwhores and prison pussies!catch ya'll in a bit...wmy
