accessible education
tuition and financial aid
the cost of your education should be simple, authentic, and transparent. that's why beginning in the 2025-26 academic year, tuition for the college of arts & sciences will be $25,990, down from $44,050. 
this new rate pushes back on what has become a confusing industry standard—increasing list prices and providing significant tuition discounts. with a clear price, you can focus on what truly matters: your education and your future.
