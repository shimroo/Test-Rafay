 order requirements 






















liown moving flame® candles






                                manufacturing standards that lead the way.
                liown’s vertically integrated manufacturing leads the led candle category. the candles are made in liown’s state of the art factories and are certified by the leading quality standards organizations.
                

100% refined paraffin wax
                                free of dangerous impurities like lead, often found in candles made from recycled wax, assures consistency in color across multiple production runs.
                

consistency in color of led light
                                led color is customized to match a real burning flame. each led is set to a specific color range to insure consistency from candle to candle.
                

melting/freezing point
                                while there is no industry standard for this, liown has set the melting point at 176° and -20° for freezing.
                why does this matter? lesser quality candles will lose their shape and discolor in 100° weather and freezing will cause cracking in the wax.
