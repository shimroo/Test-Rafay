our menuslocal farms and food artisans provide us with world class ingredients. it’s inspiring to work with the fresh and beautiful produce of the hudson valley. milk, cream, eggs, cheese, maple syrup, honey, bourbon, beef, chicken – all from our neighbors. our food reflects the cultural diversity agnes has adopted over the years. ingredients are local and seasonal whenever possible. photo by kimberly coccagnia.

our cakesthe honey bee cake is our signature dessert. the beautiful soft yellow of the butter cream comes from the vibrant yolks of farm eggs and it is sweetened solely with honey. the cake is lightly scented with orange and the bees are made of chocolate truffle with almond wings and white chocolate stripes. apricot glaze creates the illusion of dripping honey. this is our most popular wedding cake.
