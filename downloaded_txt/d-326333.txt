welcome to angel's hope

 

angel loved life and she loved people. she wanted to make a difference in the world and even though she only had 18 years, she did just that. in an effort to continue what she started and help make her dream a reality, angel's family and friends created angel's hope. this name represents angel perfectly. no matter how tough her fight with cancer, she refused to give up hope. she stayed true to her motto, "refuse to sink." she never gave up; she refused to let cancer sink her.learn more
