war torn





continental drifters and the nationless nation
nick turse
we live on a planet in motion, a world of collision and drift. this was once an earth of super-continents — gondwana, rodinia, pangea. the eastern seaboard of the united states sidled up against west africa, while antarctica cozied up to the opposite side of the african continent. but nothing in this world lasts and the tectonic plates covering the planet are always in motion. suddenly — over the course of hundreds of millions of years — supercontinents cease to be super, breaking into smaller land masses that drift off to the far corners of the world.
more recently, those itinerant continents were carved up by human beings into countries. a couple — china and india — are now home to more than a billion people each. but even modest-sized nations can be massive in their own right. spain and canada, neighbors in pangea hundreds of millions of years ago, now have populations of almost 47 million and nearly 38 million, respectively, making them the 30th and 39th most populous countries on this planet. but together, they’re no larger than a nation-less nation, a state of the stateless that exists only as a state of mind. i’m talking about the victims of conflict now adrift on the margins of our world.
the number of people forcibly displaced by war, persecution, general violence, or human-rights violations last year swelled to a staggering 84 million, according to unhcr, the united nations refugee agency. if they formed their own country, it would be the 17th largest in the world, slightly bigger than iran or germany.  add in those driven across borders by economic desperation and the number balloons past one billion, placing it among the three largest nations on earth.

what will we remember of 2022?





nation (un)building and planet (un)building, american-style
tom engelhardt
let me start 2022 by heading back — way, way back — for a moment.
it’s easy to forget just how long this world has been a dangerous place for human beings. i thought about this recently when i stumbled upon a little memoir my aunt hilda scrawled, decades ago, in a small notebook. in it, she commented in passing: “i was graduated during that horrible flu epidemic of 1919 and got it.” badly enough, it turned out, to mess up her entry into high school. she says little more about it.
still, i was shocked. in all the years when my father and his sister were alive and, from time to time, talked about the past, never had they (or my mother, for that matter) mentioned the disastrous “spanish flu” pandemic of 1918-1920. i hadn’t the slightest idea that anyone in my family had been affected by it. in fact, until i read john barry’s 2005 book, the great influenza, i hadn’t even known that a pandemic devastated america (and the rest of the world) early in the last century — in a fashion remarkably similar to, but even worse than, covid-19 (at least so far) before essentially being tossed out of history and the memory books of most families.
that should stun anyone. after all, at that time, possibly 50 million people died of the waves of that dreaded disease, often in horrific ways, and, even in this country, were sometimes buried in mass graves. meanwhile, some of the controversies we’ve experienced recently over, for instance, masking went on in a similarly bitter fashion then, before that global disaster was chucked away and forgotten. almost no one i know whose parents lived through that nightmare had heard anything about it while growing up.

the war on terror is a success — for terror





terrorist groups have doubled since the passage of the 2001 aumf
nick turse
it began more than two decades ago. on september 20, 2001, president george w. bush declared a “war on terror” and told a joint session of congress (and the american people) that “the course of this conflict is not known, yet its outcome is certain.” if he meant a 20-year slide to defeat in afghanistan, a proliferation of militant groups across the greater middle east and africa, and a never-ending, world-spanning war that, at a minimum, has killed about 300 times the number of people murdered in america on 9/11, then give him credit. he was absolutely right.
days earlier, congress had authorized bush “to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determine[d] planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on september 11, 2001 or harbored such organizations or persons.” by then, it was already evident, as bush said in his address, that al-qaeda was responsible for the attacks. but it was equally clear that he had no intention of conducting a limited campaign. “our war on terror begins with al-qaeda, but it does not end there,” he announced. “it will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped, and defeated.”

climate crisis at the top of the world


global orders and catastrophic change
alfred mccoy

when midnight strikes on new year’s day of 2050, there will be little cause for celebration. there will, of course, be the usual toasts with fine wines in the climate-controlled compounds of the wealthy few. but for most of humanity, it’ll just be another day of adversity bordering on misery — a desperate struggle to find food, water, shelter, and safety.
in the previous decades, storm surges will have swept away coastal barriers erected at enormous cost and rising seas will have flooded the downtowns of major cities that once housed more than 100 million people. relentless waves will pound shorelines around the world, putting villages, towns, and cities at risk.
as several hundred million climate-change refugees in africa, latin america, and south asia fill leaky boats or trudge overland in a desperate search for food and shelter, affluent nations worldwide will be trying to shut their borders even tighter, pushing crowds back with tear gas and gunfire. yet those reluctant host countries, including the united states, won’t faintly be immune from the pain. every summer, in fact, ever more powerful hurricanes, propelled by climate change, will pummel the east and gulf coasts of this country, possibly even forcing the federal government to abandon miami and new orleans to the rising tides. meanwhile, wildfires, already growing in size in 2021, will devastate vast stretches of the west, destroying thousands upon thousands of homes every summer and fall in an ever-expanding fire season.

countdown to world war iii?





it may arrive sooner than you think
michael klare
when the department of defense released its annual report on chinese military strength in early november, one claim generated headlines around the world. by 2030, it suggested, china would probably have 1,000 nuclear warheads — three times more than at present and enough to pose a substantial threat to the united states. as a washington post headline put it, typically enough: “china accelerates nuclear weapons expansion, seeks 1,000 warheads or more, pentagon says.”
the media, however, largely ignored a far more significant claim in that same report: that china would be ready to conduct “intelligentized” warfare by 2027, enabling the chinese to effectively resist any u.s. military response should it decide to invade the island of taiwan, which they view as a renegade province. to the newsmakers of this moment, that might have seemed like far less of a headline-grabber than those future warheads, but the implications couldn’t be more consequential. let me, then, offer you a basic translation of that finding: as the pentagon sees things, be prepared for world war iii to break out any time after january 1, 2027.

welcome to the martians!


our world is increasingly like a science-fiction novel
tom engelhardt

who knew that martians, inside monstrous tripodal machines taller than many buildings, actually ululated, that they made eerily haunting “ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla” sounds? well, let me tell you that they do — or rather did when they were devastating london.
i know that because i recently reread h.g. wells’s 1898 novel war of the worlds, while revisiting an early moment in my own life. admittedly, i wasn’t in london when those martian machines, hooting away, stalked boldly into that city, hungry in the most literal fashion imaginable for human blood. no surprise there, since that was almost a century and a quarter ago. still, at 77, thanks to that book, i was at least able to revisit a moment that had been mine long enough ago to seem almost like fiction.
yes, all those years back i had been reading that very same novel for the very first time under the covers by flashlight. i still remember being gripped, thrilled, and scared, at a time when my parents thought i was asleep. and believe me, if you do that at perhaps age 12 or 13, you really do feel as if you’ve been plunged into a futuristic world from hell, ululations and all.
but of course, scary as it might have been, alone in the dark, to secretly live through the martian desolation of parts of england and the slaughter of countless human beings at their hands (actually, more like the tentacles of octopi), as if they were no more than irritating bugs, i was always aware of another reality as well. after all, there was still the morning (guaranteed to come), my breakfast, my dog jeff, my bus trip to school with my friend jim, my anything-but-exciting ordinary life, and my sense, in the ascendant cold war america of the 1950s, of a future extending to the distant horizon that looked boring as hell, without even a stray martian in sight. (how wrong i would turn out to be from the vietnam war years on!)

is there a doctor in the house?


biden the bold vs. joe the timid
andrew bacevich

is president biden afflicted with the political equivalent of a split personality?  his first several months in office suggest just that possibility.  on the home front, the president’s inclination is clearly to go big.  when it comes to america’s role in the world, however, biden largely hews to pre-trumpian precedent.  so far at least, the administration’s overarching foreign-policy theme is take it slow.
“joe biden is electrifying america like f.d.r.”  so proclaimed the headline of a recent nicholas kristof column in the new york times.  even allowing for a smidgen of hyperbole, the comparison is not without merit.  much like president franklin delano roosevelt during his famous first hundred days in office in the midst of the great depression, biden has launched a flurry of impressively ambitious domestic initiatives in the midst of the great pandemic — an american rescue plan, an american jobs plan, an american families plan, and most recently an environmental restoration program marketed as america the beautiful.

reframing america’s role in the world


the specter of isolationism
andrew bacevich

the so-called age of trump is also an age of instantly forgotten bestselling books, especially ones purporting to provide the inside scoop on what goes on within donald trump’s haphazard and continuously shifting orbit. with metronomic regularity, such gossipy volumes appear, make a splash, and almost as quickly vanish, leaving a mark no more lasting than a trout breaking the surface in a pond.
remember when michael wolff’s fire and fury: inside the trump white house was all the rage? it’s now available in hardcover for $0.99 from online used booksellers. james comey’s higher loyalty also sells for a penny less than a buck.
an additional forty-six cents will get you omarosa manigault newman’s “insider’s account” of her short-lived tenure in that very white house. for the same price, you can acquire sean spicer’s memoir as trump’s press secretary, anthony scaramucci’s rendering of his tumultuous 11-day stint as white house communications director, and corey lewandowski’s “inside story” of the 2016 presidential campaign.

talking tough and carrying a radioactive stick


the nuclearization of american diplomacy
michael klare

the mq-9 reaper, a drone armed with hellfire missiles, has been a workhorse in washington’s forever wars across the greater middle east and africa, but its days could be numbered. according to air force magazine, that service “has grown skeptical that the reaper could hold its own against advanced nations like russia and china, which could shoot the non-stealthy aircraft down or jam its transmissions.” while more advanced drones may be coming, however, the reaper’s still where it’s at. not so surprisingly, then, that plane is now being repurposed to use not just against afghans or iranians or iraqis or somalis, but the chinese.
that fits with the pentagon’s urge to leave those forever wars behind (as tomdispatch regular michael klare, author of all hell breaking loose: the pentagon’s perspective on climate change, has been writing at this site for a surprisingly long time). its top strategists would prefer instead to focus on recreating a nostalgia-filled twenty-first-century version of the cold war. one sign of this: in recent naval exercises off the california coast in which three reapers “performed airstrikes during [a] simulated amphibious assault on san clemente island,” the military unit responsible for those planes sported a dramatic new shoulder patch. it displayed a reaper over a silhouetted all-red map of… well, yes, i guess it must still be “red china.”
and if you don’t consider that ominous, then check out klare’s piece today on the nuclearization — such a term should exist, if it doesn’t already — of american “diplomacy.” tom

murder, he said


america’s maestro of death and destruction
tom engelhardt

yes, when he was running for president, he did indeed say: “i could stand in the middle of fifth avenue and shoot somebody, and i wouldn’t lose any voters, ok? it’s, like, incredible.”
then he won — and this november 3rd (or thereafter), whether he wins or loses, we’re likely to find out that, when it comes to his base, he was right. he may not have lost a vote. yes, donald trump is indeed a murderer, but here’s where his prediction fell desperately short: as president, he’s proven to be anything but a smalltime killer. it wasn’t as if he went out one day, on new york city’s fifth avenue or even in kenosha, wisconsin, and shot a couple of people.
nothing so minimalist for the donald! nor is it as if, say, he had ploughed “the beast” (as his presidential cadillac is known) into a crowd of black lives matter protesters, as so many other drivers have done this year. let’s face it: that’s for his apprentices, not the showman himself. after all, donald j. trump has proven to be america’s twenty-first-century maestro of death and destruction, the p.t. barnum of, as he put it predictively enough in his inaugural address, “american carnage.” in fact, he’s been a master of carnage in a way no one could then have imagined.

this vanishing moment and our vanishing future


john hersey, hiroshima, and the end of world
nick turse

it was the end of the world, but if you didn’t live in hiroshima or nagasaki, you didn’t know it. not in 1945 anyway. one man, john hersey, brought that reality to americans in an unforgettable fashion in a classic 1946 report in the new yorker magazine on what happened under that first wartime mushroom cloud. when i read it in book form as a young man — and i did so for a personal reason — it stunned me. hersey was the master of my college at yale when i was an undergraduate and he was remarkably kind to me. that report of his from hiroshima would haunt me for the rest of my life.
in 1982, i actually visited that city. i was then an editor at the publishing house pantheon books. i had grown up in a 1950s world in which schoolchildren “ducked and covered” (diving under our desks) in drills to learn how to protect ourselves — i know it sounds ridiculous today — should russian nuclear weapons hit new york, the city i lived in. yellow signs indicating air-raid shelters were then commonplace on the streets. in those years, people not in cities were building their own personal fallout shelters, stocked with food, and some even threatened to shoot anyone who tried to join them there as the missiles descended. (a friend of mine remembers just such a threat, delivered by one of his schoolmates about his father’s shelter.)
we were, in other words, in a cold war world that always seemed to be teetering at the edge of the apocalyptic. and yet here was the strange thing: with the obvious exception of hersey’s book, there were still, in those years, remarkably few ways to see under those mushroom clouds that had destroyed the cities of hiroshima and nagasaki.

fire and fury like the world has never seen


2020 version 
tom engelhardt

it was august 2017 and donald trump had not yet warmed up to kim jong-un, north korea’s portly dictator. in fact, in typical trumpian fashion, he was pissed at the korean leader and, no less typically, he lashed out verbally, threatening that country with a literal hell on earth. as he put it, “they will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.” and then, just to make his point more personally, he complained about kim himself, “he has been very threatening beyond a normal state.”
only a year and a half later, our asteroidal president would, of course, say of that same man, “we fell in love.” still, that threat by an american leader to — it was obvious — launch a nuclear strike for the first time since hiroshima and nagasaki were nearly obliterated in august 1945 was memorable. the phrase would, in fact, become the title of a 2018 bestselling book, fire and fury: inside the trump white house, by journalist michael wolff. two years later, amid so many other threatening phrases from this president, “fire and fury” has, however, been left in history’s dustbin, largely forgotten by the world.

patton and westy meet in a bar


a play of many parts in one act
andrew bacevich

it’s only mid-afternoon and army lieutenant general victor constant has already had a bad day.1 soon after he arrived at the office at 0700, the chief2 had called. “come see me. we need to talk.”
the call was not unexpected. any day now, potus3 will announce the next four-star to command the war effort in afghanistan — how many have there been? — and constant felt certain that he’d be tapped for the job. he’d certainly earned it. multiple tours in iraq and afghanistan and, worse still, at the pentagon. if anyone deserved that fourth star, he did.
unfortunately, the chief sees things differently. “time’s up, vic. i need you to retire.” thirty-three years of service and this is what you get: your walking papers, with maybe a medal thrown in.

fourth world


or american carnage from a pandemic president
tom engelhardt

the year was 1991 and the united states was suddenly the globe’s lone superpower, its ultimate hyperpower, the last and greatest of its kind, the soon-to-be-indispensable nation. the only one left — alone, utterly alone and triumphant atop the world.
who could have asked for more? or better? it had been a cold war fantasy of the first order — until that other superpower, the soviet union, imploded. in fact, even that doesn’t catch the true shock of the moment, since washington’s leaders simply hadn’t imagined a world in which the cold war could ever truly end.
now, go ahead, blame me. in this pandemic moment that should perhaps be considered a sign of a burning, sickening future to come, i’m stoking your nostalgia for better times. admittedly, even that past was, in truth, a fantasy of the first (or perhaps last) order. after all, in retrospect, that mighty, resplendent, lone superpower, victorious beyond the wildest dreams of its political elite, was already about to embark on its own path of decline. enwreathed in triumph, it, too, would be heading for the exits, even if so much more slowly than the soviet union.

robot generals


will they make better decisions than humans -- or worse?
michael klare

with covid-19 incapacitating startling numbers of u.s. service members and modern weapons proving increasingly lethal, the american military is relying ever more frequently on intelligent robots to conduct hazardous combat operations. such devices, known in the military as “autonomous weapons systems,” include robotic sentries, battlefield-surveillance drones, and autonomous submarines. so far, in other words, robotic devices are merely replacing standard weaponry on conventional battlefields. now, however, in a giant leap of faith, the pentagon is seeking to take this process to an entirely new level — by replacing not just ordinary soldiers and their weapons, but potentially admirals and generals with robotic systems.
admittedly, those systems are still in the development stage, but the pentagon is now rushing their future deployment as a matter of national urgency. every component of a modern general staff — including battle planning, intelligence-gathering, logistics, communications, and decision-making — is, according to the pentagon’s latest plans, to be turned over to complex arrangements of sensors, computers, and software. all these will then be integrated into a “system of systems,” now dubbed the joint all-domain command-and-control, or jadc2 (since acronyms remain the essence of military life). eventually, that amalgam of systems may indeed assume most of the functions currently performed by american generals and their senior staff officers.
the notion of using machines to make command-level decisions is not, of course, an entirely new one. it has, in truth, been a long time coming. during the cold war, following the introduction of intercontinental ballistic missiles (icbms) with extremely short flight times, both military strategists and science-fiction writers began to imagine mechanical systems that would control such nuclear weaponry in the event of human incapacity.

about the american empire project
americans have long believed that the very notion of empire is an offense against our democratic heritage, yet in recent months, these two words — american empire — have been on everyone's lips. at this moment of unprecedented economic and military strength, the leaders of the united states have embraced imperial ambitions openly. how did we get to this point? and what lies down the road?
