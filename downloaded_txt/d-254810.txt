2025 chicago auto show vw id.buzz drive preview

feb. 6, 2025 chicago:  vw opened its 2025 chicago auto show booth for the show’s press preview today.  this dress rehearsal is a teaser, wetting appetites for consumer show.  the cas’s public show begins saturday february 8 and runs through monday february 17.  show goers can ride in one of three electric vw models.  two are id. buzz vans and the other the id.4 suv.

earlier this week, vw announced initial pricing for the 2025 id.4.  production of this ev restarts at vw’s chattanooga factory with the rear-drive pro’s 82-kwh model’s msrp of $46,520 including destination.

meanwhile, cas goers can examine the all-new vw tiguan.  it’s on the booth’s raised platform.  its interior looks richer than the current tiguan.

2024 vw taos 4motion sel: small suv; big surprises

vw’s taos suv, wears rugged exterior cladding. these embellishments decorate a car’s architecture.  4motion sel, lets you select driving modes, plus get soft-roading traction aids.
the taos straddles the size gap between subcompact and compact suvs.  it has supportive seating plus a commodious cargo bay.  the rear seat’s legroom rivals vw’s larger tiguan.
vw supplies a turbocharged, 158-hp 1.5-liter mill.  it’s epa rated 27-mpg combined, 24 city and 32 highway.  i observed 26 mpg overall.
4motion is vw-speak for all-wheel-drive.  it includes a seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox (dsg), a fully independent rear suspension and goodyear 235/45r19 tires.
vw’s dsg is like dr. jekyll and mr. hyde.  touch the go pedal, and maybe mr. hyde responds with a polite sense of urgency followed by a smooth flow of power.
dr. jekyll, however, can appear as rough cog swapping and clutch modulation.  sometimes the taos jolts forward with a light foot on the go pedal.  when you’re cornering, the taos sometimes stumbles through three gear changes.  finally, the taos can rudely dump its “clutch” at each downshift.
tender drivers might find the vehicle’s nonlinear launches and gear shuffling disconcerting.  or they might giggle with delight—thinking they’re piloting a track-tuned dodge hellcat.
for 2024, vw’s iq.drive driver assist suite is standard on all trims.  this includes lane-keep assist and adaptive cruise control.  sel trim offers leather-clad heated, ventilated seating, a panoramic sunroof, beatsaudio sound and an eight-inch infotainment touchscreen.  interior stitch-work, contrasting materials and ambient led lighting, add panache to an otherwise plasticky interior.  the tab is $33,515.
vw offsets the ordinary bits with a hemmed headliner and soft-touch front door cards with densely padded armrests.  it even routes cold air to the wireless-phone charging alcove.
in the back, the split-folding rear seatbacks have a center pass-thru. rear riders get face vents and a single usb-c port.
vw’s driver interface is frustrating.  for example, the taos doesn’t have an instrument-panel illumination knob.  instead, you must worm your way into the infotainment screen’s menu(s).  slide your ungloved finger downward on this screen and the ip lighting touch slider appears while driving.
if you’re a steering wheel columbus, use your phone’s app.  i found vw’s bluetooth phone pairing problematic.  several times it “lost” my android phone, requiring me to re-link.  vw’s navigation setup is awful.  it spits out bogus addresses.  then, vw’s navigator sends you to the wrong location.  for example, it might route you one-block west of the screen’s destination.
pick sport mode and the tiller’s effort increases.  body roll is suppressed and the taos appears well planted.  you’ll find it’s choppy on heaved highways.  this reduces confidence.
those seeking a tidy ride for an enchanted drive in new mexico viewing its sites through a panoramic sunroof might find the taos alluring.  beware, the taos, like a striped hopi koshare, can be a trickster.
