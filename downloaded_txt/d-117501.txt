      ready for them."

      lessen it."

no farewell words were 
            spoken,
no time to say goodbye,
you were gone before we knew 
            it,
and only god knows why.
 
if tears could build a 
            stairway,
and memories a lane,
i'd walk right up to 
            heaven,
and bring you back 
again.

please see the letter 
            that was sent to my husband by our health care insurance company a 
            couple of days after my surgery.
