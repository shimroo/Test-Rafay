4746 n. racine avenue
chicago, il 60640

located in chicago’s historic uptown theater district, the riviera theatre has been a central part of chicago’s entertainment scene for over 100 years.
completed in 1917 by architects george and c.w. rapp (rapp & rapp), it was built as a movie theater for the balaban & katz chain. nearly 50 years ago, jam productions christened the theatre with its first concert, supertramp. in the years since, the riviera has hosted many of the world’s greatest performers and has established itself as one of chicago’s premier concert and special events venues.
its grand design and beauty make it a perfect location for a variety of events.
