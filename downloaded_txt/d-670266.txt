 the stories in these can't possibly live up to the promise of their covers....babelfish translates the middle one to "pearl necklace for a blond pussy". my! that can't be right. current mood: uncomfortable

 stuff from storage!i recently went to northern washington and got a load of stuff out of storage. i'd left it there for ten years and i found that i had stored a bunch of junk that i can't imagine the most schizophrenic street-dwelling magpie would keep in his shopping cart. but, among the crap, some real gems.there was this grocery bag full of my old stereoviews (polaroid, standard cards and hand-made viewmaster reels) and a tin full of zoetrope strips i made about 15 years ago. buried in the bag of 3d stuff, i found these 3 stereo shots i took of wichita kansas' famous robot superman. everyday for decades, good old robot superman was wheeled out on a dolly and made to wave a "come in-we're open" sign at passing traffic in front of joe's seat cover and car wash. before he assumed this mighty responsibility, he was a simple robot flagman placed on highways to alert motorists to road work ahead, but whose rather mechanical wave failed to move many drivers to slow down much (who cares if you run down a mannequin). you can see a very similar one in action below:the robot flagman program was scrapped, but our man was saved and remade into a new and powerful supershill for a major mid-western car wash!                                              we love you robot superman!it all seems like an old japanese cartoon,batfatty.strangers comment please.
