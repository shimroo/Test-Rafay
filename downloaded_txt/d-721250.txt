what started on an airplane as a conversation between a 12-year-old boy from connecticut and a mississippi businessman led to the creation of mississippi, believe it!™ 



the boy asked rick looser, coo of the cirlot agency, if he, “still saw the kkk on the streets every day” … and whether or not he “hates all black people.” this stunning revelation was the catalyst to create the campaign, which combats the erroneous stereotypes that plague mississippi. the cirlot agency designed mississippi, believe it!™, pro bono, to inform and educate the world about the accomplishments, wonderful people, aspects and facts associated with the state of mississippi. the campaign takes common mississippi stereotypes and twists them to reveal the truth about the state.
