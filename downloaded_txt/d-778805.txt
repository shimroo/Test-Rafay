styles and styles of wedding clothes 

 

most wedding dresses are formal, but some styles have a more casual feel. a ball gown with cathedral-length veil is considered fanciest, and most wedding dresses are made of silk, tulle, lace, or satin. the difference between daytime and evening wear is typically subtle, though a sprinkling of sparkle is acceptable during the day. strapless necklines are typically preferred for evening events, but a strapless dress may also be appropriate for a daytime event.
less-formal weddings
a less-formal wedding is a wedding in which the dress code is semi-formal and has dressy and casual elements. this kind of wedding is a popular option for brides and grooms as it allows women to wear a floor-length gown or a cocktail dress that is just above the knee. men can wear a suit and tie or a more casual jacket and a shirt.
the style of a less-formal wedding varies according to the wedding location and the weather. in a summer wedding, a sundress or a cocktail dress is appropriate, as is a strapless dress.
semiformal to informal events
