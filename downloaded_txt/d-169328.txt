welcome to the website of the
international association of insurance supervisors (iais) 



established in 1994, the iais is a voluntary membership organisation of insurance supervisors and regulators from more than 200 jurisdictions, constituting 97% of the world’s insurance premiums. it is the global standard-setting body responsible for developing and assisting in the implementation of principles, standards and guidance as well as supporting material for the supervision of the insurance sector. the iais mission is to promote effective and globally consistent supervision of the insurance industry in order to develop and maintain fair, safe and stable insurance markets for the benefit and protection of policyholders; and to contribute to global financial stability. 











highlights 











icps and comframe 



the insurance core principles form the globally accepted framework for insurance supervision. comframe builds on the icps and focuses on the group-wide supervision of internationally active insurance groups. together these support the protection of policyholders and promote the stability of the global financial system. 







ics 



the insurance capital standard (ics) has been developed as a consolidated group-wide capital standard for  internationally active insurance groups and forms the quantitative element of comframe. it consists of three components: valuation, qualifying capital resources, and a standard method for the ics capital requirement. 







climate risk 



climate risk is a key theme within the iais strategic plan. iais’ work on addressing the risks from climate change spans across many of our activities, ranging from financial stability risk assessment, developing supervisory and supporting material and capacity building. 











holistic framework 



the holistic framework for the assessment and mitigation of systemic risk in the insurance sector was adopted in november 2019 and is an integrated set of supervisory policy measures, a global monitoring exercise and implementation assessment activities. 







iais annual conference 2024 



the iais welcomed over 500 participants from more than 105 jurisdictions to the annual conference 2024 on 5-6 december in cape town, south africa.watch the session replays, read the summaries and view the photos! 







gimar​ 



the global insurance market report (gimar) is an annual report on the outcomes of the global monitoring exercise, which is aimed at assessing global insurance market trends and developments and detecting the possible build-up of systemic risk in the global insurance sector.
