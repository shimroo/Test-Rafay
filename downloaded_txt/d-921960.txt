the most terrifying music genre the world has ever seen





colonel ryszard kuklinski with texas a&m cadetsinvented by ryszard "crunk king" kuklinski (the grandson of an infamous polish cold war spy of the same name), crunkczar, which sounds a bit like polish donk, is a terrifying new genre that makes ravers lose control of their bodies. the drug of choice is a pharmacy technician cocktail of carfentanyl, a downer that's approximately 10,000 times more potent than morphine, and dexedrine, a powerful amphetamine. (young fans opt for something slightly less harmful: a mixture of red bull and sherbert, referred to as "crunk gunk".)some people will break both their arms and continue dancing all night as if nothing has happened. also, numerous cases have been reported of people dancing so fast that their heart gives in and they drop dead on the dancefloor.download:  lil wayne, "a milli (ryszard kuklinski remix)at one rave at the end of last year, when the above song was pitched up to +16, three people dropped dead before the track had finished.full story over on guardian.co.uk/music.

burnley's buzzin'





the people at vbs recently travelled to burnley to meet with donk's main man, and a personal hero of mine, mc grimzie. this guy's like snow multiplied by bernard manning, to the power of that "louish walsh" [sic] x factor guy.if you haven't heard "sexy nun", his x-rated ballad which describes in sickening detail his seduction and rape of a lady of the cloth, i implore you to go and listen to it now. it's utterly offensive in every way. vbs got some footage of him performing an a cappella version of it in a church but it unfortunately didn't make the final cut.he really is a hero of mine, though. he's a rule breaker, he's a risk taker/ cookin' up rhymes as quick as a baker (makes bread). sorry, i just broke into a freestyle rap there. i do apologise.

attempted murderers' cribs: part one





circumcision, aspiring gangster-style.this just in from my friend ted: "i've met the attempted murderer in that documentary on your fader column. i moved into his old house in clapton park estate about eight years ago. he had photos of himself holding knives lying around. lots of gaunt, wild-eyed people kept calling by asking for him and transport for london sent about 20 letters addressed to him during the two years i lived there. we found a photo of him posing and put it on the wall as a memento."london transport fines, eh? thish guy'sh more big time than i firsht shushpected.the rather picturesque estate in question.to find out more about the house, i asked ted to come down to the station to help me with my inquiries.detective chief inspector prancehall: what was the house like?ted: grey, bars over most of the windows, but big. it had three floors, a big kitchen and living room, and was very cheap. i think i paid about Â£250 a month.fill me in on the general decor.erm, it was minimal. when he was still there, there were knives lying around upstairs, and a relaxing scent of weed.was it fully furnished?it had a greeny-beige three-piece-suite, beds and cupboards.carpet or a wipeable surface on the floor in the bathroom?wipeable laminate surface everywhere except the stairs.did you have a garden?yep, but never bothered with it.was there a mice problem when you moved in?no sir.ok, tell me about the inside of the microwave. you can usually tell how clean a house is from the inside of the microwave.i have never used a microwave.
