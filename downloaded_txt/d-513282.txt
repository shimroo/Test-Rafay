klondike derby events
events for a klondike derby
during a klondike derby, scout patrols visit stations (sometimes
called "towns") along the route and compete in the various events
(sometimes supervised by the "town mayor"). it adds to the derby to give

presenting volunteer recognition in scouting
how to make honours and awards more effective
effective volunteer recognition is an essential part of a
successful volunteer organization. it is one important way that
associations show veneration for the efforts of their volunteers.
volunteers who feel truly valued and who feel that their efforts are
having a positive impact on the world will be encouraged to continue to
give their time and effort. as well, public recognition holds up role
models for all to see, encouraging others to follow the lead of those
being recognized. the effectiveness of an award is impacted greatly by
how it is presented to the recipient.

freedom to venture outside of our urban surroundings and is a satisfying
skill to master. it also allows one to take part in activities such as
orienteering and geocaching. this guide gives an introduction to using
maps and compasses.

how to teach semaphore
scouts enjoy learning this visual communication method
the first step in teaching semaphore is to make some flags! make
enough that there are two flags for every two kids (or one each, which
ever is easiest). make the flags so that the handles are at least 12"
longer than the width of the flag. the reason for this is so they will
learn to make the handle an extension of their forearm, and not hold it
by a short handle that can allow the wrist to turn and cause the flag to
be pointing in any direction.

wfis world conference 2004
report on the world federation of independent scouts meeting in bc
in 1996, some of the non-wosm scouting associations met in
laubach, germany where they agreed to federate as the world federation
of independent scouts (wfis). six years later in 2002, they held their
first world jamboree in denmark. there was a contingent in bc that was
anxious to attend, decided not to because many members were from cattle
producing areas, and mad cow and hoof and mouth diseases in europe were
in the news at the time. it was shame because it was a real deal
financially. the registration fees for the entire jamboree, including
food and firewood, was 800 danish krona (about ca$125).

save your scout camp
what to do before scouts canada tries to sell your local scout camp
scouts canada has started a process to sell many of the scout
camps in ontario, a legacy that has taken over 95 years to accumulate.
in the middle of the summer holiday they have announced that
approximately 40% of scouting's real property assets are on the block. a
short appeal period has been foisted on the unsuspecting. a national
firm has been retained and will receive a handsome commission to flog
this property. if there is an actual need to sell there are local firms
available and a significant number with scouting members who would take
a special interest in obtaining the best price and charging the lowest
commissions.

whatâs really making you feel bad?
at story about keeping warm at winter camp
it was a fairly good camp, considering that we were out in early
february in tents. twenty-eight scouts aged 11-15 and with four scouters
went tent-camping in southwestern ontario. friday night had been a
little hectic setting up the tents in the dark, but everyone settled
down eventually and the camp gradually drew quiet.

youth input? no way!
what is the role of youth members in program planning?
many years ago on my first wood badge i course, i was told all
about the importance of youth input to program planning. we were taught
some techniques for doing this and i returned to my troop eager to try
them out.

on preparedness
every once in a while, something happens that re-affirms your faith in what you believe in
i have three children, lorelei (17), wesley (20), and dustin
(23). they were all active beavers, cubs, scouts, and ventures. as
scouters, we have all hounded our scouts to be prepared, work as a team,
think for themselves. we give countless hours, but most of the time we
see only glimmers of success for our efforts. sometimes we see
more.
2002-11-05
membership retention
what we can do about membership decline
membership decline has been a problem for scouts canada for over
three decades, but what can we do about it? i visited many scout troops
to find out. i found that amid membership decline are many successful
troops with healthy and growing membership. this essay examines what
makes these troops successful so that we can follow their lead. topics
include the role of badges, outdoor activities, giving responsibility to
the scouts, and the scout uniform. this essay was written as part of
fulfilling my degree requirements at the university of
waterloo.

klondike, ho!
resources for running a klondike derby, including a new sled design
klondike derby is a winter competition event for scouts during
which patrols will pull their klondike sleds along a course in the
woods. along the way, they will be tested on scouting skills at various
stations. a derby is usually a day-long event involving a route of 7-8
km and about 20 stations. the event finishes with a formal banquet and
the awarding of trophies. klondike derbies provide an opportunity for
scouts to apply their scouting skills in a fun competition. the event
can be made to come alive with the use of the lore of the 1897 klondike
gold rush in the yukon.

klondike derby sled plans
a new design for a strong, light, and inexpensive klondike sled
dissatisfied with previous designs for klondike sleds, we set
out to make a new design. we wanted a sled that was strong, light,
inexpensive, and something that the scouts could build themselves. the
distinguishing feature of this design is that it is held together with
rope lashings rather than with metal screws. in this way, the design is
not really new. the inuit have used flexible sleds for much longer than
scouts have been around.
2002-02
klondike derby mushing
working as a team to drive your klondike sled
driving a klondike sled is called mushing and requires the
scouts to work together as a coordinated team. this is one of the
reasons why a derby is such a good scouting activity.

scout patrol emblems
nineteen canadian animals and their symbolic meanings
scout troops are made up of groups of six to eight scouts called
a patrol. every patrol chooses an animal to be its emblem. a patrol
animal is not just a handy way of identifying a patrol. the scouts
should take pride in their animal and strive to imitate its positive
characteristics.
2002-02
scout patrol flags
patrol flags are fun to make and help identify a patrol
scouts may wish to make a flag for their patrol. deciding on a
design is a good teamwork activity, as scouts will have different ideas
which can be put together to create a single design. when the flag is
done, it helps the patrol to feel like a team.  a patrol flag is
normally carried on a staff by the patrol leader. a flag can help the
patrol to get organized. scouts can easily find their pl in a group by
looking for a flag held in the air. the flag staff can be put in the
ground to mark where a patrol should pile their kit when leaving for
camp.

a rover ramble to the birthplace of scouting
a journal entry from kandersteg international scout centre, switzerland
i am sitting in the staff room of the kandersteg international scout centre
95Â km south of bern, switzerland. a train is just going by on the
track outside, having just emerged from the lÃ£Â¶tschberg tunnel, a
15Â km train tunnel which houses the main line between germany and
italy. the tunnel was built between 1906 and 1912. in 1908, a chalet was
built to house the workers and their families. the chalet was abandoned
after the tunnel was complete. in 1923, walther von bronstetten, chief
scout of switzerland, suggested to baden-powell that the chalet would
make a great international home from scouts. impressed by the
international friendship shown at the recent world jamboree, b-p had
been looking for a place where scouts from all other the world could
gather on a permanent basis. thus, kandersteg international scout centre
was founded.

the hunt for captain rasputinâs treasure
a treasure hunt program for scouts
many years ago, a band of pirates under captain vladimir
rasputin set sail to plunder on the seven seas. eventually, they spied a
spanish merchant ship. they raised their jolly roger and prepared to
fight. after the battle, the pirates sank the merchant ship and made off
with a great treasure. but captain rasputin had been injured in the
battle. they sailed to their hideout near berlin, ontario where captain
rasputin died. in accordance with the captain's wishes, he was buried
near their hideout, the treasure along side of him.

personal camp kit list
what a scout needs for a weekend camp
below is a personal camp gear suggestion list. this is an all-season list. you need to think about the weather and type of activity when choosing what to bring. talk to your patrol leader or scouter if you are unsure about what you need. you are responsible for making sure that you have everything you need and that it is properly packed. your parents must not put things into your backpack for you. you need to know where things are packed so that you can find them quickly.

the b-p kit
this first aid/emergency kit helps scouts to be prepared
when in the outdoors, every scout must be prepared for both
ordinary camp activities like lighting a fire or cutting rope, as well
as emergencies like getting lost or severe bleeding. the items below
form a good kit to help a scout to be prepared. these items should be
packed away in a container that is easy to carry around, such as a waist
pack. carry this kit with you always when in the outdoors. it could be
useful anytime.

a story about the 91st toronto scout troop
the 91st toronto scout troop went on an overnight hike one fine
spring weekend. that night, the scouts ate a fine meal of pita pizza
pockets cooked in the fire. after supper, they had a spirited game of
capture the glow stick, followed by a camp fire, hot chocolate, and
toasted marshmallows. by 23:30, the scouts (and scouters) were exhausted
and climbed into their tents.

extreme adventure: extremely easy
all fun and no learning is not scouting
in the past couple of years, scouts canada has started offering
two new programs, scoutsabout (ages 5-10) and extreme adventure (ages
14-17). the new programs are intended to help "scouts canada reposition
itself and expand its products" (scouts canada 1999:17). the programs
are intended to "increase membership and involvement in scouting". they
are not "intended to compete with existing core scouting programs, which
will continue."

can the rover scout vigil change the community which values it?
an analysis of the rover vigil as ritual
at the turn of the twentieth century, lord robert baden-powell
of gilwell saw a need to create a youth organization in which the youth
could grow up to be a productive, responsible citizens within their
communities. he created the scout movement, which has spread all over
the globe. certainly canada is no exception. through the aid of a
resource, rovering to success (baden-powell 1922), rover scout
communities have developed all over this country. the rover scout
movement is based not only on baden-powell's proposed knighthood theme,
although it is the most common. by employing the methodologies of arnold
van gennep and victor turner, it is the intent of this paper to explore
a certain ritual in the rover scout community, the "vigil," and to
assess its potential to promote change within the rover scout community
which values it.

what is a scouts' own?
a scouts' own is an important part of the spiritual life of any scout section
a scouts' own is an important and often misunderstood part of a
scout program. most of the scouts' owns that i have seen are essentially
distilled church services which do little for the spiritual life of
those present, particularly those who do not regularly attend religious
services. this essay is intended to help scouts and scouters run
effective scouts' owns by providing a definition of scouts' own, some
things that follow from the definition, and examples of how this can be
put into practice. while i will use scouts section terminology for this
essay, beavers' owns, cubs' owns, venturers' owns, rovers' owns, and
scouters' owns are important parts of their respective
sections.

structured play is not scouting
scouts canadaâs new program potentially to be operated by paid leaders
recently, scouts canada has been quietly taking some initial
steps down a new path. those of us who read the scouts canada web site
in detail ran across the mention of a project to develop a "play with a
purpose" program in minutes of the may 1999 national meeting. i spoke on
the phone with ian mitchell of the national office who provided me with
some details about the structured play program, now a pilot project in
toronto. this new program is in a new direction is two major ways.
first, the program does not use the scout method and therefore is not a
scouting program. second, there is the potential for the program to be
delivered by paid leaders, rather than by volunteers. this essay, which
is based on my august 1999 conversation with ian mitchell, will describe
the program and offer some commentary.

a winter camp story
it all starts with an official storm warning
i was standing in the ranger's cabin at camp manitou near
burlington, ontario checking in for a weekend camp with the scouts. the
weather radio enunciated, "environment canada has upgraded the storm

them. already several centimetres of snow had fallen and more was coming
down fast, the snow sparkling as it passed under the lights outside the

the scouter-in-training award
a proposal for an addition to the venturer program
the current venturer program lacks a means for recognizing
venturers who have displayed outstanding leadership in the younger
sections of scouting. to remedy this, i propose the addition of a new
award that will be "fourth route" to the queen's venturer award. this
new award will be granted to venturers who are involved in the
leadership of the junior sections (beavers, cubs, scouts).

what does scouting mean by duty to god?
scouting embraces diverse spiritual expression, theistic or not
one of scouting's three principles is titled "duty to god." this
statement has been interpreted in many different ways, some of which
have lead to religious discrimination, a violation of scouting's
fundamentals. what does duty to god really mean to scouting? duty to god
is about the development of the spiritual values of life and is not a
statement about any required beliefs about the material world.  this
essay is based on the world organization of the scout movement's (wosm)
document fundamental
principles which contains "the only authoritative statement
agreed upon by more than one hundred member organizations of wosm" (wosm
1992:1). all quotations in this essay are from that document.

recognizing a new scouter at the front of the horseshoe
in this ceremony, a new scoutmaster takes the place of the old.
the two are referred to as scouter new and scouter old in this
description. the officiate is usually a senior member of the group or a
commissioner, but any member of scouting can be the officiate.
adaptations of this ceremony can be used to install people into other
positions within scouting. this ceremony best takes place at an opening
of a meeting or camp.

the uniform iou
loan uniforms to those who cannot afford them
the scout uniform is too expensive for many people. in order to
ensure that no one is deprived of scouting due to financial
considerations, the uniform iou was developed. a scout and their
parent/guardian will sign the form and be lent a scout shirt until the
scout outgrows it or leaves scouting. scouts are encouraged to buy their
own sash and, if this is not affordable, the group will buy it for them.
this is done because a sash is a personal record of achievement and
should not have to be returned. here is a sample uniform iou.
