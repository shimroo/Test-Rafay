  teaching atomic structure using cooperative learning


cooperative learning is a teaching pedagogy that is great to use, but often challenging to implement. in a high school general chemistry classroom (non-honors level), the range of math abilities across the student population often means that some students catch on quickly to the algebra-based concepts.  other students struggle with very basic algebra. the beauty of using cooperative learning is that the science teacher can use the higher ability students as another resource for the students that need to have concepts reinforced.
