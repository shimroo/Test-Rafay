hi deedee
many thanks for such a wonderful 4 daysjudeen 
				& i had a great time at cairo nightsthe instructors were all 
				world class, and the saturday night show was the best weve seen 
				anywhere, by far. i picked up lots of useful technique & 
				inspiration. you were so kind to us & really made us feel 
				welcome!  
many thanks & hope to see you again soon

i just wanted to say thanks again for 
									inviting me to perform.  the seminars were 
									great, and i think the saturday night show 
									was the best you have ever produced.  i know 
									it takes a lot of hard work to plan and i 
									just want you to know we all appreciate your 
									efforts.

														hi dede!

														 

														this is valeri cavazos! 
														my mother and i met you 
														last weekend at your 
														ahlan cairo nights show! 
														it was amazing! i just 
														wanted to say thank you 
														for bringing nour all 
														the way to texas! she is 
														actually my very 
														favorite dancer and i 
														thought the only way for 
														me to meet her and take 
														a workshop would be if i 
														went to egypt!!!  thanks 
														again! i would like to 
														join your mailing list 
														to be informed of 
														anything else little 
														egypt has in store!  we 
														had such a wonderful 
														time and are looking 
														forward to seeing you 
														again!  all the best to 
														you and your beautiful 
														family!

														 

														love,

														 

														valeri
