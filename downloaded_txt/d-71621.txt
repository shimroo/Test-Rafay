testimonials





















"cindy's business of singing classes are one of the most useful things a singer could experience while trying to make their way in the professional singing world at any capacity. not only is there an amazing focus on how to specifically market yourself to the best of your abilities in every possible situation, it also includes invaluable knowledge about the business side of singing that is often only gained through actual experience as a working singer. so often a program or a music degree won't include anything about actually working as a singer beyond technique, stage experience, and acting, but cindy's classes teach you how to effectively present those skills and how to monitor and run your experiences as a business. cindy's experience in the business and her collaboration with other successful artists create an astoundingly in-depth series of courses that teach you everything you need as a working singer from taxes and management to social media platforms and audition materials. they are an essential supplement to anyone wishing to perform professionally as a singer!"—lauren slagowski, soprano, graduate student






















"her insight on the business, how to prepare and be prepared for every situation is amazing."darren keith woods, general director, seagle music colony






















"i don't care if you're a neophyte or, like me, someone looking to renew their pursuit of a career after taking time off or somewhere in between; a consultation with cindy is a must."–limmie pulliam, tenor






















"cindy has lots of experience and perspective to draw upon, being an opera professional working in several capacities; she also has the ability to get to the heart of your question quickly, talk about it frankly and constructively, and offer "real-talk" advice and actionable ideas. i found myself easily creating a "to-do" list from the feedback i received on my questions, and left her session feeling motivated and empowered."  —danielle buonaiuto, soprano






















"she listened patiently to all of my questions and concerns, gave me agency to start treating my career like a small business, and helped me to see that i have the tools to navigate this crazy world."timothy madden, bass-baritone
