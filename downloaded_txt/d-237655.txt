   dear friends,as we approach valentine’s day this week, we are surrounded by heart-shaped cards, chocolates, and festive decorations, all reminding us of the significance of love in our lives. while this day is often associated with romantic love, the church also recognizes another beautiful occasion around the same time -world marriage day, which fell on sunday, february 9, as part of national marriage week (february 7-14).the united states conference of catholic bishops (usccb) encourages us to take this time to reflect on the sacred bond of marriage and the family, emphasizing this year’s theme: "marriage: source of hope, spring of renewal. pursue a lasting love!" in a world that often distorts the meaning of love, we as a church have the opportunity to focus on building a culture of life and love, rooted in the example of christ.interestingly, valentine’s day itself has christian origins. saint valentine was a roman catholic priest who was martyred on february 14, 270 a.d. 
 under the persecution of emperor claudius ii. the emperor sought to eradicate christianity and executed influential christian leaders, including father valentine, who remained steadfast in his faith despite the threat of death. legend tells us that before his execution, valentine gave a heart-shaped note to the jailer’s daughter—a small yet powerful symbol of enduring love. the church later canonized him, and his feast day became a time to remember not only romantic love but the sacrificial love of a christian witness.






 though much of this meaning has been diluted over the centuries, it reminds us that true love—whether in marriage, friendship, or our walk with christ—is selfless, sacrificial, and rooted in faith.as followers of christ, we must not shy away from discussing love in our churches. if we do not teach about romantic love from a christian perspective, the world will teach it from its own. valentine’s day presents a wonderful opportunity to share god’s perspective on love and relationships, emphasizing that the greatest love story ever told is not one of fleeting romance, but of god’s eternal and unconditional love for us—from creation to the cross.jesus commands us in john 13:34-35:"a new command i give you: love one another. as i have loved you, so you must love one another. by this, all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another."for those celebrating valentine’s day with their spouses, may it be a time of renewal and gratitude for the gift of marriage. may you take this opportunity to reflect god’s unconditional love in your relationship. and for those who find this day difficult, please remember - your worth is not determined by a relationship status or a bouquet of roses. you are loved deeply and eternally by your heavenly father.﻿


 whether or not you have plans for valentine’s day,
god desires to meet with you. he is always pursuing you, longing to reveal his love in ways far greater than we can imagine. so let us celebrate not just human love, but the divine love that never fails, never fades, and never gives up.may the love of christ fill your hearts today and always. please do watch the youtube video from our bishop barber on marriage and family. ~ fr. paulson
