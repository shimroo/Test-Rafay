march 2010


walbro just released a line of high performance in-tank modules for
newer gm trucks.   check 'em out

 april 2009 

we've often wondered why napa and others sell the sae j30r10 hose for over $20 for a one foot section, but
        we can get a 6-inch piece for a lot less.     we just learned that the high-pressure, in-tank hose that
        walbro uses in all their kits, and that we sell individually, is not sae j30r10 certified.    it
        is rated for high-pressure, in-tank use, but is only made to a certain chrysler corp spec.   
        we will continue to sell the hose we get from walbro, but we'll now note it as not-quite-j30r10 hose.

        we found sae j30r10 hose on a reel!    after many years of working on it, we convinced a
        major manufacturer of hose to not cut the j30r10 hose.   before now, all manufacturers cut their hose
        into 1-foot pieces.    we will cut you off as much or as littl as you need.    you'll find the
        hose on the "install  parts" page.

 march 2009 

we found a 15-inch flex hose for those instances when 8 inches is not enough.  
        you can find the new flex hose on the "install parts" page.

        lpe's exclusive contract with walbro for the c5 corvette fuel pump upgrade has expired.  
        you can find the c5 corvette fuel upgrade pump module on the c5 pump page.
      
 november 2008 

 walbro engineering has resolved the f20000169 fuel pump problem.  
          we have a supply of the new f20000169 pumps in stock. 

 october 2008 

 walbro engineering has discovered the problem with the f20000169 fuel pumps.  
          they are getting the parts to fix
          the problem.   the warehouse should have the pumps by the middle of november.  
          then, they'll have to ship them to the distributors.    we should get more
          of those pumps by the end of november. 
 all f20000169 pumps that are returned will be tested.   in the past, walbro has
          had over 98 percent of returned pumps run on the test bench as okay.  
          not all pumps will have the problem.   any pumps that are tested to be okay will be
          returned to you.   this is not an across-the-board recall as far as i know. 
 walbro engineering is trying to identify a timeframe when the problem parts got
          into production pumps.   as far as they can tell, any pump manufactured
          before the 2nd quarter 2008 should be okay.   if your manufacture date is
          before that, they currently don't have a clear reason to swap it out.
