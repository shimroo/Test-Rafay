keeping canada running since 1976




there's no need for an appointment when you come to  mr. lube. we'll change your oil and perform a wide range of other maintenance services, keeping your vehicle running smoother than ever.
in 1976, arnold and clifford giese, a hardworking, forward-thinking father and son team, set up their very first  mr. lube location. they did so with some lofty goals and a clear vision of what their customers should be able to expect. the plan was simple: to deliver no hassle, fast turn-around oil changes without having to make an appointment.
