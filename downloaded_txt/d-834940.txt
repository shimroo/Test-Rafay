waiting list
it is "worth it" to join the waiting list. when we make cabin assignments, we frequently "find" a place in a cabin and can go to the waiting list to offer that place. you may add your name to multiple waiting lists and you may accept a place in one session and stay on the waiting list for a different session.
junior staff registration process:all potential cits and junior counselors must have had their 13th birthday by the time they arrive at camp and must have attended strong river as a camper. eligible cits and junior counselors can apply to be a member of the junior staff through ultracamp using the waiting list process. just login to your ultracamp account and put your name on the waiting list for any cit session(s) you want to attend.you will also need to submit a letter explaining why you want to be part of the junior staff at strong river. this letter should include your choice of morning activities you would like to teach and, if you are applying for multiple sessions, the list of sessions in order of preference. your junior staff application will not be considered complete until we have received your letter.
junior staff applications must be submitted by january 10, 2025. we will begin to send out acceptances by email on january 20, 2025.
as of january 20, 2025, we are beginning to send out offers to register to the junior staff. this will be a gradual process over the next week, so please be patient. if you get a notification that we have a place for you, you must register to claim that place. 
if you have siblings registered as campers, their sibling discount will automatically be applied when you complete your registration. 
​the discount for being a first-year cit is already reflected in the cit session fees charged.
if you are a second-year cit, apply for an additional discount with the discount code cit2. if you are a third-year cit, use the discount code cit3 and fourth-year cits use the discount code cit4.

strong river 101
we are kicking off the summer with strong river 101! this will be a special session designed to introduce strong river camp to younger brothers/sisters, cousins, neighbors or anyone aged 6 - 10 who would like to spend three nights with us and experience a shorter version of camp.
sessions 4 & 8 - "short and sweet" 3 - day sessions
similar to strong river 101 but open to 7-13 year olds, sessions 4 and 8 will begin on a sunday afternoon and end on a wednesday morning. come ready to stay busy and have fun!
session 5 - the campers' favorite... the 9-day session!
this summer session 5 will begin on thursday, june 26 and end on saturday, july 5. it includes an overnight campout and our huge 4th of july celebration! come enjoy the party - special events, special food and some red, white and blue surprises!
we will no longer have any camper sessions that may be combined for a longer stay.
we appreciate that campers want to stay longer but we have come to realize that sometimes campers are too tired to rally for another week. our sessions are designed to pack in the fun and build to a 'grand finale'.
