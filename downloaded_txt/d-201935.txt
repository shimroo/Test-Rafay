musings on science, the bible, and fantastic literature (and sometimes basketball and other stuff).

god speaks to us through the bible and the findings of science, and we should listen to both types of revelation.

the title is from psalm 84:11. 

the wikipedia is usually a pretty good reference. i mostly use the world english bible (web), because it is public domain. i am grateful.

blogging: posts that have received over 500 views





i blog mostly because i want to say something, whether anyone reads it or not. i hope that i am also blogging for god's glory. sometimes i wonder if it's worth the effort, but a recent experience indicates that at least some of it is. the experience is that blogger, which i have used since beginning this blog, keeps track of the number of views, and comments, on each post. i was posting on a biography of dietrich bonhoeffer, and looked up some previous posts on him, and was amazed to note that those two posts had received over 400 views each. those posts are here and here. (in case you are wondering, there are over 2,000 posts on this blog. most of them have received a few dozen views.)

what is a view? i'm not sure, but suppose that, at minimum, someone clicked on the blog post's page. 400 views does not mean that 400 people actually read the post, or even glanced at it.

so what posts have received over 500 views? here's an annotated list, including:

a post on what's wrong with the political left, and the right, is here.

salt-bible study





there are about 40 occurrences of the word, salt, in the bible. here are some of them:salt was part of the offerings to yahweh: leviticus 2:13 every offering of your meal offering you shall season with salt. you shall not allow the salt of the covenant of your god to be lacking from your meal offering. with all your offerings you shall offer salt.salt was used to poison the fields of enemy nations: judges 9:44 abimelech and the companies that were with him rushed forward and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city; and the two companies rushed on all who were in the field and struck them. 45 abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city and killed the people in it. he beat down the city and sowed it with salt.deuteronomy 29:23 that all of its land is sulfur, salt, and burning, that it is not sown, doesn’t produce, nor does any grass grow in it, like the overthrow of sodom, gomorrah, admah, and zeboiim, which yahweh overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath.but salt, in at least one case, had the opposite effect, presumably because of a miracle: 2 kings 2:19 the men of the city said to elisha, “behold, please, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the land is barren. 20 he said, “bring me a new jar, and put salt in it.” then they brought it to him. 21 he went out to the spring of the waters, and threw salt into it, and said, “yahweh says, ‘i have healed these waters. there shall not be from there any more death or barren wasteland.’”offerings were supposed to be salted:leviticus 2:13 every offering of your meal offering you shall season with salt. you shall not allow the salt of the covenant of your god to be lacking from your meal offering. with all your offerings you shall offer salt.numbers 18:19 all the wave offerings of the holy things which the children of israel offer to yahweh, i have given you and your sons and your daughters with you, as a portion forever. it is a covenant of salt forever before yahweh to you and to your offspring with you.”salt was used in part of the ritual of establishing a covenant:2 chronicles 13:5 ought you not to know that yahweh, the god of israel, gave the kingdom over israel to david forever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt? (i'm not sure whether salt was used in covenants between people, or just in covenants between god and people.)babies were salted at birth: ezekiel 16:4 as for your birth, in the day you were born your navel was not cut. you weren’t washed in water to cleanse you. you weren’t salted at all, nor wrapped in blankets at all. (it may be that some of the significance of salt, as in putting it on babies, were prevalent just at the time related to that scripture. or these practices may be widespread.here are some references from the new testament: matthew 5:13 “you are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its flavor, with what will it be salted? it is then good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men.luke 14:34 “salt is good, but if the salt becomes flat and tasteless, with what do you season it?colossians 4:6 let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one.for the christian, salt is related to keeping our flavor. does that mean that we should remain distinct from the general population? christians are to impart god's grace, perhaps somewhat like babies were salted in ezekiel's time.salt preserves and flavors. these uses were well known in bible times. a use that they probably didin't think about was that salt retards freezing. as i write, there is lots of crystallized salt on roads and sidewalks nearby.  christians, too, should be warm-hearted.there are several biblical references to the salt sea, which we now call the dead sea. (it has a high salt content.)for a lot more about salt, see the wikipedia article.

uzza, or uzzah





2 samuel 6:1 david again gathered together all the chosen
men of israel, thirty thousand. 2 david arose, and went with all the people who
were with him, from baale judah, to bring up from there god’s ark, which is
called by the name, even the name of yahweh of armies who sits above the
cherubim. 3 they set god’s ark on a new cart, and brought it out of abinadab’s
house that was on the hill; and uzzah and ahio, the sons of abinadab, drove the
new cart. 4 they brought it out of abinadab’s house, which was in the hill,
with god’s ark; and ahio went before the ark. 5 david and all the house of
israel played before yahweh with all kinds of instruments made of cypress wood,
with harps, with stringed instruments, with tambourines, with castanets, and
with cymbals. 6 when they came to the threshing floor of nacon, uzzah reached
for god’s ark, and took hold of it; for the cattle stumbled. 7 yahweh’s anger
burned against uzzah; and god struck him there for his error; and he died there
by god’s ark. 8 david was displeased, because yahweh had broken out against
uzzah; and he called that place perez uzzah, to this day. 9 david was afraid of
yahweh that day; and he said, “how could yahweh’s ark come to me?” 10 so david
would not move yahweh’s ark to be with him in david’s city; but david carried
it aside into obed-edom the gittite’s house. 11 yahweh’s ark remained in
obed-edom the gittite’s house three months; and yahweh blessed obed-edom and
all his house. 12 king david was told, “yahweh has blessed the house of obed-edom,
and all that belongs to him, because of god’s ark.” (world english bible,
public domain. this story is also told in 1 chronicles 13.)
i confess that this story has always bothered me. it
bothered david, too. uzzah seems to have been  just trying to protect the ark, and god seems
to have killed him for it.
before i go further, a side note. there are two versions of
uzzah's name -- uzza and uzzah. it is possible that these names tell us about
two different people. it is also possible that there was more than one uzza, or
more than one uzzah, in the old testament. i am assuming that there was only
one uzzah, and that, for reasons i don't know, his name is spelled in two
different ways in the world english bible, and, most likely, in other versions
of the bible. see here for more examination of the question of how many uzzahs,
or uzzas, that there were.
1 chronicles 8:1-7 tells us about the ancestry of uzza,
probably the same man as in the story above. 
2 kings 21:22-26 indicates that uzzah may have been known
about much later, as king amon was buried in a tomb in "the garden of
uzza."
ezra 2:49 lists offspring of uzzah as some of the temple
servants, returning from captivity, and this is also true of nehemiah 7:51.
i believe that god is just. i also believe that god directs,
or allows, things that i don't understand. perhaps god's justice was
illustrated in the life of uzzah, when it suddenly ended, but, even in death,
his family was honored by being among those returning from captivity, and among
those tending to the care of the holy places and ceremonies of israel. perhaps
uzzah is resting until the final kingdom, or perhaps he is even now
worshipping god as we speak!
thanks for reading.

sunspots 972





some things that i have spotted that may be of interest to others:joel duff is perhaps the most articulate anti-young-earth creationist blogger. he understands criticism, and knows the literature. when i  previously looked his posts, they were not entirely textual, but were mostly youtube videos. that's not true now. his work includes videos, but the content of the video is generally also presented in text form, where it can be quoted, and where users can see what duff has to say without disturbing anyone who doesn't want to listen. a recent post concerns the realization, by many young-earth creationists, that it is impossible to explain supposed effects of the flood, over a brief time period. here's duff's post: (the title begins with "divine intervention in geology." an intriguing subject.)one of my readers noted that the post above had an incorrect link. i believe that it is now corrected, and thank that reader.scientific american has a good article on how and why many trees change color in the fall.thanks for looking! i hope to publish sunspots from time to time, but have ceased publishing every week.

god's creativity





let us be thankful for god's wisdom, creativity and imagination. he thought of many things: information, beauty of form, sound, color, smell and taste; physical laws and constants, elementary particles and the structures that are made of them; life, diversity, and natural selection; communication, humor; faith, generosity, innocence. he let us live in a good, diverse, and well-planned world, with energy, oxygen, water, organic compounds, and other elements and compounds we need to live.more could be said. the universe's creation involved the father, son and spirit, working together.
