revolutionize diving
 



how are we doing things different 



the mission viejo nadadores diving program is looking to change the way we approach the development of age group divers in the united states. the country currently has a competitive system which incentivizes skipping steps and rushing through the fundamental elements of diving. the nadadores have a system in place in our program that reinforces building a strong foundation. this is designed to support their future development in the sport of diving, setting them up for long-term and sustainable success in their athletic careers.
