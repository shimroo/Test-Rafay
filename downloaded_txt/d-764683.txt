downsizing the u. s. government this way will destroy its effectiveness without increasing its efficiency





before cutting the ranks of u. s. government employees who safeguard the
      nation's nuclear material and respond to nuclear accidents, it would seem
      wise to ask them exactly what tasks they are assigned and how they
      accomplish them. apparently, that was not a consideration when the trump
      administration through its u. s. department of government efficiency
      service (currently run by billionaire elon musk) began
        firing personnel at the national nuclear security agency (nnsa).
what is happening at the nnsa
      is a window into why merely downsizing an organization does not
      necessarily increase its efficiency. on its website the nnsa explains that
      it has the following missions:

to ensure the united states maintains a safe, secure, and reliable
        nuclear stockpile.

to prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear or radioactive material
        that could be used in an attack on the united states, its interests, or
        allies.

to provide effective nuclear propulsion plants to the u. s. navy.

to prepare for nuclear and radiological incidents and accidents
        through planning, training, and exercises and respond to nuclear and
        radiological incidents and accidents worldwide.

why musk's access to u. s. treasury payment systems risks a global financial meltdown





whether or not you share the zeal for cuts in government spending
      embraced by president donald trump and his billionaire sidekick elon musk,
      you should know that giving musk and his callow team of computer coders
      access to payment systems at the u. s. department of treasury risks a
      global financial meltdown. it doesn't make such an event certain, but it
      lowers the odds considerably. 
here's why:
first, the u.s. department of treasury processes some $6 trillion in payments each year. if that system were to come to a halt for even a relatively short period of time, the consequences would be devastating, not only for the u.s. economy but for the global economy as well.
it is also important to grasp that the treasury department
      stands behind the entire u.s. banking system. it is the lender of last
      resort in a banking crisis to the federal deposit insurance corporation
      which insures bank deposits nationwide, and because the treasury
      department has the full faith and credit of the united states government
      behind it, the department is a potent force for forestalling panic and
      crisis in the banking system.

after deepseek, ai developers are wrong that the jevons paradox will bail them out





in 1865 british economist william stanley jevons explained to the public
      that increased efficiencies in the use of resources per unit of production do not
      generally lead to lower consumption of those resources. rather, these efficiencies lead to
      higher consumption as many more people can now afford the more efficiently
      produced goods which carry a lower price tag. jevons was
      referring to coal, the cost of which was falling and demand for which was rising due to increased
      efficiencies in production. his idea became known as the jevons paradox.
when the chinese-based artificial intelligence (ai) upstart deepseek
       demonstrated  last week that complex and powerful ai can be delivered for
        a tiny fraction of the cost and resources of current ai tools, deepseek's 
        competitors cited the jevons paradox and told investors not to worry.
      demand for ai would now grow even more rapidly in response to greater
      efficiencies and thus lower costs.
what those competitors failed to mention is that deepseek's breakthrough
      is great news for buyers of ai tools, but very bad news for current developers who are sellers
        of those tools. deepseek is giving away free or at only 3 percent
      of competitors' prices (for those needing application programming
      interface services) something comparable to the very expensive products of
      its competitors. this suggests that the hundreds of billions of dollars
      spent developing those expensive tools may have just gone up in smoke. that
      investment may never be recouped.

democratization of ai spurts ahead: more power to individuals for mischief





while the world was focused on the actions of the trump administration in
      its first week, a
        little-known chinese startup startled the tech world last week with
      the release of an open source artificial intelligence tool that for a
      fraction of cost and resources of american competitors such as chatgpt
      matches and in some cases outperforms its american rivals.
the company, deepseek, has gone
      even further, making its eponymous tool available for download for free.
      only those seeking to use the company's application
        programming interface―something which allows the tool to interface
      more easily with existing programs—must pay a fee that is only about 3
      percent of that of other tools.
deepseek sheds light on two important issues. first, u.s. export controls
      on advanced computer technology, both hardware and software, are
      meaningless against a rival that has a highly educated population with the
      training and tools to work around such controls. the lack of resources
      essentially forced the deepseek team to solve problems related to
      efficiency that they would not have bothered to tackle if u.s. technology
      had been available. the team ended up producing a superior, much more
      cost-effective product as a result. in my december 2024 piece "u.s. china trade war: is the latest battle really tit for tat?" i wrote:

wishful thinking? sweden building nuclear waste site to last 100,000 years





the sensible swedes like planning ahead. this time its storage
        for nuclear waste from its own nuclear industry—storage that is
      supposed to last 100,000 years. nuclear power currently provides 40
        percent of sweden's electricity from six operating reactors. the
      swedes expect to fill the storage site—"60 km of tunnels buried 500
      metres down in 1.9 billion year old bedrock"—sometime by 2080 at which
      time it will be closed.
for understanding whether the target of 100,000 years of successful
      storage is plausible, i suggest a trip back 100,000 years to understand
     what surprises might be in store over such an interval. one hundred thousand years ago the
      bronze age, the age when humans first started to refine and work with
      metal, was still 97,000 years in the future.
it might seem that not much happened in those 97,000 years, but actually
      a lot that could challenge such storage schemes did. for example,
      somewhere around 71,000 to 74,000 years ago mount toba, located in
      modern-day indonesia, erupted in a supervolcano thought to be the largest
      in human history. the eruption was two orders of magnitude (100x) larger
      than another famous indonesian volcanic eruption, mount tambora, which
      caused what is now referred to as "the year without a summer" in 1816.

elevator 'crisis' as symptom of our infrastructure predicament





i recently noticed that the elevator at my favorite cinema has been out of order for weeks now. the less mobile patrons need that elevator to transport them downward to this underground theater. i then learned of america's "elevator crisis" and my mind wandered to the struggle to
      maintain the roman empire. i'll explain the connection below. but first a
      refresher on rome's predicament:
the roman emperor trajan brought the roman empire to its greatest extent
      during his reign (98 to 117 a.d.) with his successful conquests in what we
      today would call the middle east. rome's many conquests had been financed
      by booty taken from the conquered.
but its hold on the
        sprawling empire—one that reached from northern england to southern
      egypt, from spain in the west to what today is called iraq in the
      east—would henceforth have to be financed by rising taxes and inflated
      currency. the money was needed to pay for armies and naval forces to
      defend the empire's very long land and maritime borders. building an
      empire turned out to be less expensive than maintaining one, including
      building and maintaining the infrastructure of roads and military and
      political outposts needed to protect and administer it.
what happened to rome's maintenance bill happens in any system of
      infrastructure as it expands. the existing infrastructure must be
      maintained even as new infrastructure is built. eventually, it becomes
      very expensive 1) to pay collectively for maintenance of all existing
      infrastructure and 2) to pay for increasingly aging infrastructure that
      requires extra expense.

bird flu: will it be the biggest story of 2025?





amid ongoing wars in ukraine and the middle east; the collapse of
      governing coalitions in europe; the return of donald trump to the
      presidency of the united states promising to downsize its federal
      government radically and end or pare down its commitments to europe and
      ukraine; the hottest year on record in 2024 and worse to come including
      more violent and destructive storms due to relentless climate change; amid
      all this turbulence, a tiny virus may break through to become the biggest
      story of 2025.
kff
          health news reports that "at least 875 herds [of dairy
      cattle] across 16 [u.s.] states have tested positive" for bird flu and
      that "the virus shows no sign of slowing." as
        i discussed previously, for obvious self-interested economic
      reasons, the dairy and beef cattle industries did their best to thwart
      quick action to contain the virus when it began spreading earlier this
      year. now, it seems, it is too late, and the foolish attempt to limit the
      economic damage to the beef and diary industries has instead turned the
      bird flu into a major and expanding calamity for both those industries.
there are two developments that could end up making this the biggest
      story of 2025. first, the availability of beef and dairy products may be
      curtailed as production declines due to sick and dying animals. so far,
      most dairy cattle survive the infection—only 2 to 5 percent die—but milk
      production declines by 20 percent. that kind of decline would be a big hit
      for the dairy market as the disease spreads to cattle practically
      everywhere.

when governments speculate: orange county, british gold and bitcoin reserves





there can be few fields of human endeavor in which history counts for
        so little as in the world of finance. past experience, to the extent
        that it is part of memory at all, is dismissed as the primitive refuge
        of those who do not have the insight to appreciate the incredible
        wonders of the present. only after the speculative collapse does the
        truth emerge.

                     —john kenneth galbraith, a short history of financial
      euphoria, 1990
all the recent talk about government bitcoin reserves has
      gotten me thinking about what happens when governments speculate.
by the time governments decide to take the plunge to make money by
      speculating, whatever craze they are joining is likely nearing an
      important and very bad turning point that will lead to regret. this is
      because in their actions governments are by nature conservative in the
      ordinary sense of the word and tend to follow rather than lead investment trends after long delays. (sometimes, as you will see below, the opposite happens: governments sell assets at the bottom believing low prices signal that such assets are no longer useful or relevant. they thereby miss out on the next bull market proving that their timing is backwards at both market extremes.)
government employees' conservatism in action comes from being constrained by a web of rules that tell them
      what to do and when to do it. this is no more the case than in the
      management of government treasuries. that money is there to be spent on
      things the elected representatives decide to spend it on. in the meantime,
      it should be invested in low-risk securities with a very low likelihood of
      default, and that usually means investing in government securities of
      short duration. that also means low returns. but accepting such returns is
      said to be justified by the desire to make sure no money is lost.
