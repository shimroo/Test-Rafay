loving life: the morality of self-interest and the facts that support it this is an excellent first introduction to objectivism, the philosophy of ayn rand. loving life demonstrates that morality is a matter not of divine revelation or social convention or personal opinion -- but, rather, of the factual requirements of human life and happiness. biddle shows how a true morality is derived logically from observable facts, what in essence such a morality demands, and why it is a matter of pure self-interest.



   
free market revolution: how ayn rand's ideas can end big government a look at how our current crises are caused by too much government, and how ayn rand's bold defense of free markets can help us change course.



   
the financial crisis and the free market cure:  why pure capitalism is the world economy's only hope
 not only is free market capitalism good for the economy, says industry expert john allison, it is our only hope for recovery. as the nation’s longest-serving ceo of a top-25 financial institution, allison has had a unique inside view of the events leading up to the financial crisis. he has seen the direct effect of government incentives on the real estate market. he has seen how government regulations only make matters worse.



   
the dim hypothesis: why the lights of the west are going out with his groundbreaking and controversial dim hypothesis, dr. leonard peikoff casts a penetrating new light on the process of human thought, and thereby on western culture and history.



   
objectivism: the philosophy of ayn rand  this is a philosophic discussion of objectivism. it is written as academic philosophers might describe and debate philosophic thought. more thorough but also harder reading than loving life.



   
the virtue of selfishness ayn rand here sets forth the moral principles of objectivism, the philosophy that holds man's life--the life proper to a rational being--as the standard of moral values and regards altruism as incompatible with man's nature, with the creative requirements of his survival, and with a free society. 



   
capitalism: the unknown ideal the foundations of capitalism are being battered by a flood of altruism, which is the cause of the modern world's collapse. this is the view of ayn rand, a view so radically opposed to prevailing attitudes that it constitutes a major philosophic revolution. in this series of essays, she presents her stand on the persecution of big business, the causes of war, the default of conservatism, and the evils of altruism. here is a challenging new look at modern society by one of the most provocative intellectuals on the american scene. 



   
 introduction to objectivist epistemology: expanded second edition today man's mind is under attack by all the leading schools of philosophy. we are told that we cannot trust our senses, that logic is arbitrary, that concepts have no basis in reality. ayn rand opposes that torrent of nihilism, and she provides the alternative in this eloquent presentation of the essential nature--and power--of man's conceptual faculty. she offers a startlingly original solution to the problem that brought about the collapse of modern philosophy: the problem of universals. this brilliantly argued, superbly written work, together with an essay by philosophy professor leonard peikoff, is vital reading for all those who seek to discover that human beings can and should live by the guidance of reason.
           

    of course, rand's atlas shrugged (see below) is the fictional work where she first expressed a near complete description of her objectivist philosophy. it is a complex story and most find it a pleasurable read. it is a book of about 1000 pages, so a committment is required to complete the reading. rand's discussions of her philosophy are provided as lengthy soliquies, with the longest description of the philosophy appearing in the last 100 pages or so. if you are interested, the story describes a near future that is uncannily similar to our current situation. if you're more interested in learning about objectivism and how it might be applied to your own life, the above list of books is a good begining. 



   
atlas shrugged with this acclaimed work and its immortal query, "who is john galt?", ayn rand found the perfect artistic form to express her vision of existence. atlas shrugged made rand not only one of the most popular novelists of the century, but one of its most influential thinkers. 

      

      atlas shrugged is the astounding story of a man who said that he would stop the motor of the world--and did. tremendous in scope, breathtaking in its suspense, atlas shrugged stretches the boundaries further than any book you have ever read. it is a mystery, not about the murder of a man's body, but about the murder--and rebirth--of man's spirit. 

      

      atlas shrugged is the "second most influential book for americans today" after the bible, according to a joint survey conducted by the library of congress and the book of the month club
