monsters, inc.

animated movies





  plot monstropolis is a city populated entirely by monsters. the world can be connected to children's bedrooms in the human world through closet doors. when a door is properly activated, it becomes a portal between the monster world and the human world. the city's power supply is provided by monsters, inc., a power plant that employs monsters to scare children and extract energy from their screams. the company has a large warehouse full of doors, work areas called "scare floors" where the doors are activated, and a special training room in which employees practice their scare skills. the company's best scarer is james p. "sulley" sullivan (goodman), whose assistant is his best friend and room mate michael "mike" wazowski (crystal). sulley's main rival is randall boggs (buscemi), but enjoys a patronizing relationship with the company's ceo, henry j. waternoose iii (coburn), who likes sulley because of his scaring ability. waternooses also worried about an energy crisis because children are harder to scare than they used to be.  one day, sulley finds an activated door on his scare floor after the workday has ended. he finds no one in the room behind the door, but a little two-year-old girl (gibbs) follows him back into the monster world. far from being scared, she calls him "kitty" and delights in playing with him. since monsters think humans are lethally toxic, sulley tries repeatedly to return the girl to her room, but she keeps following him back, and randall eventually deactivates and stores the door, leaving the girl stuck in the monster world. the girl's presence becomes public knowledge after sulley sneaks her into a restaurant to find mike, so they hide her in their home while the child detection agency (cda) searches for her. sulley decides to call the girl "boo", and he slowly bonds with her after realizing that she is not poisonous. he also discovers that her laughter produces even more energy than her screams.  the next morning, sulley and mike disguise boo in a monster costume and sneak her into work. randall agrees to help them return her to her bedroom, but when mike enters the room, randall captures him in a box, believing he is boo. randall intends to kidnap boo and subject her to a device that extracts her screams.  what follows is a sequence of battles, chases, and accidents in which sulley and mike attempt to protect boo from randall and his scream machine. waternoose reveals that he is in cahoots with randall and exiles sulley and mike to the himalayas, where they meet the abominable snowman (john ratzenberger). sulley and mike return to the monster world through a village at the foot of the mountain, where randall chases them through the company's roller-coaster-like door-moving system. when the energy in boo's laughter activates the doors in storage, the chase passes in and out of the human world. finally, sulley and boo defeat randall. sulley throws randall through the door of a trailer-park trailer, where a woman beats randall with a shovel, and mike destroys the door to make sure randall never comes back.  just as sulley and mike attempt to return boo to her home, waternoose and the cda call her door to the scare floor, ready to arrest them, but mike leads the agents away by fleeing with boo's monster costume, and sulley flees with boo and the door. when waternoose follows sulley and boo, sulley attempts to set up and activate the door, and when waternoose follows them through the door, he tells sulley he is willing to kidnap children in order to save the company. however, sulley had not properly activated boo's door, causing the three to actually wind up in the adjacent monsters, inc. training room, which is equipped with a video monitoring system. mike has recorded waternoose's confession, and after he replays the confession, cda agents arrest waternoose.  with the scream-machine plot foiled, the cda agents call in their leader, who is revealed to be roz (bob peterson), the company's bookkeeper who was working undercover at monsters inc. mike says goodbye to boo and sulley returns her to her bedroom, then roz has the door shredded, preventing monsters from ever visiting boo again. sulley keeps one of the wood splinters as a memento.  some time later, sulley becomes the ceo of monsters, inc., and the company has ended the energy crisis with his policy of making children laugh instead of scaring them. meanwhile, mike has collected and reassembled the pieces of boo's shredded door. when sulley puts his piece in its place, the door is activated again, and when he peeks into boo's room, she greets him.

10 health habits that will help you live to 100

health tips





the biggest factor that determines how well you age is not your genes but how well you live. not convinced? a new study published in the british medical journal of 20,000 british folks shows that you can cut your risk of having a stroke in half by doing the following four things: being active for 30 minutes a day, eating five daily servings of fruit and vegetables, and avoiding cigarettes and excess alcohol. while those are some of the obvious steps you can take to age well, researchers have discovered that centenarians tend to share certain traits in how they eat, move about, and deal with stress—the sorts of things we can emulate to improve our own aging process. of course, getting to age 100 is enormously more likely if your parents did. still, thomas perls, who studies the century-plus set at boston university school of medicine, believes that assuming you've sidestepped genes for truly fatal diseases like huntington's, "there's nothing stopping you from living independently well into your 90s." heck, if your parents and grandparents were heavy smokers, they might have died prematurely without ever reaching their true potential lifespan, so go ahead and shoot for those triple digits.  1. don't retire.  "evidence shows that in societies where people stop working abruptly, the incidence of obesity and chronic disease skyrockets after retirement," says luigi ferrucci, director of the baltimore longitudinal study of aging. the chianti region of italy, which has a high percentage of centenarians, has a different take on leisure time. "after people retire from their jobs, they spend most of the day working on their little farm, cultivating grapes or vegetables," he says. "they're never really inactive." farming isn't for you? .  2. floss every day.  that may help keep your arteries healthy. a 2008 new york university study showed that daily flossing reduced the amount of gum-disease-causing bacteria in the mouth. this bacteria is thought to enter the bloodstream and trigger inflammation in the arteries, a major risk factor for heart  disease. other research has shown that those who have high amounts of bacteria in their mouth are more likely to have thickening in their arteries, another sign of heart diesease. "i really do think people should floss twice a day to get the biggest life expectancy benefits," stresses perls.  3. move around.  "exercise is the only real fountain of youth that exists," says jay olshansky, a professor of medicine and aging researcher at the university of illinois at chicago. "it's like the oil and lube job for your car. you don't have to do it, but your car will definitely run better." study after study has documented the benefits of exercise to improve your mood, mental acuity, balance, muscle mass, and bones. "and the benefits kick in immediately after your first workout," olshansky adds. don't worry if you're not a gym rat. those who see the biggest payoffs are the ones who go from doing nothing to simply walking around the neighborhood or local mall for about 30 minutes a day. building muscle with resistance training is also ideal, but yoga classes can give you similar strength-training effects if you're not into weight lifting.  4. eat a fiber-rich cereal for breakfast.  getting a serving of whole-grains, especially in the morning, appears to help older folks maintain stable blood sugar levels throughout the day, according to a recent study conducted by ferrucci and his colleagues. "those who do this have a lower incidence of diabetes, a known accelerator of aging," he says.  5. get at least six hours of shut-eye.  instead of skimping on sleep to add more hours to your day, get more to add years to your life. "sleep is one of the most important functions that our body uses to regulate and heal cells," says ferrucci. "we've calculated that the minimum amount of sleep that older people need to get those healing rem phases is about six hours." those who reach the century mark make sleep a top priority.  6. consume whole foods, not supplements.  strong evidence suggests that people who have high blood levels of certain nutrients—selenium, beta-carotene, vitamins c and e—age much better and have a slower rate of cognitive decline. unfortunately, there's no evidence that taking pills with these nutrients provides those antiaging benefits. "there are more than 200 different carotenoids and 200 different flavonoids in a single tomato," points out ferrucci, "and these chemicals can all have complex interactions that foster health beyond the single nutrients we know about like lycopene or vitamin c." avoid nutrient-lacking white foods (breads, flour, sugar) and go for all those colorful fruits and vegetables and dark whole-grain breads and cereals with their host of hidden nutrients.  7. be less neurotic.  it may work for woody allen, who infuses his worries with a healthy dose of humor, but the rest of us neurotics may want to find a new way to deal with stress. "we have a new study coming out that shows that centenarians tend not to internalize things or dwell on their troubles," says perls. "they are great at rolling with the punches." if this inborn trait is hard to overcome, find better ways to manage when you're stressed: yoga, exercise, meditation, tai chi, or just deep breathing for a few moments are all good. ruminating, eating chips in front of the tv, binge drinking? bad, very bad.  8. live like a seventh day adventist .  americans who define themselves as seventh day adventists have an average life expectancy of 89, about a decade longer than the average american. one of the basic tenets of the religion is that it's important to cherish the body that's on loan from god, which means no smoking, alcohol abuse, or overindulging in sweets. followers typically stick to a vegetarian diet based on fruits, vegetables, beans, and nuts, and get plenty of exercise. they're also very focused on family and community.  9. be a creature of habit.  centenarians tend to live by strict routines, says olshansky, eating the same kind of diet and doing the same kinds of activities their whole lives. going to bed and waking up at the same time each day is another good habit to keep your body in the steady equilibrium that can be easily disrupted as you get on in years. "your physiology becomes frailer when you get older," explains ferrucci, "and it's harder for your body to bounce back if you, say, miss a few hours of sleep one night or drink too much alcohol." this can weaken immune defenses, leaving you more susceptible to circulating flu viruses or bacterial infections.  10. stay connected.  having regular social contacts with friends and loved ones is key to avoiding depression, which can lead to premature death, something that's particularly prevalent in elderly widows and widowers. some psychologists even think that one of the biggest benefits elderly folks get from exercise the strong social interactions that come from walking with a buddy or taking a group exercise class. having a daily connection with a close friend or family member gives older folks the added benefit of having someone watch their back. "they'll tell you if they think your memory is going or if you seem more withdrawn," says perls, "and they might push you to see a doctor before you recognize that you need to see one yourself."

history’s most influential desks








labels:
inspirational





bill gates the first thing you notice when you walk into this office is that there are three monitors on the desk that are synchronized from a single desktop computer. the next thing you notice is that there is very little paper. with his personalized computer system, the founder and ceo of microsoft can easily move items from one screen to another at his whim. with such a large display area, who would ever be satisfied with a traditional one monitor system again?   gates does, maintain one ‘low-tech’ item of office equipment in his office – a whiteboard which he says is great for brainstorming, whether alone or with others in the room. it is always fully stocked with lots of colored pens, and ready for action whenever a brilliant new idea begins to bubble to the surface.   resolute desk – home of the president when president barack obama took the oath of office nearly a year ago, he inherited more than a war, a bad economy and runaway unemployment. he also inherited the oval office and the resolute desk, by far one of the most famous desks in the world. it was built from timber that was originally used in the british ship, resolute. the desk was presented by queen victoria as a gift to president rutherford b. hayes.   the desk is now a fixture in the oval office of and has been used by almost every us president since hayes. the exceptions are presidents lyndon johnson, nixon and ford. of the presidents who did use the resolute desk, however, some chose to use it in their private studies rather than the more formal and historic oval office.    the desk was modified to accommodate president franklin roosevelt, who had it placed atop a two inch base to accommodate his wheelchair. because he preferred that people not see his leg braces while tending to the business of running the nation, fdr had also requested that the kneehole be fitted with a modesty panel bearing the presidential seal. however, he passed away before it was actually installed.  hitler’s desk rumor has it that the desk members of the dorset regiment removed the desk used by adolf hitler during world war ii from his headquarters and donated it to the regimental museum at the keep in dorchester, england. it is seen here as it appears in the museum, adorned with the nazi flag, other nazi memorabilia and a framed photo of the dictator, himself.   einstein’s desk life magazine published these photos of the princeton office used by albert einstein just a few months before his death in 1955. the paper strewn desk, the unkempt bookcases, the chalkboard displaying of equations, and even the pipe carelessly tossed on top of an notebook, capture the essence of the man who has become known as the world most renowned genius.   steve wozniak/steve jobs desk the office of the brains behind the apple computer empire looks more like a garage, a warehouse, or perhaps even a refuse center. the king of the nerds’ workspace is cluttered, and to the unenlightened eye, disorganized. however, in this case, a cluttered desk truly means a busy mind. steve wozniak reigns supreme in what most people would consider to be the messiest office on the planet… or is it his partner… the other computer geek named steve – none other than apple co-founder, steve jobs?       shakespeare’s desk although he never claimed authorship of the many plays now attributed to him during his lifetime, there is very little doubt that william shakespeare actually wrote most of them at this very desk located in his home in stratford upon-avon   warren buffets desk you would be surprised to discover how ordinary billionaire warren buffet’s omaha, nebraska, office is. his office has no computer, no stock terminal or any of the other accessories one might expect to see in the office of a person as powerful as this. he doesn’t even have a calculator in his office. he keeps the television in his office tuned to financial news network, cnbc, but the volume is muted. while he sometimes takes a mobile phone with him when he travels, buffet refuses to use one while in his home town. instead, he uses two black telephones that sit unobtrusively on the cabinet behind his desk – both of which are direct lines to his wall street stock brokers in new york.   gandhi desk the father of peaceful confrontation, mahatma gandhi had no computer or any of the other items now considered to be essential for an office or desk. in fact, he liked to sit on the floor. to accommodate this preference, he had a very low desk. ghandi perched himself at his low slung desk to write letters to world leaders urging them to seek peaceful resolution to conflicts, including the famous letters to adolf hitler.   charles dickens desk when it was sold in auction last year, the desk used by charles dickens to write great expectations and all of his final correspondence just hours before his death brought in £433,250 ($894,000us).   the irish entrepreneur who bought it said that the price was a bargain for a piece of literary history such as this.   winston churchill’s desk    toward the end of world war ii, british prime minister, winston churchill asked the prime minister of australian to send him a live platypus for his amusement and to lift his spirits. sadly, however, the animal, which was given the name ‘winston,’ died before completing the long journey from australia to england. not to be dissuaded, churchill contacted a taxidermist who stuffed the animal and kept it on his desk for the rest of the war
