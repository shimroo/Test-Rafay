   about the los angeles fsc

the los angeles figure skating club, founded in 1933, is a member of the united states figure skating association. home to more than 70 national, world and olympic champions, the club is one of the largest and most notable in the united states.all of our rinks host a thriving community of skaters and their families. we have always tried to provide for every level of our changing sport. we sponsor four major competitions each year: the adult mid-winter warmup open championships in february, the california championships in may, the los angeles open championships in july, and the ground-breaking theatrical skating competition, la showcase for skaters in june.additionally, we promote theatre on ice, offer critiques to our competitive skaters and sponsor exhibition nights. we have opportunities for judges, coaches, skaters, and parents to learn the nuances of our sport, and we offer a complete program of us figure skating tests. at the grassroots level, we sponsor occasional “parent’s meetings” to aid those who are new to skating, so that they may understand what it is all about.
