                                                                              dear
brothers and sister.                                                                                                             

it is with great sadness and great
grief that i have to inform you that khalid has passed away, on 
thursday 28th november
2013.

may allah bless his sole, and make
him amoung the guided ones. 
may allah raise his status, ya allah forgive khalid and make his grave wide and
full of light.
the
prophet (peace and blessings of allah be upon him) said: “when a man dies, all his deeds come to a
halt apart from three: ongoing charity (sadaqah jaariyah), beneficial knowledge
or a righteous child who will pray for him.”
 
this site will still be maintained
by his brother and friend lateef (e-mail: lateef@live.co.uk)
