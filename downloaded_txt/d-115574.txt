about us


Â 



welcome to:







company mission:
the best things is focused on selling the very finest quality antique and vintage items in all of the categories that we offer.  we are not interested in being a high volume business.  all of the products we sell are carefully vetted to meet our rigorous standards.  then they are described with painstaking accuracy.  this is a retirement business but we keep doing it because we love buying great antiques and making customers happy providing them with heirloom quality antiques at realistic prices.
