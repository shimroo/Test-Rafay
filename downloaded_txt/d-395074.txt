what is the orthodox church?
“the orthodox christian church is evangelical, but not protestant.it is orthodox, but not jewish. it is catholic, but not roman.it is not denominational, it is pre-denominational.it has believed, taught, preserved, defended, and died for thefaith of the apostles since the day of pentecost nearly 2,000 years ago.”– our life in christ
