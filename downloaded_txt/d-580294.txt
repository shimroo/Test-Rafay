          one department, many paths to a career
      


the biological sciences have undergone tremendous expansion in recent decades with the development of exciting new discoveries and technologies. these developments have advanced fundamental knowledge in cell and molecular biology, as well as advancing knowledge in biomedical science, leading to new approaches to treating disease.




















          programs
      


undergraduate students in the program choose courses from among a wide range of research fields to both develop a solid foundation in biology and to build meaningful depth of study in areas of personal interest. in addition to formal lecture and lab courses, students have many opportunities for independent study through seminar courses and research with our outstanding faculty.
graduate students can choose an ms or phd program. both programs stress the importance of the research experience and its value to critical thinking. students choose from research tracks that have specific course and research requirements that aim to build depth of study in specific focal areas: cellular and molecular biology, and neurobiology.

etchegaray and gao labs examine gene regulation and its role in preventing gastrointestinal diseases















patent by dr. pabitra sahoo.



targeting g3bp aggregation to prevent neurodegeneration
dr. sahoo's g3bp1-derived peptide rescues multiple in vitro modelled neurodegenerative diseases, such as alzheimers, parkinson, and als.

recent highlights



award-winning poster presentation, tran lab
adefemi baderinwa, a graduate student in the tran lab, won first prize for her poster presentation at the 2024 fall symposium of rutgers brain health institute. congratulations, adefemi!
















publication from friedman lab



"oligodendrocyte progenitor development from the postnatal rat subventricular zone is regulated by the p75 neurotrophin receptor"
this paper from the thesis work of subhashini joshi, who graduated in 2022, demonstrates that the absence of the p75 neurotrophin receptor from developing oligodendrocyte progenitors leads to their premature exit from the cell cycle and accelerated differentiation, causing abnormalities in early myelination.














publication from friedman lab



"cortical brain injury causes retrograde degeneration of afferent basal forebrain cholinergic neurons via p75ntr"
this paper from the thesis work of srestha dasgupta, who graduated in 2023,  demonstrates that traumatic brain injury not only causes the loss of neurons at the injury site, but also elicits the retrograde degeneration of specific neurons that project their axons to the injury site from a distal location.














year-end celebration and ugly sweater contest!
