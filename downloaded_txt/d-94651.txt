custom metal buildings and steel garages

real stories, real results








daniel stevens






the owner and i set out to build a 1 car garage with a 2 car carport integrated all into 1. turned out fantastic and has been a nice addition to my property.












sherri simpson






had a great experience with having my carport installed with this company. especially to be able to have a 5 ft. opening to my patio. thank you ben and the crew who came to install it for being so patient with me. please see attached pictures.













high score media, llc kings of sound






professional, from the front end, communication, and efficient install.thanks!










phillip hudson






i can't say enough good things about my georgia portable building carport! this thing is really solid! i ordered the 140 mph wind load because the wind here gets pretty bad sometimes so they added big mobile home anchors along the sides and we've already experienced 40 mph winds without a shudder! i got a 22 x 46 x 12 with 3 enclosed sides for my 40 ft motorhome and i love having all the extra room! one last thing i have to say, kudos for a well thought out website, one of the best i've ever run across.













sam c.






very thorough ordering process. iâm hoping to be able to modify/change options if needed. not actually ready to order due to not knowing price and other details.

ron c.






liz is amazing and really made my purchase experience personal and idealized to my specific request. other than the engineer prints delay the process has been good








ronnie s.






this whole process was so easy! we ordered online, received a call back very quickly on what the next step was to be. paid our deposit and thought we'd have to wait 6-8 weeks.we got a call that they installers would be in our area, so the time from paying the down payment to installation was less that 3 weeks. the installers were quick and efficient! we are very pleased with our camper cover!








bob m.






all went well with the purchase and installation. the wait time from order to delivery was right at 8 weeks. the installation did not start until late in the afternoon due to issues with previous deliveries but they did finish that day, though it got dark about 45 minutes before they were done. the crew was pleasant and easy to work with. they answered my questions when i saw something i didn't understand and asked about it.
