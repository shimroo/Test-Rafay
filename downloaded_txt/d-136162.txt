testimonials






what our clients say









what’s a better way to start the spring and summer seasons than with a new fence? we had the great pleasure of working with joe and ffc fence this spring for a full yard fence install.they were amazing! the crew came early, worked efficiently and cleaned up every day. you can barely tell that there were post holes dug! they left no messy dirt or damage to the yard. it was a fantastic experience and i would highly recommend giving joe a call!

tobbi g.




was looking to have a section of my yard fenced off for the dogs. called around for pricing and ffc was the only one to call me back and come out to measure for an estimate. i had talked to others that had fences installed and had so i had an idea on how much to expect. josh and the team were very professional and came in under budget! they had the fence installed in two days. fence looks great and the dogs couldn't be happier.

lynn c.




came out very quickly to give estimate after contacting. had plenty of options available to work with my material and color preferences. work crew was professional and did a great job with installation while being as minimally disruptive as possible. would highly recommend for any major fence projects. thank you again for the work.
