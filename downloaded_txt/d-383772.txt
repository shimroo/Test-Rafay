like old zach wrote earlier, we are finally closing this thing down.  it's been a good run that's provided a lot of enjoyment and many new relationships for us on the blog.  i hope we have been a source of enjoyment or edification for some, heartache for certain others and a source of information for more.   it's amazing to see how much the virginia blogosphere has developed over the last 16 months that we have been in it.  it's been exciting to be among those on the cutting edge of this media frontier.upon much discussion and debate among our members,  we have decided to shut it down.  we started this to contribute to the discussion and debate ongoing during the republican primary races and then promote the election of those candidates.  last fall's election wasn't quite as successful as we had wished, but the election of two statewide republican candidates was an improvement, and mcdonnell pulling out the recount allowed us all to breathe a sigh of relief.old zach has addressed some of the numerous issues facing the republican party in virginia and nationally in his last few posts, and i echo his sentiments that we have many challenges facing us that we will take delicate and painstakingi personally no longer have the time to make this blog a priority.  unfortunately, sometimes we have to make decisions as to where our time is most needed and most valuable.  i no longer believe my time is most valuable spent in blogging on virginia politics.  it may once again become so, but this is not the time.  and i have no desire to get caught up in the inward looking discussion of the blogosphere that exists right now.as i graduate from uva law school this may, go active with the air force jag corps, and get married to a spectacular young woman, i have to make prioritization changes so that i fulfill my obligations and duties in the things that really matter in an honorable manner.  you will soon see me involved in virginia politics once again, but it probably won't be on a blog.i wish you all good luck and i hope all of you keep involved in virginia politics, making this state i love so much a better place to live.addison adds:i obviously tapped out a few months earlier that zach and lh, but it was for the same reasons.  i enjoyed the opportunity to articulate my viewpoints, and i think that it has made me a better advocate in my off-line incarnation.thanks for reading.

	 bolten
	 
    


no "outside gray-beard" like so many nattering nabobs in the msm have been calling for, today's shake-up in the president's most inner circle brings in a distinctly un-washington character.thank you to howling latina, at the new virginia progressive group blog, for pointing out this now-ancient 2001 business week article. while this "mumbling honky" definitely agrees it is worth noting that mr. bolten has been sighted "canoodling" with ms. derek, i think the ultimate value of this piece is that it gives us a chance to see what the convention wisdom on bolten was, as opposed to what it has become in the hours since he was named cos. the whole article is worth many reads- but two things stand out to me:1. the charlie norwood anecdote certainly doesn't bode well for the administration's interactions with congress, but at least we can be sure that bush didn't cave in to rep. tom davis with this pick.2." with many of his colleagues preoccupied by the war on terrorism, the secretive bolten is more valuable than ever as he works to keep the rest of the bush agenda moving. but he'd rather the outside world not know." when the president's approval ratings where they are, with a country that now apparently trusts democrats on taxes more than republicans, i hope that bolten has developed some taste for engaging the public.

	 north korea's perfect people
	 
    


interesting article a friend sent me showing how north korea kills at birth all infants who are born with birth defects or deformities in order to purify the race and ensure that they aren't a burden on the already starving and malnourished people of north korea.  pretty amazing where these things lead.

	 mccain- the only alternative on iraq?
	 
    


inspired by oz's post, it's occurred to me recently that there's only a semantic difference between the president's position on iraq, and that of his toughest critics. the honorable john murtha and most democrats in congress call for the announcement of a timetable of withdrawal, but usually leave plenty of room for the extension of that timetable. the president and most republicans (rightly) refuse to announce a timetable, but end up frequently dropping hints and clues as to how long they are planning to stay. but not john mccain. the only guy who isn't calling for a draw-down in '06, lays out his iraq strategy fairly well in this october 2005 op-ed.if there's one reason i can overcome the pain in my stomach i feel everytime i hears someone say "bick-rah" (bipartisan campaign reform act, which is next only to the alien and sedition act in terms of rank heinosity) it's that he may be the strongest, clearest, voice on iraq.

	 remembering tom fox
	 
    


tom fox was a truly extra-ordinary man. killed last week in iraq after being taken hostage 4 months ago in baghdad, the sprinfield, va quaker and peace activist had been keeping a blog of his time in iraq, living outside the "secure" part of baghdad since september 2004, at http://waitinginthelight.blogspot.com/. fox is eulogized in this connection newspaper editorial. fox's life story, which is well-covered in this connection newspaper article, is particularly amazing and inspiring. a friend said fox would've wanted to be thought of as an ordinary man, but i doubt that friend or many others would agree. i have never been a man of extraordinary faith, but a life like this one, an seemingly average joe (a grocery store assistant manager) who answered a higher calling and did something incredible, inspires me to take a closer examination of my spirituality and relationship to god. it should also inspire all of us to clear our eyes, minds, and hearts from the fog of this war, and look for solutions that bring about peace.i have been a supporter of the intervention in iraq since it was announced by the president. i continue to support the presence of the u.s. military in iraq, but those of us who stand for those american values, those of us who believe in the shining city on the hill, those of us who believe that our men and women are sacrificing there lives for the betterment of the iraqi people and the safety and security of the world would do well to hold dear to our hearts the memories, principles, and words of tom fox.the only “something in my life” i can hold onto is to do what little i can to bring about the creation of the peaceable realm of god. it is my sense that such a realm will always have natural disasters. it is the “man-made” disasters that we are called upon to bring to and end.

	 what is hidden will be made known
	 
    


as we watch barry bonds' reputation fall apart as the truth comes out about his use of steroids ever since the 1998 season, it just reminds me of how true matthew 10:26-27 is:fear not, for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and nothing hidden that will not be made known. what i tell you in darkness, you will speak in the light, and what i whisper in your ear, you shall preach on the rooftops.
