ford 
        gt 40 
the original 
      gt 40 was one of the most revolutionary race cars in history. one of the 
      first mid engine race cars, it's design set the trend for future mid engine 
      cars. it used a monocoque design and a new system of construction where 
      molding and bonding were used as in the aircraft industy. it exceeded 200 
      mph down the mulsanne straight at le mans and versions of it won there four 
      times. the one pictured above is the late model recreation.    
  

dodge daytona

the dodge daytona was 
      one of the most potent and aerodynamic cars in the stock car circuit during 
      its day. the history of stock car and nascar goes back to the late forties 
      and fifties when moonshine runners hopped up their cars to outrace the law. 
      it took many decades of rule changes to get to the cars we see today. stock 
      meant that it was a car from the factory and not a racecar in the traditional 
      sense built from the ground up. small modifications were made but basically 
      it was a car that most anybody could own.  


a 
        positive charge

the audi r8 is built on the same chassis as the gallardo 
        but with a different body style that is more teutonic than italian.
