			        what you don’t see
 february 13, 2024

in september of 2023 i took down brianna.org for the first time in (gasp) 25 years. and i left it down.
it wasn’t a premeditated act or anything other than the vps i had hosted this site and my main business site on for many years had been acquired by a new host and the price bumped up absurdly and i thought well, i can just spin up a droplet on digitalocean where i do most of my friend-hosting and experimenting nowadays.
then i realized my backup from the old host was mislabelled and i had lost about 500 posts.
then i remembered my ancient external drive and found 497 of those posts.
then archive.org helped me restore the missing 3 posts and some of the images.
all of this to say, in between i used the downtime as an excuse to rebuild string theory as a block theme, which was simple and pretty straightforward and almost no fun at all, and i built a test brianna.org lunch break theme with it and that also didn’t hit the old dopamine receptors like it used to. so i decided to put up the old stuff so google remembers i exist, even the embarassing stuff about my feelings, old feelings. and that’s where we are today.
brianna.org is now hosted on the technosiren.blog network where i host cool cats like rae mariz and kathryn pinker and is no longer costing me $75/mo so, hooray. am i still experimenting on the web? you know it. am i doing it at this domain? not really. consider this a historical, though living, document. kind of like a citroen whizzing around the roman colosseum.
