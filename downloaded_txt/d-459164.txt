uccw is for educators, scientists, students and the public

utah center for climate and weather (uccw) is a premier site for anyone wanting accurate information about utah's climate and weather. the uccw is a cooperative effort among educators and scientists to share accurate and useful information with students and the general public about utah's past, present and future climate and weather. cooperation and collaboration-not competition or commercialism-is the driving force behind the uccw. all uccw contributors are non-paid volunteers. the current director of the uccw is daniel w. pope and the site is maintained by matt pope.

all professionals involved in the atmospheric sciences are invited to freely submit appropriate material and links for consideration of inclusion on uccw's website.
