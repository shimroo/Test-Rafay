ppp - peter's pilot pages



.









 







 
thanks
alot ...
...
for visiting my pages all the years!!! in 1997 i just thought it might
be a nice idea, to review my first palm a bit more from the technical
side, once i had it apart anyway. then the whole project grew 'a
bit', sometime i feel beyond my influence
:). that's nearly 10 years ago now and the palm world changed alot. in
fact i think, palmos lost to many battles and we won't see alot more
palmos driven devices in the future (just my 2 cents!).
but
my
life changed a bit too, i grew 10 years older and the days seem to
shorten, so does the free time (probably everything takes longer, once
you're an old man <g>). i always drove ppp as a pure private
site, i refused to take a single cent for ads, i wanted to keep it
neutral (yes, i had good offers). to make a long story short, ppp will
remain online as long as possible, but i won't update it anymore or
only very, very 'sparsely'.

again, thanks for all the feedback, greetings and ideas i got from all
over the world - it was nice to have you :).
