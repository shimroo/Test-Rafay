								 ssqq travel 
										is run by 
								
										rick archer and 

										marla archer.  ssqq 
										travel began in 1998 as an offshoot of ssqq 
										
 dance studio in houston, texas.  dancing 
										has played a major role in every 
										trip.  marla 
										archer works  
 as a full-time travel agent. over the past 15 years, rick and marla have taken 
										

										50 group cruise adventures 
 and booked over 2,500 passengers.  we haven't lost one yet, but you could always be the first!    
 in addition to booking all ssqq cruise trips, marla is available to help with 

										individual trips as well.

										rick archer sold ssqq in 2010.  
										however, in retirement he teaches one 
										night a week on mondays at chapelwood methodist church.   
										his monday class varies monthly from 
										western to swing and ballroom.   
										class size varies between 20 and 40.

										chapelwood and tell his stories.  to receive this newsletter, email
