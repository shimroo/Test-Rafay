it is only november 9 and i am all decorated for christmas!





i never like to wait for the last minute because it takes me a few days to decorate.  i am now done, but i will not turn on the lights until the day after thanksgiving.  i have not done any christmas decor in the family room, and we will not be using these rooms until december, so it is all good.

lionheart asiatic lily





 i am totally giddy over the number of these lionheart asiatic lilies that are soon to bloom in this container on my deck. these lilies are black in the center with yellow-tipped edges. these are the only lilies that bloom consistently for me. that is because they are up on the deck and the deer and rabbits have (so far) not ventured up to eat them!



holy smokes!  i just counted a total of 94 buds!! wow. there are only two 2-gallon containers in this barrel. cannot wait to see them bloom.

spirea goldmound





i have 7 spirea goldmound shubs in my perennial gardens.  i just love the golden yellow color before it blooms.



they are such a bright spot of delight every time i walk through the gardens.


they have gorgeous pink flowers. the pink only lasts about two weeks. this is the same spirea as the one in the pic above.

fabric carrots for easter decor





this year i made fabric carrots and had so much fun with them!


i put them on top of my largest hutch with a few wooden bunnies that my late uncle made.


i added a few real eggs that i decorated at least 25 years ago. it amazes me that they have lasted this long.  i break a few each year, but luckily i made dozens of them.


i made lots of bunnies that i have scattered around.


this year i bought some new pillow covers and i thrifted that cake stand a few ago.  it worked perfectly for the bunny vignette. 


even though i am not hosting an easter event, i have still been enjoying these two rooms for the past weeks.  i just do it for hubs and myself and now to share with anyone who stumbles across my blog.

about me





diana lamarre


michigan, united states
i am so glad you stopped by to visit my garden. i garden in lower northern michigan (zone 5)  in far less than ideal conditions. i have too many pine trees, too much shade, too many rocks, herds of hosta-munching deer and  rabbits who think my lilly buds are gourmet appetizers. i am by no means an expert in horticulture or garden design--just an amateur with a shovel and a passion.  my garden changes daily during the summer and i will be updating frequently. 
during the winter months, i blog about my favorite cold-weather hobby--quilting and just my everyday musings.
i hope you enjoy your visit, and that you will come back soon.
