      we are largely retired now, but offer the occasional antique barometer and navigational and astronomical instruments such as antique sun dials and surveying tools. our catalogs of  barometers and instruments  include pictures and descriptions. 

in the spirit of the web, we provide relevant but hard-to-find information in our technical section; this is where insights about the care and feeding of longcase clocks and barometers can be found-- e.g. if your barometer's mercury is indeed toxic, and how to use that instrument effectively.
