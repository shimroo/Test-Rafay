type 1 diabetes
in type 1 diabetes the pancreas fails to produce insulin, a hormone which transports sugar (glucose) from foods into the body’s cells, where it can be used to produce energy.
if insulin is not produced by the pancreas, glucose builds up in the bloodstream instead of getting into the body's cells, causing high blood glucose levels which can lead to serious complications. 
people of all ages are affected by type 1 diabetes and treatment is usually required for life. thankfully, type 1 diabetes is now a perfectly manageable condition and range of treatment methods are available to help people live healthy and comfortable lives.






















type 2 diabetes 
in type 2 diabetes, the pancreas struggles to produce enough insulin, or is producing insulin which cannot be effectively used by the body (insulin resistance).
for people living with type 2 diabetes, glucose builds up in the bloodstream due to a lack of effective insulin, triggering the pancreas to release more insulin to cope. over time, this process can overwork the pancreas, which becomes less efficient at producing insulin. if too much glucose (sugar) enters the bloodstream, glucose levels may continue to rise.
