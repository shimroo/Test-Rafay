indoor air diagnostics - environmental consultants

indoor environments in modern  office buildings and homes were once thought as workplaces free of overt health  concerns. however, the aggressive movement toward energy conservation and  energy-efficient designs, can frequently subject employees and residents to  poor indoor air quality. this can result in employees feeling fatigued, low  morale, excessive absenteeism and reduced productivity. our team of  professionals provides a comprehensive and systematic approach to evaluating  and correcting indoor air quality issues. 
 




 
 
 


 
our diagnostic services are  often used by clients to determine how their facility ended up with iaq  problems. this can include destructive and non-destructive testing of building  components, air sampling as well as an extensive review of the facilityâs hvac system,  how it is maintained, its effectiveness for the current tenant use and other  mitigating factors
 




 
 


indoor air diagnostics provides comprehensive air testing  for leed compliance. because of our extensive engineering expertise we can  assist clients in solving iaq issues when attempting to achieve leed  certification.
