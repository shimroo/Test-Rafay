	comfort of the wearer, by protecting the wearer from the elements. however, 
	our garments are way more important than simply keeping us warm & 
	comfortable.  the shirts, pants, sweaters, and dresses that hang in 
	our 
	wardrobes also provide a glimpse into our lifestyle, experiences and 
	aspirations.  the clothes, handbags, belts and shoes that we wear, have in our 
	closet, or wish we owned, tell a story about who we are or who we wish to 
	become.  take some time to learn more about garments, style, and our 
	industry.
