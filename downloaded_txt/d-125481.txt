allergy discussion group
 
hoax alert:  please read this if you got an unsolicited e-mail claiming to be from anyone @immune.com

if you have an allergy, here is a free discussion group for you!

   
  welcome to the allergy discussion!    
   
 allergy discussion group on listserv@listserv.uark.edu 

the allergy group discusses all types of human allergies -
how allergies influence our health and lifestyles, treatments for
allergies from the consumer perspective and experience, self-help
prevention of allergy symptoms, allergy self-care, and support
systems.  families and friends of the allergic are also welcome!


related topics also include hives, sinusitis, asthma, itches, eczema,
rashes, sinus, nasal and respiratory difficulties, mastocytosis, etc.
these topics are fair game, especially as they relate to people
dealing with allergies in their everyday lives.

the allergy mailing list is an open, semi-moderated, free listserv
discussion list.  the allergy mailing list is seeking additional
sponsors, and will accept pre-approved commercial announcements
*strictly* related to allergies.  only the allergy list "owner"
may post commercial advertisements on the allergy mailing list.
all commercial announcements must be screened and approved in
advance by the list owner at
relevance@immune.com.

allergy welcome message always available

to learn more about the allergy online discussion group, anyone
can request a current/fresh copy
of the allergy membership guidelines and allergy rules at any
time because the allergy clerical robot will send it by e-mail
24 hours a day, seven days a week. to obtain the allergy
welcome message, send (in the text/body of your
e-mail message):


get allergy welcome
to our sweet old tireless e-mail robot at:

listserv@listserv.uark.edu
or read an old copy of the allergy welcome message right now by
 clicking here.


in keeping with the ancient internet idea that each person must
have 100% control over their own e-mail "in box," and to reduce
everyday wear and tear on the allergy manager, allergy expects
each member to turn their own account on and off for vacations, etc.

please read and follow the rules and guidelines in the allergy
welcome message. every allergy member is 100% responsible for managing
their own allergy account, so every allergy member soon learns to
deal with our simple, clerical robot (available 24 hours, seven days a week).
there is also a 24 hour web page for managing your own account:

allergy accepts plain text (ascii) e-mail only

the allergy mailing list is made up of a diverse worldwide
group of people with various computers and mail programs.
for some allergy members, when a message contains formatted
text, their e-mail program presents them with a blank message
because the e-mail program is unable to translate the
formatting.  in other cases, the mail program does the best
that it can and provides a "translation" of sorts
with all the control characters and
formatting commands spelled out (sometimes in broken english
and sometimes not) - very messy and hard to read.

if you use an e-mail program that produces html format or
other non-ascii non-plain-text output, please adjust your
program options and preferences when you send e-mail to
allergy. allergy has several hundred members, in about 40 countries,
and everyone should be able to read your message, even if their
hardware and software is very different from yours. here are
some simple instructions for adjusting two common e-mail programs:


force microsoft outlook express to
 create plain ascii text e-mail messages

force netscape communicator/composer to
 create plain ascii text e-mail messages

if you need help with getting some other e-mail program to speak
the acsii plain text language, please visit this

rootsweb problem-solving page or this informative page for help with most e-mail programs.
if you still need help, please write to the allergy
mailing list manager,
or send a test message to 
allergytest@immune.com. 


through the generosity of these web community services, the
allergy mailing list has grown for over 10 years:


this list was begun at texas agriculture & mechanical university in april 1995. we left tamu.edu in november 1999. 
 
 many allergy members 
joined the discussion group via david baker's popular lwgates. thanks david!  

and our listserv host site since 1999, the university of arkansas, makes our mailing
list possible.  thanks uark!
