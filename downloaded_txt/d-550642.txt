what our guests are saying 


























						"5/5
this is the best place to stay in lancaster! unbelievably clean (cared for by inn keepers of local people who care about their work and take pride in it. no virus here!). the accommodation was just perfect! the room was incredibly comfortable and sparkling clean to the point that it was impossible to find a tiny bit of dust anywhere. all details in the room are carefully and intentionally planned to amaze their guests. we highly recommend staying here! you will not regret it!"
