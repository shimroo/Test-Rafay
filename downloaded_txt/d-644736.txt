the secret millionaire



















































“after growing up on the notorious wyther park council estate in leeds where i lived with no electricity for 3 years, and leaving school early without any qualifications i would never have dreamt that i would eventually win the title of “i own britain’s best home” and have the opportunity to give away thousands of pounds of my own money as i did on “the secret millionaire”. i hope i can be an inspiration to anyone with an entrepreneurial spirit. i’m living proof you don’t have to be held back by your roots.”

— terry george
