we maximize the potential of children with developmental differences and disabilities. 
children's therapy center is one of the largest and most comprehensive independent nonprofit pediatric therapy programs in washington state. since 1979, we've provided essential services for children with developmental differences and disabilities including physical, occupational and speech therapy; early support for infants and toddlers (esit) services; and parent education and support.
in partnership with parents and caregivers, we celebrate where each child is today and work toward who they can become. last year, we served nearly 3,000 children in south king and pierce counties.
