                2/4/10 - the message board is back up!!  bookmark the new
                
                link.
















 with the current level of popularity that professional 
              wrestling is experiencing, it becomes natural to examine its past... 
              and that's what kayfabe memories will 
              do.
there are
            several excellent websites available that examine wrestling's early
            days... the days of gorgeous george, antonino rocca, ed lewis, and
            many others who were involved in the sport during the 1940's and
            1950's. 
kayfabe
            memories,
            on the other hand, will explore pro wrestling's more recent history, 
              when the country was divided up into various regions. each region 
              had one or more fairly large and well-known promotions that entertained 
              fans. each section of kayfabe memories 
              will offer something different. to learn exactly what each section 
              will contain, please click on the "what is km" link to the
            upper right.
enjoy your time 
              on kayfabe memories. we hope you learn 
              a lot about wrestling's regional history, spread the word about 
              the site and return often. enjoy!
