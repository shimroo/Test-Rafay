blockchain

the wildly misunderstood technology behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could change business and society as profoundly as the internet did. i see it as  fundamentally a new form of decentralized trust. 






data ethics

big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, and artificial intelligence are transforming the landscape in virtually every industry. yet these techniques can produce privacy abuses, unethical manipulation, and discrimination.






gamification

what actually makes games fun? what do game developers understand about motivation and design that can be applied to business? how can âgame thinkingâ go beyond surface-level points and rewards? 






internet policy

since the mid-1990s, i helped shape regulatory approaches to digital platforms as a policy-maker, industry analyst, and scholar. technological developments continue to produce new legal and business challenges, but basic principles remain consistent.
