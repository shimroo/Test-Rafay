the skilled trades are a wonderful career opportunity for women.



whether you’re fresh out of high school, or looking to change careers, learning a trade is a great pathway to a high paying career that raises you above the normal, regular job. we help gritty women find the career that provides them the opportunity to provide for themselves and their families.
nationally, only 3 to 4% of the building trades workforce are women – and similar representation in related skilled trades such as machinists and auto mechanics. tradeswomen inc. aims to increase the number of women in construction and related trades.
we support women who are looking for a career in a craft, and act as a resource center for both tradeswomen and employers to bring change into the skilled trades.

the facts






construction and utilities were the only sectors where
more women are on the payroll after the
the coronavirus pandemic than before.
 
“generally: women make 81 cents to a man’s dollar.
in construction: 94 cents to a man’s dollar.
union careers: dollar-to-dollar equal in all union contracts.”
source: the institute for women’s policy research (iwpr)





















why choose a career in a union construction trade?








 20 average starting wage is $20/hr plus benefits. plus project labor agreements, or construction work done for government agencies, pay prevailing wage. 






 100 although women make 80 cents on the dollar in most comparable positions, union contracts dictate that women make the same as men 






 4 in the summer of 2019, seasonally adjusted construction employment in california topped 900,000 for the first time in 12 years, increasing by 4% or more in june, july, and august, compared to the same months in 2018. 














  




























  



only 250k 250 a quarter of a million women work in the trades. 


of the 165 million working in the trades, women make up 250k. our goal is to narrow that gap!








only 3.4%










in 2018, fewer than one in twenty (3.4%) of construction trades workers were women working with tools.
