from the lynbrook police department
on june 12, 2020, gov. andrew m. cuomo signed executive order 203, requiring each local government in n.y. state to adopt a policing reform plan that will maintain public safety while building mutual trust and respect between police and the communities they serve. police chief paladino has been working tirelessly with various community stakeholders to ensure that lynbrook’s police reform plan is thorough, and accurately addresses those concerns as reported by not only our committee of stakeholders, but also from an online survey which garnered over 500 responses.
chief paladino requests that you take a few minutes to read the below plan, and email lynbrookpolice@lynbrookvillage.com with any additional topics that you would like to see covered.
 additionally, chief paladino will be hosting a virtual town hall during the first week of march (date and time to be announced) where he will be explaining the plan and during which your suggestions can also be made.
 thank you for taking the time to help the lynbrook police department in this very important endeavor!
