				celebrating our oneness with god, creation, and neighbour			
 





who we arewe, the sisters of st. joseph of toronto, are a roman catholic congregation of women founded in france around 1650. we have been in toronto since 1851.
as a religious community, we are brought together by the love of christ. we are called by god, the gospel and the church to serve those in need in simplicity and compassion and to pursue social justice and equality for all. we are committed to creating a society transformed by gospel values in the areas of social justice, peace and creation.
we invite others to join us in living the gospel values and serving the “dear neighbour”, with a current focus on indigenous justice, the climate emergency, labour exploitation and human trafficking.
we continue our long tradition of advocacy and support for creation care and social justice, with a special emphasis on clean drinking water as a human right.
we seek collaboration and participation in our mission, ministries and spirituality.













journey for justice newsletter
our quarterly newsletter from our social justice ministry shares exciting initiatives that, we hope, will inspire you to join us in working for a world transformed by gospel values of peace, justice, and creation care.

for valentine's day, we hear and reflect upon pope francis and his words regarding the human and divine love of the heart of jesus.pope francis: "the symbol of the heart has often been used to express the love of jesus christ. some have questioned whether this symbol is still meaningful today. yet living as we do in an age of superficiality, rushing frenetically from one thing to another without really knowing why, and ending up as insatiable consumers and slaves to the mechanisms of a market unconcerned about the deeper meaning of our lives, all of us need to rediscover the importance of the heart."#dilexitnos: press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/bollettino/pubblico/2024/10/24/241024b.html#valentinesday
