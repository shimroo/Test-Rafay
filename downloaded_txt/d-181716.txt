troop communications

posted on september 30, 2013 by bsa troop 111 

to keep abreast of all the wonderful activities troop 111 offers throughout the year, it is important for scouts and their families make use of two key services:
1. monday night meetings – during each monday night meeting, permission slips and sign-up sheets are provided for any pending activity. make sure you sign-up early and get your permission slips in with payment to reserve your spot.
2. weekly troop emails – troop 111 sends a detailed email outlining all the pending troop activities. it is very important for each family to read this email thoroughly to make sure they do not miss deadlines or payments. it also includes training and volunteering opportunities for those families interested in supporting the troop. if you do not get this email, stop by monday night and ask to be added to the distribution list. read this email!!
and remember to thank all the wonderful volunteers who donate their time to support your son during his time in scouts!
