welcome to
elevation baptist church
our mission is to be a church of loving disciples who care about the need of our world to know christ. the visionary and leader of our church is pastor t.l. carmichael, sr., serving as pastor since 1998.
we believe:

the bible is the inspired and infallible word of god
there is only one god, eternally existent in three persons.
the only means of being cleansed from sin is through repentance, faith in the precious blood of jesus, and accepting the gospel, according to romans 10:9-10.
in regeneration, the holy spirit
in the redemptive work of christ on the cross that provides forgiveness for sins and peace with god throughout eternity
