best time to plan a new england fall tour
 
the main difference between traveling through a new england fall versus anywhere else in the world is timing. when planning your 2024 escorted fall foliage tour, you must first realize that this event occurs during a small window of time. if you wait too long, you’ve missed it, and if you arrive too early, well you’ll miss it. this being said, and knowing what you know now, the best time to plan a tour like this is a year in advance. you should then plan to be booked nine (9) months prior to your departure. it’s really as simple as that if you wish to confirm your space and purchase the least expensive airfare.  due to the narrow window of time, space is normally sold out within six (6) months of peak fall, and by this time airfare can be over $500.00 per person area, which is what you want to avoid.

we cannot begin to say what an excellent job that our travel agent, cheryl has always done for us, she consistently does an outstanding job. we are not seasoned travelers and she has always been very patient with us. when we inquire about anything her response is both rapid and fitting. if we were to able to travel more she would be our first choice to utilize due to her fine attitude and talent.
