	what the critics are saying:
"al caucci is the most single-minded dry fly addict i have ever 
		met, also the most knowledgable. this year on the delaware river 
	his precise analysis of hatches and currents helped me to hook and land 
	brown trout in excess of 23 inches. then, on the missouri, we had a two day 
	stretch of dry fly fishing--pure 'head hunting'--that i have only dreamed 
	of. in thirty five years of flyfishing (and writing about it), i have 
	never come across someone who knows exactly how he wants to fish and how to 
	fish the best places at the best times. 
 it was truly, the trip of a lifetime. of course, you still have to 
	catch the fish yourself!"


peter kaminsky, flyfishing author and outdoors columnist, the new york 
	times


al, 
before i forget i wanted to personally thank you for one of if not the 
	best fishing experience of my life. my week dry fly fishing on the missouri 
	was one of the most challenging and most rewarding experiences of my fishing 
	career. but beside the river, i want to say i don't know how you do it, but 
	everything from the house, to the food, not to mention the wine, to the group, 
	to the guides and to the coming and goings was perfect.

	 i will long remember a 25+inch trout that took out 200 yards on his first 
	run and then charged me so fast i could not keep up with him (i have sent 
	you his picture). it is
	

the memories of this trip that will be the measure of all trips in the 
	future. till we fish together again, 


tight lines!
