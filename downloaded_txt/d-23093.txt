who's checking your credit report? because credit issuers, 
  banks, employers, landlords, and insurance companies can legally access your 
  credit history to determine your credit line, insurance rates, and eligibility 
  for loans, it's important you know who's checking your credit report and what 
  information is being added. 
stay informed: find out who's reviewing your online credit 
  report with our credit monitoring service, which monitors changes to your credit 
  record on file with one of the national credit reporting agencies on a daily 
  basis. we'll notify you each day of changes to your record. we'll also send 
  you a quarterly "all-clear" notification if there are no changes to your record 
  in a 3-month period! visit privacyguard.com for credit 
  advice.
