on sustainable routes

road markings made with degaroute® have been contributing to resource efficiency for several decades thanks to their long service life. as an alternative to its proven binder, röhm has launched degaroute® proterra, which further improves the sustainability of road markings. that’s because degaroute® proterra is composed of at least 30 percent recycled methyl methacrylate, thus having a significantly smaller co2 footprint. swarco road marking systems, a global manufacturer of road marking systems, has chosen röhm’s sustainable binder for the development of a pioneering new marking material. the first application of the new product was on a 100 square meter bike lane in darmstadt. more
