south beach boxing 









 

 





















south beach boxingour historychange happens here!for over 25 years now we’ve been transforming lives. south beach boxing opened in 1998, as the rebirth of the original 5th st. gym, and we were the continuation of the legacy of boxing on miami beach just a few years after they tore down the 5th st. gym, and its building, in 1993 for good. we opened in a similar space, also upstairs on the 2nd floor, just 2 blocks down the street, on 7th & washington.as the longest running gym in miami beach we created real boxer’s workouts to the fitness world; whereas the 5th st. gym, catered only to professional fighters, which many, many greats came out of there. angelo dundee trained 15 world champions out of there. after they closed in 1993 for good. we continued the legacy of boxing on miami beach, with all the professional fighters, and then also created mainstream, badass, workouts for people who wanted to get super lean, strong and fit like a boxer, taught by professional boxers
