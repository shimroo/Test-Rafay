		  "a nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. but it cannot 
		  survive treason from within. an enemy at the gates is less formidable, 
		  for he is known and carries his banner openly. but the traitor moves 
		  amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling 
		  through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself. 
		  for the traitor appears not a traitor; he speaks in accents familiar 
		  to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments, he 
		  appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. he 
		  rots the soul of a nation, he works secretly and unknown in the night 
		  to undermine the pillars of the city, he infects the body politic so 
		  that it can no longer resist. a murderer is less to fear. the traitor 
		  is the plague."  - by marcus tullius cicero
		  (106-43 b.c.) roman statesman, philosopher 
		  and orator
"search history and see what 
			has been the fate of every nation that abused its credit. it is the
			
			same, only more awful in its magnitude and its consequences, as that 
			of the spendthrift individual. 
			and it will profit us nothing to conserve what we have remaining of 
			the great national resources 
			that were the dower of this continent unless we preserve the 
			national credit as more precious than
			them all. when it shall be exhausted the heart of the nation will 
			cease to 
			beat."   ---  e.c. knuth author of  "the empire 
			of the city"

george greenville butler's 
					"the weapon of mass reconstruction" solution!

the 
					weapon of mass
reconstruction

the
					idea that 
					iraq
					had weapons of mass destruction was used as propaganda to go 
					to war with 
					iraq. later and especially 
					today many draconian laws based since 911 are being used to 
					put america 
					down and impose upon 
					america a new world order, 
					an order created and controlled by an international cartel 
					of financial interests. in cinderella time was running out 
					after the ball for cinderella to return home, also time 
					unfortunately is running out for 
					america, so time is truly 
					of the essence. 

america 
					was created from out of british dominated colonies and was 
					morphed, and evolved by a yearning to be free, free to 
					worship, to work and to prosper. this great inherent 
					yearning to be free gave rise to a dynamic of truth seeking 
					unprecedented in the worlds history. 
					america in this mode of 
					truth seeking especially fleshing out new political systems 
					supported scientific discovery. these dynamics together 
					synergistically gave rise to rebelling against 
					great britain which wasnt 
					as much a rebellion against a dominate state but was more a 
					greater higher minded revolt against the suppression of 
					humankind by financial interests practicing money-mind 
					sorcery. the ancient systems of hidden rule even to 
					contemporary systems may be described as follows:

physical superiority, 
					orchestrating money-mind sorcery
the 
					money question is important because over the ages the world 
					has been dominated by the money changers. these money men 
					have evolved a system over centuries, that has given 
					themselves control over the worlds peoples. today we find 
					these money people controlling through their financial 
					entities presiding over a dialectic devolving world 
					swirling, whirling, tumbling into a chaos theory of mad 
					scientists, physicists without absolutes who teach lay gurus 
					of gaia, the falseness of heisenbergs uncertainty 
					principle, wiring a conduit into the world mind to mesmerize 
					into a state of subjectivism one controlled by the 
					externally stimulated media.
we 
					must awaken from this mesmerized state this conditioned 
					deluded state, and arise to a new state of being, of 
					existing, of walking the true path of enlightenment 
					harboring no resentments, no hatreds forgiveness filling our 
					hearts but still wary of mans ways. into this aquarian age 
					we go into an era of fascism, of a mad world ruled by insane 
					luciferian-satanists. there is a difference between good and 
					evil imagine a line on one end is goodness and on the other 
					evil.  goodness on one end of the line 
					can be described as enlightenment while evil on the opposite 
					end can be described as ignorance. to be wise is to be 
					enlightened and to be ignorant is to be evil at times caught 
					up in a deluded unknowing state.  do the 
					evil ones ever come out of the delusion? they almost never 
					awaken from their sleep of evil for to be caught up into 
					ones self, totally self absorbed is to be ignorant 
					unknowingly of thy self, evil unto the grave. 
					

					scientific evidence exists that proves that the 911 event 
					was not as the government described but resembles more of a 
					false flag operation. dr. steven jones
					
					www.stj911.org/members/index.html a retired physicist 
					from brigham young university has irrefutable proof of 
					thermite reactions, thermate being present and found within 
					residue of dust from the wtc site and also of iron rich 
					spheres only formed in steel making processes which were 
					also found present in the dust from the wtc site. 
					in addition richard gage
					www.ae911truth.org 
					from san 
					francisco a practicing a.i.a.
					architect  has

1,242
					architectural and engineering professionals 
					and 8,936 other supporters including a&e students who have 
					signed the petition demanding of congress a truly 
					independent investigation of 911. these two findings and 
					studies are evidence that the governments explanation of 
					911 is false.
evil 
					has perpetrated the 911 false flag event upon america, 
					because america is still a bastion of freedom and is still 
					god centered and thats the primary reason americas enemies 
					are trying to destroy the goodness and american ideals, that 
					america has spawned, these evil ones consider themselves 
					god-men reaching for greatness but failing one another being 
					mere mortals. 911 is being used as manipulative tool much as 
					pearl harbor was used to mobilize the american 
					public for war. the result of this false flag event is that 
					america
					is losing its freedoms and liberties based upon a falsehood 
					and the american public being 
					traumatized by 911 do not realize they are being mind 
					controlled to bring 
					america
					under the dominance and control of international financiers 
					who are building a fascist world government established with 
					the 911 lie. 

					president barack obamas administration is controlled by the 
					most power cartel in the world made up of world dominate 
					financial entities that not only are supporting a collective 
					world government but are nurturing one that is more fascist 
					than democratic. there is a long history of the ultra 
					capitalists spawning a collective world government with peon 
					citizens vying for benefits dolled out by a powerful fascist 
					state. the recent financial summits are the final planning 
					stages of such a new world fascist state controlled by 
					powerful financial interests. 
i 
					attended the freedom fest held at ballys casino in 2009 in 
					las vegas and while reporting from 
					the conference i began to perceive a distinctive consensus 
					that many of these wealthy attendees were becoming very 
					frightened by barack obamas attack on private property. 
					many wealthy individuals are now seeking ways to 
					protect their wealth and even russ limbaugh is now making 
					pronouncements about the new administration, along with its 
					supporters intent on expanding their wealth at the expense 
					of anyone who resists their goals. their goals are evil and 
					must be resisted, and there is a way to overcome this 
					tyranny, using the weapon of mass reconstruction-911 truth 
					movement.  many important 
					individuals are standing tall and working against their 
					diabolical system. 
					

					the founding-father of the 911 truth movement is alex jones, 
					the brave and courageous broadcaster-journalist-documentarist 
					of austin, texas, a truth seeker who is presently coming 
					under increasing attack. the powerful, in possession of our 
					government have used 911 to bring 
					america down, intentionally 
					to destroy the last shining light of a government based upon 
					citizens being kings and the government being the servant. 
					the american revolution was led by men who yearned to be free 
					and understood the danger of banking interests in control of 
					the government, and now that fear of our founding fathers 
					has come true.  

the 
					weapon of mass reconstruction is the 911 truth 
					movement  

and i 
					call upon  all citizens to join together 
					and take back,  

our 
					country before it is lost to international interests.

george butler's initial report fromhis assignment at the g-20.




money sorcery - a must 
							download

							 


sitting the 
scene 
i attended the g-8, g-20 summits held in toronto, canada 
june 24-27, 2010, there i witnessed two opposing views an uprising 
against the new world order, and unfortunately a rubber stamping, a further 
parroting of the g-20 party line. on saturday there were police car burnings, 
marches (numerous) many acts of vandalism. on monday morning june 28, 2010,  i was 
listening to john oakley 
on monday morning 640am radio a well known toronto 
broadcaster while driving from toronto to buffalo, new york, he said while live 
on the air that he had received confidential e-mails from toronto police who 
were on duty during saturday afternoon on the scene that they could have made 
arrests of some of the vandals but were held back from doing so by their 
supervisors. saturday afternoon hundreds of 
different groups comprising virtually thousands marched down university 
avenue a divided street that at times filled both north and south bound lanes. i 
video-taped the entire march and then decided to move back to the international 
media center where i continued to report on the g-20 summit and later from the 
international media center i would live stream the city television 
feed to our viewers on 
www.liveonlocation.tv  charlotte littlefield and i also had a simulcast 
of our live  radio program "the secret truth" 
www.thesecrettruth.com while we were streaming live 
street shots supplied by city television toronto. in addition i have included in 
this report still shots from a photographer who took some extraordinary 
photographs his name, benjamin king who graciously provided me the photos 
embedded in this report.  
real anarchists?
i was on the street and had cause to examine 
the so called anarchists who committed the vandalism during the saturday may 
helm, in my opinion the destructors broke down into different groups, hardcore 
anarchists, anti capitalists,
extremists 
and mixed in were some agent provocateurs who were difficult to spot except for 
clothing details. there were obvious plain clothes officers wearing new protest 
clothing and riding new bicycles sporting the latest cleanest bicycle clothing.  
there were 70 arrests made sunday morning on the campus some of who were members 
of the anti-capitalist convergence group from montreal, who are ardently against 
capitalism and are definitely on the far left. there was real property 
destruction and in my opinion it was due to some hardcore extremists encouraged 
by agent provocateurs, long before the activities began. the protest was more 
anti-capitalism than purely an anti g-20 protest. the privately owned central 
banks of the world represented at this summit by the g-20 nations are furthering 
the aspirations of the international banking elites so now that the secret of 
money creation out of thin air, is becoming more prevalently known the masking 
of  monopolistic capitalism and money creation by private interests has 
been revealed and the evolving from the already existing corporate state would 
naturally evolve into and dynamically result in political fascism, which is 
the real threat. 
canada's identity 
when in canada americans need to remember that 
canada relates to and is still part of great britain. canada is a federation 
consisting of ten provinces and three territories, governed as a parliamentary 
democracy and constitutional monarchy with queen elizabeth ii as its head of 
state, furthermore canada is a commonwealth realm which is a 
sovereign state within the commonwealth of nations that has elizabeth ii as its 
monarch. the mindset of the average canadian is peaceful, socialist, inclusive 
and accepting of all, they tend to be statists believing in government, middle 
class, honest, loyalty to the queen is a mixed bag, with strong support of labor 
unions as a reaction to monopolistic capitalism's excesses which is little 
understood by canadians who like naomi klein attack capitalism ignoring the 
monopolistic corrupt aspects of modern capitalism that render the failures, not 
the system of capitalism. the fabian society has been quietly  nurturing 
and fostering socialism both in great britain and canada, an indication that the 
big money has always supported the growth of socialism as a means to expand a 
statist system where all subjects would have to petition the state for 
entitlement benefits, thus helping to establish a centralized state 
dictatorship.
police state
the cost of security for the g-20 summit was 
well over a billion dollars so many canadians today are questioning the wisdom 
of spending that much money on this event. there were over 10,000 police 
officers brought into toronto from all over canada and there were troops on 
alert in case the police were unable to handle the unrest.
there 
were over 900 people arrested  and they were taken to the toronto film 
studio on eastern avenue and detained, but by monday morning according to 
authorities only 172 were still being held. 
the police all carried riot gear and 
there some special police equipped with additional padding and armor, plus tear 
gas who would be sent in to disperse crowds. toronto police chief blair admitted 
on tuesday that the public was  deliberately mislead about a new law that 
made it an offence to be closer than 5 meters to the g-20 fence in downtown 
toronto. the law never applied to the g-20 security fence. he indicated he 
mislead the public and did so to discourage law breakers, he said during a press 
conference held tuesday "i was trying to keep the criminals out,". the 
question would arise after experiencing the canadian experience, does a police 
state already exist or would it better be described as an authoritarian state 
that rules with an iron fist inside a velvet glove. the rules are intense and 
the population being many immigrants are subject to rigorous policing a very 
aggressive law enforcement that attains fines, fees for the state in an economy 
of minimum wage earners with a heavy presence of shopkeepers in the toronto 
area. 
g-20 future - becoming a permanent institution 
the g-20 concluded their meeting behind closed 
and carefully guarded doors, fenced inside a 3 meter high fence that was 
installed downtown to protect the g-20 members. prime minister stephen harper 
swore to cut their debt by 50% by 2015 with president obama warning fellow g-8 
and g-20 colleagues to be careful in continuing their stimulus so that their 
economies would not stall. the chancellor merkel in her policy statements 
indicated during the greece crisis and several times afterward expressed the 
german view of belt tightening so that her viewpoint along with support from the 
g-8 to a degree won the day in 
toronto. carroll quigley predicted in 1962 writing in "tragedy and hope" 
about a world government bought about by the world dominant bankers. 
earlier institutions such as leaders 20 
www.l20.org  has been working toward world 
governance and has a heavy canadian contingent. this could be one reason toronto 
was the meeting place of this latest g-20 summit. the intent of the g-20 group 
is to establish a permanent g-20 group institution that would usher in a new 
international financial structure thereby establishing a new world order.
