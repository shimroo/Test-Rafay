                 gabrielle miranda  2022-09-30    i highly recommend dr. geoffrey stewart! i had a severe herniated disc and it was compressing my sciatic nerve. i spent months stuck at home in pain. i was so nervous about making the decision to have spinal fusion surgery because i was hearing all sorts of horror stories from friends and family. i had exhausted all of the conservative methods to reduce the pain and i was desperate for a solution. i visited 2 other surgeons before finding dr. stewart. from the first visit with him, i knew i could trust him with the surgery. he’s been practicing for over 20 years, so he is very experienced at what he does. he showed me the x-ray and the mri and explained my options. he then gave me as much time as i needed to make the decision. i was super anxious about it, but i decided to do the lumbar spinal fusion. i was definitely not prepared for the painful recovery! i have a low pain tolerance and i was in a lot of pain for the first 2-3 months. i’m thankful though that dr. stewart’s office referred me to dr. javier placer who is an amazing pain management doctor. i’m 5 months post op now, so i’m still recovering, but i have my life back thanks to dr. stewart! i’m able to drive to work, go out with friends, go to church and feel normal again. if you need back surgery, call and schedule a visit with the spine and scoliosis center! they’re the best!             jerome williams  2022-08-07    dr. snavely is probably the best surgeon in florida. everything played out exactly how he said it would. i had surgery on two herniated discs. i felt better immediately after and i'm healing just fine. everyone in his staff has show extreme professionalism  and actually made this process for me way easier than i thought possible. i would like to acknowledge maycee martin for her immaculate customer service. in a world where it's difficult to find employees who actually care or do their jobs at all because they're over worked, this young lady goes above and beyond and takes her job serious. she's the only one in the building at her position, so she's busy 24/7 and somehow finds a way to get it done in a timely fashion. i would like to thank her, dr. snavely and the entire staff for working harder than any organization i've worked with in years. this type of service is rare these days and should be appreciated.             sandra ottum  2022-06-11    my husband consulted with dr. snavely. the good doctor shared his honest opinion about healthy habits to prepare for future surgery. he also shared his prognosis for surgery outcomes. dr. snavely provides realistic outcome expectations; he does not automatically recommend surgery. he sits on the edge of his seat, looks intently at his patient, and asks lots of questions. thank you, dr, snavely.             marlo holman  2022-01-15    dr. snavely is great. he explained everything & asked if you have questions.  the staff was great. i felt really good leaving his office, because i felt the staff & him provided whole care😊             sandy simmons  2021-11-18    highly recommend spine & scoliosis center! dr. snavely and staff are caring and go above and beyond to give the best treatment possible.             ladykatherine gamble  2021-11-09    i love  🤎 the spine & scoliosis center. i had back surgery in 2017 and have been a patient since 2007. i was treated with the best of care, respect and courtesy when visiting this office. i absolutely adore stephanie a medical assistant in this office. she has always went above and beyond to ensure that i had the necessary documents to submit to my employer, etc.  she treated me like a person and not just a patient. i have recommended this office to others and will continue to do so. the service is excellent. i am satisfied with the level of service received. my dr. flynn passed away in 2020. i plan to stay with dr. snavely my new doctor in the office because i trust the service will continue to be with a spirit of excellence.

r. i.p. dr. joseph flynn 🙏🏽

ladykatherine gamble             jamie postle  2021-11-05    wonderful staff and amazing doctor! trust me, there is no one better!             elizabeth decker  2021-11-02    everyone is very nice, friendly and welcoming! they made me feel very comfortable with my concerns.            google rating score: 4.7 of 5, based on 181 reviews
