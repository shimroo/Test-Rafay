these are some of the measures we are taking to insure the safety of our customers. all employees are wearing gloves and masks that are dealing with the customers. we are putting markers on the floor in front of service counters and checkouts to let people know to stay back 6 feet. we clean our hand baskets and rolling carts with a bleach pressure washer regularly. we  enlarged the space between the checkouts.  most of the time there is no wait. our cashiers are cleaning their pin pads regularly. our customer bathrooms have eight sinks in each.  we have hand sanitizer available at different locations in the market. we have employee bathrooms and hand wash stations all over the building that are monitored for cleanliness, sanitizer and soap daily. we have hygiene checks being done before we open using special biological swabs to make sure our equipment is being cleaned and sanitized correctly. we have temperature checks on our refrigeration equipment continually. we have a sanitized air washer system that maintains 62 degrees and 65% relative humidity in the market constantly. all the air in the market production and selling areas is cycled through this air washer system every 10 minutes. higher humidity makes viruses less able to be transmitted. this is why during the summer we do not get the flu as much compared to the dryer conditions during the winter. all pollen and other particles are washed out of the air. outside air is being continually added to our system. this system is unique for a retail environment. we have been working seven days a week to make the market function given these difficult times for our customers and suppliers. we have maintained our inventory these last weeks so there are very few shortages of the products we normally carry. our restaurant is closed. the market is large enough so people can maintain their own distances from each other. we have seen our customers be very courteous to each other in this regard. the market is not as busy on the weekends as it was. the business is spread out all during the week because people have more time to shop. the least busy times are around lunch and dinner hours. the busier time is in the mornings from 9-11. we are open 9-9 seven days a week as usual.  all of us are learning how to adapt to this new environment. we are committed to providing high quality fresh food at the best price possible in a safe environment for our customers as we have for the last 43 years.
thank you for your support.

the importance of "our world market" book 
 download: "our world market brochure" free 



"our world market, the generational distinction, our connection to life" was written by my husband, robert blazer, shortly after a good friend's unexpected passing.  robert then realized the urgency of sharing this valuable information.  it is
his legacy.  the book was written in approximately six weeks
with the intention to document what he had discovered.
 
after many years of working with families from all over the globe,
he discovered a pattern that exists in every family.  he saw that fathers and sons were opposite in the way they contribute, and
that mothers and daughters were the same opposites in the way they contribute.  the words he uses to describe these differences are "expanding, space creating energy" and  "contracting, time creating energy".
 
we have taken these insights and applied them to our
workforce, and have been able to achieve amazing results with people of all different cultures working together in harmony.
 





many of our employees would tell you that this information not only makes their jobs more enjoyable, but that it has had a profound affect on them and their families.  this information has allowed them to understand their children and their spouse in a way in which it was not possible before.
 
it is robert's heartfelt desire to share this with all people.  i urge you to read it carefully and discuss
it with family members and closest friends so you can see it for yourselves.  it is  "the difference that makes the difference".
 
barbara blazer



this is a gift from me to you. this is information i discovered 31 years ago when i was 41 years old.
this knowledge has impacted every aspect of my life in ways i could never have imagined before.
it is what makes the difference to "our stand". it is my heartfelt desire that you, my loyal customers,
that have supported me through the years, receive the benefits this information provides as well.
i am here to support this anyway i can. it is a privilege to server you.

 âour world marketâ  readers share their experiences:





in âour world market, the generational distinction,â robert blazer shares what he has learned from years of experience observing people and behavior and building a successful business heavily dependent on people working together.
 
the information in this book, when applied to work or personal relationships, can have a profound impact on productivity, relationships with others, understanding of others and self, and general well-being.  i found especially interesting the observations and explanations of people as either âexpandingâ or âcontractingâ.  like yin and yang, expanding and contracting people are complementary opposites.
 
as the organizational structure at your dekalb farmers market demonstrates and as we have seen in our business, pairing expanding and contracting people together in the work place creates a team with balanced energy that capitalizes on the expanding personâs tendency to âthink bigâ and the contracting personâs tendency to get the job done.
 
robert also shows how these differences affect family relationships.  the book teaches how
to identify these variations in people, how these distinctions affect workplace and family relationships, and how to use this information for personal and professional benefit.
thank you, robert!
 
mary long, market customer and attorney



âour world marketâ is a legacy of the truths that robert has discovered in business and in life. he shares these discoveries as a gift to those desiring to live and work in harmony and
in peace â absent scarcity and suffering. what better application to these truths, than the diverse and successful atlanta landmark, your dekalb farmers market, founded by robert
in 1977!
 
the generational and gender maxims presented are profound and seem unchallengeable in explaining human and organizational relationships. knowledge is freeing, when you see and apply new understanding to improve family and work relationships.  his explanation of dual and opposite energy and how generations are distinguished is not only enlightening but fun to see in place within my own family and coworkers.
 
i have a greater appreciation for my own self and those i know because of âour world marketâ.
