our vision & missionour vision is for orange and neighboring cities to be composed of healthy, robust neighborhoods that provide security and opportunity for all residents. low and moderate-income families have access to civic, cultural, and natural resources, educational and economic opportunities in "just and beautiful" cities.hands' mission is to empower residents to create neighborhoods of choice—places where people can and do choose to raise their families and run their businesses















our approachour current focus reflects our historic mission. we help residents and other stakeholders build and sustain healthy neighborhoods that provide economic, educational, and cultural opportunities and outcomes rivaling those found in more affluent towns and cities. we and our partners build safe and healthy affordable housing for residents and affordable commercial space for small businesses. we also co-design innovative initiatives that help stakeholders take ownership of the neighborhood revitalization process. as of spring 2021, our approach has expanded to include asset-based community programming to increase the wealth and financial resources of various community stakeholders, including homeowners, small business owners, and families enrolled in orange public schools. we envision that as a result of these efforts, inspired and empowered stakeholders will take the lead in building the urban village for the 21st century—a just and beautiful city.
