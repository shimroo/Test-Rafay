welcome to "new zealand films on vhs, dvd, blu-ray and streaming". by clicking on the appropriate box, you will be able to locate 
information regarding some 302 new zealand feature film titles that can be found on vhs video (ntsc or pal), dvd or blu-ray discs plus many that are now streamed online. 
all titles have links to trailers or film clip downloads.












gradually as more information becomes available, the "news" section will contain information about the most recent site additions and/or changes, 
as well as announcements of general interest. the dvd, blu-ray and streaming buttons will take you to lists of titles available on those formats, where clicking on the film titles will provide you with details.












if you are looking for new zealand documentaries, short films or links to nz film cast or crew associations, check the resources in the "links" section. 
gradually changes are being made to make the site "friendlier" for those with mobile devices, including smaller mp4 trailers. i welcome your comments and suggestions.












the "first choices" section is a great starting point for those new to new zealand films. the "books" section lists publications about the nz film industry, 
its participants and their films. the "directors" section is a cross-reference to their titles. click on the "buy sell rent" box to find major on-line sources in key countries for titles.












the "soundtracks" section is continuing to being revised and expanded, including sample downloads for most titles. 
i need to decide how to represent soundtracks that are only available as a "burn-your-own download. a sub-section covering early soundtrack lps has been added.












the "misc" section will fill you in on little facts concerning nz films and their history, as well as related items such as nz movie themed postal stamps. 
there is a list of the nz films that have reached at least $1 million at nz cinemas and a statement regarding artistic credits and property rights plus links to international film commissions.












in summary i want to hear your ideas about how i could improve the content of this site. 
believe me when i say that this site is the result of the work of many people, although indirectly. we all owe much to those who have dedicated themselves to nz film. 
if you are looking for specific information that you cannot find here, email me and i will do my best to provide an answer.









link to sneak peek trailers - the latest nz films - soon to be on dvd, blu-ray or streaming.


important notice regarding property rights
i do not claim rights to most of the contents displayed or referred within this site. i do lay claim to the organizational nature of this site. feel free to contact me regarding clarification of this issue.
