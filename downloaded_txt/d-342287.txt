maga proprio



in a well-written article, jayd henricks compares president trump and pope francis, both men who govern with autocaracy and confusion. here is the best excerpt:as in trump world, the francis papacy is marked by the influence of a small group of advisers whose personal loyalty seems to be their major skill. penetrating that bubble with differing views seems nearly impossible, which allows ill-informed and biased judgements to go unchallenged. in effect, both leaders tend to govern by personal fiat. president trump’s flurry of executive orders is an obvious example, and it tracks with pope francis’ extensive use of the motu proprio (he has issued motu proprios at a rate of more than five times that of john paul ii and benedict xvi). this reflects an arbitrariness that, at least in the case of pope francis, creates significant instability within the global community he leads. so many of the motu proprios that come from the holy father’s desk seem to be spontaneous acts that lack any effort at consultation or legal vetting. this very quickly takes on the appearance of governance by whim, which then fosters discouragement, confusion, and disunity.but you should read the entire thing if you can: https://whatweneednow.substack.com/p/the-president-and-the-popehere is a point i have been trying to make all along, how we need a pope who has read the ccc:the pope moralizes in broad terms, missing opportunities to catechize the faithful about the issue in a way that would draw them more deeply into the church’s rich tradition. he employs little theological precision or even concern for such precision, which opens him up to easy criticism.

kataluma



i am fascinated by this insight, especially given what i just taught about the third epiphany at cana:that there was “no place for them in the kataluma”  therefore may be an oblique and tactful reference to the awkwardness of joseph and mary’s situation. typically a man would return to his father’s house in his home town to complete the marriage if the betrothal took place elsewhere. however, in mary and joseph’s case it was not appropriate for them to use the kataluma. mary was already pregnant. the relatives of joseph therefore fulfilled their obligation to offer hospitality, but also recognized the apparently shameful situation of mary and joseph by offering them shelter in the warm, adjacent back room which was the cave used for stabling and storage.this understanding of kataluma also adds weight to luke’s use of the word for the room where the last supper was held. note that jesus’ words about “in my father’s house are many rooms” takes place during the last supper. in a kataluma often used as a bridal suite, jesus refers to the kataluma that a bridegroom would build for his bride and refers to his “coming again to take them to himself”. this affirms and corroborates the nuptial imagery that occurs throughout the gospels–in which in his sayings and parables jesus regularly refers to himself as the bridegroom and we, as the church, his bride.i therefore do not think it is stretching this too far to see that our lord’s birth in bethlehem is like the betrothal of the bridegroom and the bride. he “comes to his own but his own receive him not” his incarnation is his betrothal to his bride the church and this is theologically why he does not use the kataluma. but he will come again to take us to himself and then we will be with him at the marriage supper of the lamb–and finally in the room he has prepared for us in his father’s house: which is why st john in revelation pictures heaven as the marriage supper of the lamb and the consummation of the marriage of he bridegroom with his bride–the church.https://dwightlongenecker.com/the-true-meaning-of-the-inn-in-bethlehem/

noel



                  by j.r.r. tolkiengrim was the world and grey last night:the moon and stars were fled,the hall was dark without song or light,the fires were fallen dead.the wind in the trees was like to the sea,and over the mountains’ teethit whistled bitter-cold and free,as a sword leapt from its sheath.the lord of snows upreared his head;his mantle long and paleupon the bitter blast was spreadand hung o’er hill and dale.the world was blind,the boughs were bent,all ways and paths were wild:then the veil of cloud apart was rent,and here was born a child.the ancient dome of heaven sheerwas pricked with distant light;a star came shining white and clearalone above the night.in the dale of dark in that hour of birthone voice on a sudden sang:then all the bells in heaven and earthtogether at midnight rang.mary sang in this world below:they heard her song ariseo’er mist and over mountain snowto the walls of paradise,and the tongue of many bells was stirredin heaven’s towers to ringwhen the voice of mortal maid was heard,that was mother of heaven’s king.glad is the world and fair this nightwith stars about its head,and the hall is filled with laughter and light,and fires are burning red.the bells of paradise now ringwith bells of christendom,and gloria, gloria we will singthat god on earth is come.

our hope is not in this world



out
of gloom and darkness,the eyes of the blind shall see.
the lowly will ever find joy in the lord,
and the poor rejoice in the holy one of israel.
for the tyrant will be no more
and the arrogant will have gone;
all who are alert to do evil will be cut off,
those whose mere word condemns a man,
who ensnare his defender at the gate,
and leave the just man with an empty claim...those who err in spirit shall acquire understanding,
and those who find fault shall receive instruction.

holiness will hurt



 in case you were misled about what happens to good people:12 here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of god and hold fast to the faith in jesus.13 and i heard a voice from heaven saying, “write this: blessed are the dead who from now on die in the lord.” “yes,” says the spirit, “they will rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them.”14 then i looked, and there was a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was one like the son of man, with a golden crown on his head, and a sharp sickle in his hand! 15 another angel came out of the temple, calling with a loud voice to the one who sat on the cloud, “use your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is fully ripe.” 16 so the one who sat on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was reaped.17 then another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle. 18 then another angel came out from the altar, the angel who has authority over fire, and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, “use your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for its grapes are ripe.” 19 so the angel swung his sickle over the earth and gathered the vintage of the earth, and he threw it into the great wine press of the wrath of god. 20 and the wine press was trodden outside the city, and blood flowed from the wine press, as high as a horse’s bridle, for a distance of about two hundred miles.hurt will bear fruit.

remain in the word



i normally abhor the nab translation, but today's reading was noteworthy:many deceivers have gone out into the world,those who do not acknowledge jesus christ as coming in the flesh;such as the deceitful one and the antichrist.look to yourselves that you do not lose what we worked forbut may receive a full recompense.anyone who is so “progressive”as not to remain in the teaching of the christ does not have god;whoever remains in the teaching has the father and the son.update: another way of looking at the term 'progressive' https://www.thecatholicthing.org/2024/10/22/the-decomposition-of-synodality/

liberal bigots



 bret stephens, in an opinion column for the nytimes, offers an incisive analysis of the prejudice that led to trump's election, and here's the money quote:the politics of today’s left is heavy on social engineering according to group identity. it also, increasingly, stands for the forcible imposition of bizarre cultural norms on hundreds of millions of americans who want to live and let live but don’t like being told how to speak or what to think. too many liberals forgot this, which explains how a figure like trump, with his boisterous and transgressive disdain for liberal pieties, could be re-elected to the presidency.so, there it is, folks (though it's ironic to think of liberals as folks, since that is who they so vehemently disdain). you made the bed you're lying in.__________________________________more on the catholic vote:https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2024/11/why-catholics-voted-for-trump

psalm 84



 my soul is longing and yearning,is yearning for the courts of the lord.my heart and my soul ring out their joyto god, the living god.the sparrow herself finds a homeand the swallow a nest for her brood;she lays her young by your altars,lord of hosts, my king and my god.they are happy, who dwell in your house,for ever singing your praise.they are happy, whose strength is in you,in whose hearts are the roads to zion.as they go through the bitter valleythey make it a place of springs,the autumn rain covers it with blessings.they walk with ever growing strength,they will see the god of gods in zion.-monday of week iii

nary a whimper



from the pillar, a pithy observation of synodality: the pope will not issue an apostolic exhortation, telling delegates that  “what we have approved is sufficient.”it was a funny way to end things, because the 28,000 word text calls for changes to canon law, and the creation of offices, and other concrete initiatives, which have to actually be taken up and put into motion by someone with executive authority — namely, the pope himself. but rather than choose to receive those recommendations and then issue a text saying he’ll implement them, the pope instead formally promulgated a document — carrying his authority — calling on him to do things, which he may or may not do.

quid est veritas



 this article lays out succinctly how we came to this highly anti-ratzingerian moment in the history of the church. what we need is a restored ecclesiology.that will come about when we identify the roots of this distorted eccelesiology so prevalent in the church currently. many of those distortions, such as moral proportionalism, are being foisted upon the synodal process currently underway.

the pretend church



oh, what a fisking!the penitential service “is intended to direct the work of the synod towards the beginning of a new way of being church.”it seems to have forgotten about an older way of being church, even from just twenty-five years ago. i would add: not forgotten- deliberately eschewed.
