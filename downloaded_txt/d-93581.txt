american horse council outlines priorities for 2023 farm bill

the american horse council is committed to protecting the health and welfare of the u.s. equine population. we provide the following information in support of our funding requests to the united states department of agriculture (usda). note most of these programs are not equine exclusive, nor does the current budgetary process identify outlays specific to equines. for example, the usda budget summary for fiscal year 2023 only mentions horses/equines in two-line items. neither line item offers a discrete funding amount for horses. accountability and transparency for equine health and welfare programs should be adopted. we urge the committee to direct the usda to implement a process by which equine-related appropriations are listed as budgetary line items.
