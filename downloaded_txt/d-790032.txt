our philosophy
our firm's philosophy is to listen to and respect the needs and concerns of each client. injured plaintiffs have the “deck stacked against them” as their claim is always defended by large multi-million/billion dollar insurance companies or corporations. they have unlimited resources to defend the claim and will do anything to defeat or decrease the claimant’s compensation. we represent our clients on a contingent fee basis which means that you pay nothing unless we win your case for you. we never represent insurance companies or insured defendants.
