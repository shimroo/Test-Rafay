the kingfisher police department would like to invite you to come donate blood on feb 18th from 11am-6pm at the kingfisher elks lodge.  this event is a friendly competition between us and the kingfisher fire department so when you sign in make sure you let them know you are supporting the police.  thank you in advance, this event is one of obiâ€™s biggest donators and they definitely need as many donations as we can get them.  come out and save a life!  remember to grab a free shirt and that hoses are a drag so support the police when signing inðŸ˜œ.

a vibrant community to live, work, play & visit
welcome to the city of kingfisher, a vibrant community with a thriving local economy on the outskirts of oklahoma city, opening the gateway to northwest oklahoma. 
with a rich history predating statehood and progressive planning to prepare for tomorrow, kingfisher is the ideal place to live, work, play and visit. as the county seat of kingfisher county, oklahoma, our city is most notably recognized as the birthplace of sam walton. kingfisher is situated on a part of the chisholm trail. main permanent tourist attractions include the chisholm trail museum, gov. seay mansion, veterans memorial, and jesse chisholm statue. these facilities preserve relics and information of the communityâ€™s unique heritage.
