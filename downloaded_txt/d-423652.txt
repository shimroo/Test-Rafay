wor/th


 













wor/th is all about coming back to both the heart and the mind of worship. our one-day worship and theology seminars aim to challenge and inspire songwriters, worship leaders & their teams to fight for deeply biblical, relevant and poetic worship. leading and teaching alongside host matt redman at each event will be experienced theologians, pastors, worship leaders and songwriters who care passionately about painting a big picture of god in our songs and services. we hope each of these days will have the feel of both a classroom and a chapel - a mix of education and encounter - as we stir up a conversation around the glory of god in our worship.visit worthworship.com
