diversity & inclusion
the duke chemistry department aspires to create a community built on excellence, collaboration, innovation, creativity, and belonging. as scientists, educators, collaborators and co-workers, we are committed to promoting a culture of mutual respect that inspires creativity, relishes scientific inquiry, fosters intellectual curiosity, and rewards collaborative engagement. our collective success depends on the robust exchange of ideas – an exchange that is best when the rich diversity of our perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences flourishes. to achieve this exchange, it is essential that all members of the community feel secure and welcome, that the contributions of all individuals are respected, and that all voices are heard.
