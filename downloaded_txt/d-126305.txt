            source camera identiﬁcation for heavily jpeg compressed low resolution still images
          


journal of forensic science



            may 2009
          






        in this research, we examined whether fixed pattern noise or more specifically photo response non-uniformity (prnu) can be used to identify the source camera of heavily jpeg compressed digital photographs of resolution 640 × 480 pixels. we extracted prnu patterns from both reference and questioned images using a two-dimensional gaussian filter and compared these patterns by calculating the correlation coefficient between them. both the closed and open-set problems were addressed, leading the…

          “zeno and i are both part of the essential research consortium. in that context he facilitated my research visit to the netherlands forensic institute in 2019 and he was incredibly helpful in connecting me with people to discuss my research with. this visit also culminated in publishing a jointly written research article on deepfakes and the legal process, published by the american bar association's scitech lawyer in summer 2020. based on my experience co-authoring an article with zeno, i wholeheartedly recommend him as a project partner. zeno is an asset to our project team and is always looking for practical solutions to whatever issues come his way.”

          “zeno has been a colleague for more than 13 years. together, we have done a number of research projects and we have set up a team for forensic image analysis and biometrics. zeno works best as a team leader or a chair person in organizations that deal with forensic investigations. apart from his capabilities to act as a forensic scientist, he also has a lot of manager skills.”

          the rise of online communication tools has also increased threats against vulnerable or hashtag
#soft_targets on the internet, social media, and blogs. our research presents a detailed roadmap to better understand and address these hashtag
#e_threats through a comprehensive approach that combines normative, empirical, and theoretical perspectives. we've developed a guide integrating hashtag
#ai_driven_e_threat_detection, hashtag
#risk_assessment, and strategic response planning. the paper highlights the complex nature of deceptive behaviour online and the importance of recognizing ai's capabilities and limitations in enhancing security measures. our study aims to equip stakeholders with the knowledge to protect soft targets in cyberspace and ensure community safety and security.

diagnosis model for detection of e-threats against soft-targets

threats online - internet, social media platforms, blogs - has risen with development of cybernetics tools of communication. since the threats against soft targets are recurrent on cyberspace, the focus becomes an e-threat. this paper aims to contribute to construct a roadmap to apprehend e-threats against soft targets, considering the triangle ground of coexistence – normative, empirical and theoretical. an all-inclusive guide amalgamates the concepts of e-threats detections, risk, ia, soft targets, is developed to understand processes. the awareness of the added-value and the limitations of the integration of this technology in policing, is an initiative whose enforcement is legitimized and stranded in a simple concept of security. despite the ia advances, and its efficiency for detection, the process is complex, because deceptive behaviour has a multidimensional nature. our analysis reveals that the disruptive potential of e-threats of soft targets is tackled and some orientations are given to guarantee the safety and security of crowds.

          📃scientific paper: deepfake detection by exploiting surface anomalies: the surfake approach

abstract:

the ever-increasing use of synthetically generated content in different
sectors of our everyday life, one for all media information, poses a strong
need for deepfake detection tools in order to avoid the proliferation of
altered messages.

the process to identify manipulated content, in particular
images and videos, is basically performed by looking for the presence of some
inconsistencies and/or anomalies specifically due to the fake generation
process.

different techniques exist in the scientific literature that exploit
diverse ad-hoc features in order to highlight possible modifications.

in this
paper, we propose to investigate how deepfake creation can impact on the
characteristics that the whole scene had at the time of the acquisition.

in
particular, when an image (video) is captured the overall geometry of the scene
(e.g. surfaces) and the acquisition process (e.g. illumination) determine a
univocal environment that is directly represented by the image pixel values;
all these intrinsic relations are possibly changed by the deepfake generation
process.

by resorting to the analysis of the characteristics of the surfaces
depicted in the image it is possible to obtain a descriptor usable to train a
cnn for deepfake detection: we refer to such an approach as surfake.

experimental results carried out on the ff++ dataset for different kinds of
deepfake forgeries and diverse deep learning models confirm that such a feature
can be adopted to discriminate between pristine...

          🇪🇺 on may 27th 2024, the european union council (eu council) has adopted its conclusions on #eu #security and #defence, including #eu #cyber #defence.

 inter alia, the document deals with the strengthen the eu’s #resilience and secure access to #strategic domains and specifically on #cyber and #hybrid threats, foreign #information #manipulation and #interference (fimi).

the eu council reiterates the importance of strengthening the prevention, #detection, deterrence, #resilience, and response to hybrid, fimi, cyber threats that are targeting the eu, its member states, and partners with the further development of dedicated instruments.

the eu council welcomes the revised implementing guidelines of the #cyber #diplomacy toolbox of 2023, and the further operationalisation of the eu #hybrid toolbox and the eu toolbox to counter foreign information manipulation and interference (fimi toolbox) .

the eu council has a challenging and articulated #roadmap:

 by the end of 2024 it will establish an eu cyber defence coordination centre (@eucdcc)

by 2025 the eu council will:

- strengthen the eu single #intelligence analysis capacity  by enhancing its resources and capacities

- enhance the coordination and cooperation in the domain of cyber defence

- explore the inclusion of the information environment and #electronic #warfare into its scope

- upgrade its #military #mobility pledge 2024 by strengthening the overall resilience in all domains, including cyber security

in conclusion, the eu council will adopt concrete measure to address military mobility aspects in national and eu-level cybersecurity risk #assessments to enhance the cyber resilience of dual-use transport systems and services at the national level. 🇪🇺

          the dutch military intelligence and security service (mivd) has issued a warning about the far-reaching consequences of a chinese cyber-espionage operation disclosed earlier this year. according to the mivd, the scale of this campaign is "much larger than previously known," impacting numerous systems across multiple sectors. 

in a joint report with the general intelligence and security service (aivd) released in february, the mivd described how chinese hackers exploited a critical vulnerability in fortios/fortiproxy (cve-2022-42475). this remote code execution flaw was used over several months between 2022 and 2023 to deploy malware on susceptible fortigate network security devices. during this "zero-day" period, about 14,000 devices were compromised. targets included various western governments, international organizations, and many companies within the defense industry.

          trace #evidence analysis is a meticulous #discipline within #forensicscience, meticulously examining microscopic remnants left behind at crime scenes.
unlike #fingerprints or #bloodstains, trace evidence is often invisible to the naked eye, requiring specialized techniques and keen observation #skills. this seemingly insignificant evidence, however, can hold immense value in reconstructing events and linking suspects to #crimes.

          i've been very fortunate to read the chapter on mps by the brilliant scientists and staff @ cellmark forensic services.  honestly, in parts it reads like a shakespearian tragedy at times, but in reality, it's a damning testament to the risks private companies have to take to be innovative, the sheer scale of the hoops they have to jump through just to get heard, and how much the system in england and wales works actively against any innovation ever making it to operational forensic science.  if a company like cellmark struggle to make an innovation like this a reality in england and wales whilst being a major player in the market operating in the only evidence type the police are interested in which is performed externally to them, there is little hope for anyone else seeking to do the same in areas other than dna in england and wales.    

this chapter is a must-read, particularly for policymakers in govt or those seeking to govern.
i'm no dna expert but as a general observer i do wonder:
(1) investment in rapiddna killed off key forensic services.  now cfs have invested in mps and is finding it challenging. are we witnessing "peak dna" where the push for greater sensitivity has rendered it less efficient for day-to-day casework than a decade or more ago -  yes we're detecting dna in smaller quantities and in cases we wouldn't have been able to 10+ years ago but at the expense of productivity dropping as scientists have to grapple with more and more complex mixtures. maybe ai will help, or maybe it will make things worse, who knows?
having to innovate further to deal with the consequence of more complex mixtures arising from a previous innovation pushing the sensitivity limits, begs the question who drove this push for greater sensitivity really and was this not predictable from the outset? are there lessons to be learned from that?
(2) whilst the police control the pursestrings how can there ever be room for early adoption of new technologies which are always hideously expensive by default, may only be applicable in a small % of cases but may be the only tool to provide any solution to that minority of cases?  there is simply no way for a novel application to compete with old/existing technologies that have become cheap by comparison even if that comparison is utterly flawed.    for those too young to remember, when dna came out first it was hideously expensive, only applicable in a small number of cases and was the only tool to provide a solution in that minority of cases....

the opening paragraphs in the chapter are an excellent history lesson and the question for policymakers and those seeking to govern us should be (i'm looking at you the labour party) - what's the difference between now and then?
