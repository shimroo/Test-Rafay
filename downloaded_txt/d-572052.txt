the heiress


national bestseller • a january indie next pick and libraryreads pick

"the reigning queen of the gothic thriller." —entertainment weekly

there's nothing as good as the rich gone bad.

when ruby mctavish callahan woodward miller kenmore dies, she’s not only north carolina’s richest woman, she’s also its most notorious. the victim of a famous kidnapping as a child and a widow four times over, ruby ruled the tiny town of tavistock from ashby house, her family’s estate high in the blue ridge mountains.

but in the aftermath of her death, her adopted son, camden, wants little to do with the house or the money—and even less to do with the surviving mctavishes. instead, he rejects his inheritance, settling into a normal life as an english teacher in colorado and marrying jules, a woman just as eager to escape her own messy past.

ten years later, his uncle’s death pulls cam and jules back into the family fold at ashby house. its views are just as stunning as ever, its rooms just as elegant, but the legacy of ruby is inescapable.

and as ashby house tightens its grip on jules and camden, questions about the infamous heiress come to light. was there any truth to the persistent rumors following her disappearance as a girl? what really happened to those four husbands, who all died under mysterious circumstances? and why did she adopt cam in the first place? soon, jules and cam realize that an inheritance can entail far more than what’s written in a will––and that the bonds of family stretch far beyond the grave.

you like it darker


from legendary storyteller and master of short fiction stephen king comes an extraordinary new collection of twelve short stories, many never-before-published, and some of his best ever.

“you like it darker? fine, so do i,” writes stephen king in the afterword to this magnificent new collection of twelve stories that delve into the darker part of life—both metaphorical and literal. king has, for half a century, been a master of the form, and these stories, about fate, mortality, luck, and the folds in reality where anything can happen, are as rich and riveting as his novels, both weighty in theme and a huge pleasure to read. king writes to feel “the exhilaration of leaving ordinary day-to-day life behind,” and in you like it darker, readers will feel that exhilaration too, again and again.

“two talented bastids” explores the long-hidden secret of how the eponymous gentlemen got their skills. in “danny coughlin’s bad dream,” a brief and unprecedented psychic flash upends dozens of lives, danny’s most catastrophically. in “rattlesnakes,” a sequel to cujo, a grieving widower travels to florida for respite and instead receives an unexpected inheritance—with major strings attached. in “the dreamers,” a taciturn vietnam vet answers a job ad and learns that there are some corners of the universe best left unexplored. “the answer man” asks if prescience is good luck or bad and reminds us that a life marked by unbearable tragedy can still be meaningful.

king’s ability to surprise, amaze, and bring us both terror and solace remains unsurpassed. each of these stories holds its own thrills, joys, and mysteries; each feels iconic. you like it darker? you got it.
