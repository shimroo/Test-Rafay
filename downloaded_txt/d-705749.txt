grand resolutions for catholic grandparents in 2024



december 15, 2023
marriage & family



          as the calendar turns, we're reminded of the fresh possibilities each new year offers. our mind wanders to resolutions past, acknowledging both triumphs and missteps. yet, for grandparents, this cycle can be a launching pad for "grand-initiatives" — targeted, realistic, and meaningful goals.

for grandparents rooted in faith, particularly catholicism, priorities naturally lean toward spiritual enrichment. while goals in health, finance, or personal growth are valuable, an "intentional catholic grandparent" might first look to deepen their spiritual foundations. these resolutions, or "faithful forays," are more than mere aspirations; they are deliberate steps towards enhancing one's communion with the divine, particularly focusing on the holy trinity.

a wholesome approach involves aligning our intentions with christ's teachings, seeking ways to become closer to god, invoking the holy spirit more frequently, and cultivating a character of benevolence. a suggested starting point is a prayerful conversation with jesus, seeking guidance on how to fulfill your grandparental role in the coming year. this could mean forming new habits, fostering virtues, and continuously seeking ways to express your faith and love more profoundly.

being a virtuous example is perhaps the most influential testimony to our families.

consider the following when planning your "faithful forays":

devotional life exploration:

how might you enhance the quality and quantity of your scriptural study, prayer, or spiritual readings?
consider dedicating time daily for bible study or prayer.
engage more deeply with the sacraments, perhaps through regular adoration or spiritual retreats.


sacramental engagement:

reflect on your participation in the sacraments, understanding them as conduits of grace and examples of faith to your family.
perhaps establish or renew a commitment to regular confession or prayer intentions during mass.


neighborly commitment:

explore how you might extend acts of mercy and kindness within your community or family, embodying christ's love.
consider volunteering or contributing to causes that align with your faith.


family enrichment efforts:

invest time in strengthening familial relationships, offering support and creating traditions that underscore faith and unity.


personal demeanor:

reflect on how your actions, words, and attitudes influence those around you, striving always to embody a spirit of positivity, respect, and dignity.



as you embark on these "faithful forays," remember the journey is as important as the destination. write down your goals, pray over them, and seek companionship and accountability in your spiritual journey. let 2024 be a year of deepened faith, enriched family bonds, and a testament to the enduring spirit of devoted grandparenting.        









 






the significance of your existence



september 23, 2023
marriage & family



          your presence on earth is no mere coincidence; it's a crucial part of a divine blueprint for joy.

the purpose behind your presence

ever pondered your existence? the creation of this world and your role in it? if you sense a profound objective beyond mere survival, seek answers through divine guidance.

we hold the belief that our souls pre-existed, dwelling with the divine in a spiritual state. as a parent guides their child to school, our divine parent dispatched us to earth to embody physical forms, learn, evolve, and ultimately return to a celestial abode.

divine aspirations for your joy

understanding that growth involves choice and adversity, the divine offered his son, jesus christ, as a guide and savior, to steer us toward true happiness. the teachings of jesus christ offer tranquility, joy, and fortitude to those who adhere to divine laws and embrace the faith. the sacred texts proclaim:

"through adam's fall, we were born, and through birth, we seek joy."

2 nephi 2:25

life's sorrows are not its sole offering. the divine has bestowed upon us myriad joys and wonders. love and relationships stand as pillars of life's purpose, offering hope and joy, promising an eternal union with the divine and our dear ones.


a time for learning and evolution

life's journey is marked with trials. amidst hardships, remember the divine's omnipotence, benevolence, and the ultimate rectification through jesus christ. the scriptures assure us of a future free from grief, death, and pain (revelation 21:4).

strengthening through adversity

life's trials are the forge of our divine potential. just as muscles strengthen against resistance, our spirit fortifies through life's challenges, fostering spiritual, mental, and emotional growth.

cultivating compassion

hardships expand our empathy, aligning us closer to jesus christ's virtues. in our struggles, we become divine instruments, aiding those in similar straits.

assurance of divine justice

while we enjoy free will, not all choices made by others are just or kind. these miseries, though intense, are transient and will be rectified through christ.

your path to elevation

in sending us to learn, the divine foresaw our errors and provided jesus christ as our redeemer. through his sacrifice, forgiveness and healing are within reach.

with christ's guidance, you can transcend past faults and grow in virtues like charity, humility, and patience, continuing your celestial journey back to the divine.        









 






the journey to reconciliation



june 17, 2023
blog



          letting go of grudges isn't simple, yet it's a liberating path to tranquility and lightness.

the higher path of forgiveness as jesus illustrated

in his pivotal sermon on the mount, jesus contrasted the old retributive justice of "an eye for an eye" with a revolutionary call for forgiveness, urging us to love our foes and turn the other cheek. this profound shift from retaliation to reconciliation embodies the essence of christian love and mercy.

the liberation of letting go

grasping onto grievances shackles us with perpetual discontent. these unresolved issues claim precious mental real estate, disrupting our peace and straining our relationships. in contrast, the liberating act of forgiveness is advocated in sacred texts like the book of mormon, which asserts that life's purpose is joy. by forgiving, we unburden ourselves, making room for happiness and the indwelling of the holy spirit. our joy becomes independent of others' actions and worldly justice, rooted instead in the freedom and lightness of forgiveness.

choosing to forgive, particularly in the face of grave transgressions, is undoubtedly challenging. yet, with faith in the savior and earnest supplication for the strength to forgive, we can overcome the barriers of resentment. as church leaders like elder kevin r. duncan have articulated, we should not be perpetual victims of our past afflictions and grievances. instead, we should rise above them through the transformative power of forgiveness.

 distinguishing forgiveness from trust

forgiving doesn't equate to immediate restoration of trust. it's perfectly reasonable to forgive someone yet remain cautious about fully trusting them again. this is particularly pertinent in situations of betrayal or harm. while forgiveness is a universal imperative, trust is earned and often requires time and evidence of change.


emulating the supreme forgiveness of christ

in our own struggles to forgive, we find an unparalleled exemplar in jesus christ. amidst his excruciating crucifixion, he embodied divine forgiveness, pleading for mercy on behalf of his persecutors. his atoning sacrifices and understanding of our deepest pains assure us that through his grace, not only can we receive forgiveness, but we are also empowered to extend it to others, even in our most trying moments.        







the path to divine pardon: embracing repentance and joy



april 16, 2023
blog



          finding divine pardon involves sincere reflection and transformation through the grace of jesus christ.

understanding true repentance

true repentance goes beyond mere acknowledgment of wrongs or verbal apologies. it involves a profound transformation of mind and spirit, a shift from sinning to seeking divine aid and pardon. through repentance, one can attain enduring joy and contentment.

repentance offers an opportunity for improvement. as you strive to shed negative habits, dependencies, and enact positive changes, god remains patient. such transformation, achievable through the atoning sacrifice of jesus christ, is worthwhile regardless of the duration.

the necessity of repentance

despite the prevalent belief in moral relativism, god sets definite standards and commands for us. imperfection is a universal trait, necessitating everyone to seek repentance. as the scripture in romans 3:23 states, "for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of god"; our transgressions hinder our return to god's presence.

jesus christ's atonement provides a pathway to forgiveness. by bearing our sins, he enables us to cleanse ourselves and live without remorse.

the joys of repentance

sin burdens the soul with regret and grief. through repentance, these feelings are supplanted by joy and relief. alma, a prophet from the book of mormon, vividly recounts the joy of redemption: "there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy" (alma 36:21). full repentance brings forgiveness, healing, peace, delight, liberation, and assurance.

the process of repentance

the power to absolve sins lies with jesus christ. though repentance can be challenging and sometimes painful, it's a journey towards liberation and renewal. the lord assures, "he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and i, the lord, remember them no more".

repentance is a deeply personal journey with jesus. it may take varying times to repent for different sins. while not merely a series of steps, certain principles can guide those uncertain of how to commence or gauge their progress.

is my sin beyond repentance?

jesus christ's sacrifice covers all sins. you might feel overwhelmed by the gravity or frequency of your sins, but no one is beyond the reach of repentance and forgiveness. regardless of the sin's nature or frequency, complete absolution is possible through jesus christ, who awaits to grant forgiveness eagerly.        









 






unraveling the myth of work-life balance: a modern perspective



february 19, 2023
blog



          the concept of work-life balance is a prevalent topic in today's fast-paced world, where the lines between professional and personal life are increasingly blurred. the term typically refers to the ideal state where an individual allocates the right amount of time and energy to both work and personal life activities, aiming for a sense of harmony and fulfillment.

however, the notion of work-life balance is often labeled a myth due to its elusive and subjective nature. critics argue that the concept implies a perfect equilibrium is achievable, setting unrealistic expectations for individuals striving to attain it. the critique is multifaceted, focusing on the changing nature of work, individual differences, and the societal implications of pursuing such balance.

 

firstly, the evolving nature of work with technological advancements means that people are more connected than ever, with the boundaries between work and home becoming increasingly porous. the rise of remote working and the "always on" culture exacerbates this issue, making it difficult for individuals to switch off from work and fully engage in personal life. this constant connectivity challenges the traditional 9-5 workday concept, making the idea of a perfect balance seem more unattainable.

 

secondly, the pursuit of work-life balance is highly individualistic, with each person's ideal balance looking different based on their life stage, career, personal values, and responsibilities. for some, work might be a source of fulfillment and a central part of their identity, while for others, personal life activities and relationships hold more significance. this subjectivity means that a one-size-fits-all approach to achieving balance is ineffective and can lead to feelings of inadequacy and stress when people fail to meet these generalized standards.

 

moreover, the quest for work-life balance is often criticized for not taking into account broader societal and economic factors that influence individuals' ability to achieve it. issues such as job insecurity, work demands, and socio-economic status significantly impact the feasibility of attaining a balanced life. for many, particularly in lower-income brackets or demanding jobs, the luxury of balancing work and life is a far-fetched dream, overshadowed by the need to meet basic financial and job security needs.

the myth of work-life balance also overlooks the dynamic nature of life, where priorities and responsibilities shift over time. what might be a balanced life at one point can quickly become unbalanced due to unforeseen life events or changes in personal circumstances. this fluidity suggests that balance is not a fixed state to be achieved but a continuous process of adjustment and renegotiation of priorities.

 

in response to these criticisms, many advocate for a more realistic and flexible approach to managing work and life. concepts such as work-life integration or harmony are gaining traction, emphasizing the integration of work and personal life in a way that aligns with individual values and circumstances. these approaches recognize the complexity of modern life and advocate for a more personalized and fluid understanding of how work and personal life can coexist.

 

in conclusion, while the idea of work-life balance is aspirational, labeling it a myth acknowledges the complex reality of modern living. it prompts a reevaluation of what balance means and encourages a more nuanced approach to managing the competing demands of work and personal life. as society continues to evolve, so too will the ways in which individuals seek to harmonize their professional and personal lives, moving beyond the myth towards a more individualized and dynamic understanding of balance.

tired of the hustle and bustle of the gambling world, we retreated to the old city of macau. the atmosphere is in stark contrast to the distance of less than 2 km, it was as if we were thrown into the 16th century. the colonial buildings that are still well-maintained, the streets with stone tiles, brought directly from the portal, have survived to this day. we headed into the hills to see the ruins of the church of santo paulo.
igreja de santo paulo, that's his name. located in the hills, this church is a memory of portuguese rule in the past. built between the years 1602-1640, this church burned down in 1835. only the facade remains today. the remains of the ruins of this church became an icon of macau. it was early in the morning. we went back down to downtown macau. the gambling city that never sleeps.

history of catholic church in 1827 – 1890



february 2, 2020
history



          at that time, the commissioner-general was leonardus petrus josephus burggraaf du bus de ghisignies, a catholic who was also a catholic, from the vlaanderen region in belgium. he has full authority in batavia, as well as more power than a governor-general. during the post of du bus de ghisignies, 1825-1830, the indonesian catholic church was able to breathe freely. he is catholic and is very concerned about the needs of the people. he was also instrumental in creating freedom of religious life in batavia at that time. one of the services is the regeringsreglement which he made, in article 97 it was put: "the implementation of all religions is protected by the government." he also urged father prinsen to settle in jakarta immediately.

seeing the urgent need of the people for the church to be a place of worship, ghisignies sought a place to establish a new church. he gave the opportunity to the cathedral church council to buy the former governor general's palace in the west/north corner of banteng square (formerly waterlooplein), which was then used as an office by the ministry of defense. at that time, on the land stood the building of the former commander of general de kock's army. catholics were given the opportunity to buy the big house for 20,000 guilders. the church administrator received a reduction in the price of 10,000 guilders and a loan from the government of 8,000 guilders, which had to be repaid in one year without interest.

in 1826 ghisignies ordered ir. tromp to complete the "white house," which was started by daendels (1809) and is now used by the ministry of finance in banteng field. ir. tromp was also asked to build an official residence for the commander of the armed forces (1830) and is now known as the pancasila building on jl. pejambon. third-order to ir. tromp was designing the first catholic church in batavia. the place is now the cathedral church.

at the urging of commissioner-general du bus de ghisignies, ir. tromp designed a 33 x 17-meter cross-shaped new church. the altar room is made in a semicircle, while in the long main room, six pillars are installed. this building style is baroque-gothic-classicism, neogothic-patterned windows, baroque-style faces, pilasters, and two buildings left and left classicistic. the tower looks rather short and is decorated with a small dome on it. so, the building style is called eclecticism. plus, two buildings for the rectory flanking the church on either side and a row of rooms behind him. apparently, the design of ir. this tromp required substantial funds and exceeded the financial capacity of the church at that time. then this design was never carried out.



therefore, the building was obtained by the catholics, at the suggestion of ir. tromp was overhauled in such a way that it could be used for the church. this building is actually a building with a large room between two rows of pillars. on both sides, its length is equipped with aisles. in the middle of the roof was built a small six square tower. in the east part of the original house is maintained for the priest's residence and in the west for the boarding house. the grand altar is a gift from commissioner general du bus ghisignies. the church, which is 35 meters long and 17 meters wide, on november 6, 1829, was blessed by monseigneur prinsen and given the name, santa maria raised to heaven.

the church was sufficient to assist the priests in carrying out its mission of service in batavia. more and more people are participating in mass. for the first time, on may 8, 1834, four indigenous javanese were baptized in this church.

over time, the church suffered a lot of damage. improvements made are patchy only. then in 1859, a major renovation was held. according to the observation of a building expert, the tower in the middle of the roof is the cause of damage and leakage. the tower was too heavy for the roof structure of the church, so that is pressed against the wall and caused leaks everywhere. therefore it is proposed to dismantle the small tower and replace it with a new tower located above the entrance to the west. finally, on may 31, 1880, the church began to function again after it was completely renovated.

nearly ten years later, april 9, 1890, found parts of the church that began to be damaged, a pile of lime and sand-strewn near a pillar. this situation was quite alarming for the priests, especially fr. kortenhorst, who had stepped on the pile of lime and sand that morning. on the same day around pk. 9:00 a.m., father kortenhorst and father luypen examine the church situation. one of the pillars seems worrying. at 10:30 a.m., the pillar was looking worse and more alarming. many chalks began to come loose again. not long after, when the priests entered the sacristy, the church building collapsed with a terrible roar. the entire yard is covered in dust so that people cannot see more than five steps. the time of the day was 10:45 a.m. it was exactly three days after the easter celebration.

when the dust had begun to fall, the destruction of the church began to become apparent. the roof is gaping. before this event, there were still 68 benches made of teak wood, and now only ten are left, the rest are heavily damaged. in addition, what remained intact were the altar, the court of the priest, and the sacristy and the tower.

the condition of the church at that time was very severe, and it was not possible to hold mass. for the time being, mass is held in the horse-drawn carriage garage, which is adapted for the emerging church.        







is stock market as similar as gambling? how it is applied in religion life?



january 27, 2020
bible intermezzo



          many people think that the way to get profits in shares is like gambling. the next question would be, is it contradicting the bible or other religions? if we see people only like betting, who is quick to win, then there is a story of a barrage of losses, is it true that the stock is not gambling?


definition and how an activity is called gambling
in my opinion, this is a simple definition of gambling. in reality, gambling is snowballing, it can consist of various activities, models, and variations in patterns. there are betting one person like that definition, betting several people, even up to tens of thousands of people, or even betting online. from their activities, some bet numbers on the table, guess numbers, guess who wins, guess the results of the matches, election results, etc. in essence, gambling is the activity of guessing something with a bet. but it was years ago, now betting in gambling is really similar to stock, we also need to analyze statistically before we put our bet. you will have a live score and position of your betting online like in https://yukbola.net the sportsbook website in indonesia, really similar with stock market report in daily.
what are shares?
to learn more about stocks, please read the educational article about getting to know stocks. someone who has a stock means having some of the company's capital. this means that the person owns a small company. by holding a small company, he seems to have a company and its rights and obligations. from here, it seems stock activities are far different from gambling. but it's not.

if you are muslim and need fiqh guidance about stocks, there is already a fatwa about sharia shares. if you know this, it should be clear about different investment activities in stocks and gambling. is that clear?

people like to bet only; they do not know how to profit or loss
that is the negative effect of what i consider to be the wrong education. if all agree that the stock is to have a good and profitable company for him, then that person's activities will be far from the gambling traits as above. but the negative from stock is the internal people can control the increment or decrement of a stock. it usually named as insider trader.
what is gambling stock?
to test it, is someone losing money and others in stock? a person can lose if he sells his shares when the value is down. a person can profit if he sells his shares when the value is rising.

two people are investing in a stock. if the price is down, they can both lose. maybe it's just a different percentage. if the price is rising, the opposite can happen, both can profit. but clearly, someone will not lose money even if he sells his stock loss unless the company goes bankrupt.

in the stock model, the activity is similar to someone opening a shop to sell a product. he can profit. he can lose. a person can sell his shop to someone else when they make a profit by making a difference in the increase in capital and the value of the store that is already greater. even stores that are at a loss can be sold to other people who are eyeing their assets or shop building.
shares should be considered as a store business because the reality is so.
have you ever heard of someone buying a store at a higher price than the prices of other similar stores? similarly, in stock. there are people who buy a small amount of a company with assets of one hundred billion with an assumption of the value of a certain amount. meanwhile, there are other people who are so eager to have a business that is willing to pay the company worth rp500 billion. that's what happened in the stock.
stocks are business buys. people can profit. people can lose which similar as gambling with analysis
then what about people who buy and sell shares without knowing the background of the company, its business, or the value of the company? they are like corporate buyers who are too aggressive, and they can pay too much or pay without knowing what they are buying.

if people buy shares without knowing what they are buying, then the business goes bankrupt, then the shares become worthless, this is the same as people who share a company without knowing the ins and outs of their business. most people who do something like that can lose.

establishing a business with good knowledge can suffer losses. how would it be if managing a business without knowledge? it can get worse. in the same way, the same.

so when you are gambling with analysis, you doing similar to stock analysis.
