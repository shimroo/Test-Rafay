noack volatility test 
                            is a critical measurement of motor oil quality
amsoil 
                            was the first motor oil company in north america to 
                            use the noack volatility test to measure motor oil 
                            quality and performance. although competing motor 
                            oil companies initially paid no attention to noack 
                            results, the test has since become a critical measurement 
                            tool throughout the industry.
modern 
                            engine designs generate more heat than ever, accentuating 
                            the importance of the noack volatility test for determining 
                            an oil's ability to provide an adequate level of protection 
                            and performance. more horsepower, turbo chargers and 
                            aerodynamic styling have created extremely hot environments 
                            that receive less cooling from outside air, and high 
                            heat leads to oil oxidation, deposits and thickening 
                            in conventional oils.
top quality 
                            for the current api sm motor oils specification, gasoline 
                            motor oils cannot experience a weight loss of more 
                            than 15 percent in the noack test. amsoil synthetic 
                            motor oils were exceeding modern requirements over 
                            20 years ago, while many current motor oils still 
                            have a hard time meeting this minimal requirement, 
                            increasing wear, fuel consumption and emissions.
as seen 
                            in the graph, amsoil synthetic motor oil easily passes 
                            the noack test and falls well below the the maximum 
                            15 percent volatilization (burn off) rate dictated 
                            by the api sm motor oil specification, while the royal 
                            purple volatilization (burn off) rate is over 11 percent 
                            and the lucas oil fails 
                            the test with a volatilization (burn off) rate of 
                            over 40 percent. (read

a simple way to protect your 
                      vehicle's turbocharged engine
once reserved 
                      for sports cars, turbochargers are becoming commonplace 
                      in family sedans as automakers try to squeeze greater efficiency 
                      out of smaller engines in order to meet tough fuel-economy 
                      standards. the popular ford fusion and chevy malibu are 
                      just two examples of daily drivers available with turbocharged 
                      engines. a turbocharged four-cylinder engine can generate 
                      as much power as a naturally aspirated six-cylinder engine 
                      while using less fuel, offering drivers the best of both 
                      worlds.
the added performance 
                      and efficiency comes at a price, however. turbochargers 
                      use exhaust gases to spin an air compressor that compresses 
                      clean, cold air before directing it into the combustion 
                      chamber. the added oxygen means more fuel is added to the 
                      fuel/air mixture, resulting in more power. the increased 
                      heat turbocharged engines produce combined with the rotational 
                      speed of the turbine create brutal operating conditions 
                      low-quality oils simply can't handle. increased heat hastens 
                      the oxidation process and causes oil to break down sooner, 
                      leading to performance-robbing deposits, while shearing 
                      forces inside the turbo can tear apart the molecular structure 
                      of the oil, leading to viscosity loss. oil that has lost 
                      viscosity can fail to provide an adequate fluid film to 
                      guard against wear, potentially leading to catastrophic 
                      damage.
one of the simplest 
                      ways motorists can protect their turbocharged vehicles against 
                      these challenges is to use only high-quality synthetic motor 
                      oil, such as amsoil synthetic motor oils, and adhere to 
                      the severe-service drain interval recommendations. amsoil 
                      synthetic motor oils naturally resist extreme heat and viscosity 
                      loss in the most demanding conditions. they are formulated 
                      using high-quality, molecularly uniform base oils and premium 
                      additives to deliver consistent performance in the toughest 
                      operating conditions. 
it's one of the 
                      best investments you can make in your turbocharged vehicle's 
                      performance and longevity.

what you need to know about 
                      motorcycle oils
overview
                      as with any vehicle equipped with an internal combustion 
                      engine, proper lubrication is essential to insure performance 
                      and longevity. it is important to point out that not all 
                      internal combustion engines are similarly designed or exposed 
                      to the same types of operation. these variations in design 
                      and operation place different demands on engine oils. specifically, 
                      the demands placed on motorcycle engine oils are more severe 
                      than those placed on automotive engine oils. therefore, 
                      the performance requirements of motorcycle oils are more 
                      demanding as well.
though the degree may be debatable, 
                      few will disagree that a difference exists between automotive 
                      and motorcycle applications. in which area these differences 
                      are and to what degree they alter lubrication requirements 
                      are not clear to most motorcycle operators. by comparing 
                      some basic equipment information, one can better understand 
                      the differences that exist.
there are six primary differences 
                      between motorcycle and automotive engine applications:
operational speed 
                      - motorcycles tend to operate at engine speeds 
                      significantly higher than automobiles. this places additional 
                      stress on engine components, increasing the need for wear 
                      protection. it also subjects lubricating oils to higher 
                      loading and shear forces. elevated operating rpms also promote 
                      foaming, which can reduce an oil's load-carrying ability 
                      and accelerated oxidation.
compression ratio 
                      - motorcycles tend to operate with higher engine 
                      compression ratios than automobiles. higher compression 
                      ratios place additional stress on engine components and 
                      increase engine operating temperatures. higher demands are 
                      placed on the oil to reduce wear. elevated operating temperatures 
                      also promote thermal degradation of the oil, reducing its 
                      life expectancy and increasing the formation of internal 
                      engine deposits.
horsepower/displacement 
                      density - motorcycle engines produce nearly twice 
                      the horsepower per cubic inch of displacement of automobile 
                      engines. this exposes the lubricating oil to higher temperatures 
                      and stress.
variable engine cooling 
                      - in general, automotive applications usa a sophisticated 
                      water-cooling system to control engine operating temperatures. 
                      similar systems can be found in motorcycle applications, 
                      but other designs also exist. many motorcycles are air-cooled 
                      or use a combination air/oil design. though effective, they 
                      result in greater fluctuations in operating temperatures, 
                      particularly when motorcycle are operated in stop-and-go 
                      traffic. elevated operating temperature promotes oxidation 
                      and causes oils to thin, reducing their load carrying ability.
multiple lubrication 
                      functionality - in automotive applications, engine 
                      oils are required to lubricate only the engine. other automotive 
                      assemblies, such as transmissions, have seperate fluid reservoirs 
                      that contain a lubricant designed specifically for that 
                      component. the requirements of that fluid differ significantly 
                      from those of automotive engine oil. many motorcycles have 
                      a common sump supplying oil to both the engine and transmission. 
                      in such cases, the oil is required to meet the needs of 
                      both the engine and transmission gears. many motorcycles 
                      also incorporate a frictional clutch within the transmission 
                      that uses the same oil.
inactivity - 
                      motorcycles are typically used less frequently than automobiles. 
                      whereas automobiles are used on a daily basis, motorcycle 
                      use is usually periodic and in many cases seasonal. these 
                      extended periods of inactivity place additional stress on 
                      motorcycle oils. in these circumstances, rust and acid corrosion 
                      protection are of critical concern.
it is apparent that motorcycle 
                      applications place a different set of requirements on lubricating 
                      oils. motorcycle oils, therefore, must be formulated to 
                      address this unique set of high stress conditions.







consistent clutch 
                      feel - clutch slippage or inconsistent clutch feel 
                      can prevent dirt bike riders from riding as fast or effectively 
                      as they like. to keep the engine within the power band, 
                      riders often modulate the clutch, increasing the opportunity 
                      for clutch slippage if low-quality lubricants are used.
amsoil 
                      synthetic dirt bike oil's superior friction-durability 
                      properties help minimize clutch slippage, fade and chatter, 
                      giving riders consistent clutch feel during takeoffs or 
                      when maneuvering around obstacles on the trail. in an extreme 
                      simulated-start test, amsoil synthetic dirt bike oil continued 
                      to deliver consistent clutch feel following 32 simulated 
                      race starts, while a leading original equipment manufacturer 
                      (oem)-branded oil demonstrated inconsistent clutch-lever 
                      action and poor clutch feel after 16 starts. the clutch 
                      plates lubricated with amsoil synthetic dirt bike oil remained 
                      clean and in good overall condition, while the plates using 
                      the oem oil revealed discoloration and wear. amsoil synthetic 
                      dirt bike oil's superior performance helps instill in riders 
                      the confidence that their bikes will perform consistently 
                      in all types of riding conditions.
racing is research 
                      - amsoil corporately sponsored supercross and motocross 
                      racers identified consistent clutch feel as a key performance 
                      attribute. at the time, there was no dirt-bike-specific 
                      oil on the market that provided the level of clutch consistency 
                      professional and amateur riders demand. consistent clutch 
                      feel is critical to motocross riders during starts to keep 
                      the bike from lurching forward prior to the gate dropping. 
                      trail riders, meanwhile, need consistent clutch feel to 
                      confidently navigate obstacles without having to shift gears 
                      and lose momentum.
in-depth product development 
                      - the process to develop synthetic dirt bike oil 
                      relied on a combination of lab and track testing. clutch 
                      feel is inherently subjective, which creates challenges 
                      in designing a lubricant that delivers consistent clutch 
                      feel. to overcome that challenge, amsoil designed the extreme 
                      simulated-start test on dirt bikes. the test allows amsoil 
                      engineers to apply accelerated stress to a dirt bike's clutch 
                      in order to monitor clutch feel produced by a candidate 
                      lubricant.
the test uses a 2014 honda 
                      crf450r attached to a dyno. while in second gear, the test 
                      administrator holds the clutch at the point just prior to 
                      engagement, similar to the way a rider would hold the bike 
                      in the gates during a race start. the clutch is then released 
                      and the bike is run to fourth gear, simulating the time 
                      from the drop of the gate to the first corner in a race. 
                      the rear wheel is not allowed to slip during the test, placing 
                      additional stress on the clutch. test administrators look 
                      for consistent lever action and feel as they wait to let 
                      out the clutch and as they shift the bike through the gears.
amsoil 
                      synthetic dirt bike oil was also subjected to extensive 
                      on-track testing in the bikes of geico/amsoil/honda factory 
                      connection and other professional riders. a combination 
                      of rider feedback and lab testing resulted in the final 
                      formulation of synthetic dirt bike oil. its performance 
                      in lab and track testing dispels the myth that synthetics 
                      are "too slippery" and make clutches slip. results 
                      also demonstrate that amsoil synthetic dirt bike oil delivers 
                      consistent clutch performance while helping extend clutch 
                      life. (buy

like fuel, water 
                      and electricity, compressed air is a vital utility that 
                      we depend on to support our daily lives. we don't receive 
                      a monthly compressed air bill from a utility company, so 
                      it's easy to forget how necessary and prevalent it is. virtually 
                      every manufactured item requires compressed air for the 
                      creation of its raw materials, or for its assembly, production, 
                      packaging or shipping. we use compressed air at home to 
                      fill tires, run air tools, spray paint and keep basketballs 
                      from going flat.
reciprocating 
                      compressors are the type you are most likely to encounter 
                      in your day-to-day activities. they are commonly found in 
                      the corner of a typical garage or the back room of a tire 
                      shop, and many of them require oil.
reciprocating 
                      compressors use a piston and cylinder to compress air. a 
                      motor turns the crankshaft, causing the piston to move downward, 
                      pulling air into the cylinder past a one-way intake valve. 
                      the piston then moves up, squeezing the air until enough 
                      pressure is created to push it through an exhaust valve 
                      into a tank. this type of compressor turns on and off as 
                      needed to cool between cycles. running a standard reciprocator 
                      constantly without giving it time to cool will result in 
                      overheating, which is a major cause of premature compressor 
                      failure.
to avoid overheating, 
                      the compressor should be sized appropriately for the tools 
                      it's intended to run. if the compressor is capable of putting 
                      out 2 cubic feet of air per minute(cfm), but the tool draws 
                      4 cfm, the tool will only run well in spurts and the compressor 
                      will never shut off while you're using it. cfm is clearly 
                      identified in compressor and tool manuals or on the tools 
                      themselves, so there's no math to do. it's just as damaging 
                      when compressors sit idle for weeks, giving rust and corrosion 
                      an opportunity to start. since compressors are about as 
                      exciting as vacuum cleaners to most people, undersized and 
                      underused units are very common. the real excitement comes 
                      when you have to write a $500-$800 check to replace a less 
                      than three-year-old compressor that should have lasted more 
                      than a decade. good oil can go a long way toward keeping 
                      these neglected compressors running for years.
besides providing 
                      basic lubrication, reciprocating compressor oils have to 
                      effectively deal with extreme heat and water - two potentially 
                      damaging byproducts of compressing air. internal temperatures 
                      may range between 300°f and 400°f, accelerating 
                      oil deterioration and causing carbon to form on the valves 
                      and keep them from sealing. most of the time this just gradually 
                      degrades compressor performance, but on rare occasions the 
                      carbon can become an ignition source for the oil air vapor 
                      in the cylinder, presenting an explosion hazard. it has 
                      happened. water, on the other hand, will destroy the compressor 
                      as rust and corrosion attack the machine while it sits quietly 
                      in the garage.
like our motor 
                      oils, amsoil compressor oils are designed to handle severe 
                      environments. the synthetic base oils provide greater oxidation 
                      resistance, lower carbon-forming tendencies and higher oil 
                      film strength than is possible with commonly used mineral 
                      oils. this extra protection will help protect the compressor 
                      when it's being pushed to its limit or if oil changes are 
                      neglected. water is dealt with in two ways. first, it easily 
                      separates from the oil, allowing it to be drained from the 
                      sump. this is a benefit for larger compressors found in 
                      industrial facilities, but is not practical for machines 
                      that hold a quart of oil. for these machines, the best way 
                      to protect against water is to change the oil at the manufacturer's 
                      suggested drain interval and prevent rust and corrosion 
                      from starting regardless of the water situation. the high-quality 
                      anti-rust, anti-corrosion additives provided with amsoil 
                      compressor oils go a long way toward protecting the compressor 
                      through extended periods of idleness.
we are often 
                      asked which oil should be used in reciprocating compressors. 
                      by far the most common oil listed in reciprocating compressor 
                      manuals is non-detergent iso vg 100 or sae 30/40 oil. when 
                      these are listed, amsoil iso 100, sae 30/40 synthetic compressor 
                      oil (pck) is the recommended product. we make it easy by 
                      listing all the viscosities on the quart label.



is your synthetic motor oil 
                      really synthetic?
at one time, 
                      synthetic oil was made exclusively from polyalphaolefin 
                      and ester base oils (group iv base oils). then the landscape 
                      became a bit murky in 1999 when mobil challenged castrol 
                      when castrol introduced an oil made from group lll base 
                      oil and called it synthetic. the dispute played out before 
                      the national advertising division of the better business 
                      bureau and castrol prevailed. no big problem there. group 
                      lll base oils offer good performance, and now gtl (gas-to-liquid) 
                      base oils have joined the group lll segment.
the problem is 
                      that there is no official regulation. an oil with less than 
                      50 percent synthetic base oil can be labeled synthetic. 
                      in fact, there is absolutely nothing to prevent motor oil 
                      marketers from labeling oils made from conventional group 
                      l or group ll base oils as synthetic. there is currently 
                      no testing to verify the base oil content. and even if it 
                      was proven that the product contained no synthetic oil, 
                      there are no legal ramifications since no official definitions 
                      exist for the category.
the bottom line, 
                      of course, is that in many cases consumers are paying too 
                      much for oil that doesn't measure up to the high standards 
                      of synthetic as amsoil defines the term. and on the flip 
                      side, consumers purchasing synthetic oil for $3.43 a quart 
                      are, in all likelihood, not getting what they think.
tom glenn, the 
                      author of an article in lubes 'n' greases magazine (an oil 
                      industry trade magazine), offers this as a call to action:
now is the 
                      time to take a closer look at the term synthetic and officially 
                      define what constitutes synthetic motor oil, based on measurable 
                      and meaningful attributes and clear-cut rules. in doing 
                      so, we can protect consumers from cheaters and level the 
                      playing field for those that play by the rules. if we don't 
                      do it now, it may be too late to do it when synthetics dominate 
                      the passenger car motor oil segment.
i certainly hope 
                      that gets done. in the meantime, amsoil can set consumers 
                      straight.
not all synthetics 
                      are created equal, and it may be that not all synthetics 
                      are actually synthetic at all.
amsoil created 
                      the synthetic motor oil market, and we continue to set the 
                      standard for performance. our definition of synthetic doesn't 
                      waver. consumers can be assured that what they see on the 
                      label is what they'll see in the bottle. with amsoil, people 
                      get what they pay for.



a simple way to protect your 
                      vehicle's turbocharged engine
once reserved 
                      for sports cars, turbochargers are becoming commonplace 
                      in family sedans as automakers try to squeeze greater efficiency 
                      out of smaller engines in order to meet tough fuel-economy 
                      standards. the popular ford fusion and chevy malibu are 
                      just two examples of daily drivers available with turbocharged 
                      engines. a turbocharged four-cylinder engine can generate 
                      as much power as a naturally aspirated six-cylinder engine 
                      while using less fuel, offering drivers the best of both 
                      worlds.
the added performance 
                      and efficiency comes at a price, however. turbochargers 
                      use exhaust gases to spin an air compressor that compresses 
                      clean, cold air before directing it into the combustion 
                      chamber. the added oxygen means more fuel is added to the 
                      fuel/air mixture, resulting in more power. the increased 
                      heat turbocharged engines produce combined with the rotational 
                      speed of the turbine create brutal operating conditions 
                      low-quality oils simply can't handle. increased heat hastens 
                      the oxidation process and causes oil to break down sooner, 
                      leading to performance-robbing deposits, while shearing 
                      forces inside the turbo can tear apart the molecular structure 
                      of the oil, leading to viscosity loss. oil that has lost 
                      viscosity can fail to provide an adequate fluid film to 
                      guard against wear, potentially leading to catastrophic 
                      damage.
one of the simplest 
                      ways motorists can protect their turbocharged vehicles against 
                      these challenges is to use only high-quality synthetic motor 
                      oil, such as amsoil synthetic motor oils, and adhere to 
                      the severe-service drain interval recommendations. amsoil 
                      synthetic motor oils naturally resist extreme heat and viscosity 
                      loss in the most demanding conditions. they are formulated 
                      using high-quality, molecularly uniform base oils and premium 
                      additives to deliver consistent performance in the toughest 
                      operating conditions. 
it's one of the 
                      best investments you can make in your turbocharged vehicle's 
                      performance and longevity.



amsoil - warranty secure
your 
                      answer to misleading oem practices
original equipment manufacturers 
                      (oems) often suggest in owner's manuals, advertisements 
                      or through dealership personnel that motorists and enthusiasts 
                      must use the oem-branded oil to comply with the new vehicle 
                      or equipment warranty. some oems include warnings of catastrophic 
                      engine failure should a non-oem oil be used. these tactics 
                      are especially pervasive in the powersports market and are 
                      calculated to create uncertainty and fear in the consuming 
                      public to the point that many consumers feel they are at 
                      risk when using anything but oem-branded lubricants. generally, 
                      the public is unaware that it is illegal for a vehicle manufacturer 
                      to tie the warranty of its product to the use of the manufacturer's 
                      own lubricant.

federal law seeks to ensure competition 
                        within the marketplace, and that specifically includes 
                        guaranteeing continuing warranty coverage outside the 
                        use of oem-branded lubricants. in short, you have the 
                        right to use the oil of your choice.
 if the lubricant did not cause 
                        the problem, the oem warranty cannot be voided, period.
the warranty secure symbol is designed 
                        to reassure consumers that simply using amsoil synthetic 
                        lubricants in place of oem-branded lubricants, or practicing 
                        extended drain intervals when using amsoil lubricants, 
                        does not void new vehicle or equipment manufacturer warranties.

feel secure using amsoil 
                        products
it is against federal law for 
                        an original equipment manufacturer (oem) to deny warranty 
                        coverage based solely on the brand of lubricant used. 
                        the warranty secure symbol informs consumers of this fact. 
                        using amsoil synthetic lubricants in place of oem-branded 
                        lubricants, or practicing extended drain intervals when 
                        using amsoil lubricants, does not void new vehicle or 
                        equipment manufacturer warranties.
according to the federal trade 
                        commission:
the magnuson-moss warranty act makes 
                        it illegal for companies to void your warranty or deny 
                        coverage under the warranty simply because you used an 
                        aftermarket or recycled part.... the manufacturer 
                        or dealer must show that the aftermarket or recycled part 
                        caused the need for repairs before denying warranty coverage.

                        products violates the warranty, contact amsoil technical

after 
                    409,000 miles without an oil change, the amsoil-protected 
                    mack e7-400 engine in this truck was as wear-free as an engine 
                    in comparable service treated to twenty times the oil changes.
colonial 
                      heights, virginia -  "i didn't see any surprises 
                      in there at all. based on my experience with amsoil motor 
                      oil, it came out the way we expected," said owner/ 
                      operator haywood gray (left) of his 1990 mack e7-400 engine. 
                      it came out in good shape, exactly what you'd expect for 
                      a well-maintained engine with 630,000 miles. yet the engine's 
                      oil had not been changed for 409,000 miles!

                    gray changed his oil at 40,000-to 60,000-mile intervals though 
                    his oil analysis reports showed, without exception, that the

truck driver takes big savings 
                    to the bank using amsoil products
terry anderson 
                    jr. of chesapeake, virginia saves money, time and fuel using 
                    amsoil products.
in fact, he saved 
                      $5,679 the first year he switched to amsoil lubes, filters 
                      and additives.
anderson, owner 
                    of terry anderson jr. hauling inc., owns and operates a 2005 
                    peterbilt dump truck with a cat c-7 engine. he first installed 
                    amsoil 
                    15w-40 synthetic heavy duty diesel and marine motor oil 
                    and an amsoil 
                    ea oil filter in the truck. about a month later, he installed 
                    an amsoil 
                    by-pass filtration system.
"initially, 
                      i was concerned about the upfront cost of about $400, but 
                      soon found out it was money well spent," he said.
used oil analysis 
                    at 10,000 and 25,000 miles deemed the oil suitable for continued 
                    use, and he continued to run on the same oil.
"i changed 
                      my full flow filter after the second sample was sent in," 
                      anderson said. "the money i saved on oil alone in the 
                      first 25,000 miles paid for the by-pass filter system." 
                      at one year, and more than 50,000 miles on the same oil, 
                      a third oil analysis reported the oil good for continued 
                      use. "the savings in the oil changes alone is enough 
                      to justify using amsoil and the by-pass filter system," 
                      anderson said. "more surprising was the increased fuel 
                      efficiency i saw on a daily basis."
he typically 
                      changes the oil in the peterbilt four or five times a year 
                      at $159 each change. "that is $759 a year." he 
                      said. "i didn't have to get my hands dirty changing 
                      the oil at all for a year thanks to amsoil and the by-pass 
                      filter system."
anderson also 
                      realized increased fuel efficiency. "after changing 
                      my peterbilt over to amsoil lubricants and filters, i saw 
                      an increase in my fuel efficiency of one mile per gallon," 
                      he said. his fuel efficiency increased again when he used 
                      amsoil diesel concentrate and cetane boost. "mpg is 
                      huge in my world," anderson said. "the more miles 
                      i can go on one gallon, the more money i put in the bank."
with diesel fuel 
                      prices being so high, amsoil lubricants, filters and additives 
                      have saves anderson's company about $30 a day in improved 
                      fuel efficiency.
savings he realized 
                      in the first 15 days with amsoil products paid for his initial 
                      investment, anderson said. "the remainder of the year 
                      that $30 a day went straight to the bank along with the 
                      savings from the extended drain intervals." (see 
                      savings chart)
 

trucker saves thousands with 
                    amsoil
blake thompson 
                    is one happy trucker.
using amsoil products 
                    in his diesel engines saved him $5,000 in fuel costs in one 
                    year.
in 2006, thompson 
                    was a diesel mechanic in fortville, indiana when he fist became 
                    familiar with amsoil products. thompson had a dream of owning 
                    his own trucking company.
in november 2007, 
                      thompson bought his first diesel tractor - a 1999 international 
                      with an m11 cummins engine, an eaton 4-9 transmission, five 
                      low-range gears, four high-range gears and a twin screw 
                      (two differentials) rear-end. "it was in beautiful 
                      shape with 580,000 original miles," thompson said.
thompson is now 
                      a local hauler with two trailers. he uses one for hauling 
                      wood products - sawdust and wood chips, and the other for 
                      agricultural products, including corn and soy beans. the 
                      truck and tractor have a maximum gross weight of 80,000 
                      pounds.
thompson had his 
                    truck for only a short time before he switched to amsoil. 
                    with 590,000 miles on his tractor, he signed on the dotted 
                    line to become a commercial account. he purchased amsoil 
                    engine flush (aef) and twin packs of amsoil 
                    15w-40 heavy duty diesel and marine oil (ame).
thompson said he 
                    is more than happy he switched to amsoil products. he reports 
                    that while towing his hopper trailer his fuel mileage increased 
                    from 5.5 to 6.0 miles per gallon. while towing his walking 
                    floor trailer the fuel mileage increased from 6.0 to 6.5 miles 
                    per gallon.
oil analysis 
                      at 10,000 and 20,000 miles showed the oil was "good 
                      for continued use." typical oil drain intervals for 
                      the big diesel engine is 20,000 miles.
thompson was 
                      spending $75,000 a year on fuel. after investing $500 in 
                      amsoil products, he is spending $69,500 a year on fuel. 
                      that's a savings of $5,000 per year!
thompson is considering 
                    using oil analysis to extend his oil drain intervals even 
                    further, but thompson said he is so happy about the fuel savings 
                    that he is satisfied changing the oil at his current drain 
                    intervals.
thompson also 
                      uses amsoil 
                      synthetic 5th wheel grease (gfw) "because it goes 
                      on easy and stays where you put it." he can also see 
                      the difference in the spring shackles and king pins with 
                      amsoil 
                      synthetic heavy duty grease (ghd). thompson says he 
                      used to have to pump several pumps, with brand x grease, 
                      before the grease started squeezing out. now when he starts 
                      to pump the grease gun, the grease immediately starts to 
                      squeeze out of the joints. "that shows that the amsoil 
                      heavy duty grease stays where you put it."
thompson's business 
                      is growing. he recently bought another used tractor that 
                      has more than 470,000 miles on the engine. he says he will 
                      use amsoil 
                      15w-40 heavy-duty diesel and marine motor oil in that 
                      one too, and he is eager to try the gear 
                      lube in his bearings, transmission and differentials.
thompson has continued 
                    to buy amsoil 
                    15w-40 heavy duty diesel and marine motor oil, oil 
                    sample kits, heavy 
                    duty grease and 5th 
                    wheel grease.

what you need to know about 
                      motorcycle oils
overview
                      as with any vehicle equipped with an internal combustion 
                      engine, proper lubrication is essential to insure performance 
                      and longevity. it is important to point out that not all 
                      internal combustion engines are similarly designed or exposed 
                      to the same types of operation. these variations in design 
                      and operation place different demands on engine oils. specifically, 
                      the demands placed on motorcycle engine oils are more severe 
                      than those placed on automotive engine oils. therefore, 
                      the performance requirements of motorcycle oils are more 
                      demanding as well.
though the degree may be debatable, 
                      few will disagree that a difference exists between automotive 
                      and motorcycle applications. in which area these differences 
                      are and to what degree they alter lubrication requirements 
                      are not clear to most motorcycle operators. by comparing 
                      some basic equipment information, one can better understand 
                      the differences that exist.
there are six primary differences 
                      between motorcycle and automotive engine applications:
operational speed 
                      - motorcycles tend to operate at engine speeds 
                      significantly higher than automobiles. this places additional 
                      stress on engine components, increasing the need for wear 
                      protection. it also subjects lubricating oils to higher 
                      loading and shear forces. elevated operating rpms also promote 
                      foaming, which can reduce an oil's load-carrying ability 
                      and accelerated oxidation.
compression ratio 
                      - motorcycles tend to operate with higher engine 
                      compression ratios than automobiles. higher compression 
                      ratios place additional stress on engine components and 
                      increase engine operating temperatures. higher demands are 
                      placed on the oil to reduce wear. elevated operating temperatures 
                      also promote thermal degradation of the oil, reducing its 
                      life expectancy and increasing the formation of internal 
                      engine deposits.
horsepower/displacement 
                      density - motorcycle engines produce nearly twice 
                      the horsepower per cubic inch of displacement of automobile 
                      engines. this exposes the lubricating oil to higher temperatures 
                      and stress.
variable engine cooling 
                      - in general, automotive applications usa a sophisticated 
                      water-cooling system to control engine operating temperatures. 
                      similar systems can be found in motorcycle applications, 
                      but other designs also exist. many motorcycles are air-cooled 
                      or use a combination air/oil design. though effective, they 
                      result in greater fluctuations in operating temperatures, 
                      particularly when motorcycle are operated in stop-and-go 
                      traffic. elevated operating temperature promotes oxidation 
                      and causes oils to thin, reducing their load carrying ability.
multiple lubrication 
                      functionality - in automotive applications, engine 
                      oils are required to lubricate only the engine. other automotive 
                      assemblies, such as transmissions, have seperate fluid reservoirs 
                      that contain a lubricant designed specifically for that 
                      component. the requirements of that fluid differ significantly 
                      from those of automotive engine oil. many motorcycles have 
                      a common sump supplying oil to both the engine and transmission. 
                      in such cases, the oil is required to meet the needs of 
                      both the engine and transmission gears. many motorcycles 
                      also incorporate a frictional clutch within the transmission 
                      that uses the same oil.
inactivity - 
                      motorcycles are typically used less frequently than automobiles. 
                      whereas automobiles are used on a daily basis, motorcycle 
                      use is usually periodic and in many cases seasonal. these 
                      extended periods of inactivity place additional stress on 
                      motorcycle oils. in these circumstances, rust and acid corrosion 
                      protection are of critical concern.
it is apparent that motorcycle 
                      applications place a different set of requirements on lubricating 
                      oils. motorcycle oils, therefore, must be formulated to 
                      address this unique set of high stress conditions.

you'll notice 
                      by my signature below that i am an employee of chevron global 
                      lubricants. i am a training specialist and field engineer 
                      for our north american lubricants division. i originally 
                      worked for amoco at the r&d facility before moving into 
                      marketing, and while in that role, chevron bought our lubricants 
                      business right after i moved to florida.
all in all, i 
                      have more than 34 years of experience in fuels and lubricants 
                      testing, development and tech service support.
i own three motorcycles 
                      that i either drive on the street or race. what i wanted 
                      to share with you today is my experience with my drag bike.
it is a yamaha 
                      roadstar warrior. originally built as a power cruiser, but 
                      now it is stretched, slammed and built to run on e-85 fuel 
                      and nitrous oxide. i have taken this bike from a fun street 
                      cruiser to a beast that wants to jump out from under me 
                      every time i snap the throttle.
the engine is 
                      putting out more than three times the horsepower it was 
                      originally built with, and with the highly oxygenated fuel, 
                      nitrous, and severe use, i have been battling cylinder and 
                      piston ring distress for a couple of years. essentially, 
                      whenever i did a teardown, there was evidence of streaking 
                      of the nikasil-lined aluminum cylinder, essentially a scuffing 
                      situation that is aggravated by the high cylinder pressures 
                      and fuel dilution.
since chevron 
                      does not make motorcycle oils, i have had to try many of 
                      the "other" different motor oils, all synthetic. 
                      to make a long story short, i should have read your white 
                      paper on motorcycle oil testing. it would have saved me 
                      at least three premature teardowns.
bottom 
                      line - the amsoil 
                      synthetic motorcycle 20w-50 has completely solved my 
                      problems. i have been running it for over a year 
                      now, and compression and leakdown have stayed at the exact 
                      level as when the engine was freshly rebuilt. this weekend, 
                      i tore down the top end to try a new piston ring combination, 
                      and the cylinders had absolutely no sign 
                      of streaking or other wear-related distress.
also, all other 
                      clearances, including valve lash and valve guide and bearing 
                      have stayed the same. this is truly remarkable.
in my training 
                      endeavors, i run into a lot of end users who are high performance 
                      junkies just like me. i have no problem sharing my experience 
                      with the amsoil products.
thank you so 
                      much for the great product.

amsoil motorcycle oil for 
                        harley-davidson
a situation my daughter, lyn, told me 
                        about recently got me to thinking about how good it is 
                        to be able to blend our own oils and have complete control 
                        of our own product quality.
lyn loves to ride motorcycles. she recently 
                        purchased a harley-davidson bike and took it to the local 
                        harley shop to have our new amsoil motorcycle oil installed. 
                        the mechanic took issue with her not using the oil harley-davidson 
                        sells, saying, "i'll use amsoil motor oil when amsoil 
                        starts making motorcycles!"
how would you answer a challenge like 
                        that? i was pleased to hear lyn's response. she said, 
                        "i'll start using harley-davidson motor oil when 
                        harley starts making oil!"
perfect! the fact is that harley-davidson, 
                        like so many other "brands" of oil, contract 
                        with one or more oil companies to make their lubricants. 
                        often, the decision as to who actually makes a private 
                        labeled product is based on low bid, and like almost everything 
                        manufactured by a low bidder, short cuts are taken in 
                        order to meet the low price.
i understand that harley-davidson has 
                        contracted with one company for a number of years to make 
                        their oil. that's good, but it doesn't change the fact 
                        that they make motorcycles, not oil. now consider all 
                        the other private label oils out there. every manufacturer 
                        that makes equipment with an engine has its own name on 
                        an oil bottle. that includes all the major auto manufacturers, 
                        the makers of motorcycles, atv's, snowmobiles, lawnmowers, 
                        farm equipment, you name it, they all have oils. but none 
                        of these equipment manufacturers actually make an oil. 
                        they sell oil to make more money, and they often price 
                        these oils well above the going rate for competitive lubricants 
                        because, like harley-davidson, they can specify or create 
                        the impression that only their oil be used in their equipment.
now there's nothing wrong in having a 
                        goal to make money, but let's get real here. why would 
                        anyone want to use a product manufactured down to a price 
                        rather than a product manufactured up to high quality 
                        standards? we have tested a number of these private label 
                        motor oils and two-cycle oils and we found many are mediocre 
                        quality products. none of them even comes close to performing 
                        as well as amsoil lubricants, and that's a fact!
i'm not taking shots at harley-davidson. 
                        they make good motorcycles (although i liked my goldwing 
                        better). and i understand their concern that normal automotive 
                        oils not meeting api c specs shouldn't be used in their 
                        bikes. but when they imply that amsoil motorcycle oil 
                        is not as good as their brand or i hear that one of their 
                        dealers recommended not using amsoil, i get a little hostile. 
                        thise kinds of statements are the very reason we introduced 
                        our motorcycle oils in the first place. and when we say 
                        use our 20w-50 motorcycle oil in v-twin motorcycle engines, 
                        that definately includes harley-davidson motorcycles!
our motorcycle 
                        products brochure, g-391, includes wear comparisons 
                        of amsoil motorcycle oils vs other oils, including h-d 
                        "genuine." both our oils demonstrate superior 
                        wear protection over all other tested brands. interestingly 
                        enough, the highest wear scar in this test turned out 
                        to be harley-davidson's own "genuine" oil!"
there is a good reason why amsoil 
                        motorcycle oils protect so well against wear. they 
                        are formulated with significantly higher levels of zinc 
                        and phosphorus, which when included in proper formulation 
                        with other high quality additives, provide superior wear 
                        protection at the high operating temperatures typical 
                        of motorcycles. in addition, synthetic oils inherently 
                        reduce sump temperatures so the engines actually run cooler.
the fact is, harley would do well to 
                        have amsoil make their oils for them. then they could 
                        be assured that their oil was indeed a superior product. 
                        as it is, there may be absolutely nothing wrong with their 
                        oil for use in average service, but i guarantee you that 
                        as the oil temperature gets hotter, like it does when 
                        sitting in traffic on asphalt on a hot summer day, the 
                        harley-davidson with amsoil in the crankcase is going 
                        to be far better protected and run far cooler than the 
                        bike with h-d "genuine" oil in it. there's just 
                        no two ways about it!
so, my daughter lyn will be going back 
                        to this mechanic armed with the facts about amsoil 
                        motorcycle oils and a few facts about h-d oil. nobody's 
                        going to tell her that her dad's oils are not the very 
                        best. she knows better, and she's on a mission to prove 
                        her point. who knows? knowing lyn, she might sign up another 
                        amsoil dealer in the process!

                      biggest thing i noticed was the big twin engines run hot," 
                      campbell said. he initially ran harley syn3 in the crankcase, 
                      redline heavy shock in his transmission and redline 75w-140 
                      in his primary. "wee, the redline didn't work any better

                      running at least 30 degrees cooler, my transmission shifts

amsoil motorcycle oil drops 
                      engine temp for harley v-rod
bon hills, tampa 
                      bay, florida, is completely satisfied with amsoil products. 
                      "without a doubt, you have the greatest lubricants 
                      going," said hills.
the 64-year-old 
                      has been riding motorcycles since he was a youngster on 
                      the family farm. hills uses amsoil 20w-50 synthetic motorcycle 
                      oil in his 2003 harley-davidson v-rod engine and transmission.
"i had an 
                      immediate nine degree drop in engine temperature at running 
                      temperature. absolutely no valve chatter at any rpm, clutch 
                      reaction smoothed out considerably and the engine idle is 
                      now much less 'bumpy,'" said hills.
hills also uses 
                      amsoil motorcycle oil filters and many other amsoil products 
                      in his personal vehicles and his boat.

dear amsoil,
i wanted to let you know how 
                      happy i am with your amsoil 
                      20w-50 synthetic motorcycle oil. i own a 2006 harley-davidson 
                      sportster with 5,000 miles on it. since the bike was new 
                      i've only used harley-davidson oil in the engine and sportster 
                      gear lube in the transmission and primary chaincase.
after reading your "study 
                      of motorcycle oils" i decided to switch 
                      to amsoil. that was the best thing i've ever done for my 
                      harley-davidson.
from day one i have had problems 
                      down-shifting, especially when the bike was cold. it would 
                      hang up between gears and i couldn't get it free before 
                      the light at the signal turned green. very dangerous.
harley-davidson told me it 
                      was not broken in yet and to stop "granny shifting."
after 5,000 miles it was still 
                      doing it. now, after i started using amsoil in my engine 
                      and transmission, the problem has ceased completely from 
                      the minute i put it in. no matter how easy i down-shift 
                      i can't make it hang up between gears.
thank you so much for your 
                      incredible oil. i'll never use any other brand again.

                      motorcycle safety chief instructor michael r. douglas, of 
                      anaheim ca, wrote, "i currently own a 1989 honda gl1500 
                      gold wing motorcycle. my gold wing has 267,025 miles on 
                      it. for the past 191,000 miles i have been using amsoil 
                      synthetic 10w-40 motor oil. i have been changing the oil 
                      and filter at intervals of approximately 10,000 miles."
"recently, 
                      i decided to pull the motorcycle apart and have it painted 
                      and chromed. after pulling the valve covers off, i was extremely 
                      surprised to see how clean the valve train was. the green 
                      paint sprayed on by honda over 10 years ago is still visible. 
                      in the rear of the engine by the clutch, is a small piece 
                      of plastic 90-degree tube, which allows oil to return to 
                      the front half of the engine. with this many miles, this 
                      tube is usually either partially or completely plugged with 
                      clutch debris and other deposits. if this happens, the front 
                      end is starved for oil. the tube in my engine was spotless!"
"i also 
                      use amsoil synthetic gear lube in the final drive assembly. 
                      keep up the great work! outstanding products!"



gold wing owner enjoys increased 
                      mpg
ralph sites, 
                      a police officer in rutsburg, virginia, said he put amsoil 
                      10w-40 synthetic motorcycle oil in his 2002 gl 1800 honda 
                      gold wing when it had 4,550 miles on the engine.
"i 
                      had been getting 30 miles per gallon," sites said. 
                      "i was supposed to be getting 40 to 45 miles per gallon."
his first oil 
                      change to amsoil improved his gas mileage to 38 miles to 
                      the gallon, he said. at 6,500 miles on the engine, he was 
                      getting 40 miles per gallon. he replaced the final drive 
                      oil with amsoil 75w-90 synthetic gear lube.
"i switched 
                      to amsoil for the long-term gain. the improved gas mileage 
                      was just a bonus. amsoil is cheaper than honda's synthetic 
                      and i don't have to change it as often. it's a win-win situation."
he bought the 
                      bike new in january 2002, and after putting 12,000 miles 
                      on it he estimated he'd saved more than $100 in a matter 
                      of a few months because of the increased mileage he got 
                      after switching to amsoil.



amsoil motorcycle oil makes 
                      honda goldwing purr
ken burkhalter 
                      trusts the quality and performance of amsoil motor oils, 
                      lubes and filters, but he has been newly impressed with 
                      amsoil products in his 1999 honda goldwing gl1500se. he 
                      purchased it with 15,000 miles on the engine. he put 5,000 
                      miles on the oil and fluids installed by the dealer he bought 
                      the bike from and then installed amsoil 
                      10w-40 synthetic motorcycle oil. "upon riding the 
                      bike after the change i was blown away," burkhalter 
                      said. "words alone cannot describe the remarkable performance 
                      change."
he reports the 
                      engine starts easier and quieter and idles significantly 
                      faster.
"i'll have 
                      to adjust the idle speed back down," he said. "it 
                      runs like everything is made from silk. the engine is so 
                      quiet you can barely hear it at 70 mph, and the smooth sound 
                      it makes is so stunning, i have been driving with my radio 
                      off just to enjoy the engine purr."
besides the purring 
                      of the engine, burkhalter experienced an immediate improvement 
                      in shifting ease on the goldwing. "i thought it might 
                      be my over-fertile imagination, but looking at the shop 
                      manual closer i find that the transmission runs in the engine 
                      oil (not seperate) so the extreme smoothness. ease of shifting 
                      and lack of gear gnashing can only be attributable to the 
                      use of the amsoil 
                      motorcycle oil. (read

amsoil keeps honda cr85 on 
                      the track
motocross racer 
                      chris price of yadkinville, north carolina, competes on 
                      a 2005 honda cr85 at a couple of local tracks. one day at 
                      the track. mike price (chris's dad) installed a new clutch 
                      on his bike before racing began.
"i forgot 
                      to check the clutch for play because the plates will swell 
                      when they are new," said mike. he said he could hear 
                      the engine screaming as soon as the 11-year-old racer left 
                      the gates. the motor nearly quit altogether and price fell 
                      to last place, but he didn't stop riding.
"i finished 
                      the whole seven laps and took second place, the clutches 
                      held together but were slipping the whole time" said 
                      price.
after getting 
                      the bike back to the trailer the prices changed the oil 
                      and checked the clutches.
"everything 
                      looked great. my dad said if it wasn't for amsoil 10w-40 
                      motorcycle oil in the transmission, the clutches would have 
                      burned out after two laps," said price.
price uses amsoil 
                      dominator in the engine and an amsoil power sports air filter 
                      along with the amsoil motorcycle oil in the transmission.
"the oil 
                      never broke down in the severe heat that built up in the 
                      clutches, and amsoil dominator is the best that has ever 
                      been made," said mike "customer for life."



hayes diesel powered motorcycles

                      available motorcycles, tentatively scheduled for release 
                      by early 2008. the company is so impressed with amsoil that 
                      these motorcycles will come factory-filled with amsoil synthetic 
                      lubricants. this quote from hdt's website sums up their 
                      experience with amsoil: "with over a year of testing, 
                      we have found that amsoil products continually outperform 
                      all other lubricants. amsoil provides improved performance, 
                      increased fuel economy, lower oil consumption and significantly 
                      reduced engine wear in all operating conditions." (read

why amsoil?
a commitment 
                      to excellence
as a jet fighter squadron commander lieutenant 
                      colonel albert j. amatuzio had ample opportunity to witness 
                      synthetic lubricants in action. these oils are used exclusively 
                      in jet engines because of three extraordinary performance 
                      characteristics: an ability to reduce friction and wear 
                      on engine components, an ability to function dependably 
                      at severe temperature extremes and an ability to withstand 
                      rigorous and lengthy engine operation without chemical breakdown.
recognizing that 
                    these same benefits would prove invaluable in combustion engines, 
                    amatuzio began conducting serious research in 1963. by 1966 
                    he had formulated a synthetic motor oil and put it to use 
                    in vehicles in northern minnesota. throughout the late '60s 
                    amatuzio continued his research and development and sold commercially 
                    available synthetic oils under a variety of names. in 1970 
                    he incorporated his own name into a commercially sold product 
                    called ammoil. in 1971 this product name was changed to amzoil 
                    and it continued to be sold commercially. the true milestone 
                    came in 1972 when amzoil became the first synthetic motor 
                    oil in the world to meet american petroleum institute criteria. 
                    the new lubricant performed like no other before it. when 
                    the first can appeared on the market in 1972, it signaled 
                    the birth of an entire industry. amsoil synthetic lubricants 
                    have expanded the boundaries of lubrication science and redefined 
                    the performance possibilities of modern machinery and engines.

amsoil fuel efficient transmission 
                      fluid provides high performance protection
amsoil synthetic fuel efficient 
                      automatic transmission fluid (atl) is engineered to exceed 
                      the requirements of gm, ford and toyota where low viscosity 
                      oil is required. the highly specialized properties of this 
                      fuel efficient fluid provide outstanding performance without 
                      compromising protection, even in severe operating conditions.
most drivers are unaware that 
                      transmissions commonly operate under severe service and 
                      require shorter fluid drain intervals. amsoil synthetic 
                      fuel efficient atf is a long life fluid capable of extended 
                      service intervals. it provides an extra margin of protection, 
                      especially when fluid change intervals are missed or during 
                      heavy use; even during abuse. drivers can count on amsoil 
                      synthetic fuel efficient atf to provide protection beyond 
                      conventional fluids. (read

short supplies 
                    and ever-increasing demand have pushed crude oil barrel proces 
                    to record highs over the summer, and motorists have been directly 
                    affected. gasoline is one of the primary products produced 
                    from crude oil, and pump prices are directly affected by the 
                    prices refiners pay for crude oil. in fact, the average price 
                    per gallon of gasoline reached levels over 50 cents higher 
                    than last summer, causing motorists to alter their driving 
                    habits and look for every and any way to get the most for 
                    their fuel dollar.
according to the 
                    u.s.energy information administration (eia). the price of 
                    crude oil represented an average of 42.6 percent of retail 
                    gasoline prices between 2000 and 2003, with refinery processing 
                    cost, marketing and distribution costs and gasoline station 
                    costs and taxes comprising the balance. it is the volatile 
                    of crude oil prices that is most responsible for fluctuating 
                    gasoline prices. amsoil 
                    synthetic motor oils have been shown to yield significant 
                    increases in fuel economy over conventional motor oils. petroleum 
                    based lubricants are composed of irregular molecules of various 
                    sizes that create excess friction, in addition to the friction 
                    generated by moving parts. the vehicle's engine must burn 
                    extra fuel to overcome this friction, decreasing fuel economy. 
                    amsoil synthetic lubricants, on the other hand, contain only 
                    smooth, uniform molecules that effectively reduce friction 
                    and improve fuel efficiency.
conventional lubricants 
                    are also very suseptible to volatility. when the oil's lighter 
                    molecules volatize during hot operating conditions, viscosity 
                    increases and the oil becomes more difficult to pump, consuming 
                    more energy and reducing fuel economy. because amsoil synthetic 
                    lubricants contain uniformly sized molecules, they resist 
                    volatization, maintain their viscosity and allow more fuel 
                    to be used for vehicle propulsion, improvong fuel economy.
the use of amsoil 
                    synthetic motor oils, gear lubes and drivetrain fluids 
                    can have a profound impact on fuel economy. industry tests 
                    demonstrate that an average passenger car can conservatively 
                    decrease its fuel consumption by two to five percent by switching 
                    to synthetic lubricants, while independent testing shows that 
                    trucks can decrease fuel consumption by 8.2 percent. many 
                    amsoil customers report even larger gains in fuel economy.
according to the 
                    u.s. federal highway administration, total u.s. fuel consumption 
                    was 162.3 billion gallons in the year 2000. consider the savings 
                    if every american vehicle converted to amsoil synthetic lubricants 
                    and gained a five percent increase in fuel economy. it would 
                    equate to a savings of 8.115 billion gallons of fuel each 
                    year, at a pice savings of $24.35 billion (at $2 a gallon).
according to the 
                    u.s. department of transportation, the average passenger vehicle 
                    burned 587 gallons of gasoline in 2002. at a price of $3 a 
                    gallon, the average vehicle owner spends $1,761 on gaoline 
                    each year. with a five precent fuel economy improvement afforded 
                    with amsoil synthetic lubricants, the motorist saves $88.05 
                    a year in fuel expenses. that's enough to cover the price 
                    of a year's supply of amsoil synthetic motor oil and ea oil 
                    filters, with money left over.
in addition to 
                    fuel savings, amsoil synthetic lubricants also allow motorists 
                    to reduce oil usage through extended drain intervals, while 
                    significantly reducing friction and wear, improving engine 
                    performance and extending equipment life.

 

is your synthetic motor oil 
                    really synthetic? 
recently, 
                    castrol and mobil brought the debate over what is "synthetic" 
                    into view, as mobil challenged castrol's replacement of polyalphaolephins 
                    (paos) with hydroisomerized waxes (hydrocracked petroleum 
                    basestocks) in their synthetic formulations. exactly one year 
                    after the national advertising division of the council of 
                    better business bureaus' ruling upholding castrol's position 
                    that wax isomerates could be called synthetic, petro-canada 
                    (a large provider of basestocks to oil marketers) advertised 
                    it would be referring to its very high viscosity index (vhvi) 
                    basestocks as a synthetic in the north american market. these 
                    products fall into the same api group (group iii) as wax isomerates, 
                    but could vary significantly in quality from wax isomerates. 
                    this market roar by petro-canada has carried a quiet undertone 
                    of moves from pao to vhvi technology by several engine oil 
                    marketers. (read

the myth of the 3,000 mile oil 
                    change interval 
amsoil represented 
                    the lone voice for extended drain intervals in america for 
                    over 30 years, recommending 25,000-mile/one-year drain intervals. 
                    while extended oil drain intervals have been common in europe 
                    for years, other american motor oil companies have mostly 
                    avoided recommending them, preferring instead to stick with 
                    3,000-mile recommended intervals despite the contrasting recommendations 
                    of vehicle manufacturers and european motor oil companies.
in fact, marc graham, 
                    president of pennzoil-quaker state-owned jiffy lube international, 
                    was quoted in a 2001 lubricants world interview as 
                    saying, "at [pennzoil-quaker state] we use a number internally 
                    that if we [shorten the drain interval] by 100 miles [for 
                    each car serviced], it would mean an additional $20 million 
                    in revenue for the company." he also explained that "if 
                    we could move our customers to get one more oil change per 
                    year, it's worth $294 million for the oil change alone and 
                    $441 million in revenue, when you include the ancillary products 
                    and services customers typically buy along with the oil change."
today, with vehicle 
                    manufacturers recommending longer and longer drain intervals 
                    and the increasing use of oil monitoring systems, the practice 
                    of extending drain intervals has become more mainstream and 
                    forced more motor oil companies to take notice.

                    system equipped with be-110 by-pass filtration elements.
the test vehicle 
                    was a 1995 freightliner fld-120 powered by a detroit 60 series 
                    diesel engine and utilized mainly in long-haul transports. 
                    the testing covered a two-year period and the vehicle accumulated 
                    212,326 total miles.
 the goals for 
                    this demonstration included showing that the use of amsoil 
                    series 3000 5w-30 heavy duty diesel oil, in conjunction with 
                    the amsoil dual-gard filtration setup and sdf oil filters, 
                    would result in improved efficiency, reduced operating costs

diesel oils evolve with diesel 
                    engine designs
the latest round 
                    of emission standards went into effect in 2007, requiring 
                    even more stringent nox and particulate emissions reductions. 
                    while low levels of egr technology (10-15 percent) were successfully 
                    applied in diesel engines to meet 2002 nox emissions standards, 
                    most manufacturers incorporated increased egr rates of 25-35 
                    percent in order to meet 2007 standards. increased egr rates 
                    mean 2007 and newer diesel engines run hotter than their predecessors, 
                    requiring diesel oils meeting the latest api cj-4 specification 
                    to be formulated with improved oxidation resistance properties 
                    to prevent thermal runaway and maintain engine protection.
decreasing the 
                    level of sulfur in diesel fuel has been determined to be the 
                    most cost effective way to decrease particulate emissions. 
                    the introduction of ultra low sulfur diesel (ulsd) fuel in 
                    june 2006 dropped diesel sulfur levels from 500 ppm to 15 
                    ppm in order to meet 2007 particulate limits, provide compatibility 
                    with nox after treatment systems and enable high egr rates.
in addition, in 
                    order to further reduce particulate emissions, diesel particulate 
                    filters (dpf's) were incorporated into all 2007 and newer 
                    american diesel engines, and cj-4 diesel oils are faced with 
                    the challenge of balancing engine protection with dpf life. 
                    increased egr. although effectively decreasing nox emissions, 
                    results in less efficient combustion and increased levels 
                    of soot, and some of it finds its way into the engine oil.

superior filtration plays important 
                    role in engine protection
a great deal of 
                    emphasis is placed on the importance of using the most advanced 
                    high-quality lubricants, but superior filtration is often 
                    taken for granted. the general attitude displayed by many 
                    consumers is to use whatever is cheapest, even when they've 
                    invested is superior lubrication. while amsoil synthetic motor 
                    oils provide unbeatable protection, performance and economy, 
                    they require the assistance of filtration. without filtration, 
                    by-products from the combustion process and abrasive materials 
                    ingested from the air will ultimately destroy an engine. (read

amsoil synthetic gear lube outperforms

high 
                    quality gear oils must lubricate, cool and protect geared 
                    systems. they must also carry damaging wear debris away from 
                    contact zones and muffle the sound of gear operation. commonly 
                    used in differential gears and standard transmission applications 
                    in commercial and passenger vehicles, as well as a variety 
                    of industrial machinery, gear oils must offer extreme temperature 
                    and pressure protection in order to prevent wear, pitting, 
                    spalling, scoring, scuffing and other types of damage that 
                    result in equipment failure and downtime. protection against 
                    oxidation, thermal degradation, rust, copper corrosion and 
                    foaming is also important.

                    and valvoline 75w-90 gear lube to an independent laboratory 
                    for quality comparison tests. the gear lubes were tested according 
                    to astm testing procedures in several critical performance 
                    areas, including oxidation resistance, viscosity retention 
                    and cold temperature fluidity. oxidation resistance was measured 
                    using the l-60-1 thermal oxidation stability test, viscosity 
                    retention was measured using the krl shear stability test 
                    and cold temperature fluidity was measured using the brookfield 
                    viscosity test. additional load carrying, wear, extreme pressure 
                    and scoring protection tests were performed exclusively on 
                    amsoil 
                    75w-90 synthetic gear lube using the l-37 high torque 
                    axle test and the l-42 high speed axle test. (read

why motor oil deteriorates
it is common knowledge 
                    that, at some point, engine oil must be changed. it's something 
                    that is preached relentlessly to vehicle owners by vehicle 
                    manufacturers, quick lubes and oil companies. but consumers 
                    are widely unaware of what exactly makes oil changes necessary.
many factors contribute 
                    to a motor oil's demise, but it is essentially the accumulation 
                    of contaminants in the oil and chemical changes in the oil 
                    itself that make a motor unfit for further service. with time, 
                    it is inevitable that the oil will be contaminated by dirt 
                    or sludge, or succumb to the extreme pressures or temperatures 
                    found inside an engine. amsoil motor oils are formulated with 
                    the industry's most advanced synthetic base stocks and additive 
                    packages to combat the forces that deteriorate conventional 
                    oils. (read

what is the noack volatility 
                    test?
volatization is a term used to describe 
                    what happens to a fluid as it is heated to the point it begins 
                    to "boil off." upon reaching a certain temperature, 
                    oil will begin to lose some of its lighter weight molecules 
                    as they "boil off" and leave heavier weight molecules 
                    behind. not only does this cause higher oil consumption, this 
                    process can also cause increased viscosity making the oil 
                    more difficult to circulate through the lubrication system.
