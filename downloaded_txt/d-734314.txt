****


ten years have come, and gone. two wars still rage on. the coward bastard now sleeps with the fishes, but still there are many more with evil wishes. ten years have passed yet we still cry, for those who had no reason to die. maybe it's good to feel that void in our soul, constant vigilance helps fill that hole. look guys, i aint no poet. so basically what i'm trying to say is that after ten years, i still can't find closure. my heart is still filled with vengeance. our whole world has changed, and i dont believe things will ever be the way thay were prior to that tragic day. god bless our people in the armed forces, keep them sharp, and keep them safe. maybe i'll find closure when the job is done, and all our troops are home.until next time, stay happy, stay healthy, and stay safe.dirty vic................../////////////////////////////
