cottar’s safaris





cottar’s safaris is a portfolio of two transformative properties in the maasai mara area in kenya, that work with the local community to unite wildlife conservation and sustainable luxury travel. we are a 5th generation family-run safari company that has been operating safaris in africa for more than 100 years. our 1920s camp and private bush villa are located in the private olderkesi conservancy which borders the maasai mara national reserve.
our motivation goes far deeper than simply providing a place to stay. as a fellow member of the long run, we operate under the guidelines of the long run’s 4cs: conservation, community, culture and commerce and are one of less than a dozen global ecosphere retreats in the world. each guest’s visit contributes directly to the sustainability of our conservation and social development efforts. these include the restoration of the natural environment to a pristine condition, re-establishment and protection of biological diversity, anti-poaching, on-site research and rehabilitation projects, the provision of healthcare services and a local preschool.
situated in the untouched exclusive olderkesi conservancy bordering the maasai mara, serengeti and loliondo reserves; the area guarantees privacy and an abundance of wildlife. our 1920s camp provides the romance of safari under eleven cream canvas tents, spacious and luxuriously furnished in the style of the bygone era of the twenties. our private bush villa boasts 5 en-suite bedrooms, amazing views over the masai mara, a 25m private pool, a private chef and guides. both properties extend an era of luxury and quality, as we return to the original spirit and essence of “safari”, reminiscent of a golden era; an era of romance, professional guiding, adventure and elegance. our low-impact, high-value approach to sustainable ecotourism helps fund the vital work that is conserving land for biodiversity.












cottar’s 1920s camp
vintage luxury at its best, the award-winning cottar’s 1920s safari camp has its own 7608-acre private conservancy and is situated one kilometre from the famous ‘seventh’ natural wonder of the world, the maasai mara in kenya and the tanzania serengeti game reserve.  







cottar’s bush villa
elegant and unforgettable, the only real luxury private villa in the maasai mara, kenya. cottar’s bush villa recently won the world travel award for africa’s leading luxury private villa 2016 and is global eco-sphere retreat accredited.  







cottar’s experiences
the cottar family provide genuinely stunning wildlife and wilderness experiences, engaging in the original spirit and essence of ‘safari’: an abundance of wildlife, a guarantee of privacy, and the highest standards of professional guiding, in a luxurious and authentic safari environment.
