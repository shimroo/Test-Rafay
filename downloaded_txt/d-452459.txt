project prepare llc - supportive healthcare simulation
gynecological and urogenital teaching associates






working since 1970 to build medical students' competence, confidence, and compassion project prepare llc trains medical students and practicing physicians to provide outstanding patient care in reproductive and sexual health. we believe all people should receive gentle, non-judgmental, and supportive medical care. we also believe providers and students benefit tremendously from hands-on simulation - particularly in small group or one-on-one settings.our gynecological and urogenital teaching associates provide comprehensive instruction on the technical and psychosocial elements of performing reproductive and sexual health exams. we then assume the role of patient, offering learners the unique opportunity to practice physical exam technique on our bodies while receiving individualized, real-time feedback. ensuring that each exam is comfortable and thorough, and that each learner exits our training with less self-reported anxiety, is our bifold mission.project prepare additionally offers live and virtual workshops on sexual history interviewing, preparing learners to address patient concerns in the areas of family planning, sexually transmitted infections (stis), and sexual function and well-being. we simulate clinical encounters and maintain a library of cases that range in objective from successful rapport-building to diagnosing life-threatening conditions. our cases and curriculum have been honed, with the input of stanford md and ucsf md faculty, over the course of five decades. we bring unequivocal professionalism to every encounter and can customize our trainings to support your institution's goals. furthermore, we pride ourselves in representing a diverse range of patient identities and body types.contact us via the form below to enquire whether our services are right for you. headquartered in california's san francisco bay area, we travel nation-wide.
