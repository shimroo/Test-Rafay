awakeneers: the album




      a nomadic tribe of multi-instrumentalist songwriters (most of whom are siblings) the awakeneers offer a genre-bending blend of acoustic positivity that orbits elliptically around the idea of folk music.

segueing from a celtic fiddle-ballad to a piano-pop guide to mindfulness, or a meditative love song to mother earth, the music centres around honest vocals with rich harmonies and diverse acoustic instrumentation.

awakeneers’ music shines a light on life's big questions, celebrating the goodness of humanity and the miracle of life on earth.
