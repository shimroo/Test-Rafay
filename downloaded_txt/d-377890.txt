            "searching for a wooden screen door, we weren't 
            sorry we finally chose tiny touchstone woodworks in ravenna, ohio. 
            owner tina walters' handcrafted... mahogany doors are as well 
            made as the victorian homes for which they're created."

handcrafted mahogany screen and storm doors











whether you're doing old house restoration, new construction or a 
            home improvement project, a handcrafted mahogany screen-storm door from 
            touchstone woodworks will 
            dramatically enhance the appearance of your home, adding a touch of 
            warmth, elegance and individuality to the focal point of your home 
            for many years to come. 
            our elegant collection of 71 
            screen door styles includes 
            victorian 
            & country styles with old-fashioned fretwork or "gingerbread" 
            corner brackets, perfect for grand old victorian homes or country style 
            homes.

our designs also include 
            classic traditional 
            styles which 
            complement  colonial georgian, cape cod and more. our
            arts & crafts 
            styles complement craftsman, prairie, tudor, bungalows. and other 
            architectural styles based on the classical tradition.
we are a very small woodworking shop near ravenna, ohio, and our 
            custom made solid wood screen doors display the fine craftsmanship 
            and attention to detail that are absent in a factory-produced door.  
            weve also made it our business to offer the finest quality 
            screen door hardware and porch parts 
            including turned porch posts and balusters, decorative flat sawn 
            balusters, porch railings and brackets.
we think you will find our website and catalog an informative and 
            valuable source of information on what 
            makes a wood screen door last and all the things you should 
            consider when selecting one.
