pedfast™ has a better alternative to k9-ped
 






                                k9-ped is no longer available
                            











k9-ped was offered by another company for sale until 2013.  then the company went out of business.  pedfast technologies™ has excellent pedigree software products that exceed k-ped's capabilities and ease of use.please consider switching from k9-ped to our superior full-kennel management product, the breeder's standard®. we also offer a pedigrees-only program, iped™, which is also an outstanding and powerful program.pedfast technologies™ has a program that will convert the dog information in k9-ped into a format compatible with the breeder's standard® and or iped™, and will perform this conversion, normally a $40 support charge, for free when you purchase either program.for further information, feel free to call us at 1-800-746-9364 or 1-815-806-2130 and press 1.thanks,pedfast technologies (formerly man's best friend software®)
