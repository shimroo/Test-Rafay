welcome to the at-sea processors association











 

the at-sea processors association (apa) is a trade association representing five member companies that own and operate 15 u.s.-flag catcher/processor vessels that participate principally in the alaska pollock fishery and west coast pacific whiting fishery. by weight, these abundant, well managed groundfish fisheries account for more than one-third of all fish harvested in the u.s. each year. fishery managers and scientists employ a precautionary approach to management to ensure healthy fish stocks for years to come.
