tara klena barthel, jd mba, is a christian adr specialist and attorney, college instructor, author, speaker, trauma survivor, and grateful wife and mother who encourages redemption in all areas of life.
my lil’ ol’ website can be accessed here, but many elements are quite out of step with my current season of life, so i asked my husband to make this landing page to let you know a quick summary of what i am up to these days. i hope to revise my site soon, but in the meantime, i am doing most of my public writing at @tarabarthel.
blessings and joy—
