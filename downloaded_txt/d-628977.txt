meth dealers targeting kids with new drugs





meth dealers really don't care if they kill your kids - even your elementary school kids - because it's all a soulless search for money for them.  just how horrifying these meth dealers are is evidenced by two new drugs, cheese and strawberry quick.strawberry quick looks like strawberry pop rocks (the candy that sizzles and 'pops' in your mouth). it also smells like strawberry and it is being handed out to kids in school yards. but it's a mixture of meth and kool aid, according to fox news.kids are ingesting this concoction thinking that it is candy and many of them end up being rushed off to the hospital in dire condition.  and all of them get a taste of drugs at an early age, which just shouldn't happen.it also comes in chocolate, peanut butter, cola, cherry, grape and orange.cheese, if anything, is even worse, according to fox, which says:something called “cheese” is killing kids. in august of 2005, no one had even heard of it — so much so, that when a school district police officer first saw a bag of this drug, he thought it was fake. now officials realize cheese is all too real; at least 21 kids have died from overdosing on it.cheese is a combination of black tar heroin and crushed up tylenol pm tablets and hits of it sell for a buck or two. like any type of heroin, cheese is highly addictive and deadly. if that’s not enough to scare you, there’s this: drug pushers cooked it up special for kids.“traditionally heroin is going to be an adult user drug,” says dallas independent school district officer jeremy liebbe. “black tar heroin is cooked on a spoon, mixed with liquid and injected. meaning needles. not many kids are wild about needles, so if you want to market heroin to kids you've got to come up with an alternative to it.”i know you probably never thought you'd have to warn your elementary school kids about drugs, but those days are over.  let them see these pictures, and tell them what these incredibly bad people are trying to do to them.  tell them that if they see these drugs in their schools to immediately tell their friends they're dangerous, and run tell a teacher!

strong energy drinks claim a fatality





almost every day, people come to my blog to read an old post on red line, which i posted after a friend got very sick after drinking the very strong chemical stew posing as an "energy drink."many visitors leave comments claiming that the drink poses no danger at all.  perhaps they should consider this news story, which was left in a comment posted on my earlier red line post:wellington teen dies after consuming alcohol, energy drinksby leon fooksman, luis f. perez and lia lehrersouth florida sun-sentinel8:44 am edt, may 21, 2008a 16-year-old wellington student died over the weekend after attending a party where alcohol was consumed, palm beach county sheriff's investigators said.paramedics who tried to resuscitate ashley ramnauth on sunday found alcohol in her system, sheriff's spokeswoman teri barbera said.ramnauth was a lake worth high school honor roll student and the daughter of hollywood police officer hansman ramnauth.she "apparently made a bad decision to consume energy drinks and alcohol in combination," according to a statement from her family released tuesday through the palm beach county school district. she "did not have a lot of experience with alcohol and did not have a known problem with alcohol," the family added...in march, paramedics took four weston schoolboys to a hospital after they became ill from drinking an "energy-boosting" liquid not meant for children, authorities said. the boys were sweating and suffering from increased heart rates and lightheadedness. they drank redline, a combination fat-burning and energy enhancement drink marketed as a "freaky scientific" breakthrough on the web site of the company that makes it.there's a news clip about ashley's death with the news article; it's worth watching.i'll conclude with how i concluded my earlier post:there's something definitely wrong here. [red line manufacturer] vpx is not taking responsibility for its product and is getting away with it. seven-11 is not taking responsibility for the products it sells and is also getting away with it.please pass this along with a warning. energy drink drinkers, think about going back to good old coffee or black tea and stay away from this junk.

here's a show you won't want to miss!





be sure to tune in this friday to e! television, for the show ths investigates:  prom nightmares and airs at 8 eastern/7 central (check your local listings).the 90-minute show offers a warning to parents and prom-going kids about what has happened to other kids who made bad decisions on prom night.  it will include a segment on cathy isford, a girl who died after taking ecstasy at her prom.i included a segment on cathy, told by her mom, dad and sister on my voice of the victim films.  it is such a touching and sad story!  the tribute her father paul gives to her is one of the most moving things i've ever seen or heard.the ths crew used our office to shoot the interviews with the isford family and me and we're told that voice of the victims will get on-screen titles -- and that several million people are likely to watch the show.  since my mission is to get the films into the hands of people who need them, this could be a great moment for voice of the victims.if you're curious, or if you or your kids or your grandkids are at or approaching prom age, this could be a good thing to watch. and by the way, if you're curious or if you, your kids, etc., are prom age, you should consider getting a copy of the films yourself.catch a preview of prom nightmares here.  the clip doesn't include anything on cathy, but gives you a pretty good idea of what the story line is:  the risks kids put themselves in because of bad choices they make -- and a lot of bad choices are made around prom and graduation.

trying to save angels





no matter how many stories i hear about how drug tragedies tear families apart, i get torn up, as i did with this story out of pennsylvania:tom hamilton has lots of photographs and memories. his oldest daughter, melissa, had an infectious smile and was a cheerleader for central dauphin and the big 33. his oldest son, phillip, was the funny one who kept an eye on younger sister nina."phillip was always very fun and caring and always protective," nina said. "i always felt safe. he'd never let anything happen to me."but phillip wasn't so protective of himself. in 2004, while partying with friends, phillip overdosed on xanax and heroin. he was 25.less than 2 years later, melissa suffered the same fate at 28."she said i need this to wake up in the morning - to get through my day," nina said. "she needed it and that's what heroin does to you."tom hamilton has responded to this tragedy in a way i understand, even though, thank god, i haven't had to live through a tragedy like his:  he started a drug education group.through his tears and grief, tom started saving angels, a non-profit dedicated to educating kids and parents about the dangers of drugs. "kids gotta understand that they're harming more than themselves," he said. "it involves parents, other friends, involves all their relatives."he is so right!  too many parents just don't understand the dangers drugs pose today, and to protect their kids they have to start by educating themselves.saving angels is a local group with an outreach program to schools and groups around harrisburg pa.  if you're in that area, please contact them.others can find educational resources at the voice of the victims web site, and much, much more on the voice of the victims films.

elation as abducted girl found





i haven't posted previously on sharon matthews, a 9 year old british girl who's been missing for 24 days. well, she's been found!  watch the excitement, not just of her family but of sharon's entire town, on hearing the news:it is impossible to imagine 24 days of waiting in horrified, worry-filled agony for news like this -- but how wonderful that this is the news the matthews family got.it's also encouraging that there is also a suspect in custody -- but once again,  it's impossible to imagine what the matthews family is feeling on learning that he is a member of their extended family.

tussionex warning!





washington has noted the dangerous results of using the prescription cough medicine tussionex as a drug and issued a warning:washington (reuters) - u.s. health officials issued an alert on tuesday about reports of life-threatening side effects and deaths among patients, including children, who took ucb sa's prescription cough medicine tussionex.the reports indicate doctors sometimes are prescribing, and patients sometimes taking, more than the recommended dose of tussionex pennkinetic extended-release suspension, the food and drug administration said.some also are taking the drug more frequently than every 12 hours, the recommended time interval, or giving it to children under age 6, the fda said. tussionex is not approved for children younger than 6.here's what the rx list has to say about tussionex.  it's technical, so i'll leave all the links in -- and i've highlighted the frightening stuff you should pay attention to!serious overdosage with hydrocodone [tussionex] is characterized by respiratory depression    (a decrease in respiratory rate and/or tidal volume, cheyne-stokes respiration,    cyanosis), extreme somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle    flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, and sometimes bradycardia and hypotension.    although miosis is characteristic of narcotic overdose, mydriasis may occur    in terminal narcosis or severe hypoxia. in severe overdosage apnea [stopped or decreased breathing], circulatory    collapse, cardiac arrest and death may occur. be careful with this and all prescription drugs!

annette's story





it's been four and a half years since annette orango was drugged with ghb and raped.  annette was crushed by the crime against her and has worked valiantly to build up her strength and self-esteem.virtually ever since that day, she's battling the vancouver police for justice and the canadian health care system to receive treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd), which she explains as:vomiting,  hypervigilance, fear, anxiety, anger, rage, hatred, panic attacks, depression including suicidal thoughts, headaches, hyper acute senses(wear sunglasses often, easily startled by noises or unexpected touching), no sex, no physical contact, avoid men, can not have my back exposed, must sleep either on couch or a bed with one side against a wall, looking over shoulder dozens of times daily, can not carry items in both hands, can not wear high heeled footwear, have to see the door in public places, have to sit in booth or high back chair or against a wall, avoid many public places including movie theatres, concerts, drinking establishments, have to sit on side bench seats or very back of public transit, avoid going anywhere after dark, avoid drinking beverages in public places, achy bones, excessive tiredness, short term memory loss, emotional swings, triggers(black men, new westminster,alcohol, degrading and disrespectful comments regarding women, violence) flashbacks, dissociation, isolation, difficulty trusting, difficulty reading, difficulty focusing and concentrating, diminished interest in everyday activities, avoid going most places alone, loss of sense of order or fairness in the world, difficulty sleeping, compromised immune system, avoid people, increased need to control, always armed, over protective, agoraphobia, obsessive compulsive disorder.there are more. some of these i have overcome,but i still experience many.all this because one man decided it would be a good idea to drug annette's drink with ghb and rape her.  after corresponding with annette for some time, she has just sent me tons of information and documentation on her case.i wish i had known annette before this happened to her, because i can tell from our emails she was a lovely person.  you can see from these excerpts from her lengthy document , canadian corruption, which details the case and the pain it's caused her, it is hard for annette to be that lovely person today.  she is angry, hurt and struggling.here are some excerpts from canadian corruption:  my name is annette orango. on april 29, 2003 my life changed forever and no one could prepare me for the nightmare i was about to endure. i am canadian and as a canadian i am going to exercise my right to freedom of speech. i will prove to you the canadian government is corrupt by supplying government documentation and i will warn you some of this information is graphic and disturbing. this includes medical records, information from the police file and much more.what you will read on this website is based on my feelings, my thoughts, my beliefs, my experiences, my wants, and my opinion. i am entitled to these and no one can take these away from me. i am born and raised canadian and my human rights have been violated so many times i've lost count. i might possibly be the most pissed off woman in this country and there are many responsible for my pain and trauma. i am filled with anger, hatred and rage and unfortunately that hasn't gotten better with time. and if you think it's acceptable for victims to go through this type of turmoil, then so be it. but,try to put yourself in my shoes. try to empathize. and if you're a man, put yourself in my fathers' boots. don't think about this too much. feel it! and this is not a joke and a game, this has been my life since april 29,2003.long story short.april 29,2003 i was drugged and raped.  i am sharing this information with the world because these are extremely heinous crimes that are happening everyday and everywhere. they are unreported because of the nature of the crime which is severe memory loss. it's very difficult to tell someone what happened to you if you don't know. also the drugs leave your system very fast and are rarely detected.rape is the worst trauma a woman can go through. it is the gravest of all violations. drugging a woman's drink magnifies that trauma by a thousand fold. and as soon as you put a date rape drug such as ghb, ketamine, rohypnol, etc. in a woman's drink; you have eliminated all aspects of consent to the act of sex and you are know a rapist. you also do not care whether that woman lives or dies at the moment of ingestion or in her future. these drugs are extremely potent and do kill when they are administered. they affect the heart, the central nervous system, the respiratory system, etc. you could also be a murderer and drugging drinks is very premeditated. there is no doubt in my mind this is what happened to natalie halloway.i have done lots of work on this. date rape drugs are everywhere and i have known for quite some time that bar staff are being paid so men can drug drinks and men are being drugged by other men. why? if a man comes into a drinking establishment with a woman or is trying to pick up a woman that some other guy is interested in, his drink may be drugged to remove him from the scenario.and of course bar staff themselves are drugging women’s' drinks as is the case of 44 year old fernando manuel aves. this bartender at the metrotown station square pub (burnaby, bc) has been charged with 4 counts of sexual assault and 1 count of administration of a noxious substance. and he is still allowed to serve drinks to women while out on bail!! ... he is a serial rapist for christ sakes and the morons responsible for him allowing to serve alcohol deserve a bullet between their eyes. this is where canadians need to get their heads out of their asses. you can hardly protect your drink when bar staff are involved. and the cops need to stop telling women to be cautious, but to tell these scumbags this is not acceptable behavior and you need to control your dicks.i was drugged in a clean, decent pub called the thirsty duck pub in new westminster, bc. i was raped in my home. we were stopped by the police on the way to my home because of the shape i was in. when i woke up i knew something bad had happened. i had a rape kit done and called the police.  i told them what i knew, which wasn't much. and honestly, i thought well if i don't remember what's it going to hurt? which is what these scumbags are counting on. it came back to bite me in the ass as hard as it gets.i was barred from the pub for life for having the police investigate.  then, in december of 2003, i started vomiting chronically.  this continued until the day i moved from my apartment which was june 28,2004. i had numerous tests done and i couldn't work. i was on disability through my workplace, but as promptly cut off from these benefits when they learned i had been drugged and raped.  i was finally diagnosed with ptsd [post traumatic stress disorder] which i get to live with for the rest of my life and have to take medication for on a daily basis. it affects the central nervous system and another severe trauma could put me in a coma, a vegetative state or even kill me.  i applied to the criminal victims' assistance program (cvap)  and have had to deal with these inept morons ever since. this is where the serious corruption starts.the drugging and the rape were committed by a black individual originally from cameroon, africa. his name is ted. he was never charged. since then there have been other crimes committed against me by government officials and other individuals. everything in my life has changed.  ultimately ted is responsible for all of this, and i want him dead for what he has put me through. ...i'm not too sure how many times one woman has to ask for help, but i can only be kicked in the head so many times and thanks to all of these selfish cops and lazy government officials, i am armed 24/7 with knives and firearms. i have done 2 radio interviews, participated in 2 newspaper stories [the province and calgary herald], participated in having the legislature changed regarding drug facilitated rape,have done peer counselling for the few women who actually knew this happened to them and have seen 5 counsellors/phsychologists. people have been extremely condescending of my trauma and pain and i have been blamed time and time again for being a victim; even though everyone knows men think with their dicks.i'm 38 years old and i am a smart woman who has had everything taken away from her. myself and my family are the only ones who have suffered any consequences. i have busted my ass to reclaim my self worth and to make a difference for myself and others. i deserve closure,the truth, accountability, compensation and restitution.i couldn't agree more, but all annette gets are roadblock, and much worse.  it's as if she, not ted, were the criminal.annette has sent me much more information, which i'm still going through.  look for future posts.photo credit:  t. paz

beware of red line energy drink!





i have copied below a post from my husband's blog detailing a frightening incident we had as a result of a family friend drinking a red line energy drink.  this is a very dangerous concoction, so please avoid it and caution your friends and family!a week ago last night, one of my friends drank an energy drink -- red line, manufactured by vpx sports -- and spent the next 24 hours so sick that we were monitoring her carefully in anticipation of having to take her to the emergency room.her symptoms, which came on about two and a half hours after she drank a can of the brew, included chills, sweating, diarrhea and vomiting, vomiting, vomiting with deep, racking convulsions that were quite frightening to watch.  fortunately, they died down and she eventually returned to her normal, healthy self.she is hardly alone in her reaction to this foul concoction.  here's lynn  commenting on healthboard message boards:i dont recommend it to anyone. seriously, i am not a light weight when it comes to things that amp you. but this one, no, no, no! it made me immediately ill, shaky, chest pain beyond belief, i thought i was going to die. (sweating and chills, through [sic] up 3 times).  outrageous, i wonder how they were able to actually sell it to anybody.and, 10.5 hrs later????  still sick and heart pounding out of control.and here's the quick-typing sleepy commenting on the site tell him fred:i have a porblem with redlineenergy drink. i drank the whole can yesterday, after i drank the can about 4 hours later i started getting shakey, then i started to throw up, i couldnt keep food down, rapid heart rate followed, extreme sweating from my body getting overheated, then my left side muscles started to go cold and hurt, i was awake a good part of the night and it was worse than any illegal drug i have ever tried and i’ve been around. do not drink this drink it is bad news and shouldn’t be legaland, if you want some "expert" opinion, here's a review from energy drink reviews:wow, this drink is some serious stuff. i mean about half the bottle is the warning label, and it is serious, this drink is insane. it says that you should not drink it unless you are over 18, which i would say is a good warning. this is the first drink that was to much for me. the bottle says warning potent, but i have had every energy drink i could find without a problem. this redline, made me feel like i was tweaking out hard core, i felt like i was going to have a heart attack. i seriously mean i wasn't enjoying the quick happy buzz that you get from most energy drinks. this was a scary my body is going out of control hot and cold sweats, tweaked out. i had the drink at two in the afternoon and i couldn't sleep until 4 am in the morning.that's from someone who obviously has a lot of experience with these drinks, and considerable resistance to them.my friend did not follow directions, drinking an entire can -- but what's with putting two "doses" in one can?  every other energy drink comes in a one-serving can.and what's in the can? caffeine, green tea, yerba mate, 5-htp (5 hydroxy-1-tryptophan), camp, yohimbe, evodiamine, and vinpocetine. and a few other things.i've thought for some time that it's ironic that people like my friend, who are concerned about their health, eating organic foods and shunning tap water, would ever get close to this stuff.5-htp?  that's an amino acid that's a precursor to the neurotransmitter seratonin.  it's in red line because of its alleged appetite suppressant characteristics but it also seems to definitely affect the brain chemistry involving mood and depression -- perhaps enhancing feelings -- but what is a compound that messes with brain chemistry doing in an over-the-counter drink?plus, it and vinpocetine can both cause intestinal upset and rapid heartbeat.here's some of what wikipedia has to say about camp:role of camp in human carcinoma some research has suggested that a deregulation of camp pathways and an aberrant activation of camp-controlled genes is linked to the growth of some cancers.[1][2][3]  [edit] role of camp in prefrontal cortex disorders recent research may indicate that camp affects the function of higher order thinking in the prefrontal cortex through its regulation of ion channels called hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (hcn). when camp stimulates the hcn, these gates open, rendering the brain cell closed to communication, thus interfering with prefrontal cortex function. this research is of interest to scientists studying the brain, especially the degradation of higher cognitive function in adhd and aging.[4]again, what's a chemical that messes with brain chemistry doing in an over-the-counter energy drink?red line's attorneys appear to be well aware of the risks of this product.  after their intervention, here's the warning label:warning: not for use by individuals under the age of 18 years. do not use if pregnant or nursing. consult a physician or licensed qualified health care professional before using this product if you have, or have a family history of, heart disease, thyroid disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, depression or other psychiatric condition, glaucoma, difficulty in urinating, prostate enlargement, or seizure disorder, or if you are using a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (maoi) or any other dietary supplement, prescription drug, or over-the-counter drug containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine (ingredients found in certain allergy, asthma, cough or cold, and weight control products). do not exceed recommended serving. exceeding recommended serving may cause adverse health effects. discontinue use and call a physician or licensed qualified health care professional immediately if you experience rapid heartbeat, dizziness, severe headache, shortness of breath, or other similar symptoms. the consumer assumes total liability if this product is used in a manner inconsistent with label guidelines. do not use for weight reduction. keep out of reach of children.i wrote vpx sports early in the week asking them to explain why they make this product, and why they pack two doses in a can.  they have not responded.i wrote seven-11 stores, which is one of the few retail chains that stocks it, and which sold it to my friend, asking them not to stock the drink any more.  they have not responded.update: vpx called me on 9/18, following up on my email to seven-11, not my email to them.  the man on the phone, while very friendly, defended the drink as appealing to a small market that wanted a substitute for ephedrine, which has been pulled from the market.  his reason for calling was because he was required to under fda regulations, and spend nearly the entire time asking me questions so he could fill out his questionnaire.  he did tell me that to his knowledge, no one has died from the drink.in all the research i've done on this product, including a nexis media search, i've found no stories by major media outlets on the threat red line presents, although i found one story about a similar drink named spike sent several denver and boulder sent several kids to the hospital.there's something definitely wrong here.  vpx is not taking responsibility for its product and is getting away with it.  seven-11 is not taking responsibility for the products it sells and is also getting away with it.please pass this along to your kids and/or friends with a warning.  energy drink drinkers, think about going back to good old coffee or black tea and stay away from this junk.

hair tests let you test for ghb long after incident





a good friend who wants to help anyone who thinks she may have been the victim of a drug assisted rape asked me to pass along contact information for two labs that can do hair analysis for date rape drugs.victims of drug-assisted rape may not realize that they have been raped until long after other tests for the presence of drugs are no longer reliable.  but with hair testing, as long as  the relevant section of hair has not been cut off, the hair can be tested -- even months  after a sexual assault.the two labs are the carlson company in colorado and tox associates in ohio."without this test, i would never have known that i was  given ghb," she told me.

vancouver police seek help on alleged ghb rapist





a friend of mine forwarded the news article below to me.  i've highlighted two key paragraphs:  the first one says the vancouver police department is seeking help on this case, and the second gives some good advice.vancouver (cbc) - a prominent member of british columbia's ball hockey community has been released on bail after appearing in court thursday, charged with spiking women's drinks and sexual assault.fernando manuel alves of burnaby was arrested on sept. 8 and charged with four counts of sexual assault and one count of administering a noxious substance.the 44-year-old pub owner and vice-president of the western ball hockey association appeared in b.c. provincial court on thursday, where he was released under strict bail conditions ....vancouver police have appealed for more information about alves, who is accused of alleged offences against four women, aged between 20 and 30 years old, in vancouver and the lower mainland.during a news conference on wednesday, const. tim fanning reminded the public to be aware of the risks involved with knowingly going somewhere alone with a new acquaintance."stay with your friends to the end of the night,'' he said. "if you meet somebody that you want to see again, meet them the next day. don't get in the position of going back with them alone, especially when you've been drinking."news of alves's arrest has shocked a former employee at his burnaby pub.scott klassen, who was a doorman at the station square pub until two months ago, described his old boss as "just a regular guy.""every night i worked, he worked," klassen told cbc news. "he never drank on shift. he always seemed to be a clean-cut guy."klassen says alves was very generous with staff."he always took people out to football games, hockey games, concerts, provided a limo - you know, free drinks, free night type thing, as a ... hey, thanks for working here type thing."

please help find madeleine (missing 4 year old)





please look at these pictures of this cute little girl who was taken.please read this message and pass it on!!!!!!!!! as you are aware my niece, madeleine, is still missing and i am asking everyone i know to send this as a chain letter i.e. you send it to everyone you know and ask them to do the same, as the story is only being covered in britain, eire and portugal. we don't believe that she is in portugal anymore and need to get her picture and the story across europe as quickly as possible. suggestions are welcome. phil mccannmccann's family believes a new picture of the missing four-year -old could play a vital role in the search for her. the photo of the youngster shows clearly her distinctive right eye, where the pupil runs into the blue-green iris. the new poster of madeleine it is this distinguishing mar k that will identify madeleine to those on the lookout for her, according to aunt and uncle john and diane mccann. the glasgow couple aim to distribute the appeal poster, which features the crimestoppers telephone number, as far afield as they can. family friend andrew renwick told sky news that support for the search had been "overwhelming" and her family were extremely grateful. her right eye mrs mccann said: "the purpose of the poster is to highlight the distinction in madeleine's eye. "we want to make the most of it, because we know her hair could potentially be cut or dyed." mr mccann added: "the poster was designed by a friend of the family and i've begun emailing it to acquaintances in different parts of the world. "i'm asking people to circulate it the best they can and make it be seen." madeleine's eye holds vital clueif you have any information you should contact your local police, rcmp or crimestoppers without delay.

dxm comment must share!





this comment just came in and it is so good and right on i wanted to post it here, so more people can see it!  thank you, josue  i agree with everything you said!!bethjosue has left a new comment on your post "dxm what are your thoughts?": i took dxm throughout high school, and a few years afterwards. i had uncontrollable muscle spasms during the times i was taking it the most. my chest would lunge forward and my shoulders and neck would twist. it was painful, and embarrassing, and it happened when i wasn’t high at all. i wanted to say, some of you don’t understand what is going on. this drug affects the nervous system and brain. the damage can be permanent, and as we know, can lead to death. some of you say it isn’t a big deal to take it, you just have to take no more than such and such amount, and some of you are bragging about taking 30 or 40 tabs, which has killed people before. people who take dxm, or want to take it, are going to do what their friends are doing, and if they hear that someone tripped balls off of 30 tabs, they will try it too. they don’t know what is “safe”. you are all saying different things. some of you are incredibly heartless too. so many people have died, and all you can do is come on here and brag about how many pills you’ve taken, or how cool your highs have been. i think it is just about as cool as drinking antifreeze. i know what it is like, and i know how much fun it is, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t foolish. i want to just warn you all out there who might be thinking about taking it or are taking it. you can literally make yourself retarded. it damages the brain and nervous system. don’t do it. if you are still thinking about taking it after knowing what it does, then you may as well write your suicide note while your at it. so many people have died. i keep hearing stories from friends. they know someone who has died, or their son, daughter, or grandson or daughter has died, or one of their friends… the stories just don’t stop.i can’t believe they haven’t done more to keep kids safe. so much can be done. i hear they are going to put in another drug that will make a person vomit if they take a certain amount. they need to hurry up and do that before this drug claims more lives.i don’t know if everyone else has noticed, but some of you can’t write or spell, and i’m wondering…seriously… i know most of you are young, but…

oxycontin heart break!!





carol (right photo) is a very special friend who i met while making my film on the dangers of designer drugs. carol’s sister, allison (left photo) had just died from ghb.now her other and only sister still living is addicted to oxy contin!! carol has been beside herself as to how to help her sister! she doesn’t want to lose her, like she lost allison. they can’t afford the high prices of a treatment center.i would love to see this money purdue has to pay in fines, go to help all those addicted to oxy contin get into treatment programs. i heard today on the news, the amount of the fine is only 6 months of profits made on oxy contin. this isn’t really that much!i want to hear from you all about what you think about this.                                                                                        allison dead from ghb note: your comments will be posted immediately. please be respectful!thank you,beth

washington drug letter





washington drug lettermay 14, 2007 mondaypurdue pleads guilty to mislabeling oxycontinsection: vol. 39 no. 20length: 344 wordspurdue pharma and three current and former company executives pleaded guilty to mislabeling oxycontin and will pay more than $634 million in fines, according to a u.s. prosecutor.the agreement closed a four-year investigation by the u.s. attorney's office in the western district of virginia over the company's promotion of the painkiller oxycontin (oxycodone hcl). purdue acknowledged it falsely claimed oxycontin was less addictive, less subject to abuse and less likely to cause withdrawal symptoms than other pain medications, u.s. attorney john brownlee said."the results of [purdue's] misrepresentations and crimes sparked one of our nation's greatest prescription drug failures," brownlee said. between 1996 and 2002, oxycontin caused 146 deaths and contributed to 318, according to a report from the u.s. drug enforcement agency.the company trained sales representatives to tell healthcare providers that it was more difficult to abuse oxycontin, the attorney general's office said. in addition, the company told some physicians that patients would not experience withdrawal symptoms or develop a tolerance to the drug.the fda's office of criminal investigations said the company engaged in "an extensive, long-term conspiracy" to generate higher sales through illegal schemes.purdue ceo michael friedman, general counsel howard udell and former chief medical officer paul goldenheim pleaded guilty to misbranding the drug. friedman will pay $19 million to the virginia attorney general's medicaid fraud control unit, udell will pay $8 million and goldenheim will pay $7.5 million, the attorney general's office said.an independent staff will monitor the company and provide reports to the government on the company's business practices, the office said. purdue noted it has already changed its internal training, compliance and monitoring systems to stop similar events from occurring again.the company and executives filed their guilty pleas in the u.s. district court of the western district of virginia may 10. -- emily ethridgerelease date: may 14, 2007

dxm what are your thoughts?





this post has been getting quite a few comments. i thought i would bring it to the front and let you all continue your thoughts on this one.bethvoice of the victims films.friday, september 29, 2006another triple c dxm deaththis was posted on the dr. phil message board site. it was posted by a woman who would like to get the word out, dxm is dangerous and we need to all warn our kids. please read this and pass it on to others. this is just so sad! the kids really think this is safe! please tell them it isn't. thank you,beth tragedy strikes againi'm writing to share with you a terrible thing that i have experienced last sunday through today and hope that you canspread a message for us. the pain that we, her family and friends are feeling right now is indescribable, and the worst part, so needless. my daughter's friend, whom she to went to school with since kindergarten, died early last sunday morning. she was 16 years old. we have known her family since the girls met at catholic school and kept in touch, saw them at church and school functions, birthday parties, etc. theycarpooled together their freshman year. she was probably the mostpopular girl i have ever met, loved by the girls as well as the boys, a super soccer and la crosse player. she was just beautiful with big blue eyes, long blond hair.last monday, she took 24 'triple c' pills. triple c is plain oldcough, cold, codeine over the counter pills we give our children when they are sick. triple c is the new high for teenagers. she was not angry, unhappy or anything else. she was not a drug user. she just wanted to get high and heard this was a fun and easy way to do it. when she began vomiting tuesday morning and couldn't stop, her parents took her to children's hospital in orange. although she text messaged a friend on monday night about what she had done, she didn't tell the doctors, the nurses, or her parents. neither did her friend or any of the other friends who were forwarded the text message. for four days, test after test was being done to figure out what was wrong. still no one said anything. on friday, she slipped into a coma and was given last rites before being flown to ucla medical ctron saturday morning. her liver had completely failed and she passed at 2:30 a.m.the memorial service yesterday at la purisima was the saddest day i have ever spent. the church was full (it holds 1200), several hundred teens alone. to see her in that white coffin weighing 25# or so more than her tiny self and looking years older because she was full of toxins was a sobering sight for those kids. as that little coffin was rolled down the church aisle today flanked by her brother and cousins, followed by her grieving aunt, grandmother and parents, i swear the whole church was sobbing. her poor dad was taken to st joe's at the conclusion of the church service for a potential heart attack (his third) and missed the 16 white doves let at the graveside. if this girl had known how many people loved, adored her...i know she didn't think taking all those pills would kill her, just give her a high, make her feel good for awhile. i know if she could have seen all those people with so much pain in them these last days,she would have thought twice about putting those pills in her mouth. these kids think they are invincible, that death cannot touch them at 16. they just have no idea. i had never heard of 'triple c' being used as a high or 'huffing' which is opening the cold capsule and snorting it. but when i asked around, all the kids were very aware of the term and the high. if each one of us tells one person about this story, and that person tells someone else, and they tell someone, and so forth, maybe we can help some other teen avoid dying so needlessly, avoid ruining their parents’ lives, hurting their friends and family.posted by beth @ 12:52 am   30 comments:at 4:02 pm, rik martin said…as always, you have compiled a very interesting blog here. i think you would enjoy my methamphetamine addiction treatment blog. you should check it out if you are interested in all things related to methamphetamine addiction treatment at 10:18 pm, anonymous said…im so sorry to hear that...i lost my lil brother 2 triple c...... at 9:18 pm, anonymous said…a few hours ago, my best friend jaimee od'ed she went to a local hospital, now she has been flown to a bigger city hospital. no one knows her condition yet. a friend's brother that was with her told me that she had taken 60 triple c's. the worst part is waiting to and not knwing how she is. at 6:56 am, anonymous said…wow.... im only 13 years old and ive been takeing triple c it kinda makes you feel like you are invinsible until you throw up it feels like yours loungs are in your throat after this story i guess i should stop. im sorry to hear what happened thanks for shareing it with me at 1:04 pm, 2 high school kids said…okay so that is all so totally scary. all of our friends and i pop triple c's to get a high now and then... usually 14 or 16 maybe even 12 for people who do it alot but like 8 or newbies. and its weird that u can actually die from it.never thought of it like that. i figured it was just coughmedicine. although ive never heard of neone "huffing it"but another thing someone should bring up is how metimucil contains 30mg of dxm just like triple c's...and lots of people pop those too...when wal mart runs out or c's. at 6:40 pm, anonymous said…this is very sad i am of only 12 years old and i have gotten exspeeled from my middle scholl 4 tripple c i was careless and stupid and now even after they took my friends life i pop them just tooo see if they will take mine to be with her i knew hwe 10 years i luv her and miss her i rpay 4 to this day i am only 12 and lost 5 friends to drug over dosees i cant stad my self but plz if u or some one u know uses tripple its not worth it im not say to but use pot as a subsatut but it can not kill you after one time at 3:02 pm, anonymous said…im 13 years old and i tried triple c's in school. my friend and i made a deal, i was giving her my diet pills for her trippin pills. im now expelled from school because of it. im very sorry to hear about what happened to you. i had to go to the emergency room,because i almost passed out. thankfully, it wasnt a huge deal, i only took 7 of them. but still, stuff like this makes me really sad,knowing that i did the same kind of thing and i am very very thankful. at 5:00 pm, nikki said…i was close with this girl. i love her and miss you soooooo much. we all pray for her and never will forget her bright smiling face. at 6:01 am, anonymous said…i have a 15yo daughter who has been doing triple c's and she stopped for awhile, like 4-5 months and then out of the blue she popped the pills because she had a bad day. she freaked out at the mall and i was not there; she thought she was having a heart attack. i am so worried about her and she is a smart girl and knows what these pills can do to her at 9:00 pm, anonymous said…i'm in the eighth grade. almost all of my friends pop triple c, except for me. i can't do anything about it, even though i've tried. none of them really know what it can do. they think it's just an easy way to get high. i dont know what to do anymore.:[ at 3:14 pm, anonymous said…this is the most rediculous display of childishness i think ive ever seen. im 21 years old and was introduced to coricidin about 9 months ago. i have a very addictive personality, so naturally i was hooked very shortly thereafter. it started with 8 pills a night. within a week, i had uped it to 8 pills twice a day. within 3 more weeks, i had been popping 16 at a time on my days off from work, and 8 sometimes up to 3 times a day while i was working. keep in mind this was an everyday occurance. every day. well, as you can imagine, things didnt go so well for me in the comming months. i became very irratible to anyone and everyone, on occasion i would have fits of rage, dillusions that i was better than everyone else. things along those lines. but then the depression came when things started falling down around me... i lost my job, (which by the way was my 12th and highest payed job yet) i lost the respect that i so desperatly strived for in my 2 best friends, and i lost my girl...all in the same day. not to mention my parents. they ruined my life... they ruined everything. and then i tried to commit suicide. how you ask? ccc's of course. i took my last 20 bucks down to the store (which i wont name) and bought 80 pills. took them all... i was done; it was over. but then an hour or so later, my father came to visit me and found me in a coma. obviously he called 911, and a long story short, i woke up the next day completly out of it, and in the hospital. they used some sort of charcoal as an antidote, and it was like a miracle that i made it through. here i am, 3 months later after i got out of that hospital, after i was baker acted, and after i went through byfar the worst time in my entire life, and im still that guy... i just cant seem to get away from the c's. i take them alot less than before, but there just so damn addictive... they made me into who i am today. all i want to say here, especially to those 16 or 17 yr. olds, is, learn from my mistakes... quit now because they've destroyed me...and lemme tell you, it aint easy pickin up the pieces and movin on. now, i did have other drugs influencing me, (pot, coke, meth, speed) but the root of all of that is the c's... don't do drugs kids, you'll regret it, i guarentee. at 8:31 am, anonymous said…i'm sorry to hear about her death. i'm 18 yrs old and i was just recently introduced to triple c's. i had no reason for why i tool them, i just did. the only drug that i've tried all my life was pot and which i still intend to do. but triple c's i did enjoy my first time, i took 8. i've taken triple c's twice. it's not really my thing and after lookin'up information on these pills i'm glad that i've found this site, reading everyone's comments helped me realize that this type of dumb shit isn't gonna help you get over things or feel better. so yeah i just wanted to share my experience and once again i'm sorry hear about the 16 year old girl and all the death's everyone around the world has witnessed from triple c's. at 5:32 am, anonymous said…that is ridicuolous. i used to do c's when i was young. it is dangerous to take it, because of two ingrediants that both attack the same enzyme in your liver--this is what causes the sometimes potentially fatal liver problems aforementioned. do some research. dxm is what makes you trip. the alternate ingredients in pills containing dxm can be potentially fatal when taken in mass quantities. dxm alone is illegal in the united states, prompting dxm fans/users to pull apart over the counter drugs to get at it. there are other drugs that contain dxm that can be taken in large quantity without harm, such as robotussin. reaserch this, and you'll find a wave of "teens" who "robo-trip." c's do not possess the capabilites of being addictive like heroin or even nicotine. c's are only addictive in the aspect that your mind created some strong manifestation of desire for them.. there are no physical withdrawal symptoms. it takes a while for c's to clear out of your systems, so kids that do it are sure to feel the after affects for another day, or more, depending on the dosage. it is almost impossible to pass as normal on c's. you look like a zombie and will often bleed from any oraphis. parents that do not notice something is wrong with a child that has slurred speech, bloodshot eyes, throws up randomly, and sleeps frequently... need a wake up call.also. dxm has not been tested extenively, and users/fans interested in the drug are mainly curious as to its psychological effects---dxm users report intense psychological "plateaus" of thinking when on the substance, similar to that of acid users. at 9:47 am, anonymous said…triple c is fun unless u take too many then u get i take 8 to 12 at a time i havent died last friday i took 28 im still here the most ive popped is 40 im not dead or sick or any thing so i dont think this story is true at 9:51 am, anonymous said…ive popped 40 im still here last friday i took 28 still here friday im going to steal more at 2:23 am, anonymous said…man, that is horrible. i'm not going to lie, i've taken triple c's before. only twice, and now i definitely know for a fact that i won't do it ever again. the first time was an experiment, i was willing to do it with my friend to see if i would like it. my friend had already done it quite a few times, so it didn't really have as much of an effect on him. i took 8 and sat down in my living room. after about 30 minutes my eyes felt like they were crossing by themselves....things weren't just blurry, everything was doubled. i laughed to myself at first, because even though i was only a few feet away from my friend, i couldn't tell what he looked like. i couldn't even see any of his facial features. his face was just a random white blob. i laughed to myself, and then kept on sitting there in silence. next thing i knew, i felt sedated to the point where it seemed like i was slowly dying. i was too weak and tired to move. my friend walked up to me and whispered to me ''hey dude are you high?'' and it took me literally 30 seconds to say ''oh my god....i'm so high''. i finally stood up and got the hang of talking. i stuttered uncontrollably and i couldn't even feel the words come out when i spoke. whenever i sat back down, i was a bit sobered up, but it was the grossest feeling ever. i pretty much didn't know anything. i felt retarded. my body felt like a piece of sh*t. i didn't like it. i don't see the enjoyment that others associate with getting high on triple c's. maybe they experience different things than i did. if educating young teenagers about the negative effects of triple c overdose doesn't help with the problem of overdose among adolescents, then i don't know what will.and also, i feel the need to say a few things to whoever posted this:''ive popped 40 im still here last friday i took 28 still here friday im going to steal more''and this:''triple c is fun unless u take too many then u get i take 8 to 12 at a time i havent died last friday i took 28 im still here the most ive popped is 40 im not dead or sick or any thing so i dont think this story is true''^^^^ are you f*ckin retarded? how old are you? first of all, it's pretty obvious that you're full of sh*t. and even if what you said was true, it wouldn't mean that it's safe to do it. it's pretty much like saying ''i ran around and played on the highway blindfolded and i didn't get killed, so it'll never happen.'' and why don't you think this story is true? just because you ''took 40 one time and youre not dead or sick or anything''? you're a dumb f*ck, you know that? why would someone lie about something like the death of an innocent 16 year old girl who overdosed on triple c's? not everybody has to lie for attention like you, you f*cking dickhead. i hope you overdose and die, you f*ckin' little cunt. at 1:10 am, anonymous said…i'm 15 years old and last night i tried triple c's. i had bought 2 boxes of triple c's at the grocery store (without an id i might add) and i popped 12 over an hour, i started with 7, but then i was impatient and i took 8, then my impatience got the best of me so i took 4 more. i got a little high but i fell asleep before the pills had reached the full effect. i fell asleep at around 3, my father woke my friend and i at 7 and despite my disbelief, i was trippin' balls, i was seeing shapes on my ceiling. i just stayed on the couch and acted like i was just really tired and i shut my eyes again to get my dad away, i woke up again at 4 pm, yes that is very late but i have always been an anti-morning person, but anyway i thought i was sober but when i stood up i got extremely dizzy. i was very irritable, everyone pissed me off, even my girlfriend, it wasnt until i saw her crying that i realized that my irritation was caused by the pills. i tried this drug because i was looking for an alternative drug to take, a drug that i dont have to smoke or roll. i'm a pothead, straight up, its organic, its green, and its a great trip. unfortunately i was recently caught smoking about a month ago, and my smoking days were put to a hault. marijuana stays in your sytem for up to a month, and my parents threats of getting me tested were reason enough for me to quit. i might do it again, but not any time soon, i might pop c's again, but not any time soon. i think im just going to drink for now. all my friends smoke and we have recently stopped hanging out because they usually smoke and i feel really left out. at 6:47 am, anonymous said…am 18 , i do triple c's almost everyday i also smoke pot with it. i have very slugish acts after the pill wear off. i take at least 16 a day yes the high is great but what it is doing to your mind is bad... makes you feel stuip cant walk well your eyes are wide and dylated like f*cking crazy. i have done x and thats what it feels like after 16 pills. dont think you in control with your body while on the pills your not! at 1:19 pm, anonymous said…hey guys, i really hope you all read this. this past weekend, i od'd on tripple c's. i decided it'd be cool to "trip," as if i were on acid or whatever, which is what i was told it's somewhat like. however, little did i know, i have a heart murmur. and guys, these are high blood pressure pills. everyone else was smokin pot, i thoguht it would be cool to trip tripple c's. i took five, nothin happend, (i didn't give enough time). so i took five more. this is ten tripple c's. i'm an 18 yr old 115 lb girl. i laid down in the bed and my legs went numb. i was like "yes this is awesome." then i hear a guy say "i'm going to turn into a spider." this is what sent my trip to shit. i started screaming and curling into a little ball on the bed sayin "no no please dont please i'm scared of spiders." they walked me to the couch and thought i was "over reacting" but i wasn't. it was real. my cousin got in my face and jokingly said "quit being a baby" then i saw his face swirl around in multi color repeating "quit being such a baby" everything seemed so real. when i laid down on the couch i was saying "look at all the stars here in outerspace, i can touch every single one of them" and then i scream "omg im getting sucked into a black hole" and i felt my body go to shit, everything went haywire. i got hot so fast and immediately started throwing up. when my cousin got my mom to me, i couldn't talk. i didn't know where i was, who i was, nothing. she took me to the er and my blood pressure was at stroke stage, then it would bottom out. my temp would go from 104 to 96 over and over. i would just lay in the bed and ask the nurses and my mom and family if i was dead and in hell. because i honestly believed it. they gave me an iv to make me throw up to get it out of me. i was tripping so bad i didn't know what the blood pressur cuff was on my arm. i made my mom take all my clothes off of me because i didn't know what they were and it was th eonly way to keep me calm. if i was scared, i would trip and think i was shrinking. the doctor told me i was lucky to walk away from it, and lucky my liver didn't quit on me. i almost died because of only ten tripple c's. please, guys, dont do them. at 9:07 pm, anonymous said…triple c is fun and all but after this past weekend im not sure if i want to do it again. this past friday i went to a concert with my friend and i gave him 8 and i took 8. i have taken them before, a few times. the trip is so much fun. the next day you feel it still & the colors of everything are very vivid and you feel just calm, just everything is chill. but anyways so we took them and went to the concert. after about two hours he was going crazy and having a great time. but me, i was just sitting down not feeling anything wondering why it wasnt working. it was because i was sitting down, to get the full effect you have to be and walking or doing something. as soon as we left it started to kick in. after i got dropped off at my house there were tons of lights in front of my house. i didnt realize until i got closer that they were cop cars and tons of them. it turns out my older brother had done a hit and run. it didnt sink in though that there were tons of cops at my house! my mom was explaining the situation to me and i just spun around the house, and she said she saw me kissing a wall. i was really fucked up from the 3 c. she sent me to bed very disppointed , but i wouldnt tell her what i did and she didnt know. she thought it was xtc. but it was really triple c. the next day i slept in and was still feeling it when i woke up. my friend and i decided to take some (a different friend) and it hadnt even been 24 hours since i last took the last 8 that i had taken before the concert! after it started to kick it her face was doubled and it was crazy; it feels like you are drunk & when you walk up stairs it feels like you are lifted up. i like to stare at a fan when im on it because its the most beautiful thing ever. it spins and makes a tie-dye color. but back to the point. as usual it was very fun and i loved the high. but the next morning we had to get up early and that was a big drag. we both took a shower and while i was taking mine, all of a sudden out of nowhere i felt really sick. and i mean really sick. i hadnt eaten anything because when your on it you dont feel the need to eat. but i still wanted to vomit. then my world got dark and i could only see the outlines of things. i knew i was about to black-out but i could barely comprenhend that much and im surprised i did. i stumbled out of the shower and could barely think enough to put a towel on. my friends mother asked what was wrong and i told her i was about to black out or pass out. my whole body was numb and i heard a sharp ringing through my ears. i laid down and after a few mintues everything was back to normal. this has never happened to me before and it scared me. i love the high i get off of triple but im not sure if it is worth it. its addicting and it makes me addicted to reserch it and that is why im here.everyone who has posted something on here was on this page for a reason. they were looking up something about triple c. so to the people who said they want more and think this is bull, you read it and were directed to this page for a reason. are you having doubts? i know i am thats why im on this page.triple c is stupid if you think about it. but we are teenagers and want to experiment and we will. no matter what people tell us. im sorry to hear about this death and its ashame they have this stuff out on the market without a perscription. but at the same time how can you expect us not to want to try it. it is amazing. but really we shouldnt do it. so then why do we continue to do it. criticize me if you want, but im speaking the truth.thanks for reading. at 9:35 am, anonymous said…when i was 15 i started to take coricidin cough and cold medicine i woould take 16 or 18 usually everytime i did it. i would typically do it 3 or 4 times a week for about a year. it's very hallocinative, my friends and i believed one night sitting infront of an old radio with lots of knobs on it that we were on a space ship on the moon...i still laugh about it because to me and my friends it was just dumb teenagers having fun. but i do know of someone who took 62 and was comatose for 3 days and did nothing but stare into space...we didn't do anything about it but what should we have done we were teenagers and scared he turned out to be fine but we then discontinued use of the triple c's...now just thinking about them, red skittles, or even seeing the box makes me get a sick feeling in my stomach...i now know that they were a very stupid thing to do but we were just kids just like this girl and i'm very sorry to hear that she lost her life for such a stupid thrill but i think more teenagers should be aware of these over the counter drugs that have such serios affects if abbused...i'm now 19 years old and no i'm not perfect but i have learned to make better judgements and i look back on some of those times where i was completly unaware of what was going on and i couldn't speak straight i'd say things twice like, "you you" or "like like" and even in my face you could tell i was messed up the corners of my mouth would slope down like all of my mussels were relaxed. to all of you teenagers out there that all might sound fun and intising but trust me and can have long term affects on your organs i've constantly had problems with aches and pains nausea..i've had tests and cat scans recently and they all like back to stupid drugs i've taken and i dedicate triple c's to doing the most harm because i took them for sucha a long time and they are really harsh on your body so please be smart don't try them they do so much more harm than anytype of good or plessure!!!! at 10:22 pm, dont be stupid said…i am 17 years old and was introduced to tripple c's about 3=5 months ago. i really really like the hight that they give me and im pretty sure that im not going to quit. i take tripple c's whenever i get the chance. i always go to wal mart and steal a box or two every time. i take 12 pills and then an hour later i take the other 4 (16). do not take tripple c's if your are not aware of them!!! if you are going to take them start slow. yes they are addicting so do not take them all the time. by the way the od limit is from 18-25. all though my little brother tried to kill himself he took 48 of the pills and survived. i was so pissed at him that i didnt know what to do. im not telling you to stop taking tripple c's, all im saying is be smarter about it. if you have a bad feeling about it then dont do it. if you think you are going to od then you should go to your bathroom and make yourself throw up. and dont take more than 16 of them. im not going to quit tripple c's. in fact i am on them right now and have 16 more in my room. they are extremely addicting and you shouldnt mess with them. im addicted to them and will probly be taking them for the rest of my life. or until they become illegal. at 5:27 pm, anonymous said…im 17 and last night i experienced the effect from triple c. the high is crazy 6ut i will tell you i will never touch them again. after awhile i took 14 then was jumped into a local gang 6ut 6efore i got jumped i took 2 more so i took a total of 16 last night. i kept thinking i was in some sort of video game, i thought at any second i was going to die and i didn't really enjoy the high after thinking to much of dieing. i dont recommend taking triple c's, i dont care who you are or how many things you have done it isnt worth the risk of almost dieing. last night i couldnt sleep for the longest time and right now my pupols are still huge and i am still feeling some of the effects. i just want the effects to stop. thats all i have to say, i will never do triple c or anything else like that ever again. at 6:54 pm, anonymous said…my cousin has been takin triple c's for about 2 years now and shes only 15. i found her one day layin in a ditch with throw up comin out of her mouth and she was barely breathing. i had to take her to the hospital. she had od'd on triple c's i later found out. i cant stand those pills!! i'm 18 years old and my cousin is like my little sister...i really thought i almost lost her. i think she told me she took like 30 or so. i was pissed. to all of u people out there who think its "cool" to take those damn triple c's... you are stupid. u could be that person lying in a ditch somewhere oding on triple c's an if no one knew where u were,cuz u prolly lied to ur parents bout where u were, u would prolly be chokin on ur own puke. so u go ahead and get an awesome high, but u better make it pretty damn awesome cuz u never know when ur guna take ur last breath in that ditch. at 1:56 pm, dxm feind said…for all you out ther who don't know what dxm does to you here goes. your brain swells up masivley, then it does enough brain damage to you that a 6 day drinking binge does to you. sorry to tell you all. i still love it. at 9:33 am, anonymous said…damn these are some crazyy stories. i had a friend that had taken 127 triple c's and died for 10 min. he came back alive. he will not touch them to this day. me and my friends are poppin them today. but i think this is gonna be the last time i take them! im poppin 8 and so are my friends we all never taken them b4. we gonna smoke weed and maybe drink hopefully we dont get to fcuked up! at 9:52 am, anonymous said…i have oded on those but they are so addicteing and i cant stop taking them at 9:57 am, anonymous said…i have taking 42pills and oded i was dead 4 5min they brought me back to life and i still keep doing them i love them but i know whats going to happen if i keep doing themsincerleycloud 9 at 12:58 am, anonymous said…im 17, up until about a few months ago i took triple c's on a regular basis....almost everyday since i was 14. i consider myself extreamly lucky. all these kids need to realize what dxm does to you. in my personal oppinion, along with many other people ive talked to, triple c's are right up there with heroin and cocaine. i thank god everyday that i was taken to the hospital after oding. i was told that if i wouldve taken 3 more pills, i would have been dead. and at that time. i only took 10, and the scary part is, i was thinking about taking 15, but my gut somehow told me not to. every pill that is taken doesnt go away after your high is gone, it sits in your stomach, and it eats at your liver until theres nothing left. i suggest to anyone that takes these, find something else, and not another drug. theres things in this world that can create natural high's for each individual. for me, its playing music, and performing. to me, nothing is better, theres things like that for everone. find it. ive had 3 friendships crumble, because of these things, and along with that, other things have gone wrong. ill tell you one thing, if they werent around, i would still have the best group of friends in the world. there was 7 of us....now there is 3 but really, i only have one. my only friend who ive known since the 2nd grade...and it almost tore us apart too....these things are not worth it, at all!and if anyone doubts me one bit...then god help you. at 6:31 am, anonymous said…im sry for the lost of ur friend ive came so close to losing my girl friend b/c i just couldnt stop and i finally relized that i love her way more than the drug and ive been sober for 2 months but to anybody tht is reading this and is doing it im telling you u need to quiet b/c drugs do nothing for you execpt make you lose the people closest to you and you dont need drugs to have a good time you know i mean when ever i feel like doing it when i with a whole bunch of people i just tell myself naw man ur good uve got ur girlfriend wht else more do you need and again im really sry that u lost ur friend like tht i know how it feels ive lost alot of people to overdoses and it sux but i would like you to know that god is watching over you and hes always got his guardian angels watching over you so dont feel like your alone b/c your not god is always with you dont forget that
