    from the north american division of the seventh-day adventist church: an appeal for human dignity and decency


 by ohio conference
•
january 31, 2025

there are many in the united states who are afraid for their futures, and for the lives of family members. as a christian denomination in the u.s., the seventh-day adventist church supports the rights of all persons, no matter their country of origin — the equal rights provided in the u.s. constitution and fair treatment as immigrants and refugees in this country.                                                    as members of the seventh-day adventist church, we believe that “we are all equal in christ, who by one spirit has bonded us into one fellowship with him and with one another; we are to serve and be served without partiality or reservation” (fundamental belief no. 14).                                                              “we maintain our allegiance to the biblical principles of equality and dignity of all human beings in the face of historic and continuing attempts to use skin color, place of origin, caste, or perceived lineage as a pretext for oppressive and dominating behavior. these attempts are a denial of our shared humanity and we deplore all such aggression and prejudice as an offense to god” (seventh-day adventist church statement “one humanity: a human relations statement addressing racism, casteism, tribalism, and ethnocentrism”).                                                              the bible declares that in christ there is neither jew nor gentile, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female — all are one in christ jesus (gal. 3:28). we are one humanity. dehumanization and margination by law or the implementation of the laws or policies are diametrically opposed to the bible. therefore, it is inhumane and robs people of their god-given dignity in christ to have policies that make them afraid to go to church and school because of the threat of being deported.                                                              the seventh-day adventist church in north america encourages its churches and schools to be warm and welcoming places for all people. all are created by god and deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.                                                              in light of the fact that we have a shared humanity, in light of the fact we all are created equal, in light of the fact we should love our neighbor as ourselves, and in light of the fact that jesus said, “whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me” (matt. 25:40, niv), our appeal is for us, as adventists, to show our immigrant families that we love them by lifting up our voices and standing by their side in these times of uncertainty.                                                              our appeal to our policymakers and government leaders is found in the seventh-day adventist church manual (p. 92): “all are in search of wholeness. all are gifted, needed, and treasured. all are created in the image of god with an inherent dignity regardless of any limitation they may have.” therefore, let our laws and the implementation of our laws treat all of god’s children, who are created in his image, with the dignity and decency they deserve.                                                              g. alexander bryant, president                                                              kyoshin ahn, executive secretary                                                              judy r. glass, treasurer/cfo                                                              ***                                                                                       guidelines for pastors and school leaders, through the document "guidance on immigration enforcement activity on church and school property," from the north american division of seventh-day adventists office of general counsel, can be found by clicking                                          here                               .

january 25, 2025

today, stereo adventista internacional, the online hispanic christian radio station led by the ohio conference of seventh-day adventists' multilingual ministries department, celebrated its 7th anniversary in columbus, ohio.                                                    pastor fredy funez, director of the radio ministry's southern area, welcomed in-person guests and online viewers to the event and asked for god's blessings upon everyone present.                                                              pastor bob cundiff, president of the ohio conference, delivered the sermon, using water as a metaphor to highlight spiritual discernment. "not all water is safe to drink," he noted. "the stuff that you watch, listen to, and stream on your device—it's not always safe to consume. it's not always good for you or your family." referring to john 4:14, cundiff emphasized jesus' promise: "whoever drinks of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life." he likened stereo adventista's ministry to a spring of living water that offers eternal life. he added, "when i drink from it, it gives me eternal life. and when i am a part of helping this ministry succeed, i am giving eternal life—not just to my church, my family, the hispanic ministry of ohio, and the entire world."                                                                                                 a growing ministry with global impact                                          with its motto, "a voice of hope," stereo adventista internacional operates four radio stations in cleveland, columbus, dayton, and toledo, reaching 108 countries; the ministry averages 103,000 connections and has garnered thousands of followers on digital platforms.                                                              as part of the celebration, ten individuals participated in baptism. pastor edwina monterroza praised god for their decisions, stating, "praise be to the name of god—a pure and clear manifestation that the holy spirit is still working among his people."                                                              pre-recorded messages from listeners highlighted the ministry's global reach. rut ester sandoval shared, "i am happy. i congratulate you, and i ask god to continue blessing us with his power and grace so that stereo adventista internacional continues on the air, carrying the message of hope and salvation to the world." nilken ortiz, a loyal listener from colombia, added, "today, with gratitude and admiration, i celebrate with you the seventh anniversary of this incredible radio station. from the fertile land of colombia, i send you my most heartfelt congratulations. may the tune of stereo adventista continue to illuminate our days and soothe our nights. congratulations!"                                                                          supporting the ministry                                          in a video message, bob cundiff shared a personal note: "you may not know that i listen to stereo adventista every saturday morning when i prepare for church and many times while driving to my preaching appointments. so i want to thank you for listening, supporting, calling, and giving financially to stereo adventista. the work we do here is important—it's mission work, it's evangelism. and here's a powerful thought: because of the work we do, new people will go to heaven because they heard the message of jesus for the first time on stereo adventista."                                                              andrew sutton, treasurer of the ohio conference, commended the radio ministry's supporters. he explained how their donations fund essential operations, including purchasing equipment and software and hosting events. "we know that many people are coming to the lord through the ministry of stereo adventista," sutton stated. on behalf of the ohio conference administration, he presented a $15,000 check to support the ministry.                                                              pastor edwina monterroza also expressed gratitude by presenting gifts to conference officers, volunteers, and other supporters who have contributed to stereo adventista's success.                                                                                                 looking ahead with faith and hope                                          before offering the benediction, pastor oswaldo magaña, executive secretary of the ohio conference, gave thanks to god for his past and present blessings. he expressed optimism about the ministry's future, particularly its role in the upcoming pentecost 2025 initiative. "the radio will play an extraordinary role in the outpouring of the holy spirit, resulting in many souls being won for the kingdom of heaven," he stated.

 




   

    war divides their homelands; christ unites them in cleveland

january 16, 2025

in a small cleveland church, where worshippers from russia and ukraine kneel side by side, peace reigns, defying the war that divides their homelands. this unique congregation sings, prays, studies and fellowships together, with no trace of the painful divisions or hatred that mark their nations' conflict.                                                    the church's story began after pastor gennadii kasap arrived in cleveland at a challenging time. before his arrival, there was just a handful of slavic members in the area—mainly a ukrainian family who attended a church with only american members. "i arrived in cleveland on march 10, 2022, just weeks after the war began on february 24," he shares. "of course, the beginning of the war created certain problems from the very start of my ministry." having come from moscow, russia, gennadii faced initial resistance to forming ohio conference’s slavic mission church, however, he believed the congregation's closeness to god would overcome negativity.

the ohio conference treasury department has announced two major leadership transitions: zachary sharpe has moved from assistant treasurer to associate treasurer, and karen alvarez has been appointed assistant treasurer.                                                    zachary’s parents, who are adventist church employees, served in various locations, allowing him to move with them several times during childhood. he was born in newark, ohio, while his father worked at mount vernon academy. throughout his education, zachary attended adventist schools—from kindergarten through his master’s degree.                                                              karen, the oldest of three children, was born in el salvador to an adventist family. she loves nature and spends much of the summer hiking. karen also enjoys reading and listening to music. she joined the ohio conference in may 2023 as a human resources assistant. her primary responsibilities included managing the onboarding and offboarding processes, explaining benefits to new employees, and overseeing open enrollment. she assisted with employee retirement processes, service records, and working policy updates.                                                              as the new associate treasurer, zachary’s responsibilities include managing the conference’s non-operating and trust funds. he will also oversee endowment funds and participate in various committees to foster collaboration among staff as they further the lord’s work. zachary joined the ohio conference on november 1, 2018, as an assistant treasurer, where he primarily oversaw payroll and accounts receivable. reflecting on his work, zachary shared, “the most rewarding part about working with the ohio conference is hearing the stories about how god is working in ohio and seeing the incredible things that he is doing.” his favorite bible verse is philippians 4:13: “i can do all things through christ who strengthens me.”                                                              karen expressed that the most rewarding part of working with the ohio conference is knowing she is working for god. “and helping employees with their benefits and retirement process,” she added. her favorite bible verses are psalms 23 and 91. beaming with hope, karen said, “i will keep doing my best to do the work that god has called me to do.”                                                              echoing that hope, zachary said, “i look forward to continuing to serve the ohio conference as we continue the work the lord has given us in taking the message of christ to the people of ohio.”

 




   

    springfield, ohio's haitian church: a sanctuary of faith in tough times


 by francis tuffour
•
november 14, 2024

early on a sabbath morning, a young man with his baby strapped to his chest steps into the small haitian adventist church, where voices of praise fill the air in springfield, ohio. for members of this faith community, the gathering is more than worship—it's a source of solace, a sanctuary from life's hardships.                                                    emmanuel haitian seventh-day adventist church began with just four haitian members meeting in the basement of springfield's hispanic adventist church in december 2021. named 'emmanuel' to reflect their unflinching faith in god's presence among them, the congregation quickly grew—first to 17, then to 35, to 40, and now to over 70 members, with as many as 80 to 100 joining when visitors come. these immigrants left haiti, but they did not leave behind their faith. they created a space to grow spiritually, seek god's guidance, and find hope amid their challenges. according to the migration policy institute, many haitians have recently migrated to the u.s. due to political instability, natural disasters, violence, and economic hardship. amid these struggles, the members of emmanuel face difficulties navigating a new environment while holding tightly to their roots.                                                              while they left behind some challenges in haiti, life in a new land has brought hardships. cleoius joseph, an emmanuel haitian seventh-day adventist church elder, explained that members face significant immigration-related difficulties but lack someone to guide them through the process. 'we need help with immigration issues, filling applications, and someone who can assess our needs and connect us to resources,' he shared.                                                              the church regularly sees new members and visitors, some of whom are not adventists, arriving in search of help. many come with nothing to eat, lacking food, clothing, money, or even a place to stay. the financial strain also prevents the congregation from hosting after-church potlucks, which they would otherwise use to build fellowship and support.                                                              joseph also noted that some members have faced ridicule and harmful stereotypes, with rumors circulating that haitians are responsible for pet disappearances. this misconception has caused distress within the community, leading some families to relocate to other cities in search of a more understanding environment."                                                              despite facing tough times, the church continually strengthens members' faith in god through prayers, bible study, sermons, and songs. worship includes ample time for singing, which they approach with joy and energy. unlike the israelites, who questioned how to sing the lord's song in a foreign land, emmanuel haitian adventist church members lifted their voices together. the congregation participates in singing, not just a few in a praise team, creating a shared sense of unity.                                                              though they may lack potlucks, their fellowship is rich as they sing hymns like what a friend we have in jesus. faces beam with hope as they sing lines such as, 'is there trouble anywhere? we should never be discouraged; take it to the lord in prayer! precious savior, still our refuge—take it to the lord in prayer! do your friends despise, forsake you? take it to the lord in prayer!'                                                              during sabbath school, they engage in communal study, led by one person who encourages participation through questions and personal contributions. together with the sermons, these moments of worship and study continue to strengthen the faith of every member                                                              the church, composed mainly of young people and conducted in french, is led by roger melendez-cabrera, a spanish pastor who provides spiritual guidance with the support of his elders.                                                              as emmanuel haitian adventist church grows, its members hold fast to their faith, drawing strength from one another and finding hope for better days ahead. within this humble congregation, they have genuinely found a sanctuary.

 




   

    hope for today: a united effort in the greater toledo area

october 31, 2024

the hope for today city-wide evangelistic campaign was a historic moment of unity, community                     service, and spiritual revival in the greater toledo area. it occurred at owens community                               college from august 31 to september 14, 2024.                                                              it was a testament to the power of collaboration as all five local churches in the city's metro                               area, including bowling green sda, toledo first sda, swanton sda, northwood sda, and                               parkwood sda, joined forces in a cross-conference collaboration. also, two spanish                               congregations in the city's metro area - toledo spanish sda and bowling green spanish sda                               held campaigns simultaneously at a separate venue.                               the program was also a testament to what could occur when the various levels of the church                               synergize. while the initiative was grassroots-led, the ohio conference, allegheny west                               conference, and the columbia union assisted with sponsorship via their presence, prayers,                               finances, and resources.                                                                                                 impact on individuals and families                                          as a result of the event, 87 individuals joined the churches by baptism and profession of faith.                               these new additions were the culmination of the holy spirit working through compassion                               initiatives, meaningful conversations, one-on-one bible studies, and powerful messages by the                               campaign speaker, pastor ryan day of 3abn. many of these individuals expressed that the                               sense of community and compassion drew them in and helped them take this step.                               in addition to the numerous adults who attended hope for today, the event welcomed 40 to 100                               children each night into a warm and fun environment. the facilitators taught kids bible stories,                               played games, helped with crafts, and blessed the young ones with snacks. this robust                               children’s program called the hope zone effectively motivated parents to attend the nightly                               meetings.                                                                                                 serving the community's practical needs                                          understanding the practical needs in the community, hope for today offered tangible support                               for families by distributing groceries, diapers, clothes, laundry supplies, and dinner each                               evening. these items met essential needs and showed the community the church's commitment                               to caring for them on multiple levels. families were deeply grateful, and many expressed that                               this outreach significantly impacted their lives.                               one attendee said, "i just wanted to thank you for this event. i recently took custody of an infant                               and am struggling financially. not only were the diapers a blessing, but i also won the meijer gift                               card!"                                                                          preparing through prayer, training, and unity                                          in preparation for "hope for today," the churches engaged in multiple five-day prayer sessions                               seeking god’s guidance and blessing for the outreach.                               additionally, on may 18, 2024, the pastors of the local churches hosted an evangelism boot                               camp, training members on engaging with the community, sharing their faith effectively, and                               meeting people where they are.                               on august 24, a joint rally gathered everyone before the event started, strengthening the spirit                               of unity and purpose. during the rally, the keynote speaker, dr. bob cundiff, president of the                               ohio conference, reminded the church members that their spiritual efforts were worthwhile.                               moreover, church members noted that their boldness for jesus increased as they kept inviting                               others to the campaign.                                                                          lasting impact and continued growth                                          the bonds formed among the five churches have only strengthened since "hope for today"                               concluded. the churches continue to grow as new members join them, and existing members                               remain inspired to stay connected and involved.                               pr. eccles, the bowling green & swanton church pastor, mentioned that "the program gave our                               church momentum and direction as we prepare for pentecost 2025."                               in post-assessment, pr. steven valles of parkwood sda church noted, "hope for today was                               more than an event—it was the beginning of a movement. our churches are excited to continue                               building on this momentum, knowing that when we come together, we can make an incredible                               impact on our community and beyond. together, we look forward to further opportunities to                               serve, grow, and bring hope to those around us."                                                                          written by:                         kojo twumasi
