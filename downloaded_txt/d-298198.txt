“i left camp with a newfound confidence after meeting other kids with heart problems for the first time.” 



- noelle, camper



welcome to camp boggy creek, a magical and always free camp for children with serious medical illnesses. camp was founded in 1996 by actor paul newman and general h. norman schwarzkopf, with one simple premise in mind… that every child, no matter their illness, could experience the transformational spirit and friendships that go hand in hand with camp.

a truly magical place!








gatehouse & water tower
the gatehouse and water tower are the first landmarks our guests see from brantley branch road. welcome to camp 








the heated pool
the camp boggy creek pool was a contribution from our partners at sea world orlando. the pool comes complete with an accessible sloped entry that is suitable for entry for all campers. the pool house has locker rooms and bathrooms.








the horse barn & nature center
our local friends in the community let their horses live at camp for the summer so our campers can enjoy them. the horses spend time in the barn and in the pastures, and the arena provides an alternative riding area during summer rains.








state-of-the-art medical facility
the patch – where campers go to get patched up – is our state-of-the-art medical facility, decorated with murals of a jungle scene, dinosaurs, hot air balloons, and florida wildlife to help campers feel comfortable while visiting.








be a star in our theater!
the theater was a gift from our partners at universal studios orlando. it houses commercial grade lighting and sound equipment to help show off the performances of our campers and family members. there are costumes and props galore!  our stage is lower than most stages to help it feel less intimidating to first-time performers.


















 



the camp boggy creek facilities are maintained and upgraded year-round, to offer the most unique and accessible camp available to children with serious illnesses. from our pool to our medical center – we have it all. below are just a few of our facilities at camp. to learn more about all of our facilities, click here. 


























dear parents,



camp boggy creek is a $23 million facility that features a state-of-the-art medical facility called “the patch.” our full-time physician and nurse are joined by volunteer doctors and nurses when campers are at camp. these volunteers specialize in the illness or disease group being served during a family retreat weekend or summer session. this extensive medical support gives parents the confidence to know that their child will be safe and have access to medical care as needed, oh, also, they will have the time of their life!




    apply today!
  










































be a part of the magic.



camp boggy creek is a place where children can reach beyond their illnesses and enjoy the simple pleasures of childhood. our programs are always provided free of charge to our campers and families, and this is because of our faithful donors, partners, volunteers and camp friends who support us throughout the year.  below are some of the ways you can make a difference in the lives of children with serious illnesses.

"not a day goes by that i don't think of camp boggy creek." — taylor, camper



camp boggy creek relies on the generosity of individuals, foundations, corporations, medical partners and voluntary health organizations who believe in our mission and the programs that impact our campers and their families. donations support all program activities, including 24/7 medical care, meals and lodging — everything needed to make a week of camp an unforgettable experience for children with serious illnesses. gifts made to camp boggy creek are not only an investment in the life of a child diagnosed with a serious illness, but also give back a childhood that has been taken away.
