discover the story behind advanced nutrients and our team 



in 1983, michael ‚Äòbigmike‚Äô straumietis set out to unlock the genetic potential of cannabis to maximize potency, yields, and flavor. together with a team of top phd scientists, he mapped out the plant‚Äôs genome and utilized this data to revolutionize the industry by continuing to develop and optimize cannabis-specific nutrients. today, growers in over 117+ countries rely on advanced nutrients to produce the largest yields of the highest quality cannabis they can and are helping to further our mission of making cannabis an acceptable and everyday part of healing humanity.

                here are some example topics:

                example 1: what is the best way to germinate my seeds? can you explain in much detail as possible.

                example 2 : what advanced nutrients' base nutrient should i use for growing cannabis at home?

                as ai is prone to errors, the information provided should be used as a general guide, not as a definitive source. if you are experiencing problems and trying to troubleshoot, contact our expert grower support here for free.

why do i need to shake nutrients in their bottle before mixing them?

over time, components within the nutrients settle on the bottom of the bottle. when you pour a bottle without shaking it, you can potentially be pouring out an unbalanced solution. shaking up the nutrient bottle ensures you are pouring the right blend into your reservoir, giving your crops the nutrition they need.



can i mix products from different manufacturers?

usually, it‚Äôs not a problem. but some products are incompatible with each other and can damage your plants when they‚Äôre used together. for example, bloom boosters with high pk numbers or low-grade silica products can destabilize your nutrient mix and cause nutrient lockout.nutrient manufacturers design their products to be used with each other. in doing so, they include specific portions of each nutrient in each product, so crops receive the right nutrition through each stage of the grow cycle. when you stick with one manufacturer, you don‚Äôt have to worry about inadvertently destabilizing your nutrient mixture. one example of why you need to stick with only one manufacturer‚Äôs products is advanced nutrients‚Äô ph perfect line. these products are designed to keep your crops‚Äô root zone within a specific ph range. when you use them alongside products from another manufacturer, we can‚Äôt guarantee your root zone will maintain its optimal ph level.



is there an easy way to know how much of each nutrient i need to add to my garden?

yes! if you‚Äôre growing with advanced nutrients products, you can use our easy nutrient calculator to generate the correct nutrient chart for your crops in seconds. check out advanced nutrients‚Äô nutrient calculator here. another great resource is our library of free custom-growing recipes. try our expert grower-tested nutrient schedules here.you can also download our official budlabs app to generate nutrient schedules and receive real-time notifications for specific tasks, including feeding your crops. upgrade to budlabs pro to maintain profiles on an unlimited number of crops.



where can i buy advanced nutrients?

if you are a grower, visit this link to find the closest advanced nutrients authorized retailer. if you are a retailer, visit this link to identify our official distributors.



do you offer customer support?

our greatest passion is growing great cannabis‚Äîand helping other growers do the same. that‚Äôs why we offer complimentary cultivation support 24/7 from monday to friday and from 9 am until 7 pm pst on saturday‚Ä¶ with the same level of advice licensed producers would pay consultants tens of thousands of dollars to unlock.just call 1-800-640-9605 or email support@advancednutrients.com. for spanish-speaking growers, email spanishsupport@advancednutrients.com.



do you have a product guarantee?

yes! if for any reason you are not absolutely thrilled with the results you achieve when you use our products, just bring the unused portion, along with your original sales receipt, back to the place of purchase within six months, and ask for your money back. find out more about our grower guarantee here.



what is ph perfect¬Æ?

advanced nutrients has spent many thousands of man-hours developing a technology that automatically balances your ph for you ‚Äî putting it in the ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù and holding it there for one week.and the technology is so ‚Äúsmart‚Äù that it can account for many of the aforementioned variables in your grow room. our proprietary ph buffering agents and stabilizing mechanisms became the foundation of a new system aptly called ph perfect¬Æ technology. learn all about it here.
