our vision & mission
the sweet medicine sundance path inspires spiritual evolution. it is a shamanic tradition dedicated to sharing knowledge that works which guides us into healing, growth and transformation. the sweet medicine sundance path shows us how to establish a deep connection to nature which teaches us how we are interconnected with all of life.







community
communities of like-minded seekers with study groups, lodges, longhouses and community gatherings bring life-changing ceremonies and teachings in the form of wheels and keys.



physical & physical healing
heal your entire being: body, emotions, mind, spirit and soul. personal healing practices that restore balance and support both allopathic and alternative medicines. this includes ceremonial alchemy that addresses the cause, not just the symptoms, of many diseases.



personal development & growth
explore and develop your physical health, strength, and skills. the body is intended to live a very long time. we provide programs that increase endurance and promote longevity and heightened awareness.



life’s transitions
meet and move through your life changes with beauty. rites of passage ceremonies teach, heal and encourage healthy growth through all life passages.



relationship enhancements
sexuality is one of the most misunderstood and misused energies today. the quodoushka spiritual sexual teachings take us back to imagine that sex is natural, sacred and beautiful.
