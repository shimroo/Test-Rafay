have an elicensing account?





already applied or licensed but need an account?






applying for an exam or exam/license and don't have an elicensing account?














note: licensees are strongly cautioned not to postpone the entry of an elicensing renewal transaction in the event that access to the system 
           may be temporarily unavailable or experiencing slow or interrupted responses. elicensing renewal transactions are considered to be late after midnight
           of the license expiration date, even if the transaction is in process at that time or the system is unavailable.  all elicensing transactions will be monitored 
           by the timing mechanisms of the elicensing online system and not the licensee's computer.
