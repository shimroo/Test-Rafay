                                  best 75
                                  hong kong films
                                  of the 2010s
                                  
                                  four months after we announced it,
                                  we're  finally starting our countdown for
the best 75 hong kong
films 
                                  of the 2010s.
                                  for the next few weeks we'll be
                                  revealing the 
                                  films as voted upon
                                  by over 130 readers and passerbys
                                  of lovehkfilm.com. each person took 
                                  time ouf of their busy lives to send in 
                                  lists of movies that they like,
                                  even if the movie was as bad as meow.
                                  check damn you kozo for
                                  tbe newest updates.
                                  spoiler: you will not see meow
                                  in the top 75.
                                  






so, how about that 2020, eh?
lovehkfilm.com is finally revealing the results of our  best hong kong films of the 2010s reader vote and it's been a long time coming. we're sorry for taking so long to get it done, but life seldom waits for dumb things like website updates. usually it just barrels forth, ruining your plans and even your fortunes, if it's feeling  frisky.

apparently, life is super frisky right now because everything is in a state of destablization and disarray that would impress even the most dedicated pessimist. it's kind of amazing, actually, how totally effed up everything is. if you tend to be complacent or cavalier about these things, we ask you to stay alert. if you're  freaking out, please calm down. panic helps nobody.

we hope that during all this wacky and worrisome chaos that you find the time to watch new hong kong movies. it's a dumb message but it's all this dumb website is authorized to suggest because, well, this is a hong kong movie website. we don't know how to solve the world's problems and don't feel comfortable pushing any particular solution. but man, we do like a good hong kong movie every once in a while. so that's all we'll say.
 
take care of yourselves.
