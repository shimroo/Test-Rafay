discovered in 1957, coenzyme q10 in its ubiquinone form is an essential component of the process of atp energy generation. in its ubiquinol form, it is an important antioxidant, protecting cells against oxidative stress.
coq10 is sold as a nutritional supplement, as an ingredient in skin care products, and, in europe, not least as a medicinal product that plays an important role as an adjuvant therapy for heart failure patients.
in 1978, dr. peter mitchell won the nobel prize in chemistry for his explanation of biological energy transfer and the importance of coenzyme q10 to the process. since then, numerous clinical trials have documented the absorption, bioavailability, safety, and efficacy of coq10 supplementation in heart conditions, statin-induced muscle pain and weakness, migraines, and physical performance.
