  nonprofit recycling & reuse network
  transforming generosity into impact


connecting donors and nonprofits
in a fast-changing world where technology and resources are precious, efficient use of these resources is essential. at recycles.org, we offer a user-friendly platform where people who want to help, meet people who need help.
our purpose
our mission is simple: to make a better world where everyone has what they need. we work to reduce the gap between those who have access to technology for education and healthcare, and those who don't.
what we do
recycles.org connects generous people with nonprofit organizations. together we work to ensure everyone has access to what's needed for a brighter future.
we focus on sharing valuable second-hand resources, such as office supplies, furniture, educational materials, and even surplus healthcare and hospital equipment. our goal is to prevent waste and create positive change.
our vision
imagine a world where the digital divide disappears. in this world, everyone, no matter where they're from or what they have, is able to have access to the technology they need to improve their lives through applying better tools for the job.
with your help, we turn this vision into reality. donations become bridges, your gifts are applied toward education, healthcare and nonprofit endeavors where they empower individuals, uplift communities, and inspire a brighter future.
every contribution, no matter how small, has the potential to creates positive, lasting change. together we're building a better equipped and more connected world.
server status
at present, we had to  

close our server down, but our mission remains wide open, waiting for the support it needs to flourish. our huge user database is safe, temporarily at rest, while we're burdened by the absence of financial and technical backing.
keep reading to learn more about this remarkable idea that through the years and around the world has touched millions of lives and transformed the landscape of a nation.  recycles.org deserves to continue, but without your help, mr. dibella will need to perform a miracle.
who we serve
recycles.org is here to serve a diverse range of individuals and organizations, including schools, churches, learning, activity and health centers, teachers, counselors, technicians, doctors, nurses and community leaders. we all share a common goal: to make the most of available office, school and medical equipment, preventing it from ending up in landfills or sitting idle in warehouses, and instead putting it back into service where it can have the most impact.
why donations matter
when a donor gives something to someone who asks for it and genuinely needs it, rather than simply discarding it, the gift takes on a new level of appreciation and utility. our mission is to minimize the unnecessary disposal of good, usable technology and materials. through our expanding network of nonprofit participants, we provide a secure and confidential avenue for donors to contribute sensibly and discreetly to worthy causes.
diverse donor motivations
people donate for various reasons. some want to ensure their gift goes to a cause they identify with, while others seek tax deductions, and some simply want to perform acts of generosity. our unique and innovative service caters to these diverse motivations and plays a crucial role in supporting growing nonprofits, as well as promoting sustainability.
getting started is easy
we've made it incredibly straightforward for you to get involved. there's no need to create an account, remember a password, or jump through hoops. you can offer to donate any usable items a nonprofit organization might need through a single, hassle-free form. your offer remains just that â an offer to donateâ until you decide to engage with a requesting organization of your choice.
what sets us apart

proven process: our specialized-niche exchange process has a track record of success. we carefully monitor donation offers and initial requests while screening nonprofit participants. we also consider options for pick-up, shipping, and tax-exempt status.

community building: we serve as a valuable asset to many isolated communities, particularly those with access to larger metropolitan areas within driving distance. we provide guided assistance in building philanthropic bridges, offering an avenue for directed giving which in turn supports long-term community development.

your role in the process

arrangements for giving: you are responsible for making all arrangements related to your donation. we aim to facilitate a seamless network experience, but the actual connections and transactions are your responsibility.

vigilance against abuse: we actively monitor the network for abuse and take action against abusive users. however, it is your duty to ensure the legitimacy of the nonprofit organization you choose as the recipient of your gift. report any suspicious activity to us and consult with licensed professionals when necessary.

offer anything you can
feel free to offer anything you believe a growing nonprofit organization might need. your offer remains anonymous until you choose to respond to a requesting participant. this anonymity allows you to explore a list of pre-screened nonprofit applicants who have specifically requested your gift, with your identity only revealed when you initiate contact. remember, you are never obligated to act upon any single request you receive for any offer you make.
at recycles.org, we believe that together, we can make a significant difference in ensuring that unused yet valuable resources are put to good use. join our network today and become part of a community dedicated to meaningful and sustainable resource allocation.

about us
connecting goodwill worldwide
once upon a time, during the very early days of the internet, there was an idea rooted in the heart of one kind-hearted early adopter. this idea believed in the power of giving and the importance of reusing what we have. it was a simple thought: "what if we could connect those who have something to share with those who need it most?"

this simple idea sparked the birth of recycles.org, a place where generosity knows no bounds. it all began with a vision to make a positive change in the world, one small act of kindness at a time. recycles.org wanted to ensure that usable items didn't end up in landfills, but instead found their way to people and organizations that could put them to good use.

over the years, recycles.org grew and evolved into something more significant â the nonprofit recycling and reuse network (nrrn). it wasn't just about recycling; it was about reusing, sharing, and connecting. nrrn became a bridge, linking donors with nonprofit recipients, schools, churches, teachers, and community leaders.

nrrn's mission was clear: to help schools, churches, and nonprofits access the resources they needed to fulfill their noble missions. it believed in the power of good, used technology to transform lives and communities. nrrn was there for those who had a heart for reusing school, office, and laboratory technology to make a difference.

what made nrrn special was its simplicity. no complex logins or passwords were required. anyone with a desire to give could easily offer their help. donors remained anonymous until they chose to connect with a nonprofit in need. it was all about making the giving process smooth and hassle-free.

nrrn understood the importance of trust, so it carefully screened nonprofit participants to ensure they were genuine and aligned with the spirit of giving. it promoted responsible giving and responsible receiving, fostering a sense of integrity and honesty in every exchange.

today, nrrn stands as a symbol of hope and goodwill, connecting people from all walks of life. it's a global network, transcending boundaries and cultures, because kindness knows no borders. it's a place where children and adults, everyday individuals, and community leaders come together to make the world a better place.

whether you're a student, a stay-at-home mom, a business owner, or a community leader, nrrn welcomes you to join this global family of givers. together, we can continue to share, connect, and make a positive impact on our world, one act of generosity at a time.

join us, and let's spread the joy of giving far and wide, for we believe that when we give, the world becomes a better place for all.
