ðŸŽ‰ celebrating 50 years in business! ðŸŽ‰

    november 1st, 2024 marks the 50th anniversary of our company's founding.   and, on that day, our first sales were a 1961 porsche 356b coupe with sunroof, a 1961 austin cooper 997, and a 1959 morgan plus 4 four seater.
    
    now, after a half century, we enjoyed forty years of vintage and historic racing at venues from the bahamas to tremblant in quebec, meadowbrook in detroit to bryar in new hampshire.   and car shows all over the northeast (with, as recently as june this year, a first place ribbon at the greenwich concours).  needless to say, we have had a lot of fun.
    
    we have sold cars all over the world and typically have fifty to sixty in inventory.   all under our company motto 'don't buy a classic cars you can't push yourself.'   and if there is a second motto, it would certainly be 'in owning an older british sports car, you must always maintain a sense of humor.'   because, in the end, it is all about enjoying cars beyond mere transportation but as pure enjoyment.   or, to quote cunard, the great british shipping line's 1930s print ads with a waspy couple leaning on the rail of a fine steamship, 'getting there is half the fun.'
