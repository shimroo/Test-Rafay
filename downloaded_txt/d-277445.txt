featured listing
range road north tract
117± acres, granville county, nc |  $1,487,500
117 acre farm located just outside of stem in granville county, nc. first time on the market, this farm has been in the same family for almost 50 years. it is hard to find a farm that offers so many different features, but this property has it all. the farm is located in southwestern granville county, with easy commute to durham and the triangle (less than 10 minutes to i85). it has extensive road frontage (over 2,800 feet), good percable soils, 1 pond, 12 acres of fields, creeks, mature and growing timber.  the topography is flat with some rolling hills on the southern end of the property. 

considering the location, soils and road frontage, this farm also has a lot of residential development potential. or it would be an excellent estate property for someone that wants a large amount of acreage for hunting/recreation, but still easy commute to the triangle. 

the farm has been managed for timber production and contains two excellent stands of timber. the first stand contains 26 acres of 21-year old loblolly pine that has been thinned once and will be ready for second thinning in 2-4 years. the second stand is 70 acres and is located on the southern end of the property. it contains a mature stand of hardwood timber that can be harvested immediately for income.  the farm is under present use value for forestry, which provides the owners with reduced property taxes. this program can be assumed by a new owner to continue to save on property taxes.
