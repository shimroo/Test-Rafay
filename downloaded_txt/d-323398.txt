welcome to africa's travel indaba 2025
            

                shaping africa’s tomorrow, through connection today!
            

                africa’s travel indaba is an iconic african leisure trade show, owned by south african tourism, with the specific objective of creating market access for our vast array of african leisure tourism products. 
            

                africa’s travel indaba is a 3-day trade show preceded by a dedicated business opportunity networking day (bonday) which seeks to create a platform for thought-leadership, knowledge sharing and obtaining the latest in global trends and local insights. the bonday programme is developed in close collaboration with the global tourism organisations, continental experts as well as industry associations. 
            

                the trade show exists to provide the ideal platform for african tourism exhibitors to showcase their offerings to international and local buyers, destination marketing companies and leisure tourism services partners. it is the most formidable platform on the continent for you to meet face-to-face with the most influential buyers in the world, and to gain access to africa’s excellence and its endless possibilities. these are the business opportunities and quality connections that will shape africa’s tomorrow. 
            

                the trade show takes place in the host province of kwazulu–natal, synonymous with its warm and inviting coastline and friendly beaches, safari parks, rolling green hills and its vast sugar cane and banana plantations. 
            

                it also has a rich history and its battlefields, and the nelson mandela capture site are some of its popular tourist attractions. kwazulu-natal is renowned for its two world heritage sites – the ukhahlamba drakensberg park and the greater st lucia wetland area. 
            

                the city of durban will play host to africa’s travel indaba, where delegates can look forward to vibrant spice markets, authentic zulu culture and a vibrant cityscape and nightlife, with the inkosi albert luthuli international convention centre as the world-class host venue for the show.
