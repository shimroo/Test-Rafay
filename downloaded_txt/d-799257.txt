our purpose



since niea was founded in 1969, native educators and advocates have fought to ensure native students receive an equitable and quality education that is afforded to many of their peers. from advocating for immersion programs, professional development of teachers, and increased funds for school buildings, niea has continued to be an important part of crafting policy on the state and federal level. niea membership remains the driving force behind niea’s work, passing resolutions and electing board members that guide niea mission.

 

tribal communities in schoolniea, as a licensed partner of communities in schools national, is implementing a tribal cis model in partnering schools across the country. this evidenced-based model surrounds students with culturally relevant supports and is intended to expand our reach to impact native students in public and charter schools with native populations, tribally controlled schools, and bie through integrated student supports (iss).currently, niea and maine indian education partnered to implement tcis in indian island, indian township, and sipayik schools. tcis has successfully been implemented through a pilot program funded by the dept of ed, in anadarko, oklahoma in partnership with cis of mid america.  



national educator initiative project from big cities to the most remote villages, schools across the country are developing and implementing innovative, community-based strategies for solving their teacher pipeline challenges. native schools demonstrate great potential for growth, yet rural isolation, small budgets, and low visibility on the job market hamper efforts to find new teachers and educators that will thrive in native schools. niea launched the national educator initiative to share best practices.
