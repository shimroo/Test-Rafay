if you have never owned an argentine dogo my suggestion is to stop & do as much research on the dogo argentino breed as you can. for myself i have found the argentine dogo breed to be a perfect mix of extremely loyal, super intellige nt , protective & majestic looking all in a nutshell. our argentine dogos all have lovable, protective and remarkably intelligent, magnetic personalities. most people who have adopted one of our legend dogo argentino puppies have commented that their dogo is the most intelligent personable dog that they have ever owned & we feel the same. we would not have a dog that did not posses a loving, well rounded perfectly family orienteddogo argentino pictures personality.
