our company used stone environmental for the disposal of old fluorescent light bulbs that were in 4 ft and 8ft lengths. the process was exceptionally smooth, from start to finish. boxes were shipped for the packing disposal, and when we were ready, all it took was a phone call and the boxes were picked up by the company. stone environmental has been a very professional and courteous company to work with.
