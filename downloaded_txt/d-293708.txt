      see what our customers are saying! ✰✰✰✰✰we needed to replace a split rail fence installed by another company because it was falling apart. our biggest concern (other than having a solid fence) was being able to keep our two small dogs in the yard. one is a serious escape artist and finds any opening to break through.york fence met with us and listened to our concerns. we asked about putting wire mesh behind the fence and burying it 5-6” into the ground. however, our ground is very, very rocky and we were told the cost of digging up 6” would be more than the cost for the fence. instead, they proposed putting boards along the base of the fence to keep the dogs from pushing up the wire. we could use rocks (which we have plenty of) to fill any gaps. we agreed with this approach.the crew that installed the fence went above and beyond this. after erecting the fence (which looks great) they put a new inch deep trench behind the fence and put the boards in there before nailing them to the fence posts. this solution was great - there are zero gaps and it looks great. the dogs cannot get out and are enjoying running in the yard while we don’t worry they’ll get out.highly recommended - the work exceeded our expectations, the price was fair for what was done and we can really enjoy our back yard without worrying our dogs will run away.-john h.✰✰✰✰✰we just had a deer fence installed around the perimeter of our property. this company was fantastic to work with. we made many changes in planning along the way, they were very helpful and responsive throughout the process. they arrived on the scheduled date, the installers were very polite and professional. we are very pleased with the job. highly recommend.- suzanne b.✰✰✰✰✰janet at york fence went above and beyond, she stayed on top of a very complicated project between multiple property lines. we were so grateful for these guys to be on the job. highly recommend.-michelle b.✰✰✰✰✰needed two sides of a corner lot fenced to fully enclose the backyard for dogs. two other fence companies either didn't show up for the estimate or didn't call back when scheduling. york always answered the phone and emails and was available right away for a reasonably priced estimate with exact details of work, materials and plan with measurements. they also signed and returned the part of the zoning permit form that i needed right away. the installation team was awesome. i have had many fences installed over the years in different parts of nj and this team was hands down the best. their team chief havy had such a great attention to detail and took care that everything was perfectly aligned. he often checked that we were happy along the way before proceeding with major next steps. havy was very knowledgeable and offered several suggestions that we hadn't considered regarding gate swing and how to reduce gaps due to land slope. the team also spent time at the end to wipe the entire fence down to remove any dust. overall it was a great experience and the office staff was excellent to deal with.-kyle f.✰✰✰✰✰great experience, very professional company. the quality of my fence install is excellent.-dave g.✰✰✰✰✰wish i could give ten stars. lived here for 35 years through many renovations and landscape modifications so i've dealt with a number of fence companies with varying degrees of satisfaction. pretty much one and done for them all. contacted york for suggestions last year after finding it impossible to get anybody specializing in gate openers to come and look at a malfunctioning system. that experience was so good that i had them install a fair amount of new fencing for my dogs. then i decided to replace the gate operator and they attended to that. fast forward a year and they replaced 800+ feet of existing perimeter fencing. in the time between the estimate and the installation, i suffered storm damage and a downed tree crushed some existing fencing and two gates. any other place, i'd have had to get an estimate and go to the end of the line for that repair. instead, they simply added it on to the existing job order and everything was done at one time. prompt, professional, the site was left immaculate. javi and his crew are terrific and always kept an eye out to make sure the dogs were safe. they worked long days and were even here all day on a saturday. not the least expensive option, but you definitely get what you pay for. great communication, great customer service. a top notch company for sure.-banshee bullmastiffs✰✰✰✰✰the entire experience was great. i worked with janet, she patiently answered so many questions and helped me decide on the best fencing for me. the crew arrived on time every day, and worked all day long, for 5 days. it’s a shadow board fence, and they built it by hand, board by board. it is absolutely beautiful.i took estimates from 4 fence contractors, and this company was well ahead, in every way.-pam w.✰✰✰✰✰the york fence office staff and the on-site work crew could not be more professional and engaging. they are very nice people who do a great job. the crew was incredibly hard working and precise in their expertise. the fence is just beautiful and we couldn't be happier. i highly recommend them.-j m
