the story of



the minturn saloon



the railroad and mining town of minturn dates back to the 1880s, and the minturn saloon is one of the oldest structures in town built in 1901. this building was part of the recovery effort after a fire in the downtown commercial section of minturn in the 1890s. the building has always housed a restaurant and bar, as well as serving as a pool, boxing hall and gambling joint at one point or another.
