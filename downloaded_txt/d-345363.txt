welcome to the classic!the classic cafe at roanoke serves globally-inspired menu items, prepared with farm-quality ingredients by a creative and collaborative kitchen team. our menu of fresh seafood, premium steaks, and pastas includes items that follow the seasons, as fruits and vegetables ripen in our on-site garden. we offer a full bar, craft cocktails, and a wine list carefully selected to complement the menu. live classical guitar can be heard in the bar on friday and saturday nights.

we opened the classic in may of 1993 with a desire to serve a world-class menu in a casual, relaxed setting, and to build a community around great food in the heart of old town roanoke, texas. we’re incredibly grateful to have served the roanoke, trophy club, westlake, keller, northlake, argyle, southlake and flower mound communities (and beyond!) for more than 30 years. in addition to dine-in, our food is available online for curbside pick-up and local delivery.
