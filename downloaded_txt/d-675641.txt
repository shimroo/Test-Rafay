testimonials





















“dennis personally took care of all of the logistics regarding the band/av management and worked directly with our venue and wedding planner. the band (kings county) was amazing and we highly recommend, as well as the violinist jaquay pearce. they played all the classic hits we wanted to hear, and some modern music. dennis is a relationships guy and will certainly take care of his clients.”






















“in my line of work i help facilitate a variety of high profile events that require top of the line entertainment of all sorts. dennis bailey management has proven to be an excellent partner in this regard; always providing the best entertainment available and delivering the experience in the most professional manner possible. i highly recommend their services and will continue to call on them when i need the very best of the best.” - joel lisi / senior programs manager / straz center for the performing arts






















“thank you to dennis and all of the bands for coming out to waterset for our concerts for a cause! everyone enjoyed the music and outdoor concerts so much, and the donations for the local food back were incredible! win, win for all! we always love working with d. bailey management!!!” - waterset fl






















“we've been working with dennis bailey management company for years for our community events and every time it's been a pleasure. dennis makes the process so easy and is great with communicating to make sure i know when everything will be set up and who i'll be working with. he follows up and personally calls to see how everything went and if anything can make it better for next time. i would definitely suggest using dennis bailey management for your musical entertainment needs!” - bexley by newland






















“dennis & his team made our halloween party a huge success! raydio band did not disappoint, neither did the beautiful dancers. this is the 3rd time we have used d bailey management to provide entertainment for both company and private functions! we'll be sure to give dennis a call for our next corporate event. thank you!!” - kim hauser






















“frequency is an incredible band. we have used them for two large parties and they have been such a crowd pleaser. everyone was on the dance floor having a great time. after their last song, the entire dance floor chanted “one more song”. we hope to use this band for other events in the future. thank you for making our parties so much fun!” s. ennis - tampa






















“we want to thank dennis bailey and frequency band for an amazing performance at our wedding reception. dennis was a pleasure to work with from the initial booking through confirming the final arrangements. and the band? all we can say is wow! they absolutely killed it and they nailed the songs we asked them to learn! we received so many compliments from our guests and the staff at our venue. the general sentiment was ‘best wedding band ever!’ we agree!” - bob & nancy everin






















“they played every song so so so well, everyone loved them! the singer even danced with my husband's great aunt, which totally made her night! i highly recommend this band & agent, you will not be disappointed.” - kelsey h. bride






















“when i started planning, i couldn't imagine using anyone else! very talented and great at getting the crowd dancing. our young nieces and nephews were dancing right alongside grandparents, and everyone in between! the lead singer was someone new from when my sister booked them, which made me a bit nervous, but wow, she was unbelievable! the price is obviously high compared to a dj, but for us, we decided it was one thing we wanted to splurge on. i think it was well worth it!” - barbara c.

“frequency was our wedding band--and to put it lightly, they absolutely crushed it! all of our guests were commenting that they never been to a wedding before where everyone got up and danced before dinner even started. the band had everyone on their feet all night long. even better, my husband and i's first dance song was a little unconventional, and frequency learned it and performed it live for us. it was incredibly special.” - courtney c., bride

“my husband is a musician who has worked with d. bailey for awhile now and we have always had a great experience. communication is organized, venues are quality, and we receive payments on time. those qualities are not always easy to come by in this industry. we love working with dennis and associates!” - sarah
