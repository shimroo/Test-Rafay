welcomenorth point ministries, inc., was founded in 1995 with the vision of creating churches that unchurched people love. since its inception, npm has grown from one church to eight in metro atlanta and has developed a global network of more than 150 partner churches.each week, more than 50,000 people attend services in person or online at our atlanta-area churches. each month, sermons and leadership messages are accessed over one million times via our websites.though our methods have evolved over the years, the mission has always been to inspire people to follow jesus. it's what we do, whether at our atlanta-area churches, at our partner churches around the world, or through our many online and broadcast offerings. along the way, we’re committed to equipping other church leaders that want to create churches unchurched people would love by passing on what we've learned.
