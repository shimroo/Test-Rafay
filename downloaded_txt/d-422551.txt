tony natsoulas is a distinguished artist, known for his awe-inspiring large-scale figurative ceramic sculptures. after completing his masters of fine arts degree in 1985, natsoulas has devoted his life to creating stunning pieces of art that capture the imagination of all who behold them.
his love for art began during his undergraduate studies at the university of california, davis, where he had the great fortune of studying under robert arneson, a world-renowned funk art professor. arneson’s unique approach to ceramics influenced natsoulas in countless ways, leading him to develop his signature style, which blends realistic figurative sculpture with a touch of humor and playfulness.
natsoulas’ works have been featured in galleries and are part of permanent collections in over 16 museums worldwide. his talent is recognized even by prestigious institutions such as the san francisco museum of modern art, who recently acquired a large piece of his work. he has received numerous awards and honors throughout his career, including being named by the smithsonian as one of the top 100 craft artists in the united states in 2004.
apart from his success as a sculptor, natsoulas has also undertaken several commissioned works for both public and private clients. he has worked with a variety of materials such as bronze, fiberglass, and ceramics, all while maintaining a studio in sacramento, ca.

the sculpture i made of sister rosetta tharpe was acquired by the san francisco museum of modern art for their permanent collection after they came to see my show at the sanchez art center in pacifica.
i would also like to share why i chose to use sister rosetta tharpe as my subject in my latest series of works. she was a gospel singer in the 1930-1960s who melded rock and roll music with gospel.
among the artists she influenced were:
elvis presley,
carl perkins,
jerry lee lewis,
and johnny cash.
when selecting a person i want to sculpt, i look for underrepresented, dynamic, and socially relevant people who inspire me. research such as reading biographies, watching videos of interviews and performances, and in this case listening to music. i use the material i gather to bring metaphors and symbols relevant to each portrait made. in sister rosetta tharpe i was drawn to her dynamic personality and incredible life. she was one of the first musicians to use a tour bus for herself, the backup singer, and the band. at that time black people were not allowed to stay in some hotels in the south, and having the bus solved that problem. this sculpture was challenging to make because of all of the elements of her life i wanted to include in the piece.
