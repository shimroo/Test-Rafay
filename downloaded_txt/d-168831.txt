las vegas is a global leader in water conservation
the las vegas valley gets about 90 percent of its water from the colorado river, which is facing the worst drought in the river basin's recorded history.
thanks to the adoption of innovative programs and water conservation measures, las vegas has reduced the community‚Äôs colorado river consumption and significantly reduced the impact of new development on our water supply.
with no end to the drought in sight, however, achieving further reductions in water use has taken on a new sense of urgency.
