mile marker 83 – oceanfront
two adorable, private cottages right on the atlantic ocean. located in the heart of islamorada!  this stunning property is truly a tropical paradise with a private, sandy beach and observing pier.  relax at the beach or cool down in the beachside pool.
the front home sits waterfront with 1 bedroom 1 bath upstairs, and a separate 1 bedroom 1 bath downstairs.  downstairs is great for entertaining with a pool table, wet bar, poker table and more.
the garden cottage sits back on the property with two bedrooms and one bathroom and is just a walk through the sandy garden away from the ocean front house.
the ocean front paradise is also a ‘destination/wedding location!’
$9,000/week –  call for holiday rates.
the viewing dock is just that, it is too shallow for boats so boats are prohibited. but great for light flats fishing, catch small flats fish or pitch a kayak out. we do have information on nearby marinas for dockage.
please note, the pool is heated to 88 degrees and does not have a hot tub.   the side pool is a spa with jets.
