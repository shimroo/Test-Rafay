admissions and tours


we are thrilled to know that you are considering lamar high school. we understand that the process of choosing a high school can be confusing and over whelming and you have a lot of options in here in houston.

dress code policy 


lamar's dress code policy will be enforced for the 2022-2023 school year. students are required to wear blue or white collared shirts with the lamar logo and khaki bottoms or jeans with no holes. check out the full policy below.

comments (-1)













clear bag policy


starting august 22, 2022, all students will be required to use a clear back on campus. some of you may be applauding the move, while i imagine there are others who find this to be an overreach.  i would like to provide you with the reasoning.

who can help  ? 


there are lots of moving pieces on lamar's campus. we know sometimes you do not know who can help. this list will help direct you in the right direction to getting the help you need. 

comments (-1)













neighborhood assistant principal or academic dean


lamar believes in big school opportunities and a small school feel. to make this mission possible we split our student body into neighborhoods that allow each assistant principal and academic dean to work with a small group of students. to find out who your student's assistant principal and academic dean are please check the list.

new learning management system : canvas


hisd is implementing a new learning management system (lms) to replace the hub this school year with canvas. canvas will be used across the district to help students learn and grow.  with any changes, we know there can be stress about learning a new tool. we have put together some helpful tip videos to ease the transition.
