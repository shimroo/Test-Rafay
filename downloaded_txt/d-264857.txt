grants of dalvey is a family owned company in the highlands of scotland.
established in 1879 as a bagpipe manufacturer, dalvey has transitioned into highly polished engravable stainless steel gentleman's gifts.
since early 2005, dalvey's quality has fallen but we inspect every item prior to shipping.
