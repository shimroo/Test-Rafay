exmoor national park is situated in the counties of devon and somerset in south west england.  the park contains a variety of magnificent landscapes. although it is one of the smaller national parks the central plateau of open moorland is remote and spacious.  to the north the moorland terminates in towering cliffs above the bristol channel.  rocky headlands, steep wooded ravines, plunging waterfalls and jumbled heaps of fallen rock make this an area of outstanding scenic beauty; it is defined as a heritage coast. don't miss snowdrop valley in february. exmoor information.

 






east devon is a mixture of open countryside - heatland and farmland and a number a well known seaside resorts. exmouth is a moderately sized resort, sidmouth is a regency town which manages to retain the charm and character of years gone by, beer is a pretty seaside village built around a smalll cove.
              there is also budleigh salteron, seaton and lyme regis on the dorset border. inland is honiton and axminster, which lies in the beautiful countryside of the axe valley, a designated area of outstanding natural beauty, amidst rivers, streams, hills, farmland and pretty villages.
 




mid devon there's only one way to describe devonshire's heartland: the focal point of a whole new holiday experience! by using one of the peaceful towns and villages as a base, you can enjoy the best of both worlds, exploring the area's beautiful hills and valleys, or stretching your wings to visit exmoor and dartmoor national parks, or the ever popular north and south devon coasts.no matter what time of year you visit lovely devonshire's heartland, and whether for a holiday or a short break, there is so much for you to enjoy.
