how to prepare your garage for epoxy flooring
by secure_admin  |  oct 20, 2023  |  epoxy floors 
epoxy flooring can transform your garage into a clean, durable, and visually appealing space. however, before you can enjoy the benefits of epoxy, you need to prepare your garage properly. whether you’re a seasoned diy enthusiast or considering hiring a professional, these preparation steps are vital to achieving a stunning and long-lasting epoxy floor.  


tips on how to prepare your garage for epoxy flooring 
so, let’s get started on your floor kings epoxy journey to a garage that’s not only beautiful but also more resistant to stains, easier to clean, and built to withstand the test of time. 
clearing the space: start with an empty canvas 
the first step in preparing your garage for epoxy flooring is to clear the space. remove all items, including vehicles, tools, and storage. this step not only makes the process easier but also prevents any damage or contamination of your belongings during the installation. consider setting up a temporary storage area to keep your garage items safe until the project is complete. 
clean thoroughly: dust and grime are your enemies 
epoxy adheres best to a clean and smooth surface, so thorough cleaning is essential. start by sweeping the entire area to remove loose dirt and dust. follow this with a pressure washer or a strong degreaser to get rid of oil and other contaminants. stubborn stains may require extra attention with a wire brush or a concrete etching solution. the goal is to create a surface that’s as clean as possible. 
repair cracks and imperfections: a smooth canvas is key 
inspect your garage floor for cracks, holes, and imperfections. these issues can affect the quality and longevity of your epoxy floor. small cracks can be filled with epoxy filler, while larger cracks may require professional attention. pay close attention to any expansion joints or control joints, as these may need special treatment to prevent epoxy from cracking in the future. 
test for moisture: avoid future headaches 
moisture can be a common issue in garages, and it can jeopardize the adhesion of your epoxy coating. to check for moisture, perform a plastic sheet test. tape a 2×2-foot plastic sheet to the floor and leave it for 24 hours. if you find condensation or moisture beneath the plastic, you’ll need to address the issue before proceeding with the epoxy. moisture mitigation coatings or sealers can help in such situations. 
consider surface profile: the right texture for adhesion 
epoxy adheres best to a slightly rough surface. to achieve this, consider the surface profile of your concrete. you can either acid etch the floor or mechanically grind it to create the desired texture. the choice between these methods depends on the condition of your floor and the recommendations of the epoxy product manufacturer. 
conclusion: tips on how to prepare your garage for epoxy flooring 
properly preparing your garage for epoxy flooring is a critical step in ensuring a successful and long-lasting result. clearing the space, thorough cleaning, repairing cracks, addressing moisture issues, and creating the right surface profile are all crucial components of the preparation process. 

 

the winter warrior’s guide to diy snow removal
by secure_admin  |  oct 16, 2023  |  snow removal 
winter is a beautiful season filled with snowflakes, hot cocoa, and cozy nights by the fire. however, it also brings its fair share of challenges, one of the biggest being the accumulation of snow and ice. while hiring a professional snow removal service is a convenient option, some of us prefer the hands-on approach of tackling the winter wonderland ourselves.  

how to remove snow on your property by yourself  
if you’re ready to embrace your inner winter warrior and take on the task of diy snow removal, this guide is for you. however, if you need help, you can always rely on a snow removal trenton michigan company.  
safety first: gear up 
before you dive headfirst into the snow, it’s crucial to ensure your safety. dress warmly in layers, including waterproof clothing, insulated gloves, and a hat to keep the cold at bay. don’t forget to wear non-slip, sturdy boots to prevent accidents on icy surfaces.  
a pair of safety goggles can protect your eyes from flying snow, and if you have one, wear a reflective vest for visibility. 
choose the right tools 
having the right tools for the job can make all the difference in diy snow removal. invest in a good quality snow shovel with an ergonomic handle to reduce strain on your back. for heavy snow or ice, consider a snow blower.  
a sturdy ice scraper or chopper is essential for breaking up ice patches, and a bag of rock salt or ice melt can help prevent further ice buildup. 
clearing technique: start early and take breaks 
when it comes to snow removal, it’s often easier to tackle smaller amounts of snow multiple times rather than waiting for a huge accumulation. start clearing snow as soon as it falls, if possible, to prevent it from becoming compacted and more challenging to remove. take regular breaks to avoid overexertion and listen to your body.  
proper shoveling technique 
to avoid straining your back or causing other injuries, it’s essential to use the proper shoveling technique. bend your knees, not your back, when lifting snow. push the snow rather than lifting it when you can, and if you need to lift, use your legs to do the heavy lifting, not your back.  
don’t overload the shovel; take smaller, manageable scoops of snow. switch your grip on the shovel handle occasionally to reduce strain on your dominant arm. 
clear walkways and driveways safely 
when clearing walkways and driveways, start from the center and work your way outward. this prevents you from having to throw snow over already cleared areas. be mindful of where you toss the snow; avoid throwing it onto roads or sidewalks where it can create hazards for pedestrians and drivers. 
conclusion: how to remove snow on your property by yourself  
embracing the role of a winter warrior in diy snow removal can be a rewarding and satisfying experience. with these tips in mind, you’ll be well-prepared to tackle the challenges of winter and enjoy the season to the fullest, one snow shovel at a time.  

 

when to resurface the driveway? 
by secure_admin  |  oct 5, 2023  |  concrete service 
it is going to be a big problem when your home’s driveway is not working the way you wanted it to be. or when you own a restaurant and you need a place to park the car of your customers but the available area is not that very smooth, then most of your clients would refuse to go there since they are going to have some problems with the tires of their cars and this can result to some problems to them. it is more attractive to a company or a business establishment to have their own space or car parks where the clients and the customers could freely park their cars and vehicles for a moment so that they would not worry where to place their personal cars. if you are living in a condo or an apartment style home, then you need to buy or pay for the rent of the space to park your car which can be a disaster to your own budget since it costs a lot of money and it is like you are wasting your own budget for it.  

remember that if you owned a place, then you might consider this aspect as most of the clients would check or see this one during their first visit and most of the people would not pay attention to this at home and this could result to something unlikely and unpleasant to their cars. try to imagine yourself driving your expensive car to a place or to a road that is having a lot of bumpy areas or path holes, then it would be very hard for you to drive and to consider this one for your own benefit. so, you need to consider the fact that there are some chances that you have to think twice about resurfacing it and this can result to a more likely and lovable feedback coming from your friends and clients.  
there are some people that they would say or make an excuse that they could not check it from time to time as they are too busy or they don’t have much time to inspect the problem. you need to remember that there are many ways to solve this one and one of them could be about hiring others to maintain it and they will be the one responsible when it comes to knowing the different signs of the cracks and the lines that may lead to serious renovations of it.  
the worst part and problem here is that potholes where you can notice it clearly due to the size and this is not a good way to keep them right there for a long time as there will be a bad impact to the cars of the clients. of course, you can always think about a company that you can trust to fix the problems right away but you need to ensure first that the problem is coming from your client’s side like they could be having heavy things inside their car.  

 

roofing issues to watch out for during winter

pre-existing damage? 
existing damage can be made worse by the cold weather this year if your?house was affected by extreme weather earlier this year and you still haven’t had a roof assessment. the constant changes?in?winter temperatures and the collection of ice or snow can lead to structural deterioration, mold growth, and leaks.?? 
tree limbs? 
huge trees offer extra property value and excellent scenery. however, these huge trees can pose some severe issues during the winter season.?with huge amounts of ice or snow, tree limbs hanging over your roof can become weak. if it breaks, it will fall down onto your roof and damage the protective top layer of your roof.?? 
falling branches can cause severe issues onto your roof. they scrape away the protective layer of the roof,?allowing?pooled water, and trap huge amounts of snow.?? 
making sure that your roof has an 11-foot radius that is clear of any branches is an excellent rule of thumb.?? 
you should go around your lawn and check trees for big branches close to the roof, hanging and snapped branches, dead limbs, and signs of decay and rot.?? 
attic condensation? 
condensation will happen whenever warm air meets a cold surface. unluckily,?the?main candidate for the formation of condensation is an attic that’s improperly insulated. this can lead to mildew and mold, which damages?your house’s interior structure. make sure that your attic is ventilated properly to avoid condensation.?? 
ventilation in the attic is a huge part of an excellent roof system. however, it is frequently neglected. though you might know that attic ventilation saves energy expenses and controls indoor temperature, you might not know that poor ventilation can damage your roof.??
