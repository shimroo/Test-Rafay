															what is spoken word?
														

spoken word is poetry explicitly written to be performed onstage, rather than read from the page. as an art form it focuses on the aesthetics of word play, intonation and voice inflection. while often associated with hip-hop culture, it also has strong ties to storytelling, modern poetry, post-modern performance, and monologue theatre, as well as jazz, blues, and folk music. it can be can be dynamic, comedic, dramatic or tragic and often contains references to current events and issues relevant to contemporary audiences. at its best spoken word is a powerful, high-energy, form of expression that attracts artists and audiences of all ages from a wide range of disciplines and socio-cultural backgrounds.






															what is a slam?
														

a poetry slam is a spoken word competition in which poets perform spoken word poetry before a live audience and a panel of judges. usually in a coffee house, bookstore, small theater or a bar ... a flypoet classic slam: literary bloodsport! a poetry slam on steroids! a no holds barred battle between 10 hand-picked slam poetry titans from all over the country spitting fire to over 1,000 raucous audience members and celebrity judges with a title, bragging rights and big money on the line!
