welcome to the rscds cambridge & district branch

 
what is scottish country dancing?
scottish country dancing is social dancing that originated in (unsurprisingly) scotland, enjoyed by all age groups. do come and join us. there is no need to bring a partner – in fact, part of the fun of an evening’s dancing is dancing with many different people!
the dances range from those contained in 18th century manuscripts and publications to modern dances that are traditional in style.
about us
we are the local association of what is now an international movement, known as the royal scottish country dance society, our main purpose being to enjoy dancing in a traditional style.
the royal scottish country dance society was founded in 1923, with the aim of ensuring the survival of scottish country dancing. there are now scottish country dancing groups all over the world, dancing in the same way, so that wherever you dance you know that you will be able to join in with the local group.

code of conduct
we love scottish dancing and music.  every dancer, of every level of experience, should feel absolutely comfortable and safe at any of our events. see our code of conduct page for more details.
