save money on the electricity bill
making the switch to renewable and alternative energy sources can save homeowners and businesses money by reducing their energy bills. depending on capacity and energy usage, these resources can cover a significant part of the household’s or operation’s electricity needs.
in greenhouses, energy is one of the top operating expenses. making the operation more energy efficient is key for reducing these costs. common strategies to improve energy efficiency in greenhouses include tightening up the house to prevent cold air from leaking in, adding a thermal screen, insulating the perimeter, and tuning the control system.
along with installing renewable energy systems, pennsylvanians can choose to use a real-time pricing rate for electricity instead of a rate that is averaged over the course of the year. real-time pricing provides the opportunity to take advantage of hourly variations in electricity and save money by buying energy at lower prices.
in this section, find information and advice on improving renewable energy efficiency and reducing electricity costs, including an online energy selector tool. additionally, learn how bioenergy can be utilized in sustainable, energy-efficient buildings.
lower heating costs
choosing to heat with renewable fuels can be a good option for homeowners and business owners looking to reduce the amount of fossil fuel they use and lower their energy costs. depending on the current heating fuel used, a considerable amount on the heating bill can be saved by switching to wood heat. property owners can make the shift towards more energy-efficient homes by replacing heating oil boilers with pellet boilers or by using a high-efficiency wood stove.
using the heating energy cost analyzer tool allows homeowners, farmers, and businesses to compare a number of different heating fuels and determine whether switching to a new source could save them money. by far, wood is among the most favored biomass fuels for combustion systems in pa.
energy cost and efficiency
for farmers classified as commercial or industrial electricity customers, the cost of electricity is not a flat fee per kwh. it is worth knowing that the load factor can influence the cost per kwh for the billing period. calculating the load factor can provide a good indication of how the electricity demand is being managed.
if the load factor is below 50%, a review of the entire operation is needed to determine the cause and improve the farm's energy efficiency. overall, farmers and landowners can save both energy and money by implementing practices such as using drip irrigation and utilizing energy-efficient equipment. join the farm energy day workshop to learn more about renewable energy solutions available to farmers and landowners.
agricultural producers interested in improving their energy use and profitability can use penn state extension’s farm energy efficiency program. in addition, farmers and landowners can benefit from extension’s wide array of resources and obtain valuable information on choosing high-efficiency farm lighting, improving energy use in horticultural operations, and applying energy conservation measures on dairy farms.   narrow by narrow by:  education format  author / instructor         view as list grid   items 1-25 of 65  view  10 25 50 100 sort by: date posted  position product name sku price date posted start date  set ascending direction              webinars     free    c-change: grass2gas corn belt watershed case study when watch now length 1 hour recorded jan 15, 2025 event format on-demand | recorded  learn how grass2gas links ecosystem services with renewable natural gas to cut farm pollution and boost sustainability.           news  heating fuel prices looking steady so far date posted 12/19/2024  winter heating update for pennsylvania, 2024 - 2025.           webinars         c-change: stakeholder insights on the digester value chain length 1 hour  explore collaboration in the digester value chain with c-change. learn how stakeholders can drive progress and uncover new opportunities.           news  home heating assistance program opens november 4th date posted 10/30/2024  pennsylvanians who struggle with home heating bills can now apply for the low-income home energy assistance program (liheap).           news  applications for agriculture innovation grant now open date posted 10/16/2024  the agricultural innovation grant is a $10 million investment in pennsylvania's agricultural industry.           news  home energy tax credits date posted 10/3/2024  if you have made or plan on making energy efficiency improvements to your home, tax credits are available for a portion of qualifying expenses.           articles  virtual power plants explained by matthew svetz  virtual power plants (vpp) are an innovative idea that seeks to make our electric grid more efficient and resilient.           news  pennsylvania home energy rebate input sessions date posted 10/2/2024  the pennsylvania department of environmental protection (dep) wants to hear from you about our pa home energy rebate programs.           webinars     free    anaerobic digester tour when watch now length 1 hour recorded jul 24, 2024 event format on-demand | recorded  join our c-change virtual digester tour! learn how to turn farm waste into energy, explore machinery, and join a q&a on anaerobic digestion. ideal for farmers, developers, and energy professionals.           articles  using your wood stove efficiently and effectively by daniel ciolkosz, p.e.  wood stove efficiency: using a high-efficiency stove, using dry wood, keeping the fire hot, and not starving the fire.           tools and apps  tractor engine block heater timer calculator by gary musgrave  use this tool to estimate energy and cost savings from installing an engine heater timer for your tractor.           articles  real-time pricing for electricity  real-time pricing for electricity: why it matters, how and when prices vary, purchasing when prices are low, and knowing prices and controlling load.           articles  green buildings and bioenergy by daniel ciolkosz, p.e., michael jacobson, ph.d.  what are green buildings and bioenergy; and how can bioenergy can work in green buildings.           tools and apps  field operations energy calculator by gary musgrave  use this calculator tool to estimate energy use from various field operations for a farm.           tools and apps  dairy vacuum pump vsd energy calculator by gary musgrave  calculate the energy savings from adding a variable speed drive (vsd) to a milking system           tools and apps  barn ventilation energy calculator by gary musgrave  estimate energy savings from efficient barn ventilation           articles  an introduction to biomass heating by daniel ciolkosz, p.e.  combustion process, fuel choices, equipment, obtaining biomass fuels, and emissions and pollution.           articles  exploring small modular reactors: the future of clean energy?
