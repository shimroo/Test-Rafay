everything she has accomplished at penn."

"i had the pleasure of working with sez closely for many years as she was our creative director and i was the primary ops stakeholder. sez always impressed me with her desire to thoroughly understand the operational needs of the business. her constant insight and recommendations greatly improved both our online customer experience and our general site navigation.



sez is a pleasure to work with and a great person to collaborate with to flush out new-business ideas and direction. it was not uncommon for our top business stakeholders to get input from sez before making critical decisions about the direction of the business.



i would strongly recommend sez to any organization that is looking for the highest level of creativity and design. in my experiences her work-product is of the highest caliber, and i would jump at the chance to have sez be the creative force behind any web property i am associated with."

"i had the honor of working with sez closely for almost 10 years. she is a very talented web and print designer and her css & javascript skills are impressive as well. after working with her to create literally hundreds (if not thousands) of content pages and portals over the years, i can honestly say it would be very difficult to find someone with her creative talents combined with such an impressive work ethic and the high standards she ensures her work lives up to." -- shawn tyler
