read the 2024 rise report



rise was an un-conference that gathered 70 members of the svn community across three different venues in oakland, california, from may 28 – june 1, 2024. this report serves as an initial overview of what arose over those three days. our gathering was marked by deep reflection, rigorous inquiry, and expansive imagination. the insights and proposals that emerged are currently being prepared for a more detailed follow-up survey. this forthcoming survey will soon be shared across our wider network, inviting your invaluable feedback.
