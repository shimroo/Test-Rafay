                           appellation america has entered its second decade on the web. much has changed since the start, but the core focus remains characterizing the unique flavor profiles of north america’s appellations and the natural influences and human cultural forces which influence them.  we understand that through objective evaluation of wines of these appellations, finding the recurring characteristics that typify such place is primary.

                           the wine regions of virginia have taken a large chunck of center stage in the eastern united states as grape varieties focus more to red bordeaux selections with sangiovese and tannat in tow.  hightened attention in winery is bringing the most out of these plantings and these wines are gaining much acclaim.  cast in a more european style, finesse over raw power prevails.

q: what is an appellation?

an appellation is a winegrowing region with officially recognized boundaries.  
			appellation designations are required on wine labels to identify the origin of the grapes used in making the wine.  
			vineyard locations rather than winery locations determine appellation.
			because in north america we are in the process of defining our growing areas, there are two classes of appellations.  
			political boundaries (states, provinces and counties) are still used for some, but increasingly, appellations defined by geographic boundaries based on topography, climate and soil types are receiving government approval. 
			these geographically based appellations are known as american viticultural areas (avas) in the u.s. and designated viticultural areas (dvas) in canada.

q: where are the appellations?

counting all classes of appellations there are 324 officially recognized wine growing regions in north america.  presently, in the u.s. there are 202 avas spread across 26 states, and 21 dvas in canada.
