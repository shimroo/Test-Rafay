about wild dunedin



wild dunedin - nz festival of nature has very deep roots in dunedin, the wildlife capital of aotearoa. we work with local community groups, businesses, conservationists and nature lovers to share the magnificent wildlife and wild places of our city, and we showcase the work of those who are planting native species, eradicating introduced mammalian predators, and helping populations of native animals of all kinds to flourish.
