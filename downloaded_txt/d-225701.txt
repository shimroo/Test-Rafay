out damned spot





ink and leather!  they do not mix.  i have been fairly lucky.  i have had only one pen to actually explode in a purse and stain the leather.  luckily the ink was on the purse bottom and was barely visible.  i just pretended it was not there.  the thing i have had issue with are the gel pens i use.  from time to time i have accidently marked the front or side of my bags while carrying the pen. 

so far i have had no solution to getting these marks out.  the only thing to change it is to try a gel marker the same color of the purse and try to go over the mark...kind of like painting over it.  i've marked about 3 bags.  two were coach bags!  dang!!!! double dang!!  one was a black gel line on a tan suede coach bag and the other mark was a black gel like on a white leather coach bag!  i was so mad at me!  

if you have any good solutions to getting ink off leather please let me know!  i am looking for solutions!  thanks!

clark thongs





it's summer and finally my ugg flip-flops are just about done.   i have been wearing them for the past 5 years. they lasted a very long time.  i contribute that to the ugg brand and all the leather and wool on them.  when i bought them, they were one of the most comfortable casual shoes i had for summer.  whatever support there was in them, it is gone now.  after i wear them for about 30 minutes my feet begin to hurt.  they still look very good!  they just don't feel good.  i still have them for short jaunts back and forth to the kitchen but i did get some new ones for long time walking.  

i was at my local discount shoe store and found a pair by clarks that i love.  it was surprising because i have bought 2 pairs of clarks in the past and they and my feet do not get along.  they are hard and not comfortable.  after looking at various pairs of sandals i tried them on a whim.  they were like heaven on my feet.  the prior two pairs were semi dress shoes for work. 

i'm in love.  these are comfortable and even have a little flair.  they re actually just a little dressy! i'm set for summer now!  well....can a woman ever be set with shoes?  no!  let's just say i'm set with summer casual shoes.....for now!

bobbi kristina brown:  dead at 22





the news is just now starting to circulate.  bobbi kristina brown has passed away.  she was gone long ago.  just her body remained.  i know she will be at peace now. she is with her mother.  i never really liked bobby brown or whitney houston.  they were just too ghetto for me, regardless of their singing talent.  it has been a very sad sequence of events for that entire family.  i hope that bobby brown will get himself and keep himself together.

my summer shoes!





i was in belk recently and they were having a sale!  what could be better?  i found these by kenneth cole reaction.  i love them. love the cork heel and...and...the foam layer on the cork.  it makes for extra cushion and comfort.  since i am having some sort of foot pain now, these are a dream.  i have not been able to wear my skinny heeled shoes for a few months now, so i have been buying wedges and some flats until the issue is resolved.  

normally these were $69.  i got them for $21 last weekend.  score! another attractive feature is the bling on the top.  these dress up any casual summer dress.  i have worn then to work and church. they are great.  check the out!  you might want to get a pair too!

late on the reebok recall






i was looking up this shoe on line because i have a pair.  i got them about 2 years ago fro t j maxx.  i thought they were great except for one thing...they seemed a little off balance due to the high cushion on the bottom.  i thought it was just me not having ever worn a shoe like this before.  it is the reebok simplytone.  it is the one that was part of the recall and class action suit back in 2009. after finding this out i was shocked.  all claims were paid out by 2011 and reebok had to pay millions.  i totally missed out on this.  the thing i wonder most is why was this shoe still being sold after the class action?  i know that the discount outlet stores like marshalls and tj maxx sell things that are past season.  i guess these were sitting around in their wharehouse after the lawsuit was over.  

 

the shoes have been okay.  i have adjusted to the feeling the high cushion on the sole gives.  i have found my balance.  i was having some sore leg and foot issues about 5 months ago and they were the most comfortable shoe i have that is soft an cushy.  they felt the best when i wore shoes.  now i am not sure what to do with them.

 

the class action says the shoes are not made properly and actually cause knee and hip issues. i wear them so infrequently that i had not noticed any issues with mine.  i guess i will keep them but  i will be looking for  a new pair of athletic shoes in the next two weeks. you just never know! i paid $40 for these shoes.  if i had know i could have gotten a voucher for  new pair of reeboks.

ready for the beach!









last year i only made it to the beach once the entire year.  i live on the coast so that is just ridiculous.  we have beautiful beaches all around.  my intent this year is to do better.  i only took a staycation last year and i really did not do anything.  i plan to go to the water as many weekends as i can.  i love the beach and our beaches here are beautiful. my favorites are sullivan's island, folly beach and kiawah.  

i always feel renewed when i can go to the ocean.  the roar of the waves just take me to another place.  timeless.  the ebb and flow are mesmerizing. this picture is of folly beach, taken a few weeks ago in february. this year i may not have the funds for a big trip, but i will still put on my traveling shoes and head to the beach.

irish drinking toast

when we drink, we get drunk.
when we get drunk, we fall asleep.
when we fall asleep, we commit no sin.
when we commit no sin, we go to heaven.
so, let's all get drunk, and go to heaven!


irish blessing

may you always have work for your hands to do.
may your pockets hold always a coin or two.
may the sun shine bright on your windowpane.
may the rainbow be certain to follow each rain.
may the hand of a friend always be near you.
and may god fill your heart with gladness to cheer
you.



irish curse

may those who love us love us.
and those that don't love us,
may god turn their hearts.
and if he doesn't turn their hearts,
may he turn their ankles,
so we'll know them by their limping.

madonna and tupac?  who knew?





 why is it the world is just finding out that madonna and tupac dated? what kind of hell shoes are those?  why are we all just finding this out now?  and now there are news briefs from rosie perez that she was the one who set them up!  

in the world of music where all eyes have been on madonna and tupac, it seems impossible that their relationship was a secret for all of this time!  i see that since madonna was on the howard stern show that all sorts of pictures of the two of them from way back then are now finding their way to the web.  gosh. this one is with my main man sting! love him.  

i have always loved madonna's music but i never listened to any of tupacs' music when he was alive.  or even after he died.  now, here in 2015 i am about to jump on the tupac train and go back and listen to his music.  i need to see what the world saw in him  because clearly i missed out on  his era.

careful what you wish for





 i bought the lovely bag back in december.  actually i saw it in tj maxx and debated for three weeks before putting it on layaway.  i was in love.  it had all things i liked.  it was black, roomy and i loved the fur.  real!  i had researched the brand, aqua madonna and liked what i saw so, i decided to get it.  

weeks later i was thrilled to get out of  layaway.  it was $129.00.  i got it home and wrapped it and put it under the tree for  christmas. a gift from me to me.  well, early january i swapped out my purses and voila!  i was using my new purse.  i just know i looked just like all those skinny girls on pinterest carrying the big tote with the leggings, boots and slouchy sweaters on .  you couldn't tell me nothing.  i took it to work and it looked beautiful on my purse hook at my desk.





what is it about that purse? that thing is damned heavy.  it is all leather trim. suede inside and covered with fur.  it is extremely heavy just like lugging around a side of a cow on your arm.  omg!  it is so frigging heavy.  it is the heaviest purse i have ever had.  my daughter was even telling me i needed to take it back, it was so heavy.  i wish i had listened to her.  the time to make a christmas return is long past and i have a purse that is as heavy as the side of a cow to carry around.

at least it is still pretty!
