                                       even when physical classes were not available due to the unprecedented coronavirus outbreak, my stamina and strength continued to improve as a result of daily online classes. ultimately i can say i am more than glad that i returned, not only because i can clearly self-identify an increase in confidence, discipline, perseverance, fighting spirit, and physical abilities in myself, but also because i have reconnected with a community which uplifts and pushes me to be my best.

                                       during the covid lockdown, the online training sessions have been an answer to doldrums and inactivity. after each session, he is ready for dinner with a smile. thank you for taking our boy and giving him skills and character traits that will last a lifetime.

                                       my sons and i studied taekwondo here. we enjoyed and appreciated the “family” environment at excel. the owners and the instructors are all very friendly and professional. they work with their students as individuals and strive to bring out each person’s strengths within their practice. i highly recommend excel to anyone looking for an excellent taekwondo school.

                                       my son has been dramatically influenced by his experience here. after only 9 months he has improved in discipline, focus, and respect in every aspect of his young life. i could choose anywhere to bring my kid, but the community in this center is beyond what i thought i was signing up for. this place isn’t about fighting; its about community, family, focus, education, and discipline. god bless the work you do.
