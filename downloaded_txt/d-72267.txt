the international standard
    for tar and particle measurement in biomass producergas








welcome 

welcome to the home of tarweb.net. this web-site is designed and constructed for all end-users,
suppliers and developers of biomass gasification technologies to present the development and
to stimulate the use of a standard method for the measurement of organic contaminants (tars)
in biomass producer gases.


project information is provided and project
results are presented to be actively
discussed by you. please don't hesitate to send us your comments.

technical experts are highly welcomed to join the tar activities! experts on bio-energy, 
gas cleaning and/or tar measurement can contribute in the project. 
more information can be found here


the following results can be downloaded from here:
 - a draft version of the standard 
 - the final version of a background document (technical report) 
 - the final version of a document called "rationale for setup of impinger train" 



in case you or your organisation performs tar
measurements in line with the standard method we would be very happy to
receive your experiences and /or comments. for this you can sent your
experiences to vanderdrift (at) ecn.nl.
