hibernation? hiatus? holiday?

we at my sunshine coast are taking a break. hibernation? hiatus? holiday? more like long service leave maybe? üòâ
like many small businesses across the nation, covid-19 really took a toll, the last year has been rather difficult both personally and professionally. as many of you know, we are a family organisation and don‚Äôt run my sunshine coast as a profit-making entity. with less staff in 2020 and the need to attend to other business concerns, has made keeping content up to date difficult which of course results in extra stress on our lives as well.
we say ‚Äúhibernation‚Äù as we have proudly been helping many community groups with their events and news on the sunshine coast since 2002, we are not going to shut down the site completely, as in the not-too-distant future when life settles down a bit and our family is in a better place to cope with the extra unpaid work, we are looking forward to taking up the reins again.
we will keep all of our social media live, in case something big happens and of course we all enjoy kylie‚Äôs lovely sunrise photos to get our days started. in the meantime, thanks to all who have supported us over the years, and we will be emailing & chatting with you again soon üòé
regards,
noely, stephen, caitlin & pat
