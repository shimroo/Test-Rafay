join a bible studymost of our bible studies meet during the “sunday school” hour each sunday at 9:00am. choose the class that best fits your age or stage of life,  and plug into fellowship with other believers who want to study the bible together. we have a nursery and children’s classes so bring the kids with you!












sunday evening table talktable talk takes place every sunday night at 5:00pm in the commons. it’s an opportunity to combine both large and small group discussion, as well as discuss key takeaways from the morning message with the rest of church. don’t miss this encouraging time to hear what god is teaching other members of kwbc, and to dive deeper than what can be relayed in a single sermon. bring your bible and your notes from the morning message!












kirby kidsour preschool and kids ministry exists to show children the love of jesus and how they can live for him. while creating a secure and fun atmosphere, we teach your children principles found in the bible by explaining those truths on a level they can understand and apply to their life. we provide nursery and kids programs during all of our weekly church gathering times.












youth groupour student ministry meets every wednesday at 6:15pm in the w311). during this time our students will study a book of the bible together, worship, and have fun playing games. our students also have many special events throughout the year where they’ll get to spend extra time getting to know each out and serving together.
