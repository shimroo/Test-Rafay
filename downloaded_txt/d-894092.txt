 the lily auction vision




 our daylily sellers






















welcome all daylily and garden lovers
our mission since 1995 is to bring buyers and sellers together in a friendly forum where everyone can 
		interact while benefitting from the cutting-edge work of dedicated daylily hybridizers. we have a growing membership 
		of over 14,000 friendly folks and, unlike buying and selling on social media sites, the lily auction keeps an easily 
		accessed and well organized record of your sales, which can be searched and sorted in various ways. we encourage sellers 
		to add their seller items link, which can be copied from their mylilys page, and pasted into their social media page. in 
		this way both buyers and sellers can avoid unorganized 'chaos' buying and selling while still enjoying the benefits of 
		social media.
we continue to grow as new member registrations are added every day and the site is continually upgraded according 
		to member feedback and needs.
please read our user agreement. 
		use the links in the left hand column to view our organized lists of daylilies and other garden plants. use the top 
		and/or bottom menus to explore the many features of the site. you may register or log in, using the link buttons at 
		the top of the pages.
