tradition, innovation, and culture



vermont folklife’s mission is to deepen our understanding of each other by engaging with communities across the state to document and share everyday expressions of tradition, innovation, and culture.



vermont folklife builds programs around community concerns and our partners’ expertise. we root our work with educators, students, traditional artists and musicians, researchers, and non-profit professionals in the process of collaborative ethnographic inquiry, seeking to understand experience from the perspective of the people to whom an experience belongs. through techniques such as interviewing, cultural documentation and media production, we recognize every individual in vermont as valuable and significant, as an expert in their own arenas of activity, as creative, smart, and capable. no one is on the margins; no one is dismissible.
