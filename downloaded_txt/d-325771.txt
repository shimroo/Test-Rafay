what to expect from comedysportz?



the format of a comedysportz match features two teams of improvisational performers competing in various head-to_head and team choice rounds, using improv games and performing scenes. audience members judge the results and award points as directed by the referee. in every match, a comedysportz referee monitors the action, awarding points, and administering fouls as necessary. match outcomes are not pre-determined as it’s you, the audience, who will ultimately decide the winner. the format is fast paced, competitive, but content-wise, it’s perfect for everyone.















how we keep it fun for everyone!



in the spirit of good sportsmanship comedy, comedysportz does have player (and audience) penalties that are put in place for everyone’s benefit including:out of bounds foul: called when a player (or audience member) uses explicit language or refers to something crass or off-color. in a comedysportz match, the comedy is better and smarter than those kinds of off-putting jokes.groaner foul: called when any player speaks a joke or pun so bad it makes the audience groan. the offending player may loose their team points (or award the other team with points), unless their apology to the audience is heartfelt enough and accepted.any spontaneously generated fouls: called whenever the referee feels it’s needed to move the match forward.
