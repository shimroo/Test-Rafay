both samuel j. davis and james t. davis have earned "av"* ratings, which is martindale-hubbell's top rating, and they have also been certified by the national board of trial advocacy as civil and criminal trial advocates. our founding attorneys are also members of the southwestern pennsylvania academy of trial lawyers and both have been named as pennsylvania super lawyers, an honor bestowed on 5 percent of the lawyers in pennsylvania. along with partners gary j. frankhouser and jeremy j. davis the law firm of davis & davis is ready, willing and able to effectively represent your needs.







are you fully covered by insurance in case of an accident?
we continuously hear from people who have been injured but whom we may not be able to help because they selected limited tort insurance. we recommend that all of our clients purchase full tort insurance. with so many uninsured/underinsured drivers on the road, take the necessary steps to protect yourself and your family and purchase uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage equal to your liability coverage.
