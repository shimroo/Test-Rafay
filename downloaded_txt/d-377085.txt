turner syndrome fact 



turner syndrome is a chromosomal condition related to the x chromosome that alters development in females, though it is not usually inherited in families

turner syndrome can affect one person very differently from how it affects another person. it is difficult to make predictions about how the disease will progress for an individual.this can be because of problems associated with the disorder like problems with the heart, high blood pressure, osteoporosis (where the bones lose bone mass and become fragile and brittle), or obesity.

















































turner syndrome is a chromosomal condition that affects development in females.the most common feature of turner syndrome is short stature, which becomes evident by about age 5.













most girls and women with turner syndrome have normal intelligence.













developmental delays, nonverbal learning disabilities, and behavioral problems are possible, although these characteristics vary among affected individuals.
