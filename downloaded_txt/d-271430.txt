new news -

it saddens me deeply to report the passing of marion gorham on november 26, 2010.    marion was an inspiration to all who knew her.  
marion and her husband, al shane, were an iconic couple aboard their tandem bicycle.  although this website is now quite out of date,
if you have ever hovered your mouse over the "puzzler" "business cards" icon at the top of this webpage, you have seen their iconic image, literally.     

here is an enlargement of the image (notice the teal freewheelers jerseys with the white logo on the back).
a memorial service was held january 8, 2011 at 1:00 pm at the leverett congregational church.

memorial contributions are suggested to the dakin pioneer valley humane society, 163 montague road, leverett, ma 01054. [this branch has closed, please refer to the one at 171 union st, springfield]




     google earth is cool!  here's a google earth path of the canal side rail trail in montague.


     i'm in the process of uploading business cards of bicycle shops that i've visited over the years.  feel free
to browse.
