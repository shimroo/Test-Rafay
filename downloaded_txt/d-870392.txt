what better place is there to call home than the beautiful frio canyon of texas? there is only one crystal clear, ice cold, frio river, and the scenic hills and canyons formed by the river over the eons are unmatched for their breathtaking vistas. 
our proximity to the larger cities of san antonio and kerrville makes it convenient when we need things that can only be found in more populated areas, but our distance from them also affords us a great deal of privacy. after all, it is the lack of hustle and bustle found in the cities that is one of our greatest attractions.
the frio canyon has developed into one of the most popular tourist destinations in this part of texas. accordingly, the nightly rental industry is big business here. people can invest in a property, place it in a nightly rental pool, then let it pay for itself and still have it to use at their discretion. these type properties are not bought and sold on emotion like typical residential properties, but rather by cash flows, expense ratios, gross rent multipliers, and internal rates of return. that’s where we come in here at suttle and company. we understand the numbers and we know how to explain them to you. dub suttle, our broker, is an mai member of the appraisal institute with over 45 years of experience in dealing with income producing properties. he can explain things in such a way that even a novice can understand. he knows numbers.
so, if you are considering investing in a rental property, we can make sure that the numbers will work and help you achieve your goals. but, if you are considering selling your property, let us help you make sure that you’re not leaving any money on the table. the numbers have to be right for sellers too. 
we also market houses, ranches, and commercial properties. we belong to the san antonio board of realtors, kerrville board of realtors, del rio board of realtors, san angelo board of realtors, and the midland/odessa board of realtors. we know what’s going on and where it’s happening.
suttle and company offers professional service along with home town hospitality. â so come see us or call us at your convenience. our agents here at suttle and company would love the opportunity to give you a tour of the area and show you properties that are available. seeing is believing, so come see for yourself. the coffee pot is always on. besides, you’ll be amazed to see that dub doesn’t look as old as he is
