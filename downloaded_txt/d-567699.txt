wild bird rehabilitation, inc. is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, tax-exempt organization. our mission is to give the best possible care to injured, sick and orphaned wild birds so that they may be returned to their natural habitat.wbr is the only organization in the st. louis area that cares for songbirds. without us, these birds would have no place to go for help. wbr relies solely on public donations. we receive no federal funding or financial support from united way or other similar organizations. all donations are tax-deductible to the full extent of the law.
