to "my one true friend".
i heard about you at ingalls group. i really wanted to meet you. i am sorry we missed each other at jewel. i was not being rude, i was taken by surprise. also i lack confidence in some face to face meetings. i am sorry. i was a bit puzzled after jewel how you tracked me down though. lol. anyway, i really want to meet you after all the past events. i don't really know all the details about the past events. i will be sitting at the following gps coordinates on the date and time below. it's a more relaxed place and i promise to provide polite conversation.  i appreciate the effort you took in reaching out in the first place.
41.56613,-87.54972 (i will be at this location on february 28 , 2025 from 9am - 12 noon.) i hope you will join me there. i will be sitting by the coy fish. take care, chris
