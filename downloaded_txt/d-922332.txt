muse
if i could, would you dance w me?
the elder strauss perhaps
and we will waltz wrapped
in each other’s arms
such sweet entanglement
fingers, legs and hips
let the world spin
i have dreamed of this
if you would, could you dress for me?
décolletage in crêpe du chine
alabaster in aubergine
we are splendid in your skin
bejeweled bodice wherein
luster becomes you
citrine and sapphire blue
sibylline seraphim
-piano interlude-
if i could, would you sing w me?
draw the muse inside
given form, i will provide
your deepest inspiration
now language, light as air
refined by your lips
will make music there
i have dreamed of this
