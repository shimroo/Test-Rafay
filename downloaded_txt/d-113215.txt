metal detecting holidays in england with the world's most successful metal detecting club.20 years plus.
twinned with midwest historical 
          research society usa.
 




 


 


welcome 
to my detecting holidays in england web site. 
we have been running as a club for nearly 20 years now and every find ever made by the guys is posted on this site.
these are small hunts 
  on lands that have had occupation from stone age to present day, bordering 
  the oldest town in britain. 
check the latest news page regularly for 
  the latest finds, land news and what's happening generally. 
this site 
  is updated almost daily during the hunting season so you can watch 
  what the guys are finding, as it happens !!
