a look at personal injury law



personal injuries happen every single day. some of these personal injuries are caused by the negligence or mishap of other individuals. those cases of personal injury should be addressed accordingly. if you have been injured due to the carelessness of someone else, you could be entitled to a cash award that can compensate you for your time, pain and suffering, lost wages and more. a personal injury lawyer portland can help you better determine if you have a case, as well as help you get justice where it is due and a settlement if you in fact have a case.
what qualifies for a personal injury lawsuit?a personal injury lawsuit must prove that negligence by another person has directly caused your accident and injuries. of course you must also be able to prove that you do have serious injuries as the result of this accident. there are many different types of personal injury cases that may qualify for a lawsuit, including:
• medical malpractice
• car accidents
• slip & fall accidents
• trucking accidents
• workplace injuries
these are just a few examples of the types of accidents that could result in a lawsuit.
how to start a claim for personal injury
if you have been injured and feel that the cause was someone else’s negligence or unwillingness to follow rules, it is a good idea to talk to a personal injury lawyer at once. this type of lawyer specializes in personal injury cases and can ensure that your voice is heard and victory served.
don’t worry about money. a personal injury lawyer will talk to you at no cost during a consultation. this consultation can cover a great deal of information, and you can learn the steps that you should take next regarding your case. if it is determined that you could benefit from the help of a lawyer, you can start your case with no money needed in most cases. personal injury lawyers usually work on a contingency basis, meaning they are paid only when they win your case.
how to choose a personal injury lawyer
choosing a personal injury lawyer should be done carefully. far too many lawyers out there are incapable of benefiting you in such a matter, and you certainly don’t want to be stuck with an incompetent lawyer.
to choose a great lawyer to handle your case, keep these things in mind:
• first and foremost, make sure the lawyer chosen specializes in personal injury cases. a lawyer who handles these cases is much more likely to get you a winning judgment.
• do not settle for a lawyer who simply has experience. look for a lawyer with winning results. after all, that is the outcome that you want in your case.
• is the lawyer a member of the american trial lawyers association? does the lawyer hold any special licenses and affiliations?
• does the lawyer listen to what you have to say and seem genuinely concerned about your case? do you feel like you can talk to your lawyer? these are all important.
• how long has the lawyer been practicing law? the more experience the better.
• what kind of reputation does the lawyer have? asking family and friends can really tell you a great deal about the lawyer and whether or not he is worth your time and money. you should also consider the lawyer’s practice areas.
when our lives are rearranged and turned upside down because someone else chose not to follow directions or act responsibly it is their price to pay. you’ve suffered enough, and should not endure additional hardship due to lost wages, a loss of a job and the mental torment. you shouldn’t pay your medical bills, either. when you file a personal injury lawsuit you can get what you deserve. talk to a lawyer and make sure that you see justice in the near future.

why is solar power perth the right option for me?



we’re all looking to save money on our electric bill. it seems like the money we’re being charged keeps going up every time we receive a bill. that’s because the electric companies work together to keep rates high. it’s not the cost of the material they’re using. aren’t you sick of them taking advantage of you? maybe it’s time you switched to solar power perth?
when you switch to solar power, you’ll be able to work with a smaller company. that means more individual attention when it comes to the discussion of your rates. companies that supply solar power are numerous, which means they have a lot of competition. when companies aren’t working together, and are actually competing, it means better rates for you.
some individuals aren’t aware of how commercial solar power perth works. this can negatively effect their decision when they’re considering the installation of it. a major concern among potential buyers is that they won’t have access to energy at night. this isn’t true. solar energy is stored during the day for night time use.

solar energy is expensive to install, but financing is available. it’s worth the installation cost when you see how much money it’s saving you on your electric bill every month.
you can find the right professionals to get your solar energy from when you use a site like angie’s list. angie’s list does cost a small, annual fee, but it’s the best site to find real reviews. no one wants to waste their time looking through reviews that weren’t left by actual customers.
switching to solar power has many more advantages. look up the positive effects switching to solar power has on the environment and the economy. you may be surprised by the difference it’s making. you’ll find that solar power works just as well, and is cheaper in the end.

the health and conduct of a hgv driver



the health and conduct of a hgv driver
accidents, generally occur due the lack of concentration and distraction of a driver, along with failure to observe the rules of the road. to find out more about the rules of the road, read the latest version of the official highway code.
to minimise the possibility of accidents happening a well qualified hgv driver should have sufficient knowledge of what specific health issues are a hazard when driving their vehicles.
main health issues that affect driving
you will be surprised that even simple illnesses can affect a driver’s reaction. if you have or feel that you are likely to suffer from the following, please think how they will affect your driving skills and awareness:

hay fever
a common cold
tiredness
flu symptoms

there has been numerous studies that have been undertaken by the department for transport that have examined the effects of fatigue and sleep related vehicle incidents (srvis). evidence has shown that srvis are prevalent in 40% of incidents and are normally with commercial vehicles. srvi are more likely to result in serious injury than an average road incident, simply because they normally involve running off the road or into the back of another vehicle and are worsened because of the fact that there is no pre-emptive braking involved beforehand.
studies have shown that the peak time for an incident is between 2am and 7 am, as this is when our body’s natural body clock is in its daily trough. although there is a smaller window where drivers have shown to be less alert and that is between 2pm to 4pm (this is the ideal time for a nap to occur).
if you feel yourself feeling sleepy on a long journey, try to find a safe place to stop before you get to the stage whereby you are fighting sleep and take a nap. the most effective countermeasure known is actually to consume 2 cups of coffee, then take a small nap if you are feeling sleepy. the caffeine in the coffee will take about 30 minutes to work into your blood stream and by that time your brain  will had have had a short nap. remember this should be only considered as a temporary measure and the best way would be to pull over and find somewhere to sleep for the night.
nb – fatigue can lead to reduced reaction times and will impair your concentration. before you start your shifts make sure you have had plenty of sleep and make sure you take your scheduled breaks  and try to take more rest time on a journey than is required by law.
falling asleep while driving
a high proportion of vehicle accidents occur when drivers have fallen asleep at the wheel, especially when driving on a motorway that resonates monotonous driving conditions.
when driving an hgv on motorways, be aware of boredom when driving at night. always:

try to keep fresh air circulating in the driving area
avoid driving when less than 100% fit.
avoid driving after a particularly heavy meal
take planned rest breaks
try to stop the cabin area of your hgv getting too warm

the introduction of the following into heavy goods vehicles

air suspension on vehicles
more widely adapted soundproofing materials
smoother and quieter diesel engines
air-suspension driver’s seats
floating cab suspension

has effectively made the drivers cabin of most modern hgv drivers a perfect environment to doze off when driving, which can easily cause tiredness.
shift work has been shown to be blamed for an increase in the tiredness of found in truck drivers, in the long term working shifts will damage your natural body clock, so try and take all precautions to avoid continuously working in shifts with insufficient rest time in between each shift.
drugs
if you are driving for well-known multi-national companies you may find that you will be subjected to random drug tests and that if any of the following drugs are found in your blood stream there will be instant dismissal:

amphetamines
methaqualone (sleeping pills)
propoxyphene
cannabis
cocaine
heroin
phencyclidine (angel dust)
benzodiazepine (tranquillizers)
methylamphetamines (mdma)
barbiturates (sleeping pills)
morphine/codeine

if these drugs had been taken for medicinal purposes, be aware that it may take at least 72 hours for the drugs to leave your blood stream.
alcohol
this rule is so simple when driving all vehicles, as it should now be treated as law:
if you plan on driving anywhere, then you do not drink any alcoholic substance
the current law states that it is an offence to drive with:

 a breath alcohol level greater than 35µg per 100ml.
a blood alcohol level greater than 80mg per 100ml.

remember that if you are caught driving an ordinary motor vehicle and your breath or blood levels of alcohol breach the current laws, then you will be banned for driving both normal cars and any heavy goods vehicle and this will mean your losing your job.
