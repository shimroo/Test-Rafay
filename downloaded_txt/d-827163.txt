letter from the chairman:




dear students,after the update to our course last year, there remain two issues that our program has never before addressed: the first issue regards the challenge of an affordable, professional website. it is a rude surprise to discover that website builders, e.g. squarespace and wix, are far more difficult than advertised, and many people are forced to hire help. hosting will cost over $200 a year, and hiring a 3rd party to setup a squarespace or wix site for you will cost $5,000. fortunately, for the special case of wedding planners, there is a way to build a professional site that is nearly free. we do not want to see wedding planners get stuck on this crucial step or have to redo their first site. participants in the new partner method version of our certification will receive one-on-one advising on setting up their website. the second issue regards those enrollees who do not finish their course. there is nothing worse than having nothing to show for a course you do not finish. students may change their minds for their own personal reasons. to correct for this, we are moving more (not all) of the general business and professional development topics into the first part of the program and leaving more (not all) of the wedding planning specific topics for the second part of the program, and we are separating payment for each part. participants in the new partner method version of our certification will get their money’s worth and more whether they choose to stop after the first part only or proceed to complete both parts to graduate. some of you may know my history in the bridal industry and my life-long relationship with the original author of the weddings beautiful worldwide program, doris nixon. and, if you know me personally, you know i care deeply about everyone feeling true and lasting benefit from the course. the new partner method for our certification is both more personalized and personal. i want students happy now and forever. the access to one-on-one coaching calls is what makes this the partner method. while availability is limited, partner method participants will receive 50% pricing over the traditional method. due to the increased personal nature of the approach, this method will not be available to new students every month. instead, you will have to check the top of the home page for the date of the next openings. very truly yours, b.g. wrightcourse topics:website & brandingyour tech stackreceptionsinvitationsrehearsalsenthusiasm vendor researchexecutive functionceremoniesattireregistryduring the course:coursework may be completed in your free-time online in as fast as 8 weeks.all coursework will be submitted online.you will be expected to write thorough, personal responses to the course material.you will receive active feedback and direction from your instructors.all essentials will be taught to begin or resume your journey as a successful wedding planner.upon completion:graduates receive full cws certification represented by your diploma-quality certificate with seal ready for framing.
