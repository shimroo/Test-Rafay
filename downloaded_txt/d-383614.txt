once again we enjoyed the very high standard of excellence that we have come to expect from tiffany east. your staff person was an absolute delight. she was focused and efficient, professional, and always positive and cheerful. the food was just wonderful and so beautifully presented on the buffet. our guests felt so well taken care of, as did i. the rentals were packed up quickly and our house left immaculate. thank you so much - you and your staff do a wonderful job and your staff is a credit to you.

i was at tiffany's for a wedding reception. i have to admit tiffany's did far better than i expected. the staff was very well dressed, professional, courteous and did an excellent job serving all of the guests with smiles. the food was very tasty, the veggies cooked to perfection and the display of appetizers was very nice. the bartenders were friendly, accommodating and cordial, and boy did they mix the drinks right! the overall atmosphere was very elegant and professionally coordinated. the wedding party seating was breathtaking and so beautiful. thanks tiffany's! job well done!
