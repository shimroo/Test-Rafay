“one of the sharpest comics working today, a gifted political joke writer and loose-limbed, adventurous performer with an urgent brand of observational humor.” (the new york times)











a native new yorker, ted alexandro has appeared on david letterman, conan o’brien, jimmy kimmel, comedy central and dr. katz. he’s had two half-hour specials on comedy central.he began as a music teacher in nyc elementary schools, which he talks about in his standup. now three decades into his comedy career, ted is married with two toddlers—still using kids for comedic fodder but now they’re his own. ted has five comedy specials/albums available to stream. his most recent special “cut/up” is free on youtube. ted currently tours with jim gaffigan.
