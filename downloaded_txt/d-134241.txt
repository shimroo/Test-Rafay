does the price include set and delivery?


yes, although additional fees may apply for areas farther out. remember prices do not include sales tax.




do you deliver to other cities?


yes, but once again please be aware that due to rising gas prices and the possible need for an extra truck and labor that travel fees can be quite high. please call our office for a current quote.




does the rental time include your set up time?



no. we arrive early to set up so you get the entire rental time to play.




when do you set up?


that depends on how many rentals we have that day. generally we arrive 1-3 hours before the rental time begins. if we have a lot of rentals that day, we may need to set up as early as 4 hours in advance. if this is the case, we will call the friday before to confirm that someone will be at the party location.




we've rented some really dirty jumps from other companies in the past. are they always that dirty?


no. the jump should be clean when you get it. fun jumps cleans and disinfects after every rental.
