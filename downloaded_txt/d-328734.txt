the koury difference 



pioneering vision. storied results. 















									over six decades of experience developing hospitality, retail, office & industrial and residential properties throughout greensboro, north carolina distinguishes koury corporation as both an early pioneer and modern day innovator.  focusing on customer service, we’ve chosen to develop, lease and manage only our own properties, doing so with the highest level of integrity and a long-term view.  our fully integrated business platform sets us apart and benefits our customers with the constant support of a dedicated and experienced team of architectural, construction, facilities, property management and leasing professionals.  these are the ideals established by our founder, joseph s. koury, and those which guide us today.								



this is the koury difference.
