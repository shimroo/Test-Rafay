cytoculture international, inc. is an environmental
      biotechnology firm based in point richmond, ca  providing technical consulting and
      microbiological laboratory research services to support bioremediation and biofuels projects.
 the company was founded in 1986    to develop its own proprietary continuous flow bioreactor systems
        supporting acclimated cultures of aerobic bacteria used to biodegrade a wide range of
        hydrocarbon contaminants in soil and groundwater. 
currently, we have expanded our
        environmental microbiological laboratory to investigate in situ biodegradation
        processes for a wide variety of hydrocarbon and chlorinated contaminants under both
        aerobic and anaerobic conditions. teaming with affiliated environmental engineering firms,
        both in the united states and internationally, cytoculture consults on and participates in a wide range of
        bioremediation services for a variety of clients and situations, from refinery remediation of contaminated groundwater to clean up of oiled shorelines. 
as of august 1, 2015, cytoculture is not accepting lab research samples without prior contractual arrangements.
