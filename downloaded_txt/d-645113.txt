 welcome to paperweight collectors association of texas


 

welcome to paperweight collectors association of texas
 
the paperweight collectors association of texas promotes the art of paperweight collecting presenting many activities for individuals to explore and increasing greater understanding the art of collecting.
this is a friendly association with people who not only enjoy paperweights, but also enjoy each other. we share our fascination with paperweights of every shape, size and heritage.
through three major meetings a year, members meet artists, emerging artists and have an opportunity to purchase weights from noted dealers and in silent auctions. we enjoy the magic of often seeing the artists at work through their presentations and visits  as a group to paperweight artists’ studios.
meetings take place in various cities across texas assuring that no one has to travel too far to attend an event. we learn from each other and the paperweight artists and dealers who attend our meetings. some of us have made our own paperweights. membership is open to everyone; those who live in texas and beyond our state borders.
please see events for upcoming meetings and themes.
