mailing faqs the internet has brought about colossal changes in the field of marketing. the low cost of delivering messages via banner ads and email seemed to spell the doom of direct mail. it was not meant to be. the fleeting images on a screen, although inexpensive, are still no match for the power of paper in a customer's hand. in fact, last year was the best year ever for direct mail, capping over a decade of double-digit growth. and nothing beats direct mail for its ability to accurately measure effectiveness.

what our customers are saying

name: jai hinsoncomments: i love working with acid flyers. your work is efficient, timely and reasonable. i most enjoy working with jason, who has a special eye for graphic design. he always captures what i'm thinking about even if i don't know how to explain. he has a special artistic gift. he's a keeper! and make sure you give him a raise. good talented workers are very, very very hard to find. 


name: pat smootcomments: i made a large order for a non-profit working with seniors in our community. their tri-fold brochure needed a re-design to match with the updated website design. the order was placed on a discount day and completed as promised with on time delivery. very pleased with the results & so is the agency that truly needed the fresh material. i work with several non-profit organizations and whenever possible i order for each of them through acid flyers.                                


name: liz prisley comments: their customer service has always been great, really helpful people, quality is on point too. i'm a loyal customer. plus i love that they are always emailing me coupons!                                


name: norman newsomecomments: i've worked with acid flyers since 2005 and never had a bad experience. sure there have been mishaps along the way, most or maybe all related to my mistakes -but they always go out of their way to fix or make things right without me even asking. prices are beyond low, sometimes i think their prices are too low. but what's most important is quality and customer service and with acid flyers you'll always be impressed. if you look at the bad reviews most of the complaints are related to error on the customer's end...kind of sucks to get bad reviews for having dumb customers, but that's business i guess. 


name: kyle gilrain comments: this company does quality work. we order a considerable amount from them each year and the items are always of high quality.                                


name: lawrence ahyuwacomments: i gave the production of 500 postcards. first the design was excellent! secondly the production was beyond expectation in terms of quality. thirdly the the job was completed three days before the expected pick up. and lastly i truly appreciate the customer services. my rating is 5 star!
