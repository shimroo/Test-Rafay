fresh news for summer, punks
4 jun 2013
hello friends,
 it's been awhile since we've given a proper update, so here are a few paragraphs with our recent plans and appearances. 
 first, our summer tour of europe is shaping up, with a lot of festivals with great bands of old friends, and a few intimate club shows too. . . . there are a couple more crucial appearances to be announced, but what follows are the majority of the confirmed dates. 
7/5- salzburg, austria- united people fest 7/6- munster, germany- vainstream rockfest 7/7- zurich, switzerland- dynamo 7/9- vienna, austria- arena 7/10- tolmin, slovenia- punk rock holiday 7/11- stuttgart, germany- 1210 7/12- bunsbeek, belgium- kloemprock 7/13- lindau, germany- stadtfest 7/14- munich, germany- antifest 7/15- nurnberg, germany- hirsch 7/17- amsterdam, netherlands- winston 7/19- holte-stukenbrock, germany- serengeti fest 7/22- hamburg, germany- moltov 7/23- berlin, germany- cassiopeia 7/25- eisenach, germany- alter schlachthof 7/26- bausendorf, germany- riez open air 7/27- dieburg, germany- traffic jam open air 7/28- rokycany, czech republic- fluff fest
all the anywheres are busy working, playing in other projects, and living their lives, so we haven't been able to tour like we once did, but new songs and concepts are definitely starting to cook up. as of this writing, we have no firm plans for any other touring or recording, but the creative fire is still lit between the five of us, and we will be building a new record through these next few seasons on our own timeline .. . . as long as it takes to be inspiring to us and a meaningful document. 
 we are very much looking forward to the tour in july, and the chance to re-connect with our friends in europe who we haven't seen in at least two years . 
 in other media news, this past year we have had the honor of working with chris hamer of urbnpop comicswho has featured a visually stunning adaptation of our song 'detonation' from change is a sound in the premier issue of his comic pink noise ! this lovingly crafted piece of lush,surreal protest art also features the song lyrics of our dear hometown friends, tim barry and rob huddleston/ ann beretta. check it out and get a copy or twobefore the first print run is gone.
 also, the long-awaitedleft of the dial: conversations with punk icons interviews book is out, and our friend and inspiring comrade david ensminger has reprinted and included our lotd interview from 2003 at the book's end, as a humble outro, if you will - to the preceding 300 pages of best hardcore punk compilation tape(of words)ever. it's got uncompromising, critical and joyful in depth interviews and rare photos from all, or most,of the ferocious and brilliant bands and individuals from the'70's and '80's american hardcore generation. this essential volume, and a great many other fine books that will change your life are available from  pm press . we are proud to be a small part of this worthy addition to your coffee table punk books collection. cuz we know you've got one of those.
 finally, i'm attempting to add some fresh content to the long-suffering faq section, this time from an interview during our most recent east coast tour . which takes us back to 2011. man, this global economic crisis is bullshit. 
 take care everyone and up the punks,
 solidarity and love,
thomas and strike anywhere

strike anywhere 2012... an update doesn't say too much of anything... 
20 feb 2012
well... there hasn't been much news in strike anywhere world recently... partly due to this website being busted and un-updateable for over a year... and partly due to the fact that we haven't been up to much of anything. to answer a big question... yes... strike anywhere is still together... not broken up... not even on hiatus or any of that... just not nearly as busy as we used to be. that being said, we do have some plans for 2012... though, at this point, the details are vague at best.... we will be doing a couple tours... right now looking like the overseas/south of the equator variety of touring. we will also have some "new" music released this year via bridge 9 records. it wont necessarily be new songs... but it also wont be the typical strike anywhere that most of you are used to hearing... it will honestly probably only be of interest to very small fraction of our fans... but, shit, we dig it... so hopefully someone else will dig it too. since you've heard from us last we've been keeping busy in our own ways... thomas moved back to the west coast, near the beach... smith moved south to the beach.. (lucky fuckers)... smith has also been keeping busy playing with senses fail... they're recording a new record and doing the warped tour thing this summer... garth and mark keep hacking away at the richmond restaurant industry... and i'm up in dc and occasionally play shows with pygmy lush. some actual news and updates should be coming your way soon... but for now, just wanted to put up a little something on this old website... let you know that we're still alive... -eric (strike anywhere)

spin and the moscow times
5 may 2009
what a strange combination of media this month !
the spin link takes you to a cool picture from the center of the dust-mosh at harvest of hope fest, with a quote from me that showcases a powerful gift for the obvious .the moscow times, translated article that was found in the archives of znet ( an awesome resource, by the way, for non-corporate journalism-nurturing radical ideas and debate. ) was sent to us , through keebler, by jord from propagandhi. thanks to those two canadians for the heads up . this article gives another perspective on the moscow events written in the astonishingly long european tour journal blog over in the blindingly small print of our faq section. finally, in a belated may day inspiration . . . here is a link to some union busting footage to make us all realize there is a lot of work to be done still to free us from the entrenched retrograde culture of power and profits killing people and progress. love and respect to billy bragg, and pete seeger. solidarity,thomas
