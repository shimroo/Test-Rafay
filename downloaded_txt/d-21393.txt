the perfect fit for any budget
instead of having pre-made rings with price tags on them, our goal is to create one amazing ring that fits your budget - something made just for the love of your life, for the price of something off the shelf.
take a look at some of the rings we've created in your price range to see what kind of magic we can make happen.
what goes into pricing












honesty. expertise. and lots of hand-holding.
we’re not talking about pdas though. we’re talking about hands-on help with ring shopping.
from sifting through settings, to sketching ideas, to selecting the perfect center stone, we’re by your side every step of the way.
(except when you pop the question...that’d probably ruin the moment.)











tell me about her style!


any idea what she'd like?






i'm not sure


she has some pinterest boards with all sorts of stuff on them.

seeing some of the clothing she pinned is super helpful!


seems like she's pretty casual and laid-back, maybe a little boho-chic?


here are a few ideas our designers came up with:











awesome!


could we look at those with some other diamond shapes?












of course! i think a marquise could look great.




















option 1
diamond: 1.11ct






              your browser does not support the video tag.
            

option 2
diamond: 1.24ct


best deal

total price
$5,476.00


1.24 ct
si2
g
excellent


awesome deal here!  it’s listed as an si2, but the inclusions are small and well-positioned, so they’ll be invisible to the naked eye.  that’s an extra 0.25 carats and still well under your budget!


matt










option 3
diamond: 1.1ct

is the thought of trying to buy a diamond making you a little nervous? don't worry, we'll do the hard work for you - searching across hundreds of dealers, hand-selecting the best deals out there, and helping you pick the perfect rock.
