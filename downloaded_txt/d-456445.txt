by steven dean 


wanna hear some music? wanna upload your track? you have chosen the right platform. spotify has various features that cater both to the artists and listeners. the platform’s continuous and personalized efforts have made the audience retention rate grow drastically. if you are a business or someone who would like to know popular business strategies, here’s the spotify business strategy explored. spotify business strategy explored spotify’s basic framework is similar to the framework of other social media platforms and streaming platforms. spotify also allows artists to analyze metrics, and its algorithm depends on those metrics to boost tracks and podcasts. metrics like spotify plays, streams, and followers are crucial. you get an instant boost when you buy spotify followers and to kickstart your fanbase journey. such a boost also reflects on the chances of virality of your track or podcast. artists could analyze and guess the algorithm’s expectations and boost their tracks accordingly. this makes spotify an ideal hub for growth. now, let’s break the framework further into freemium business model focus on user experience marketing efforts freemium business model ‘fremium business model’ means providing free services for some time and then converting certain features as paid after that period. in the free period, users will be habituated using the service. when some of it is made into paid, they will know the value of the feature and will be prepared to pay to access premium paid features. spotify used this business model to reach its height. spotify strived hard to attract users with its free version. later, when people started to depend on spotify for listening to music and podcasts, it realized the amount of brand awareness it had. spotify then introduced premium versions, which allowed paid users to access all the advanced features. there was a minor commotion regarding this change. yet many users who have benefitted from spotify opted for the premium version. this freemium business model has helped spotify grow a lot.  focus on user experience spotify’s strategies are drafted to entice and sustain users by promoting the benefits it could provide. its efforts emphasize its empathy for consumers. some of the great efforts to make the user experience interesting are customized recommendation spotify suggests music based on the users’ listening habits. it analyzes the users’ preferences and provides personalized recommendations. such recommendations help users discover desired songs and artists. if not for its customized recommendations, they would have lost such music in the ocean of tracks on spotify.  mood-based playlist spotify puts immense effort into curating playlists based on every user’s listening choices. it provides a wide range of tailored playlists. they are designed in a way that fits various moods. this reduces the time spent searching for the right music to listen at a time. this enhances the user experience on spotify. also, the popularity of playlists helps spotify gain new log-ins.  music discovery feature spotify also has specific features that allow users to find the exact kind of music they want to hear. some prefer researching and listening to music rather than having a prepared playlist. some prefer creating playlists on their own. some seek new tracks every week. people like spotify’s music discovery feature, which helps them find new music.  marketing efforts spotify’s marketing efforts are common yet strategically employed. the combination offers a wholesome result. the three main components are social media spotify allows its artists and podcasters to connect to other social media platforms. these artists and podcasters build a bridge between spotify and other social media platforms in several ways. for example, an independent music artist could connect spotify to another platform and persuade the audience to listen on spotify. if they reach out to trollishly to boost their online presence, the benefits of that platform eventually be reflected on spotify. if they share songs posted on spotify to their instagram stories, they could also pull their instagram audience to spotify. word-of-mouth word-of-mouth is a conventional way of marketing and is too powerful. spotify’s users do not allot particular time for using it. they hear songs at any time of the day and while doing any task. so, the hours of usage are huge, and when someone interacts with them while listening to music and doing their tasks, they will obviously talk about spotify. thus, word-of-mouth is still a powerful marketing pathway for spotify. partnerships spotify’s marketing depends significantly upon its partnerships with live events, concert tours, and music festivals. spotify’s engagement and reach multiply due to these kinds of partnerships. spotify’s brand awareness is enhanced majorly through this marketing strategy.  wrap-up spotify’s success is a guide for newly emerging businesses. spotify’s curated efforts to attract users and enhance their experience made them successful. choosing a suitable business model and evolving periodically
