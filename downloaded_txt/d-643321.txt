				let us know about your motion control project requirements
			



				for oems, frustrated with the requirement to design around off-the-shelf 
                products from inflexible suppliers, hansen offers customizable product 
                families and access to our deep engineering resources. we pride ourselves in 
                providing a best-in-class design experience, resulting in motor and motion 
                systems that provide superior quality, reliability and performance at the 
                lowest possible cost-of ownership.
