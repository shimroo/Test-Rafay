hello





my name is rhiannon, and amongst other things, i like to knit, a lot.

about four years ago my mother taught me how to knit and it was the first time a craft ever really grabbed me. over the years i had tried all sorts of crafty things - beading, weaving, tapestry, cross-stitch, the odd bit of pottery, but nothing stuck the way knitting did.

in future posts i hope to be sharing some yarn reviews, showing off some of the things i've made and eventually putting up my own designs.
