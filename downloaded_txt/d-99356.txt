introduction





at nlt, we engineer cap lamps to provide workers with the highest-quality lighting and safety in the harshest environments. our signature orange polaris is the number one cap lamp found in mines and tunnels globally. since 1984, we have been designing lamps to stay at the forefront of technology.
nlt introduced the world’s first “smart cap lamp,” which incorporated a wi-fi tracking tag. today our lamps can accommodate both tracking and proximity tags as well as facilitate bidirectional communication with third-party solutions. our new groundbreaking dual-beam technology has changed the way workers interact with their lamps, giving them multiple beams and the right light for every job they do.
all of our lamps are serviceable and customizable, and our nimble engineering team enjoys the challenge of developing custom products with mines and solution-provider partner companies. explore our site, and let nlt meet all your cap lamp needs.
