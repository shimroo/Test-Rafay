meet naba rizvi
class of 2020, information technology
âfor me, enrolling at utoledo was the fastest path to becoming financially independent
                                       since i knew i could support myself with scholarships, internships and on-campus employment.â
naba is passionate about technology and breaking barriers. she was one of 20 u.s.
                                       students to win a google women techmaker scholarship in 2018. naba also launched an
                                       education-technology company to increase diversity in computer science. she is pursuing
                                       a ph.d. at uc-san diego.

meet deidra buenger
class of 2020, english literature and asian studies with a minor in japanese, holland,
                                          ohio 
âi chose utoledo because my father and sister were alumni, but also because of the
                                       strong natural sciences programs and financial aid. without merit-based scholarships,
                                       there is no way i could have taken on study-abroad and research opportunities, let
                                       alone complete my degree. everything i've been able to do here is because my academic
                                       merit produced access to scholarships. as long as you work hard you have more opportunities.â
deidra spent her junior year studying in tokyo. her merit scholarships helped finance
                                       her time abroad. a grant from utoledoâs office of undergraduate research helped fund
                                       her summer research.

meet quatez scott
ph.d. candidate, educational theory and social foundations, cincinnati
âi was initially just going to pay for school and go part time. but utoledo launched
                                       a new diversity ambassador fellowship, and i was awarded a fellowship. the deanâs
                                       scholars and fellows program put me in a position to pay much less for school, thus
                                       being able to focus more on my academics. iâm now in a real position to complete my
                                       ph.d. in less than four years.â
