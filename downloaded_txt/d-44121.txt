tv snob's guide to binge-worthy shows


the rise of true crime documentaries
in recent years, true crime documentaries have taken the world by storm. with the success of shows like 'making a murderer' and 'tiger king', it's clear that audiences are fascinated by the darker side of human nature. but what makes these shows so addictive? is it the thrill of solving a mystery alongside the investigators, or is it the morbid curiosity that drives us to learn more about the worst of humanity?




the evolution of reality tv
reality tv has come a long way since the days of 'survivor' and 'big brother'. today's shows are more sophisticated, with complex characters and intricate storylines. but what's behind this shift? is it the desire for authenticity in an increasingly fake world, or is it simply the allure of watching others struggle to survive in extreme environments?




why we can't get enough of superhero shows
superhero shows have taken over our screens in recent years. from 'game of thrones' to 'the umbrella academy', it's clear that audiences are hungry for more action-packed, morally ambiguous content. but what drives this obsession? is it the desire for escapism from our mundane lives, or is it the thrill of watching heroes fight against the forces of evil?
