                                        this has been my second time sending flowers from designs by david.  the ordering process is incredibly simple, and i love receiving updates on the delivery.  both times, the flowers received have been stunning - fresh and beautifully designed.  i love that i have found a new florist i can rely on when i need to send something gorgeous the same day!

                                        i called for a flower arrangement because a dear friend of mine lost her grandmother unexpectedly.  designs by david took my order and delivered the most amazing arrangement.  i also said that if they needed an extra day or two to deliver, that was okay and the woman who took my order asked if they could deliver it the same day i ordered.  two hours later, it was at my friend's doorstep.  great job designs by david.  i'll definitely be using you again!!!
