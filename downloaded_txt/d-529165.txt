paving the way for new voices

 

who we arein progress is a non-profit arts group.  it  was established in 1996 with the purpose of paving the way for new voices in the field of digital media.  today, in progress represents a broad network of artists committed to sharing stories, honoring diversity, and strengthening communities through the arts.   



what we doin progress provides specialized workshops, events and mentorships primarily in the areas of photography, video, music and writing. activities are designed to inspire creativity, responsibility and leadership amongst artists.  in progress places specific emphasis on long-term mentorships that begin at an early age and extend into adulthood.



why we do itthere are many groups and individuals that have rich experiences, histories and perspectives, whose stories rarely get shared. these stories have great value and carry with them the power to recognize those least represented.  in progress exists for these stories and for the artists who make them.
