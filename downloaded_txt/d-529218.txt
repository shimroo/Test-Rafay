welcome to the town of tazewell



located in the heart of scenic appalachia, tazewell offers the full southwest virginia experience. nestled among the back of the dragon’s rolling mountains, the winding clinch river and sweeping farm lands, tazewell is nature’s playground. enjoy an excellent meal at one of our many diverse dining establishments after you shop your worries away at trendy boutiques.
we have fun community events for all ages, from the music on main & cruise in held in summer months, to our main street moments festival held the fourth friday/saturday in july every year, to the oktobrewfest each october, and the main street winter market in december.
the town of tazewell – a great place to call home!
