notable quotes







"all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing."  

-  edmund burke
"shall i tell you the secret of the true scholar?  it is this:  every man i meet is my master in some point, and in that i learn of him."  

-  ralph waldo emerson
"never grow a wishbone where your backbone ought to be."  

-  clementine paddleford
"there is no use in trying," she said.  "i daresay you haven't had much practice," said the queen.  "when i was your age, i always did it for half-an-hour a day.  why sometimes i've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast."  

-  lewis carroll
"you cannot go on explaining away things over forever or you will find that you have explained even explanation itself away. you cannot go on 
seeing through things forever because the whole point of seeing through something is to see something else through it." 

- c.s lewis 
"this telephone has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication.  the device is inherently of no value to us." 

- western union internal memo, 1876 
"you cannot hope to build a better world without improving the individual.  to that end each of us must work for his own improvement, and at the same time share a general responsibility for all 

humanity, our particular duty being to aid those to whom we think we can be most useful." 

- marie curie 
"one cannot step into the same river twice." 

- heraclitus 
"the death of democracy is not likely to be an assassination from ambush.  it will be a slow extinction from apathy, indifference and undernourishment." 

- robert maynard hutchins 
"we are moving away from the old idea of leadership -- leadership has less to do (now) with heroism.  we don’t look for... unblemished omnipotent heroes, but leaders who are complex, 

dependent, changeable... we do not need one dominant authority structure telling all our inner voices to shut up..." 

- walter truett anderson 
"to know oneself is to know one’s [country].  it is also... paradoxically a form of exile from that world... to know oneself is, above all, to know what one lacks.  it is to measure oneself against 

truth, and not the other way around.  the first product of self-knowledge is humility, and that virtue is not conspicuous in any national character." 

- flannery o’connor  
"men content themselves with the same words as other people use, as if the very sound necessarily carried the same meaning." 

- john locke 
"in order to thrive in a world of change and chaos, we will need to accept 'chaos' as an essential process by which natural systems, including organizations, renew and revitalize themselves." 

- margaret wheatley 
"politics is perhaps the only profession for which no preparation is thought necessary." 

- robert louis stevenson 
"we will be better and braver if we engage and inquire than if we indulge in the idle fancy that we already know - or that it is of no use seeking to know what we do not know." 

- plato 
"man's mind stretched to a new idea never goes back to its original dimensions." 

- oliver w. holmes 
"what you learn intellectually lies in the shallow pools among the wrinkles of your brain.  what you learn through the skin of experience sinks deep into your roots." 

- hank taft 
"in commanding us to glorify him, god is inviting us to enjoy him." 

- c.s. lewis 
"a society is judged by how it treats its least desirable people." 

- anonymous 
"people are always blaming circumstances for what they are.  i don't believe in circumstances.  the people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and if they can't find them, they make them." 

- george bernard shaw 
"until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back, always ineffectiveness, concerning all acts of initiative (and creation).  there is one elementary truth the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans:  that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then providence moves too.  all sorts of thing occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred.  a whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one's favor all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance which no man could have dreamed would have come his way.  whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it.  boldness has genius, power and magic in it.  begin it now." 

- goethe 
"try?  there is no try.  there is only do or not do." 

- yoda 
"but for this book (the bible), we would not know right from wrong." 

- abraham lincoln 
"this is the true joy in life, the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; the being a force of nature instead of a 

feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy.  i am of the opinion that my 

life belongs to the whole community and as long as i live it is my privilege to do for it whatever i can.  i want to be thoroughly used up when i die, for 

the harder i work the more i live.  i rejoice in life for its own sake.  life is no "brief candle" to me.  it is a sort of splendid torch which i have got 

hold of for the moment, and i want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to the future generations."
