the ghost of pacific telephone 
		  lives on!!
(richmond central office in 
		  california)


frequently 
          asked questions 

        a note about picture contributions; i have had some contributions come 
		in that are taken from google earth street view. although this is an 
		easy way to fill up office pictures, i think it takes away from the 
		quality of office shots. who knows, maybe in the future this might be 
		the route to take, but at this time i think the traditional photos serve 
		their purpose. thank you for those contributing actual photos!
