bike laws in washington statedo you know what the safety stop law is? how about which e-bikes can legally ride on sidewalks and trails? if you don't know these, then you ought to get a copy of the pocket reference guide. find it and more bike law information on our bike laws page in the resources drop down menu.

bikes club e-bike policymore and more of us are riding e-bikes. it behooves us to know what the club policy is regarding e-bikes. here it is, adopted by the club in september, 2023.
the e-bike policy (in summary form) is thus:
class 1 (pedal-assist up to 20 mph) can go on all club group rides.class 2 (pedal-assist and throttle-assist up to 20 mph) can go on social-pace and steady-pace rides. class 3 (pedal-assist up to 28 mph) can go on all club group rides.(note that class 2 e-bikes are not allowed on moderate, brisk, and strenuous rides.) the full policy can be found on our e-bikes policy page.

in case you missed it ...
