*since 2010 

 














“i came to dream in 2014 as a student in the a ganar program. that was where i discovered there was a position open with the futuros program, which is in charge of training young teachers. at the end of my internship, i became a lead teacher in the estrellas jóvenes program, and, after five years of literacy, i am currently transitioning into being a guide in the montessori program. all these years at dream have filled my life with unparalleled adventure and excitement. it has offered me knowledge and experiences that i will always treasure and that will allow me to be a professional with so much more to offer.”   - vanessa tejada
