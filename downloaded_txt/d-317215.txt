welcome!   if you have any questions
                              about my pottery, or workshops and classes please
                              write, or call.  if you see anything that
                            you are interested in , email me and i will let you
                            know if it is available to ship right away, or if it
                            will need to be made-to-order.
 the
                                controlled chaos of the woodfiring process
                                enhances the surfaces of my pottery in a way
                                that i cannot do in the glazing process alone.
                                imagining how flame and ash leave their mark on
                                my work, caressing the textures as they wrap
                                around the forms, affects the way i think of my
                                work in the studio. before i used wood firing i
                                was less concerned about the firing process. now
                                it is just as important as the forms and
                                textures i use.  

my latest work represents an effort to reach
                                  beyond the basics of strictly functional
                                  pottery. my pottery is functional, wheel
                                  thrown, altered, and textured stoneware and
                                  porcelain which is decorated with geometric
                                  designs impressed, and carved into the soft
                                  clay. 

                                in  the gallery section of my
                            website you will find; ash glazed pottery, wood
                            fired stoneware, porcelain, and a variety of glaze
                            colors.
i offer workshops
                              and classes at my studio in wheel throwing,
                            altering and texturing, glazing, wood firing, and
                            raku firing.
