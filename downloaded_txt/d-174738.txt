announcement: welcoming cua 10 staff, children, youth and families to bethanna!
community umbrella agency
as the community umbrella agencies (cua) serving west philadelphia, south philadelphia and center city, bethanna’s programs and services are dedicated to strengthen families, promote resilience, and offer hope in times of need. help us lead the way home for children and teens in our community.

permanency services
providing children with permanent families, rather than indefinitely remaining in the foster care system, is one of bethanna’s core commitments. without stable and safe home environments, abused, abandoned, and neglected children clearly are at risk of failing to become healthy, productive adults.
help a child!


behavioral health services
bethanna’s behavioral health services offers a wide array of counseling services to build upon and enhance individual and family strengths, opportunities, and skills while promoting emotional well- being.
