the partners




since 1999, guppy design has built a reputation for perfectly balancing compelling, original and on-target creative design with experienced, comprehensive and friendly account and project management.
partners bill crossman and nicole ungurian personify this delicate balance. a founding partner, bill brings over two decades of experience to the table, leading the design direction and creative team. nicole, a partner since 2009, has more than 25 years of project management and client service experience in the industry and ensures the smooth operation of the studio.
together, bill and nicole have established trusted and productive long-term working relationships with many clients in the non-profit, public and private sectors. guppy design is small enough to be flexible but has the skills and experience to deliver customized solutions that connect with the market and cut through the clutter.
