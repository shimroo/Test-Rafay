courage doesn't retire: keep the fire of passion and purpose burning brightly during your retirement. remember, the heat of the battle forged us, but the warmth of camaraderie sustains us. retirement is the ultimate achievement, where fun and fulfillment unite, transforming work's end into life's beginning—a joyful journey of freedom, purpose, and endless possibilities.














we are the only law enforcement officers & firefighters (leoff) retiree organization that has served washington state leoff  retirees since 1970

 

we are a leoff  retiree organization, with a mission to preserve and enhance the pension and medical benefit features of the leoff  retirement systems. the rffow has represented leoff retirees longer than any other leoff  retiree organization in washington state history.













make sure and hit the join rffow button in the top right corner (or on a cell phone the drop down list) to see the features available just to members and to see what it takes to join together with us.  the rffow is made up of retirees just like you and we would welcome you as a new member.
