what we do






giving children back their childhood 



hearts of hope is a transitional children‚Äôs home based in johannesburg, providing a turning point opportunity of personal and individualised nurturing care to orphaned and vulnerable children. 













































 























children need... 



‚Ä¶nurturing care for their innate capacities to flourish. this means providing
young children with a secure environment that is sensitive to their health and
nutritional needs, which protects them from danger and abuse, and provides
them with opportunities for early learning and interactions that are
responsive, emotionally supportive, and developmentally stimulating.
nurturing care consists of five interrelated components: health, nutrition,
safety and security, responsive caregiving and early learning.‚Äù
