switching to iconnect was a very easy transition--within a week we had all connections established with our customers. 
the iconnect staff is available 24/7 to answer all of our questions and concerns, and if problems arise, will work with us diligently until the issue is resolved.  
we look forward to our continuing relationship with the iconnect team!â

the support from iconnect has always been quick and responsive, even though calls are far and few between. iconnect is that good! with iconnect, we've experienced well over 99% uptime, and with such support and performance, we never plan on going back to onsite edi processing ever again.â
