monthly mix

 







welcome to mixcd.org 

i have always loved music and wanted a way to share it with my kids.  i decided to make them a monthly mix cd.  the only rule for the cd is that it will contain 12 songs.  some months the cd might have a theme and sometimes they are random.  feedback from my kids has influenced the artists included from time to time.  i started this project in february of 2018 and do my best to have the cd ready on the first day of the month.  this blog was created in september 2019.  all the previous monthly mix track lists were posted at this time.  thanks for viewing! 
update 7/22/2023
all things must come to an end.  i haven’t updated the site in a while, but decided to stop doing monthly mixes for my children in fenruary 2023.  five years seemed like a nice round number to stop at.  my children both enjoy music and are busy discovering music on their own.  i may post mixes i enjoy from time to time.  thanks to anyone who ever checked out the site.
