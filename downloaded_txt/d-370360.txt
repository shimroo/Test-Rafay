oratory of st. josephlearn more





all are welcome to visit the oratory of st. joseph, featuring the beautiful mosaic on the life of saint joseph.  the mosaic was designed around 100 years ago by austrian artist leopold forstner.  the images depict five important times in the life of st. joseph.  the space is simple and allows for a focused time of prayer to god in reflecting on st. joseph and his “yes” to god.  through st. joseph, we hear of his obedience to god, “and he did as the angel of the lord had commanded him.” - matthew 1:24.  god calls us all in a special way to participate in the building of his kingdom here on earth.
