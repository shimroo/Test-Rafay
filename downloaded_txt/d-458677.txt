understanding earth's evolution to predict the future

in the department of geoscience, we study some of the world’s most pressing problems, such as energy, the environment, mineral resources, and climate. armed with a clear understanding of how earth developed, we can then anticipate where it’s going and how it will get there. together, we aim to prepare students to become leaders in this growing and important field.
