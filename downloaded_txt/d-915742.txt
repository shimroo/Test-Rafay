    when you need it



you’ll probably need planning permission if you want to:

build something new
make a major change to your building, such as building an extension
change the use of your building

to find out if your project will need planning permission, contact your local planning authority (lpa) through your local council.

find out about the planning system in scotland, wales and northern ireland.

applying for planning permission
to apply for planning permission, contact your lpa through your local council.
if your project needs planning permission and you do the work without getting it, you can be served an ‘enforcement notice’ ordering you to undo all the changes you have made.

it’s illegal to ignore an enforcement notice, but you can appeal against it.
