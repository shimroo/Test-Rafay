undergraduate programs
we offer both a bachelor of arts and a bachelor of science in statistical science exposing students to a broad range of statistical methods using tools from mathematical and computational sciences. developing skills and expertise in problem articulation and solving, and abilities to appreciate and accommodate uncertainty in decision-making, are central goals. graduating students are extremely well-prepared and competitive for graduate study in statistics and allied disciplines, and for early careers in business, finance, law, medicine or other fields. the department offers interdepartmental majors in data science (statistical science + computer science) or in statistical science + another field of study. a statistical science minor is also offered.
















ph.d. program
our ph.d. in statistical science allows students to customize their studies to define “individualized programs.” we stress the flexibility to tailor course selection, independent study, research experiences, internships, etc. to help students define a core base of expertise and move at their own pace toward ph.d. research.












 




















master's programour master’s program helps launch students into professional careers, or bridge them to ph.d. studies. we offer a master’s in statistical science (mss), which provides a comprehensive education in modern statistical theory, methods, and computation.
