welcome to lafayette

lafayette is located in beautiful yamhill county, the heart of the willamette valley and wine country of oregon, just 35 miles southwest of portland and 25 miles north of salem.

the city is very rich in history - lafayette was founded in 1846 by joel perkins, an early pioneer to the oregon territory. lafayette was situated on the main native american trail that traversed the willamette valley at a point on the yamhill river known for years as yamhill falls. the town grew slowly at first, but grew by leaps and bounds after gold was discovered in california. in the early 1850's, lafayette was one of the most important and prosperous cities in oregon. in 1995, because of the beautiful farm country around the city, the development of the oregon wine industry and tourism in yamhill county, and its proximity to the portland metro area, lafayette began to grow very rapidly, and it continues expansion today. the city can take pride in its rich history, but must work very hard to maintain its small town feel and charm in the midst of this rapid growth. it is a town with a bright past and a very bright future.
