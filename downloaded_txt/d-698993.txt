selected reviews



monteverdi: the other vespers
released by decca classics
july 2017
--
âsuperbly performed . . . there is plenty of warmth and animation in the superb music-making. i fagiolini's consort and solo singing are exemplary . . . in such sure hands (and throats) as these, monteverdi's psalm-settings reach their fullest capacity to enchant and astonishâ

ânobody could leave the room without believing they had been privy to some sort of miracle of human endeavour. it was witchcraft.â

lâorfeo
st johnâs smith square, london
may 2017
--
âlâorfeo, superbly performed by i fagiolini and the english cornett and sackbut ensembleâ¦ was vivid and raw, emotionally intense and musically thrilling. matthew long sang orfeo with pliant tone and urgent expression, as if living every tremor of the musicianâs suffering.â

victoria - tenebrae responsories
released by coro records
march 2024
--
"the impact here is just overwhelming. the solo singers almost never raise their voices... the very restraint of i fagiolini does the trick hereâ¦ there are plenty more versions of the music out there but this one creates a very special colour and atmosphere."

âthere is nothing ordinary about a performance by i fagiolini.ââ
