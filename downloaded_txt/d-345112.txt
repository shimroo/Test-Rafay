our focus is to help families plan for their future.  we understand the important and challenging decisions that must be made during the settlement planning process.  our diverse team of settlement and trust professionals assists in the planning process by providing a comprehensive overview of government benefit eligibility, financial needs analysis, health-related needs, estate planning needs, and other life goals.learn about us >
























our founder
james street was one of the nations top settlement planners for nearly two decades.  being in the industry for over 40 years, he understood the value of hard work and integrity.  most importantly, he delivered the highest grade of service for those in need.  while james is often remembered for his success in making the james street group a household name in the settlement planning industry or for his athletic achievements at the university of texas as both a football and baseball player, we remember james the most by his humility and for his true love of people.  james passed away in 2013, and the james street group, llc honors him by embodying the qualities that james instilled in us.

“i have had the opportunity to work with hanson street in my capacity as an appointed guardian ad litem.  i have not only found him to be knowledgeable, prepared, timely, and precise… but mature beyond his years.  he will always have the best interest of the minor or incapacitated.” - pam hoerster, hoerster mediation firm












“hanson and his team set up special needs trusts for several of our clients over the past few years, and he was easy to work with.  some of our cases involved a detailed understanding of government benefits, and hanson and his team made the process run smoothly for our clients.  hanson is trustworthy and truly cares about people.  we have enjoyed working with him.” - james r. moriarty, law offices of james r. moriarty












“we have worked with hanson street for several years, and we highly recommend his services.  he has demonstrated a wide breadth of knowledge in his field as he has handled several complex cases for us—some of which involved a combination of a structured settlement and a trust.  hanson made our clients feel comfortable throughout the entire process and he made my life a lot easier.”  - peter taaffe, resolve adr
