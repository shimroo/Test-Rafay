connect with like-minded industry professionals across canada 






















						"i have been to a few of the bac’s learning events at vancouver island university and found them very helpful. we like to go and further our knowledge. i’ve been baking at old town bakery for 19 years and my specialties are cakes and pies. i like the fast pace of the baking industry, getting a lot of things done in a short amount of time. i was born for this!”.					





islay colebrookold town bakery, ladysmith, b.c. 






						“being part of the bakery association gives me a chance to network, share my passion and give back to the industry i grew up in. being accessible and projecting a spark of passion to today’s students, will hopefully light a little fire under the students in the schools to become part of this beautiful industry.”					





peter jacobscmb, the bakers workshop 






						“i appreciate the opportunity to network with other bakers from across the country through the baking association. bac membership events, webinars and gatherings have inspired me to try out new baking techniques and recipes as well as keep informed of industry regulatory changes.”					





mary mackayterra breads inc. 






						“the baking association of canada provides a platform for the baking community to collaborate, educate and anticipate the future needs of our industry. their support for our students is invaluable and irreplaceable in helping us inspire the next generation.”					





aron weberchair and baking instructor, professional baking arts program, vancouver island university 






						“bac is the bakery’s unified voice when it comes to new legislations and a perfect avenue for collaboration within the industry.”					





julie tannahillm.jur., regulatory affairs supervisor, backerhaus veit 






						“the bac is a good venue to help promote and educate canadians and inspire young people about the opportunities in our industry, and to help advise and shape our elected leaders to make the best decisions around industry-related legislation.”					





harry kooldirector of projects, supply chain and global equipment procurement, cobs bread 






						"since joining the association in 2022, i personally have felt bolstered and mentored by a passionate group of industry leaders who have helped me make huge strides in my career as a pastry chef. from sharing the latest trends and techniques to advocating for the industry's interests, the association is a vital part of our baking community in canada and beyond."
