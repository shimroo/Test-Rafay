greetings & salutations
after fifteen+ years a short period of time, i have finally gotten around to updating my most ancient of websites.
please be patient while the upgrades go on, it is more like web archaeology than a simple update.
you can still access to “ancient” “old” site here

sometimes a kiss can last forever…



where i am…
