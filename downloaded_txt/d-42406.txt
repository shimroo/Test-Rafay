exhibition highlights



the exhibition showcases 13 whole-body specimens and more than 260 organs and partial body specimens.
these real human bodies have been meticulously dissected and preserved through an innovative polymer process.
the bodies are respectfully presented, giving visitors the opportunity to view the beauty and complexity of their own organs and systems.
the exhibition provides an up-close look inside our skeletal, muscular, respiratory, nervous, digestive, reproductive/urinary, fetal (optional)  and the treated body.
authentic human specimens on display to illustrate health concerns such as cirrhosis of the liver, arthritis, smoking and over-eating.
a healthy lung is featured next to a black lung ravaged by smoking in a vivid comparison more powerful than any textbook image.
