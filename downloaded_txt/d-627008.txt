organic mattress:
		an organic mattress is made from natural materials that 
		are free from synthetic chemicals and pesticides. common components 
		include organic cotton, natural latex from the rubber trees, and organic 
		wool.  these materials are grown and processed using methods that 
		minimize environmental impact and avoid harmful chemicals, making
		organic mattresses a popular choice for those seeking a 
		more eco-friendly and health-conscious option.  the dunlop 
		process is known for producing a firmer, denser foam compared 
		to other methods like the talalay process.



natural mattress:
		the 
		8-step talalay process is recognized has the industry's highest ratings 
		for breathability, pressure relief, hypoallergenic and durability 
		properties.  the talalay latex mattress process is 
		a method for producing latex foam that is known for its consistent, airy 
		feel and flexibility.  the talalay process 
		typically results in a lighter, more elastic foam with a more consistent 
		cell structure compared to the dunlop process.

serving 
		phoenix: gols certified 
		organic dunlop latex mattresses:
 the dunlop latex process is a method for producing latex foam that focuses 
		on creating a dense, supportive material. it begins with pouring the 
		latex into a mold. the mold is then subjected to high pressure, which 
		helps the latex expand and form a foam structure. the foam is 
		subsequently baked to vulcanize it, a process that strengthens and 
		stabilizes the foam's structure.  made without any fertilizers and 
		pesticides.  latex is the milk or sap of the rubber tree.  today it 
		is imported from the same temperate climate areas around the globe.  
		ours comes from vietnam.  
		gots are the initials for 
		global organic textile standards.  the quilting on our certified 
		organic mattresses are made with certified organic cotton and wool.



		serving phoenix:
		talalay latex mattresses:
		the 8-step talalay latex process is a method for manufacturing latex 
		foam that involves several distinct steps to create a high-quality, 
		consisten and durable material. initially, natural latex is poured into 
		a mold. the mold is then subjected to a vacuum to remove air bubbles and 
		ensure even distribution. next, the latex undergoes a freezing process 
		to solidify and set its structure. finally, the foam is baked to 
		vulcanize it, which enhances its durability and elasticity. this process 
		results in a foam that is highly resilient, offers excellent support, 
		and is more consistent in density and firmness compared to other latex 
		manufacturing methods.
