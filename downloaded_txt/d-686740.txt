	 wear khaki if you ❤ steve
	 
    


it may have been casual friday for us here in the states, but it was khaki friday down under. steve irwin fans were asked to wear khaki in honor of the famed croc hunter, who died monday after a stingray barb pierced his chest while he was diving at australia's great barrier reef for a documentary.

	 dolphin may get artificial tail
	 
    


winter, a 10-month-old bottlenose dolphin that lost her tail in crab trap, may be getting a new one. clearwater marine aquarium is hoping to raise about $100,000 to help pay for a rare operation so winter can get an artificial tail. she's learned to swim and play without her tail but instead of swimming up and down like a regular dolphin, she swims from side to side like a shark.

	 what is that ? ? ?
	 
    


a strange creature was found by russian soldiers on sakhalin shoreline, near japan and apparently, nobody knows what it is. according to the bones and teeth, it's not a fish. according to the skeleton, itâs not a crocodile or an alligator. oh, and it has hair or fur too.

	 shark-man is a hit!
	 
    


the premiere issue sold out in new york and los angeles in 4 days, and nationwide in 7 days. so this means there'll be a movie, right?shark-man tells the story of a death-row prisoner forced to protect a utopian city from the cancer of organized crime. hero tom gaskill has been falsely convicted of his father’s murder, as well as the theft of an entire city’s wealth. from the confines of an island prison, he must now find a way to protect new venice city, the ocean metropolis his father built, with the help of a submarine designed to be the ocean’s greatest weapon.

	 irwin's freak accident caught on film
	 
    


videotape of the moment steve irwin was hit by a stingray's tail shows irwin pulling the barb from his chest. he was following the stingray in shallow water when it must've felt threatened... it's tail came up and spiked him in the chest... he pulled it out and the next minute, he was gone. apparently, his heart was pierced, and he died almost immediately. the footage of the tragedy will most likely never be shown to the public. r.i.p. steve.

a surfer was attacked by a shark on the oregon coast tuesday night. tom larson was surfing with friends at the south jetty in florence when he felt a shark pull him off his board and bite into his foot. ouch! he beat the shark with his surf board until it let go, and then paddled to shore. he said it felt like a bear trap. it took 35 stitches to sew up the eight holes the shark left in his foot.
