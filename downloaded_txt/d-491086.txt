where legends roam
designed by legendary golf course architect donald ross, and summer home to golfing icon gene sarazen, lake sunapee country club is a journey back in time, giving golfers a fair but challenging test of golf. set amidst the beautiful new england countryside and its historic towns, the course offers dramatic views of the surrounding mountains within a serene rural setting. while lake sunapee is a private country club, we invite you to tour our website and learn more about our historic club.
