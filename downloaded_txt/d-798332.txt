~advanced energy technologies to
                  power human autonomy ~ 







goal: 


provide revolutionary new, compact,
                  efficient, human
        compatible, and lightweight power sources necessary
        for augmenting human endeavor and autonomy. 


mission:


bringing
                  together scientists of various fields
                  to conceive and develop new power production
                  strategies, solve systems design and
                  integration issues, and overcome manufacturing
                  obstacles, thereby establishing the
                technology of personal power systems
