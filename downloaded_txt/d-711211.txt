bringing broadway to the south suburbs since 1931

  

the drama group is one of the oldest continuously running volunteer drama groups in the nation.as we work our way toward our first 100 years, we continue to provide quality theatre at affordable prices and continue to put the community in community theatre - always welcoming and giving the community the opportunity to participate — whether it be onstage or off — and to become a member of this vital organization. the drama group exists through the benevolence of the community… through ticket subscriptions, fundraisers, patron donations, grants and advertising.with an active membership and interesting, varied seasons of quality productions, we are proud of our heritage and committed to a long future in the southwest suburbs.
