imax:  now open
an unforgettable experience
northern colorado's only imax
imax with laser: 70-ft screen!

sharpness: experience incredible detail in every image with a sharper, clearer and crisper picture that delivers a heightened level of realism on the biggest screens.
brightness: laser brings an increased level of brightness to fill imax screens with the most vivid and lifelike images in 2d and 3d.
contrast: dramatically greater contrast levels in each frame provides a level of depth that draws audiences into the movie.
color: the widest range of colors available to filmmakers so they can present more vibrant, deeper and richer colors in imax than ever before.
sound: whether it’s a pin drop or feeling the heart-palpating force of a volcano, with next generation imax precision sound, audiences will experience a new kind of powerful, immersive sound they can feel.

the imax auditorium offers plush luxury heated recliners.
