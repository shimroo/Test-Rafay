duluth georgia
is located in gwinnett county approximately 25 miles northeast of atlanta along highway 23. it sits on the banks of the chattahoochee river and is considered part of the atlanta metro area. the town of duluth is the second largest city in gwinnett county with a population of more than 22,000 residents. it has been an important crossroads in the area since the cherokee indians first settled here. in the early 1800s, there were no known white settlers in the area that is now the town of duluth, but in 1818, gwinnett county was created and the area was opened to settlers. at that time there was only one road in the region, known as peachtree road, which was an offshoot of an old indian trail that ran alongside the bridge south of the chatahoochee river. it had been constructed during the war of 1812, and today, peachtree road is still the most famous road in georgia. duluth has experienced rapid growth in the past several years, but has retained its hometown atmosphere and has thus become known as a suburban oasis. tourism is strong in the town of duluth where annual festivals and special events are held throughout the year. the town is also home to several beautiful parks and recreational opportunities, a 30-acre railway museum and summer concerts and outdoor movies shown on the town green on friday nights. the festive spirit of the townspeople was evident with a showing of the wizard of oz, where some people dressed up as characters in the movie for entertainment for the children. this is the type of great family fun that is typical in the town of duluth.
