				bosun's marine reviews				






what our customers say 






 




									procured a pursuit during the most challenging times (post covid) and bosun’s sales and management team treated me extremely well! i couldn’t be more pleased with the sale and service i’ve received so far. everyone there seems very service oriented and the entire staff is made up of very nice, pleasant and patient folks.								











anonymous  









									really enjoyed working with bosun’s marine – specifically jack flood and dave nothnagel. both were excellent during my visit and sea trial and both were great getting the boat ready to be hauled to detroit (from boston). i love my new s 2428 pursuit. i highly recommend bosun’s marine, jack and dave. thank you.								











dan s. 









									the most pleasant boat buying and trading experience i have had to date.  great communication, answered all of my questions quickly and all of the people i dealt with were very personable.  when i’m ready to move onto my next boat i will call bosuns first.  they definitely went the extra mile.
