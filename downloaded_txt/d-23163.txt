jasmine ramirez-miranda, '25"i chose the cpsy program because of the program’s commitment to provide students with the skills to support the provision of culturally relevant mental health services and research.what i most value since joining the program is the supportive and empowering cpsy student community, i could not imagine getting through the program without my fellow peers!"hands-on experiencethe counseling psychology program’s philosophy and goals have evolved over time to provide state-of-the-art training to students. our program has set forth a vision of what the counseling psychologist of the next few decades should be, and we make every effort to train our students to this vision. as a program that trains health service psychologists with an emphasis in counseling psychology, our students receive a core sequence of training sequence focused on evidence-based individual, child and family, and community and preventive interventions implemented in both clinical and community settings. this core training sequence helps students develop and apply clinical skills to a broad range of practice settings and populations, to assess and intervene in a manner relevant to the larger cultural, sociopolitical, and economic context in which humans develop, and to conduct and disseminate research that reflects and furthers efforts to improve individual and community well-being.hear from some of our faculty        success story
