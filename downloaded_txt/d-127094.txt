sunday service times










8:00 am rite i eucharist

quiet simplicity and traditional language (thee and thou) characterize our early service. the piano is played during the distribution of the bread and wine, and there is only one hymn with organ accompaniment at the end of the service. 











9:15 am family celebration

designed for families, this service includes bible readings, prayers, a message for children (no sermon) and communion. children are encouraged to participate fully by taking a role in the procession, reading, or collecting prayer requests. 











10:15 am rite ii eucharist

our largest service, this contemporary language service includes choir, organ, and congregational hymn singing. acolytes 10 yrs old and up assist the clergy and lay ministers. during communion, members of the order of st. luke offer healing prayer in the side chapel.
