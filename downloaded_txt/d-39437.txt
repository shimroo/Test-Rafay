frequently asked questions
















								how do i buy a private number plate?							




													
							buying a private number plate couldn’t be simpler. use our search features to check the availability of the number plate you want. if it's available, you can can purchase it through our website in full or through flexible finance options.
																		





								can i create my own number plate?							




													
							you can’t create a new registration plate, but you can use our database to find a valid licence plate that suits your taste. search by your name, initials, favourite football team, or anything else you like to check the number plate’s availability.
																		





								how long does buying a number plate take?							




													
							you could receive your private number plate in as little as 7 working days.
once the documents are received by the customer, these can be used to easily transfer the registration themselves with the dvla. full instructions on the reg transfer process will be included with the registration documents issued by absolute reg.
																		





								can i buy a number plate as a gift?							




													
							yes, number plates are becoming increasingly more popular as gifts. whether for someone’s birthday or engagement, a number plate can be the perfect personalised gift to give to a friend or family member.
at the checkout, simply enter the 'nominee name' of the person you would like to gift. we would then dispatch the order to the billing address, so you can keep the gift a surprise.
																		













								can i sell my number plate?							




													
							yes, in most cases you will be able to sell your private number plate to someone else. if you currently have a number plate registration you would like to sell or transfer, you will probably be eligible to do so under the 'cherished registration mark transfer scheme'.
																		





								can i put my private number plate on any car?							




													
							not quite, there are certain restrictions to adding dvla number plates to your car. for example, you cannot make the car look newer than it is. so you cannot add an 08 age identifier to a car that was registered in 2006.

																		





								can i put my private number plate on straight away?							




													
							before putting your new private number plate on your vehicle, you first need to get it approved. when you purchase a new number plate regardless of style, you need to send off an application to get it approved. once it has been approved you can go ahead and fit your dvla registration to your vehicle.
																		





								do you have to pay to put private number plates on a car?							




													
							no, you do not need to pay to put your private number plate on your car. you just need to apply by post or online, both of which are free. you will also need the vehicle’s log book (v5c).
