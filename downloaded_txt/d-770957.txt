improving protection for children born through surrogacy




burkina faso, cambodia, haiti, ivory coast, vietnam, chili: iss global program “a better future is possible” is designed to promote safe, nurturing family care for children out of parental care with a specific focus on children with disabilities (cwd). this includes supporting national care reforms for children in particular efforts towards family reunification, alternative family-based care, and influencing main stakeholders toward family care.learn more 

iss develops targeted projects to launch and support the institutionalisation of international family mediation. this project aimed to disseminate information and raise awareness about mediation practice to solve cross border family conflicts and to facilitate the access for families to specialized mediators. in 2014, the first guide on international family mediation was published to inform and accompany families and professionals.learn more 

iss publishes a monthly newsletter offering an analysis of the latest developments in the field of adoption and protection of children without families. each publication provides an information update on the evolution of laws and practices both at international and national level. for more information about publications, please check the dedicated section above.learn more 

from 2013, iss called for urgent international regulation of international surrogacy arrangements as they affect the children concerned. the initiative launched by iss in 2016 resulted in the verona principles for the protection of the rights of the child born through surrogacy, which were published in 2021 following a comprehensive consultation process as well as substantive contributions from over 100 experts covering multiple disciplines and perspectives, regions, national and international contexts.learn more
