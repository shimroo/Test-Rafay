“we strive to leave our world a better place than we found it through our care of the land, wildlife and people, and the delivery of extraordinary guest experiences in península valdés.”


– rincón chico & cpv team


the estancia rincón chico is an exclusive property located in the southeast corner of the península valdés with sixteen kilometers of coastline along the patagonian sea, one of the richest marine areas on earth harboring populations of right whales, elephant seals, sea lions, orcas -and other smaller dolphins-, penguins, and numerous species of birds and fish. for this reason the site was declared “world heritage site” in 1999 and “biosphere reserve” in 2014 by unesco.

the income generated from the lodge activities is invested directly in the projects that we are carrying out in península valdés, so with their visit all the guests are supporting conservación península valdés (cpv) a non-profit organization formed by a team of people involved in land and wildlife conservation projects in the península.

“99% of the península valdés, a unesco protected area, is made of private estancias with few public controlled accesses. by staying at rincón chico, you get a big slice of the place on an estancia which has been in the owners’ family for 5 generations. the soul and mood of the place is amazing and the wild is virtually at your doors.”
