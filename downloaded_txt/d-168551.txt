hello, and a warm welcome to the website of alastair mcintosh.   thank 
	you for visiting my home page. see below for  
	contact  
      details and my public itinerary. 
	the tabs above for 
	are for main themes, and links on the left include a classified index of my publications 
	and some other key ports of call.  

i grew up and was educated on the isle of lewis in the 
	outer hebrides of scotland,. 
	together with four years in the 1970-80s working with appropriate technology 
	in papua new guinea, my background gave me a grounding that has shaped my 
	life's work. much of this has focussed on land reform, community empowerment 
	and the psychology and even spirituality of the wider human condition.



	since 2004, my wife 

vérène nicolas 
	and i have lived within the parish boundary of govan 
	in the city of glasgow where i am a founding trustee of the 
	galgael trust. this 
	works to "demonstrate ways of living with greater humanity in our times", 
	helping one another to rebuild community and to counter unjust social 
	structures that impact upon a hard-pressed urban area. véréne is french. we 
	met in rural ireland in 1996, and she works with transformative learning and 
	collaborative leadership. 

nearly all of what i've posted on this website has been previously published 
	or delivered as an address. the resources here include landing pages for my 
	books, the text of speeches, academic papers, articles and letters in the 
	press, poetry, reports and some broadcasts. there's direct links to the past 
	year's publications at the bottom left column of this page. video etc. is 
	either on the
	interviews 
	menu, or provided as zoom recording links for the current and previous year 
	in my public itinerary lower down this page. 

 since 1996, my work has been mainly 
freelance as a human ecologist, 
	writer, speaker, researcher and activist. i am a quaker, an
	honorary senior research fellow (honorary professor) in the college 
	of social sciences at the university of glasgow, and as a fellow of the 
	centre for human ecology was scotland's first professor of human ecology at 
	the university of strathclyde. i have also held honorary fellowships at the 
	academy of irish cultural heritages (university of ulster), the school of 
	divinity (university of edinburgh) and the schumacher society.  

	 
what i do and stand for 
     this website broadly 
 represents my work in human ecology - 
	the study of and participation in relationships between the natural 
	environment and the social environment. my approach to this integrates depth 
	psychology and the spiritual. i understand the spiritual to be the inner 
	ground of being in which our outer lives are held. in this, i am especially influenced by
	
	liberation theology  in christianity and other 
	faiths, this being theology that liberates 
	theology to liberate humanity. in choosing what to work on, i therefore ask questions 
	like:

does what i do feed the hungry?
		
is it relevant to the poor or to 
		the broken in nature?
is it meaningful? 

does it give life?

in practice, this means working with professional 
	groups, communities and key individuals within them to develop their vision, 
	courage and capacity for practical change. it is the question of what gives 
	life that most binds my work together, work that often involves holding 
	seeming contradictions together in tension, and trying to approach matters 
	with what the celtic monks called 
	"the inward ear of the heart" (adomnán, columba, ii:13). 
my books have variously been described as "weaving a 
	dizzying range of ideas into a single bright fabric" by the poet john 
	burnside, "an inspiration to anyone who cares about their own connection to 
	place" by professor carolyn merchant, "a life-giving vision for our 
	collective future" by professor michael e. mann, "solid on the science yet 
	dedicated to the human spirit" by professor katharine hayhoe, "careful, 
	sober reasoning" by mary midgley, "a spiritual journey" by starhawk, 
	"world-changing" by george monbiot, "life-changing" by the bishop of 
	liverpool and "truly mental" by tom yorke of radiohead.
places at which i have spoken or taught include:

environmental organisations including
		the international union for the 
		conservation of nature, wwf international, the society for ecological 
		regeneration and schumacher college; 
religious bodies such as the 
		world council of churches, the holy trinity sergyev monastery and iona 
		abbey; 
military institutions (on 
		nonviolence) regularly at the uk defence academy, also the royal college 
		of defence studies, the école spéciale militaire de saint-cyr, the irish 
		military college and the geneva centre for security policy; 
business groups including 
groupe credit mutuel, shell plc, nokia 
		research centre and lafarge (on whose
		
	sustainability stakeholders' panel i sat for a decade);
university institutions including the 
russian academy of sciences, duke 
		divinity school, insead business school, the glasgow school of art and 
		the guildhall school of music and drama; 
festivals including the edinburgh international, 
		ashville wordfest, greenbelt, howthelightgetsin and the lochs 
		agricultural show back home in the isle of lewis.

 

background and availability for events
     born in 1955, all of my school education (1960-73) 
		took place 
		in the community where i was raised, on the isle of lewis in the outer 
		hebrides or western isles. a traditional scottish education allows for a 
		generalist worldview. i hold a bsc in geography from the university of aberdeen 
		(1973-77) submajoring in psychology and moral philosophy; a financial mba from 
		the university of edinburgh (1980-81); and a phd by published works in 
		liberation theology, land reform and community empowerment from the 
		academy of irish cultural heritages, university of ulster (2008). a cv 
		and short bio is 
		here. 
since 1996 i've made my living on an entirely self 
	employed basis - writing, broadcasting, keynote speaking at 
	events, workshops, retreats, taught courses and consultancy. for 
	availability see my 
	public itinerary, and a rough idea of the kind 
	of things i talk about at this list. 
	my personal financial accountability, my suggesting scale of charging for 
	events, and my approach to travel in the face of climate change are all given 

here. 
	i undertake live and online events, and have the technology to offer blended 
	events using zoom.the pandemic has caused 
	most face-to-face events to 
	have been cancelled or shifted online from 2020 into early 2022. however, i 
	am fully vaccinated, and for in-person invitations can 
	offer to bring and operate zoom-adequate cameras and studio-quality wireless 
	microphones to enable blended events.
i run this website to 
		represent myself professionally. its main purpose is to make my 
	published work readily available and to give events information. forgive it being 
	a  homespun website. i use antique frontpage software from the 
	last century, but it does a good enough job and i know how to manage it 
	myself. treat it as a retro experience.

for work issues please

			discuss something that requires much thought i prefer an email first 
			if possible to arrange a mutually convenient calling time. i am on 
			skype, facetime, whattsapp and zoom: but unless it is a pressing matter 
			please first try to arrange any call by email or text. 

			  
directions to our home/office:



			 
public transport: 
for public transport in 
			scotland, it is worthwhile downloading the
			traveline scotland 
			app. if coming from central glasgow, take the subway (underground train) 
			to either govan or ibrox. they're each one mile from our house. from 
			govan is a more interesting walk, but ibrox is a simpler route and 
			less congested if we're picking you up by car (see below if walking). from 
			either govan subway 
			station or the city centre (renfield st), you can get a
			mcgills route 26 
			bus to the second stop on craigton road, from where we're the next 
			street up on the right. the fare is £3.60 from town as of the start 
			of 2018). they're every 10 or 16 minutes during the day, but the 
			timetable is unreliable. our house is no. 
			26, half way along luss rd on the right. if coming from city 
			centre's queen st or central stations, the stops for the 26 bus are 
			on renfield street (extending onto union street). taxis up from govan are about £4, 
			from city centre about £12, and from the airport about £20.
			 
if walking from the 
			subway exit at ibrox, turn right 
			onto copland road. up to the lights and turn right. pass alongside 
			the rangers football stadium, go straight on over the first 
			roundabout, straight over the second roundabout, on to the lights, 
			turn right down craigton road, and luss road is the 5th exit on the 
			left (depending on what you count as an exit).  
by car: if coming 
			on the m8 from east or west, exit at junction 24 (helen street), 
			signposted for govan. head downhill and over the lights to a 
			roundabout, as if heading to the clyde tunnel. turn left at the 
			roundabout then right at the lights into a residential area, 
			craigton road (signposted to "elderpark workspace"). luss road is 
			the 3rd on the left (or 4th depending on what you count).  
if coming by car from the 
			north via the clyde tunnel, as you exit the tunnel prepare to take 
			the first left just at the tunnel's end. be careful - it comes on 
			you very quickly and it's easy to overshoot. this brings you out 
			onto govan road with a very large roundabout. turn right at this, 
			onto drive road, passing a elder park on your left. at the end of 
			drive road, keep the park on your left by turning left onto 
			langlands road. take the 3rd right, just before you lose the park, 
			onto arklett road, then 2nd right is luss road. 
avoid the m8 approaches if 
			you can when there's a football match on at ibrox. there may also be 
			parking congestion at such times. taxi drivers from outwith this 
			area do not know it well. tell them that you want luss road which is 
			off craigton road, and to take the helen street exit if 
			coming from the m8. 

			 
if you are viewing in ios or 
			similar "reader" mode,  temporarily "hide reader", or otherwise 
			turn it off, to view the timetable below and links above and to the 
			side. reader modes generally only let you see plain text. they don't 
			display a full web page with boxes, tables, etc..

                  table shows roughly which dates i'm booked up for, with 
					booking links and, often, links to previous events' video 
					recordings. that is why last year's activity is in the left

					booking me please
					click here. gaps 
					in the timetable do not necessarily signify availability, 
					especially over weekends, as this is not my private diary. 
					dates marked for delivery of thought for the day mean that i 
					have to be near a bbc studio early that morning and have 
					time on the previous day for preparation - though these 
					dates can sometimes be swapped with another presenter. events marked
                  "s.t.c." are "subject to consent/confirmation", 
					and it is always best to confirm the time and venue of events with the organisers'
