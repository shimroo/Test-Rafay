all international units must be accompanied by a commercial invoice containing the item description and commercial value. shipping from a storefront shipper (mailboxes, ups store)? supply us with a personal return address, phone number and contact name, not the address and phone number of the shipper! any units received in this manner will be sidelined until you contact dbm. what happens when your unit arrives?
