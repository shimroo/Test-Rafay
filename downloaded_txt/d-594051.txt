spiritual quotes
 
"to confess orthodoxy means to manifest humbly by one's life the fullness of the truth in love and righteousness. orthodoxy ought to conquer only by its radiance, as the lord himself, and by no means in arguments and by force. orthodoxy is darkened by whomever is proud of it. the truth of orthodoxy is open for the sake of mankind's salvation, and not for their condemnation and chastisement. orthodoxy is the sunlight that falls upon the earth. it shines for all who want to be warmed by its rays."
         - archpriest victor potapov
