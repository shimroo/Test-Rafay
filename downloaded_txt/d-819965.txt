                                            load moving container                                        













                            how to load a moving container to keep your stuff safe                        

using a moving container when you begin packing your belongings is a way to keep your items secure until you get them to your new home. there are a few tips to keep in mind when you load the container that will help in keeping your belongings safe and secure.

make sure everything is in a box or plastic tote before it’s put inside the container
secure each box so that it doesn’t come open while inside the moving container. stack the heaviest items on the bottom and the lighter ones on the top. this can help to keep belongings from toppling on top of each other and perhaps breaking while they are in the container.
position your container for easy transportation
when you’re ready to begin packing the contents of your home, the company that offers the container will deliver it to your home. it’s a good idea to have the container positioned close to your front door to make it easier to carry boxes from your home to put them inside the unit.
you can keep the container as long as you need it on your property, which is beneficial so that you don’t have to travel back and forth to a storage unit or worry about taking everything from your home to your new house right away.
a benefit of this kind of container is that you can monitor the safety of your belongings since it’s on your property. these containers are usually waterproof, keeping your belongings safe while they are stored.
try to use boxes that are about the same size
this will make packing them in the unit a bit easier instead of trying to stack them like a puzzle in the container. avoid packing your boxes with too many items because you don’t want them to be too heavy.
try to pack your belongings in the boxes that are used firmly so that they are protected while they are in the container. put tape on the bottom and on the top of each box.

make use of the container’s space
when you start putting boxes in the container, this apartment moving company recommends creating walls from the floor to the ceiling. this will offer a bit of added security if you can get them as secure as possible instead of leaving space between the boxes. pack your boxes along all sides of the container, leaving a pathway in the middle so that you can easily get the boxes that you need before you get to your new home and when you unpack the container. try to distribute the weight inside the container so that it’s even instead of putting all of your heavy belongings on one side and the lighter boxes on the other side. you can put soft items on top of boxes to provide a cushion of support, such as pillows, blankets, and sheets that you might not have packed in boxes.

                                            freight trucking business                                        













                            how uship, u-pack, and pods have affected the freight trucking business                        

if you moved to a new location before the 21st century, you probably hired a freight truck to move your belongings. traditional moving trucks were the standard option for most commercial and residential moves. nowadays, you have several transport options. mobile storage containers are an important part of the moving industry. making a long distance move is just plain hard, no matter which route you end up taking. now, at least consumers have a few more additional options than the “old fashioned” moving company.
mobile storage containers are convenient
you can move when you are ready. unlike a traditional moving truck, the storage container does not have to be returned immediately. if your new home is not ready, you do not have to search for a storage unit. your items can stay in the container for several weeks, so you only have to load and unload the container one time.
the ease of unpacking a mobile storage container
portable moving containers are easy to load and unload. when you rent a traditional moving truck, you usually have to pull your belongings up a ramp. mobile storage containers are on the ground, so you do not have to deal with any ramps or stairs. this important factor lowers the risk of you injuring yourself when you are moving heavy items.
you do not have to race the clock
time is on your side when you rent a mobile storage container. the mobile storage company will deliver the container to your home. if you have to change your plans, you do not have to pay extra fees for keeping the storage container a few more days. you also do not have to drive a large truck in heavy traffic.
a fixed fee schedule
most traditional moving companies have a variable fee schedule. portable storage containers are an inexpensive alternative. portable storage container companies have a fixed fee schedule. if your friends and family will help you move your household items, you will not have to worry about any additional fees. most portable storage companies offer professional moving services for a nominal fee.
safe and efficient delivery
your items will not be tossed around during the moving process. moving container storage companies use a specialized lift system. the lift system keeps items secured.
national and international relocation options
do you need to move your belongings to another continent? most traditional moving companies cannot transport your belongings to another country. some portable storage companies can assist you with international relocation.
greater security and peace of mind
portable storage containers offer greater security. you are the only person with a key to your storage unit. the portable storage containers are dropped off at your new home, and you can open the unit when you are ready to start unpacking your belongings.
portable storage containers are changing the logistics of moving. for many people, traditional moving trucks are still a great option. however, portable storage containers are perfect for most residential moves.
