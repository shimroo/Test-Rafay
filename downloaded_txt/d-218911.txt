ashtanga yoga is a system of yoga transmitted to the modern world by sri k. pattabhi jois (1915-2009). this method of yoga involves synchronizing the breath with a progressive series of postures—a process producing intense internal heat and a profuse, purifying sweat that detoxifies muscles and organs. the result is improved circulation, a light and strong body, and a calm mind.
