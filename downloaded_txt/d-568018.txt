pets are wonderful support (paws)
paws keeps people and their companion animals together.




we believe that no one should have to make the difficult choice of caring for themselves or caring for their beloved pets. paws provides free comprehensive animal support services that help older adults and adults with illnesses and disabilities care for their animal companions.
our services are designed to reduce the cost of caring for a pet as well as navigate clients through systems of veterinary care and pet support resources. paws offers clients pet food and supplies; veterinary care services (including financial assistance); and supportive pet care services (such as dog walking, pet fostering, in-home cat care). services are provided by staff and a corps of dedicated pet assistance volunteers.
due to high need, our client waitlist is currently closed. do you need help knowing where to go for low-cost vet care or for pet food? please contact infopaws@shanti.org for information about community resources.





this program serving the community is funded in part by the city of san francisco’s department of disability and aging services.
