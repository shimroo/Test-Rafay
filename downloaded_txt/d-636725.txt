welcome to the ssca!

the seven seas cruising association is the oldest and largest worldwide organization supporting the liveaboard cruising lifestyle. founded in 1952 by six liveaboard couples in california and now with members worldwide, today’s ssca remains true to the traditions of its original members — sharing cruising information, fostering camaraderie, and leaving a clean wake.
