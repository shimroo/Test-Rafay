what cholesterol tests can tell you





men and women who have a history of heart disease within their families may want to make themselves available for periodic cholesterol tests. these tests provide excellent information on the overall state of the arteries, which can ultimately help determine which people are at risk for heart disease later in life. physicians will administer the test and interpret the results. they will then usually assist the patient in developing a plan of action to lower their cholesterol levels. if the test shows, on the other hand, that someone is in overall good health, then he/she will only need to maintain what they've been doing in terms of diet and nutrition.the tests should allow people to determine how much they need to modify their lifestyles. individuals who eat a lot of meats and cheeses will likely end up with cholesterol problems. if they want, they can begin working with nutritionists to develop better meal plans. eating a lot of fruits and vegetables should bring the bad cholesterol numbers down. fiber will also help to push some of the bad food products through the digestive tract at a faster pace. whole grain breads, beans, and other legumes are all excellent sources of both fiber and antioxidants.men and women should also give physical exercise a try. if they can build up the strength of the heart, the circulatory system will be able to pump blood throughout the body much easier. some medical professionals believe that this will facilitate the removal of artery-hardening plaque from the body altogether. exercisers can begin slowly, perhaps by walking a mile or two a few times per week. once they have reached a base level of fitness, they can begin to jog or even run. as added motivation, they might even enter a five-kilometer road race with a good group of friends. the cholesterol should come way down.older individuals who have not had a full examination for many years should consider the benefits of cholesterol tests. if they are obese, inactive, or have been suffering from dizziness or chest pains, then a full suite of tests will likely be needed. physicians will examine the lipid profile and suggest lifestyle modifications to their patients. individuals might even be immediately put on some kind of medication, which will help lower the cholesterol while dietary changes are in the process of being made. patients may eventually be removed from the medication once their overall health profile becomes much better. as long as they stick with their nutritional changes, they should be fine as they move forward with their lives.the information contained in this article is provided for informational purposes only and is not, nor is it ever intended to be, a substitute for professional medical advice or professional recommendations, diagnosis, or treatment. always seek the advice of your physician(s) or other qualified healthcare provider(s).

six unusual tips to get six pack abs





there is nothing quick or magical about getting a six pack. getting ripped abs can be long and tedious. it takes time, hard work, and dedication. by making the right decisions each day, you can get a six pack. however, if you frequently cheat like most people, then you will never see your abs. follow these six tips to get a six pack.your body requires water! you need to start your day by hydrating. researchers found that drinking 16 ounces of cold water first thing in the morning boosts metabolism by 24 percent for 90 minutes afterward. drink at least a gallon of water over the course of a day for hydration, health, and to keep your metabolism burning.don't skip breakfast. a study found that people who skip breakfast are 4.5 x more likely to be overweight. so make sure you eat within an hour after waking up. i like to eat 3 hardboiled eggs and an apple to get my metabolism going first thing in the morning.review your goals at least once each month. it's important that you stay aware of your goals and that you are taking the appropriate actions to achieve them. scientists found that people who monitored their diet and exercise goals were much more likely to progress their fitness level.bring your lunch with you to work. i have a whole compartment of my bag that is devoted to protein filled snacks. success starts at the grocery store and buying the right healthy snacks. some of my favorite healthy snacks are tuna pouches, protein bars, peanut bags, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and deli meats. by eating five times per day, you'll keep your body well fed and satisfied throughout the day without overeating. you will also have the necessary fuel needed for your workout. equally important is a reduction in sugar cravings from keeping your insulin level stable throughout the day.it's easy to forget that everyone has abs. the problem is that most people have too much fat on top to ever see them underneath. so instead of focusing on doing a billion crunches, you should focus on burning fat during your workouts. some of the best ways to burn fat in a short amount of time are sprint interval training, 45-60 minutes of moderate intensity cardio, and high intensity interval training workouts. mixing up your routine is crucial for continued results.getting a six pack requires sleep. that's because lack of sleep disrupts the hormones that control your fat burning ability. scientists recently found that lack of sleep can cause your muscle cells to become resistant to the hormone insulin. this will eventually lead to fat and weight gain.

hearing test: do you need one?





not everyone necessarily needs a hearing test, but some people would benefit from it. if you are not sure if you do, you can always ask your doctor, or just get one anyway. there are also some warning signs that you should get one.one of the signs that you should schedule a hearing test is when your ears hurt for no apparent reason. if you cannot figure out why, you should try to have them looked at by a professional. you may have a simple ear infection, or there may be a larger issue behind the pain. a professional can take a look and find out if the problem has compromised your ability to hear. if not, he or she might be able to diagnose the issue, or at least refer you to a doctor who can treat you. if your ability to hear has in fact been reduced, the professional you see might be able to diagnose the issue and get you the equipment or treatment you need to hear better.another sign that you need a hearing test is that you have noticed you cannot hear as well as before. if other people can hear things that you cannot, you need to find out the problem. it can usually be fixed with some treatment, or at least with the proper device for your ears. an exam can let you know how severe the problem is, which can guide the practitioners in getting the treatment you need. this is important since it can be dangerous and uncomfortable to continue on without addressing your decreased ability to hear.in addition, you should get a hearing test if you have had ear problems in the past. if you are known for medical issues with ears, including partial deafness that seems to have gotten worse, or frequent ear infections, you should get an exam. the same goes if you are older, since you tend to lose your ability to hear easily as you age. you may need either treatment or devices for your ears in order to hear as well as you used to.after your hearing test, the staff at the clinic you choose will likely tell you your options. you will likely be shown any devices that can help, or given a referral to a doctor who can treat you. no matter what the treatment ends up being, you deserve to get an accurate diagnosis quickly so you can start to hear better soon.

compliments to botox injections





there is a lot of talk about how effective botox injections are for a variety of uses all over the body for a wide range of patients. most patients, whether they are male or female, turn to this injectable solution for the effect it has on wrinkles throughout the common culprit sections of the face. but when it comes to the long-term impact of the benefits from the solution, patients are turning to complimentary treatments and procedures in order to reap the full benefits of the momentarily relaxed muscles. within three to four monthr of the initial treatment, the smoothed skin is ripe for resurfacing and deep moisturizing. the relaxed muscles allow the relaxed skin to absorb topical treatments a lot better. this gets a lot of patients back in to their cosmetic specialist's and dermatologist's offices in order to use this opportunity to make changes that can last beyond the three to four months of the botox injections.many men and women opt for non-surgical compliments and at-home treatments in order to get the most out of their botox injections. after all, the solution's effect is only to relax the muscles that facilitate the repetitive movements that cause wrinkles in aging and dehydrated skin. because it is diluted for safety and applied in small amounts in strategic zones, its effects will not last forever. so, one of the most significant compliments to this procedure is the chemical peel. whether the patient chooses microdermabrasion or hyaluronic acid (chemical) peel, in office, these treatments have been shown to have a transformative effect on the appearance of fine to medium lines, as well as age spots and scarring. so when the injections do begin to wear off, it would appear that time has stood still, if not actually reversed with regard to the skin on the patient's face.he or she can also opt for at-home topical treatments that are either prescribed by their dermatologist or cosmetic specialist, or purchased from a trusted cosmetic company. these products include the alpha hydroxyl and other chemical and antioxidant rich elements that absorb into the smooth skin either during the day, or in a night cream to create lasting support to the freshly youthful appearance of the face.the effects of botox, like any other beauty regime, have been shown to improve with consistent repetition in regular intervals. but the more you utilize compliments to your beauty regime, the better the results will be within your skin for years to come.

things to consider when you choose a plastic surgeon





as you consider your options for plastic surgery, do you ever think about who your plastic surgeon is? did you screen your surgeon to see if he or she were the most qualified candidate for the job, or did you just pick your plastic surgeon based off of some friend's recommendation? if you did the latter without giving a thought as to how it may affect you, you may want to reconsider whom you have in charge of your plastic surgery.just because your friend had a great experience does not necessarily mean that you will too. there are some things you need to take into consideration, like whether or not you are having the same procedure done, whether you and your friend have the same genetic and physical makeup and whether or not your friend took the time to screen their plastic surgeon before getting any work done.this may seem like a lot for you to think about, but when you look at the situation more closely, you will see that they are some very important points that need to be addressed. you don't want to be in a position where the surgeon who is in charge of your plastic surgery really isn't certified, licensed or doesn't have a good reputation. when it comes to your health, you need to take every precaution to ensure that nothing happens that can cause you to be uncomfortable.you may assume that just because a doctor practices that they are able to do so legally. that is not always the case. since doctors and other medical professionals often incur a huge amount of debt before they are eligible to practice on their own, they have to make sure that they pay back their student loans without defaulting on them. if they default on their loans, then they lose their license to practice until the situation is cleared up. there are other situations can also contribute to having their plastic surgery license revoked.the problem with not properly screening your plastic surgeon is that if you get an operation and something goes wrong, then you don't have much legal recourse. it is up to you to do your homework. not only do you end up disfigured, injured or even dead, there is not much anyone can do as far as legal compensation, unless it is discovered that they misled you in the first place.you want to have the best experience possible, and to do that you need to have the best possible work on your body. after all, you wouldn't hire an unlicensed contractor to work on your house, so why would you hire and unlicensed doctor to work on your body. if you are smart, you will screen any professional by whom you plan on having any medical work done before you commit to any procedure. in the long run, you will be happy that you did.

medical spa: services commonly offered





scheduling an appointment at a medical spa is much more than just an appointment at the local salon. a doctor oversees the entire facility and works with patients to perform special treatments that require a certain expertise. these facilities often encompass the benefits of a traditional salon, a dermatology office, and a physician's office. here are a few of the services most commonly offered at these establishments.laser hair removal: unwanted hair often brings patients into a medical spa. they want to find out which options are available so that they no longer have use for their razors and shaving creams. it takes multiple appointments to get successful results and with a doctor overseeing the process, clients feel confident that they are in good hands.technology is constantly evolving when it comes to laser hair removal and these types of facilities offer clients the most up to date opportunities for effective treatments. all appointments should be planned out in advance, as there are some time constraints between appointments that must be adhered to.skin tightening and injections: professionals at a medical spa can administer products like juvederm and botox. the overall idea is to gain a more youthful appearance while diminishing wrinkles and making the skin look smoother. both men and women sign up for these injections to turn back the clock and present a fresh, well-rested appearance to the public. the effects are often immediate and there is very little down time. many clients come into the facility at lunchtime and return to work immediately following.microdermabrasion: in addition to a facial, a medical spa often offers microdermabrasion. during the procedure, the facial skin is exfoliated, with the dead skin cells being removed. while there are over the counter products that can give some results, the use of ultrasonic waves can also rid the skin of some other imperfections including dark spots and even dark circles under the eyes. when the new skin is revealed, a person's face looks cleaner, brighter and overall a person often seems rejuvenated.more traditional services: aside from those treatments that must be administered by a physician, a medical spa also offers more traditional services. massages and pedicures are common requests. sometimes a client will come in looking for a complete day of treatments. it is not unusual to have someone set up a microdermabrasion appointment to be followed up with a massage or pedicure.if you are interested in any of the mentioned treatments, it is important to set up an appointment in advance. because certain services will require a follow up appointment, scheduling should be figured out as early as possible to ensure that it fits into a person's schedule.

top 7 tips to achieve total health and wellness





since i love music, i find myself continually drawn to associating harmony in any area of life to music. in a typical choir, there are four (4) principal voice types - soprano, alto, tenor & bass - and all are necessary to bring full tonal quality and harmony to the choir.we all have a mind, a body and a spirit. it should therefore serve as no surprise that, in order to achieve total health and wellness, we need to take care of all three (3) parts of ourselves - mind, body and spirit. don't focus on any one part to the disadvantage of the others, since all are required to bring balance to the human person.in this article, i will provide you with seven (7) simple, practical and effective tips that you can start using immediately to improve and maintain your overall health and wellness. tip 1 focuses on your spiritual health. tips 2, 3 and 4 focus on your physical health. tips 5 and 6 focus on your emotional health. the final tip, tip 7, focuses on a frequently overlooked area, your mental health.1. dedicate 30 minutes to god each day in prayer, reflection and thanksgiving.every day you are blessed with 1440 minutes to live your life. thirty (30) minutes only amount to a mere 2% of your entire day. god, the giver of life, deserves some of your day. read and reflect with daily devotionals, spiritual and/ or religious books (holy bible, qur'an, torah, tripitaka, bhagavad-gita, tao-te-ching, books of l. ron hubbard or other sacred texts). this will increase your knowledge of your religion, strengthen your spirit, improve your personal relationship with god, improve your relationship with your fellow human beings, help you with your daily living and bring you inner peace.2. keep physically fit.the key to achieving physical fitness is paying attention to exercises that strengthen your core muscles. your core muscles are all those varied muscles in your chest, abdomen, upper back, lower back and sides. there are several benefits to be derived from a strong core - a flat stomach, a strong back, good posture, reduced strain on the spine, effective transfer of power to your arms and legs to lift, move or carry stuff around, greater mental alertness, greater flexibility and a good heart.3. eat nutritious and healthy food.there is a widely circulated myth that foods that are nutritious and healthy are not tasty. like i indicated, it is a myth and the best way to ensure that your food intake is healthy, nutritious and that you are getting all of the required vitamins and nutrients that your body needs is by:(a) eating from the 5 major food groups each day - grains, vegetables, fruits, milk, meat & beans.(b) eating a "rainbow diet", that is, one that contains as many, if not all, of the colours of the rainbow - red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and purple. each food colour provides a different set of vitamins and micro-nutrients. for example, green foods such as spinach, are a good source of vitamin a, folic acid, vitamin c, magnesium and iron. regular consumption of spinach fights anaemia and improves eyesight.(c) using a good multi-vitamin supplement, to satisfy any nutritional deficiencies you may have.(d) drinking your recommended eight (8) glasses of water each day. drink one (1) glass at various intervals throughout the day to assist your body in the efficient elimination of waste and toxins.4. take good care of your skin.your skin serves four (4) principal functions as follows:i. protection from external elements.ii. a sort of sensor with nerve endings that cause you to react appropriately to pain, heat, cold, touch, pressure, vibration and tissue injury.iii. a heat regulator that accordingly pumps blood to your skin's surface or reduces blood flow.iv. your largest waste eliminator (surface wise) through sweating or perspiring.additionally, as you age, your skin naturally becomes drier, less elastic and produces more wrinkles. however, you can significantly slow down this aging of your skin and help your skin in its elimination process by keeping your skin continuously moist and hydrated through the following simple skin care routine.skin care routinedrink plenty of water; 8 glasses each day. eat looks of yellow and orange fruits which provide vitamin a. take a good vitamin e supplement. eat cucumbers, which supply sulphur - a trace element that is necessary for healthy skin!! also use water-based moisturizing creams or olive oil on the skin, immediately after bathing to keep moisture locked into your skin.5. take a 30-minute "time-out" at least once a week.i know this sounds easier said than done, especially if you have children or take care of elderly parents or relatives. so let's look at it from a different angle. if you suddenly became very ill or died, god forbid, the children and relatives would be somehow taken care of. maybe not as well as you, yes, but they would manage. well in order to ensure that you are around long enough to provide the best continuous care, the way you alone can do it, is to take a break!!! find your relaxing space: take a walk on the beach or in the park while listening to nature or music on your ipod; relax on your bed listening to music; curl up in your favourite chair with a cup of tea or chocolate and read a good book; sit on a park bench and watch people pass by...or whatever else relaxes you. this will clear your head and give you renewed energy to go again.6. practice contentmentin the natural ebb and flow of life and living, there are high points and low points, seasons of plenty and seasons of scarcity. happiness is not derived from the abundance, number or type of material things we have. that's why we sometimes see examples of millionaires who are drug addicts or alcoholics. added to that, there is the "law of diminishing returns". what this basically says is that the more we get of something up to a certain point, the less likely the added quantities of that thing is going to increase our happiness quota. it's like, if i got one (1) lamborghini - i am on a high, summersaults can't express my happiness, i could hug everybody i meet. if i got two (2) more lamborghinis - well that's ok. i mean i really won't feel as euphoric as that first time and in any case, how many can i drive at any one time?contentment is the ability to be happy in both the sparse and abundant seasons of our lives and it is not dependent on our circumstances. we need to develop this spirit of contentment in order to positively contribute to our overall health, happiness and well-being. this does not mean that we should not strive for better but it means that like the old west indian say goes, "we shouldn't hang our hats where our hands can't reach", in order to keep up with the jones'.7. take the care of your mind seriously.stress and depression are two (2) of the biggest thieves of mental and emotional health, globally. not only are they globally prevalent but they also lead to more serious mental problems such as dementia, alzheimer's, suicide and insanity.in fact, "the world health organization estimates that more than 450 million people [worldwide] suffer from mental disorders, and a new report by the world economic forum figures the annual global costs of mental and neurological illnesses at $2.5 trillion. that is three times the economic cost of heart disease 'global mental health issues woefully overlooked', public radio international."so stress and depression must be dealt with and arrested almost immediately in order to avoid more serious health problems. depression is a natural phase that we all experience in our lives primarily due to loss of loved ones, work issues, job loss or money/financial issues. however, the key to ensuring that stress and depression do not get out of hand, is engaging in activities that move your mind away from the problem causing the stress or depression and move you to a better mental space, despite the problem at hand. you can improve and maintain the health of your brain by incorporating some of these simple techniques into your daily living.simple mental health care solutionsboard games, puzzles & quizzesplaying board games and solving puzzles & quizzes all provide your brain with a mental workout by improving your memory, concentration, problem solving skills and preventing cognitive decline.listening to musicalthough seemingly simple, music soothes the mind and spirit, helps the body relax, relieves mental and emotional stress and tension, stimulates the senses and energizes the body.writingthere are many great online writing communities, such as ezinearticles and squidoo, which accept articles on just about any topic that you would be interested in. again, you will be exercising your brain, since to write an excellent article you will need to do some research to supplement your knowledge of the area.hobbies and sportsengage in group activities, social clubs or sports that interest you (tennis, horse riding, soccer, football, cricket, karate, sewing, yoga, tai chi, basketball, volleyball, swimming, singing, dancing etc.). anything that you are naturally inclined to and that makes you feel happy while doing it. if you can't seem to find a sport or hobby that interests you, check out the world's largest list of hobbies (see the link below). you're bound to find something that's right for you and that you'll enjoy.
