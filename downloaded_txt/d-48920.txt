south africa travel
'a world in one country'
to call south africa 'beautiful' comes only close to describing the unequalled diversity enfolded in its vastness. from the sandswept, icy waters of the cape west coast to the sunbaked savannah of the limpopo there are terrains too numerous to absorb in one visit - south africa is the smörgåsbord of the african continent.
cape town's iconic table mountain and cape point, namakwaland's annual spring flower symphony, the epic peaks of the drakensberg, the kruger national park's wildlife-filled plains, the shopping bonanza and heartbeat of jo'burg's nightlife, the implausible scenic beauty of the blyde river canyon and god's window in mpumalanga, and the five ecosystems of the isimangaliso wetland park on south africa's elephant coast - there is magic in every corner of our country.
whether you are here to experience everything, or simply to explore the beaches, the mountains or the wine routes, there is seldom a traveller who has not found something on our shores at which to marvel. whatever your choice, sa-venues.com makes it easier to travel in south africa.
