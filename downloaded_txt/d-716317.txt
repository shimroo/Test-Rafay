sonia flew



friday, may 2 - sunday, may 11, 2025



by melina lópez



directed by amelia lumpkin



when sonia learns of her son’s decision to leave college, enlist in the military and fight against terror in afghanistan in the weeks following 9/11, memories of her own childhood overwhelm her. she struggles to reconcile being forced as a young girl to leave cuba at the dawn of fidel castro’s rule with her own responsibilities as a mother facing uncertainty. sonia must find a way to come to terms with her past, her lost parents, her own children and her adopted country—or risk losing everything that she loves.
