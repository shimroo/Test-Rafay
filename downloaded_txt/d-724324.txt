a kaleidoscope itself is a constant changing pattern of elements and the book does that with style. it’s a unique, genre-bending collection of five short stories and a novella. an old gunfighter, accompanied by a billy-the-kid wannabe, arrives in the weird wild west to claim a bounty, but triggered by mistaken identity, the pair run afoul of the supernatural. the week before the unexpected covid-19 pandemic, we have a magical realism tale about a middle-class black family who reveal their innermost thoughts and experience. there’s also surrealism, medieval fantasy, sci fi, and dystopian stories in the book as well.














“not only is ‘the witness’ well written, it is also philosophically intriguing.” — caitlin park, reader”delightfully weird.”— david rogers, author“….unusually entertaining work. a western, and a mystery and even a bit supernatural thriller, set in the early days of america.”— jack rochester, author, publisher, creator

about derrickborn and raised in newark, nj. currently working as an it engineer. i’ve been writing stories since i had the strength to pick up a pencil. as a child it was comic books, but i had no talent for drawing. all focus on plot.later my main focus was screenplays, and short films. a few of which were produced. however, once i discovered how much freedom and control i had with fiction i never looked back. i practice the craft heavily, in micro, short, and novel form. experimenting with genres, prose and tone, i’m emulating my heroes such as the cohen brothers and david mitchell. not boxed in to any particular field.self proclaimed cinephile. when i’m not working on stories or novels, i’m either partying, watching anime, or playing chess.
