 who we are
 proudly serving america with designer doors & stained
glass windows since 1972

 doors


“a well designed door compliments a home or building. it neither overwhelms nor is overwhelmed by the surrounding architecture.
the two co-exist to the betterment of both.”








 stained glass windows


“stained glass will provide a brilliant and ever-changing element enhancing the interior decor of every room it occupies.
as the sun moves . . . so will your patterned light.”

we wanted to write a personal thank you for our five star experience at jennifer’s glass works.  from the beginning working with simon to our last phone call with the most caring carol we remain “impressed” by the way you do business.  installation was flawless and we love our glass window!  thank you for keeping a dying art alive and well and doing it with utmost professionalism.  we will highly recommend jgw to everyone.

just a belated note to say thank you for the excellent work and the truly beautiful window you and your folk created for us.  it is a work of art we will cherish.
it has been a pleasure meeting and working with you.
best wishes,

i just wanted to drop you a note to thank you and your team for the beautiful entry leaded glass windows you created for our forever home in beaufort, south carolina.  the attention to detail in every aspect of your work is fantastic.  the colonial lead work is superb and i consider myself to be a pretty good stained/leaded glass designer.  i can’t hold a candle to you guys.
as you know, this entry way will be on the front of our home down on the inter-coastal waterway, just north of hilton head island.  i will think of you guys every time i walk through that front door.  i am extremely proud to have a piece of jennifer’s work adorning our new home.  thanks for making it all work out.  i’ll send you pictures once it’s installed after the new year.
best regards and happy holiday’s to everyone at jennifer’s,
beaufort, sc
