	 save money on vitamins and more at iherb.com
	 
    

for the past 10 plus years or so, i've ordered my vitamins and some health food grocery items from iherb.com, an online store featuring natural products at discount prices. i learned about iherb from a friend and i'm passing this information to you if you're interested in purchasing quality health products at low rates. one of the best deals is ups shipping at a $4 flat rate although you can get free shipping over $40. on occasion, iherb will have shipping specials, sometimes free shipping for all, as well as other types of specials. i also appreciate the free products which you can select from for every shipment. if you're interested in ordering from iherb, check out the website first. if you like what you see, use this coupon code, ene422 and save $5 on your first order.

	 abraham on illness
	 
    

"you could stand here sick with ten illnesses today, and tomorrow have no evidence of any of them. your body has the ability to replenish itself that fast. but most of you do not have the ability to change your thoughts that fast. so the amount of time that it takes between sickness and wellness is only the amount of time that it takes for me to figure out how to let it in -- for me to figure out how to feel good, when i'm looking at something that makes me feel bad."~ abraham

	 natural medicine talk
	 
    

recently, i discovered a very interesting health forum called, natural medicine talk, located at http://www.natmedtalk.com/ it's created for those interested in all aspects of health and illness, with a focus on alternative health.when visiting this site, the first thing one notices is the wide variety of forums to choose from. they range from men's health, women's health and nutrition to cancer, diabetes and alternative therapies. alternative therapies is one of my favorite topics and i may be sharing some of personal experiences there in the near future. nutrition is another, longtime favorite subject of mine.also, registering at natural medicine talk is so easy to do, it just takes a couple of minutes of your time. then you can post all of the information you want to, ask any health related questions you may have or simply help others with your knowledge. it's free to join also.in the near future, i believe practice of alternative, holistic health care will become the norm in the united states (as it already is in some countries), dramatically changing health care as we know it. natural medicine talk will continue to grow as a valuable resource, enlightening people everywhere. check out the health forum for yourself and tell your friends.labels: alternative health, health, holistic, natural medicine
