welcome to the society of happy people‚Äôs home on the web!
thank you for visiting.

i‚Äôm pamela gail johnson, founder of the society of happy people, cpc (certified professional coach), speaker, and author of practical happiness: four principles to improve your life.
i believe my mission on earth and purpose in life is to make the world a happier place. and that starts with helping people feel happier one person at a time.

















way back in 1997, i wondered where all of the happy people hung out. it was the height of the self-help movement so there was a lot of focus on what you didn‚Äôt like about your life.
after the encouragement of friends and strangers in 1998 i started the secret society of happy people to give mostly happy people their own tribe.
after 20 years, and hundreds, maybe thousands, of interviews we dropped the ‚Äúsecret‚Äù because we really weren‚Äôt a secret anymore. now, we‚Äôre simply the society of happy people‚Ä¶
and, our goals are still the same‚Ä¶
¬†
help people recognize more happiness‚Ä¶
celebrate more happiness with our three international holidays‚Ä¶

happiness happens day
happiness happens month
hunt for happiness week

and of course, learn the secret membership code ‚Äì we still have to have a little fun, right?
