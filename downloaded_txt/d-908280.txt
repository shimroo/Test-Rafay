engaging every neighbor with the surprising power of grace

worship at ompc  |  sundays, 8:15 & 10:45 am















join us on sundays as lead pastor caleb click walks us through the second half of the book of mark, a series he began in spring 2024. if the first half of mark is all about who jesus is, the back half is about what he's come to do. jesus upsets all his disciples' expectations for the messiah by relentlessly pointing them towards the necessity of the cross while also showing his heart for us because as awful as the cross is, he never turns away from it. he has come not to be served but to serve and give his life as a ransom for many (mark 10:45). the cross is ever before jesus, and he would have it be ever before his ransomed people as we follow after him. join us for worship on sundays at 8:15 or 10:45 am. new to ompc? click here to view our newcomers page!
