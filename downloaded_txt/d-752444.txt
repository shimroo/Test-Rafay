kurt ribak
                            interview

 



 kurt was interviewed
              by bandleader / singer/songwriter / guitarist george
                cole for his hot jazz network podcast - you
              can find the podcast on spotify, amazon,
              podtail,
              apple






                  podcasts, and elsewhere.



 






 sfjazz wrote some really
                                  nice stuff about my band:
  
 joyous,











































































                              grooving, bluesy, sophisticated and
                              masterful" could all be accurately use to
                              describe bassist and composer kurt ribaks
                              music, but perhaps an assessment is best
                              left to the man himself, who calls his
                              rollicking mix of bebop sophistication and
                              body-moving grooves charles mingus meets
                              the meters. ribak brings his superb
                              working quartet, performing music from
                              their most recent album "onward."
  
 a berkeley
                      native, ribak parlayed his formative musical
                      experiences as a cellist and member of the san
                      francisco boys chorus into a passion for the bass,
                      studying at cal berkeley and bostons berklee
                      college of music before returning to the east bay
                      and establishing a well-deserved reputation as one
                      of the most respected creative forces on the
                      scene. at the top of his creative game, ribak
                      suffered a devastating injury in a 2012 car
                      accident that shattered his left arm and led to a
                      dozen surgeries, leaving the bassists musical
                      future in serious doubt. through extensive
                      physical rehab and endless persistence, ribak
                      re-learned to play and eventually returned to the
                      bandstand, and it is this hard-won struggle to
                      reclaim his life and career that led to onward,
                      his most personal statement to date. with a
                      renewed sense of urgency and the accompaniment of
                      his telepathic quartet, including saxophonist
                      lincoln adler and keyboardist greg sankovich, kurt
                      ribak is back for the long haul."

                  asked me to write about my injury and recovery here: https://www.sfjazz.org/onthecorner/kurt-ribak-interview/.

"kurt's ability to
                  take you on a journey from the deepest waters of the
                  caribbean to the funky alleys of the urban jungle in
                  one listening makes him a truly gifted original in my
                  book." - chris cortez, kcsm fm announcer
