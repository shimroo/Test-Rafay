welcome to eliot chapel's sunday service! 
  



sunday, february 9 – 9:45 & 11:15 am“welcoming back what we’ve excluded” –  rev. krista taves  there are many reasons we leave parts of ourselves behind. sometimes letting go frees us to embrace who we’ve become. other times we let things go that make us whole. how do we welcome those things back? featured musicians: megan dempsky, songleader; liz sale, flute; mary nistler, piano; david nalesnik, piano and flute find our previous services on
eliot's youtube channel!

   what should i wear?

   




  there is no dress code at our church. people wear what they are most comfortable in, and it varies from "sunday best" to shorts and sandals or jeans and a sweatshirt, or anything in between.

 next at eliot chapel
sunday, february 16 – 9:45 am and 11:15 aminclusion as a public practice – rev. krista tavesin our current political climate, being inclusive has become a radical, counter-cultural practice. what can we offer our country at this time?



   

 each of us has worth and dignity, and that worth includes our gender and our sexuality. as unitarian universalists, we not only open our doors to people of all sexual orientations and gender identities, we value diversity of sexuality and gender and see it as a spiritual gift. we create inclusive religious communities and work for lgbtq justice and equity as a core part of who we are.
all
of who you are is sacred.
all
of who you are is welcome.
