since 1998
nuevo santander gallery has been the place to visit when looking to acquire museum quality old west arms, antiques and fine mexican collectibles. original paintings and sculptures by internationally recognized artists are presented in a historically fashioned setting.
















located in the thriving arts district of mcallen, texas.our antique collection in the gallery includes guns, military uniforms, furniture, and religious pieces dating from as far back as the 1700's. since many of their artifacts tell the story border life on the rio grande and of colonial mexico, we designed our gallery to have the warmth and charm of a spanish mission.european antiques and a selection of reference books are also offered for sale. nuevo santander gallery gives you the chance to own a part of history at a reasonable price. the gallery is part of the historic old town mcallen.
