welcome to
                    space in miniature
my youtube channel

this is a reminder that i
                    regularly post short videos of my space modeling
                    projects on youtube. these are mostly work in
                    progress videos so you can see how i build my
                    models. most are only about five minutes long so
                    they won't eat up your entire day. these started
                    with the buran series in early 2020, and there are
                    also my old facebook videos on the gemini series, as
                    well as building the dragon 1/72 scale apollo "lunar
                    approach" kit, and building a series of space
                    shuttle kits, including those featured in the new
                    update of sim 3.1. in late 2024, i built another
                    detailed 1/48 gemini model as a commission job, and
                    the process was covered in a series of short videos.

another
                  gemini concept



over











                  the last few years i have been researching and
                  building models of spacecraft concepts that involved
                  gemini spacecraft. back in the 1960s, it seems any
                  future space station had geminis as logistics
                  vehicles. of course, none ever got built. i documented
                  most of these in sim 9 - building gemini.

                  but i keep finding more. the latest is a 1962 usaf
                  early space station concept called "military orbital
                  development system (mods). i recently finished that
                  project, and as is my habit, i kept notes and took
                  photos. there is a video series on this as well on my
                  youtube
                    channel.  i dont expect to publish this in
                  any sim volumes, so i am offering the build article as
                  a free download. it's on the sim 9
                    page on this website.

sim 3.1 space shuttle

                after building out my stash of several buran kits early
                in 2020, the next logical project was to clear out my
                space shuttle kits. i decided to build some and sell the
                excess. as i had never done a detailed orbiter model
                with an open payload bay, that would create a great
                opportunity to document that process and include it in
                an update of sim #3 - space shuttle. the original
                edition of this booklet just had a single article (from
                dave hanners) on building a 1/144th scale space shuttle
                so for this update there are several more. i had long
                ago built a 1/72 monogram orbiter as columbia, a 1/144
                full stack, an enterprise on the 747 carrier, and even a
                shuttle-c. for this book, weve got an updated version
                of hanners article, my sts-79 atlantis at mir, a
                detailed look at dragons 1/144 orbiter, and a 1/72
                build essay from jay chladek. the result is a monster
                book at 64 pages, even after deleting some material that
                became obsolete or dated.


                the updated book can be ordered at the order























                                form in a printed























                or pdf format. a hard copy sells for $12
                    plus shipping, while a pdf download costs $10. a
                    combination package of both the hard copy and
                    digital version is available for only $15 plus
                    shipping. note that i am only printing
                200 copies to sell so don't be left behind.

updated sim 7.1 - lunar
                        module

in
                              late 2019 i updated sim 7, which was
                              originally issued in 2007 and never
                              updated. i was just about out of hard
                              copies of the original print run, and
                              there is interest in another edition. so i
                              took the opportunity to regenerate the
                              entire book in apple's pages software, as
                              it was originally made in the obsolete
                              appleworks program. this allowed me to
                              create a color pdf version and add four
                              pages of updated kit reviews, including a
                              close look at the apollo kits from dragon.
                              i also found some errors in the apollo 11
                              (lm-5) thermal blanket patterns, and those
                              will be corrected. both the digital pdf
                              and hard copy (with color cover!) versions
                              are now available (as of the end of
                              january 2020).


sim 9 - building gemini

                  it had been nine years since i put a new book out, and
                  i've been busy building a series of gemini models. these include some
                    standard nasa versions as well as some proposed
                    gemini variants that never made it off the drawing
                    board. i finally
                        finished the models early in 2019 and have now
                        completed writing up a description of how each
                        one was built. while there
                    already is a gemini book in the space in miniature
                    series, sim #3, that volume did not have any
                    detailed how-to articles. the results
                        are sim 9 - building gemini, the longest
                        sim book ever, at 72 pages (including covers).
                        it came out in november 2019 as both a hard copy
                        and color pdf. the book is loaded
                    with over 200 photos of work in progress of these
                    gemini variants:

                      is the lunar rescue gemini, based on an old
                      mcdonnell study. they actually built a small
                      cutaway model and while there are also some
                      drawings available, there are differences. i built
                      a version from their scale model finished as it
                      might appear on the moon.  

  


                        

this book is printed in black
                    and white on coated paper, and is available both as
                    a hard copy book as well as a full-color pdf file.
                    the initial run of 200 copies sold out after about
                    18 months so i printed another 100 copies in
                    mid-2021. with increased printing costs and the
                    smaller run, i had to raise the price by a dollar. a
                    hard copy of sim #9 - building gemini now
                    sells for $13 plus shipping, while a pdf download
                    still costs $10. a combination package of both the
                    hard copy and digital version is available for only
                    $15 plus shipping. because of the page count and the
                    222 color photos embedded the pdf version is a very
                    large file. therefore i am making available two
                    versions to accommodate user needs. one version has
                    the highest resolution photos and is a 787mb file.
                    the other version has slightly reduced resolution
                    (but still nice) photos and is a 113mb download.
                    both are priced the same and customers can pick the
                    version they want. 
$13.00
                    plus shipping for a hard copy (b&w)
  
$10.00
                    for a pdf digital download of a full color version  
$15.00
                    plus shipping for both versions

                      about sim 
i am a
                    (recently - fall 2018) retired engineer in the
                    aerospace industry, and my hobby interests are
                    centered around building scale models of real
                    spacecraft. this quickly gets into the history of
                    space, as there are few space kits out there and
                    much research is required to come up with the plans
                    and data needed to scratchbuild accurate spacecraft
                    models. this activity led me to publish the results
                    of some of my research in the form of 40-page
                    monographs (magazines or booklets, i guess) on how
                    to build accurate models of real spacecraft. i also
                    have this internet site to augment those paper
                    publications. the book series is called space in miniature
                    (sim). click here
                    for more info or use the links at left. this web site was
                    established in the summer of 1999 to solicit inputs
                    on the mercury volume.  i used this web site to
                    post preliminary findings and to get feedback from
                    other researchers. this has worked out great, and i
                    appreciate hearing from so many of you. 

                    you can also keep up with me on facebook.

                    thanks for your interest,

                    you can purchase books using your credit card via my
                    paypal account. while i prefer checks (paypal gets
                    92 cents for every copy of sim #6 i sell using their
                    service) this should make ordering simpler for you,
                    particularly international customers.
