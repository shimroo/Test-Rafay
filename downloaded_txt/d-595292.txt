  from the pastor...

 welcome to saint michael the archangel parish!

faithful to the mind and heart of our lord jesus christ, we strive to live our catholic faith with joy.three things characterize our parish: (1) a deep love for our eucharistic lord, specially expressed in beautiful sacred liturgies, (2) an intense effort at evangelization and religious formation, and (3) a heroic commitment to the works of mercy.ours is a large parish, with over 3,000 families.  however, for those willing to participate in parish life, saint michael parish reveals a friendly, hospitable, and loving atmosphere.yours in the hearts of jesus and mary,fr. adam hertzfeldfr. adam hertzfeldpastor

    what we believe




   

  divinity of christ
 "jesus christ is true god and true man, in the unity of his divine person; for this reason he is the one and only mediator between god and men."
ccc 480
 

  pursuit of holiness
 "all christians in any state or walk of life are called to the fullness of christian life and to the perfection of charity. all are called to holiness: 'be perfect, as your heavenly father is perfect.'"
ccc 2013


   

  power of prayer
 "by words, mental or vocal, our prayer takes flesh. yet it is most important that the heart should be present to him to whom we are speaking in prayer: whether or not our prayer is heard depends not on the number of words, but on the fervor of our souls."
ccc 2700
 

  significance of sacraments
 "the sacraments are efficacious signs of grace, instituted by christ and entrusted to the church, by which divine life is dispensed to us."
ccc 1131
