california aikido association (caa)the california aikido association (caa) is a worldwide community of teachers, dojos, and aikidoka whose primary common bond is the art we practice.  it is fortunate to have within its membership many teachers with varied backgrounds and complementary skills. as such, the caa embraces many stylistic and technical traditions, but is guided by the physical and philosophical ideals established by the founder, morihei ueshiba.  the caa is an officially recognized organization by the aikikai foundation, hombu dojo, tokyo, japan.14th iaf conference in tokyothe iaf brings together its membership every 4 years for meetings and a 5-day seminar. various international teachers taught classes, and doshu taught the final class. due to the pandemic, the 2020 scheduled conference was postponed. more than 1000 aikidoists participated in this year’s event in tokyo from october 3-7, 2024. eighty-eight countries worldwide are members of the iaf and were represented at the conference.. several members of the caa, from all 3 divisions, attended this year’s conference, including division heads patricia hendricks and michael friedl. dojo members from several organizations in the us, including the united states aikido federation (usaf) and the aikido world alliance, were in attendance. below is a photo of the attendees from the us (taken october 6, 2024). this event allowed us to train and connect with aikidoists from all over the world. in addition, member countries of the iaf gave brief demonstrations at the end of the 5-day conference.  here is a link to the demo by patricia hendrick, shihan.
