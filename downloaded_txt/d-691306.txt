a donald ross masterpiecefor you to enjoy
the stunning 18-hole donald ross-designed golf course—with famously challenging greens—is recognized as one of the top 5 in minnesota and in 2013 one of the top 100 classic golf courses in the united states.
the course features 6,825 yards of golf from the longest tees for a par of 71. the wooded, gently rolling course, with amazing views of lake superior, is tough enough for low handicappers, yet is still eminently enjoyable for higher handicappers.
