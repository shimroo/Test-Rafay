							needham, ma move
						

the team was great in communicating (schedule, arrival, questions) and worked diligently and professionally. we couldn’t imagine what our move would have been like if we didn’t have the team to help us move. at first we weren’t sure we needed movers because we packed up all our things and moved the boxes to the new house ourselves (leaving larger items and furniture for the movers), but quickly appreciated all the extra help as we moved to a two story house and only had the two of us for the move.
