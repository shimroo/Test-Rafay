jess needs a fresh start. she's broke and alone, and she's just left her job under less than ideal circumstances. her half-brother ben didn't sound thrilled when she asked if she could crash with him for a bit, but he didn't say no, and surely everything will look better from paris. only when she shows up - to find a very nice apartment, could ben really have afforded this? - he's not there.
the longer ben stays missing, the more jess starts to dig into her brother's situation, and the more questions she has. ben's neighbors are an eclectic bunch, and not particularly friendly. jess may have come to paris to escape her past, but it's starting to look like it's ben's future that's in question.

in 2030, a grieving archeologist arrives in the arctic circle to continue the work of his recently deceased daughter at the batagaika crater, where researchers are studying long-buried secrets now revealed in melting permafrost, including the perfectly preserved remains of a girl who appears to have died of an ancient virus.
once unleashed, the arctic plague will reshape life on earth for generations to come, quickly traversing the globe, forcing humanity to devise a myriad of moving and inventive ways to embrace possibility in the face of tragedy. in a theme park designed for terminally ill children, a cynical employee falls in love with a mother desperate to hold on to her infected son. a heartbroken scientist searching for a cure finds a second chance at fatherhood when one of his test subjects--a pig--develops the capacity for human speech. a widowed painter and her teenaged granddaughter embark on a cosmic quest to locate a new home planet.

wondrous, and not just in the feats of imagination, which are so numerous it makes me dizzy to recall them, but also in the humanity and tenderness with which sequoia nagamatsu helps us navigate this landscape. . . . this is a truly amazing book, one to keep close as we imagine the uncertain future. -- kevin wilson, new york times bestselling author of nothing to see here











one italian summer


instant new york times bestseller

“[a] magical trip worth taking.” —associated press

“rebecca serle is a maestro of love in all its forms.” —gabrielle zevin, new york times bestselling author

the new york times bestselling author of in five years returns with a powerful novel about the transformational love between mothers and daughters set on the breathtaking amalfi coast.

when katy’s mother dies, she is left reeling. carol wasn’t just katy’s mom, but her best friend and first phone call. she had all the answers and now, when katy needs her the most, she is gone. to make matters worse, their planned mother-daughter trip of a lifetime looms: to positano, the magical town where carol spent the summer right before she met katy’s father. katy has been waiting years for carol to take her, and now she is faced with embarking on the adventure alone.

but as soon as she steps foot on the amalfi coast, katy begins to feel her mother’s spirit. buoyed by the stunning waters, beautiful cliffsides, delightful residents, and, of course, delectable food, katy feels herself coming back to life.

and then carol appears—in the flesh, healthy, sun-tanned, and thirty years old. katy doesn’t understand what is happening, or how—all she can focus on is that she has somehow, impossibly, gotten her mother back. over the course of one italian summer, katy gets to know carol, not as her mother, but as the young woman before her. she is not exactly who katy imagined she might be, however, and soon katy must reconcile the mother who knew everything with the young woman who does not yet have a clue.

rebecca serle’s next great love story is here, and this time it’s between a mother and a daughter. with her signature “heartbreaking, redemptive, and authentic” (jamie ford, new york times bestselling author) prose, serle has crafted a transcendent novel about how we move on after loss, and how the people we love never truly leave us.











hollywood ending


a vivid biography of harvey weinstein—how he rose to become a dominant figure in the film world, how he used that position to feed his monstrous sexual appetites, and how it all came crashing down, from the author who has covered the hollywood and media power game for the new yorker for three decades

twenty years ago, ken auletta wrote an iconic new yorker profile of the hollywood mogul harvey weinstein, who was then at the height of his powers. the profile made waves for exposing how volatile, even violent, weinstein was to his employees and collaborators. but there was a much darker story that was just out of reach: rumors had long swirled that weinstein was a sexual predator. auletta confronted weinstein, who denied the claims. since no one was willing to go on the record, auletta and the magazine concluded they couldn’t close the case. years later, he was able to share his reporting notes and knowledge with ronan farrow; he cheered as farrow, and jodi kantor and megan twohey, finally revealed the truth.

still, the story continued to nag him. the trail of assaults and cover-ups had been exposed, but the larger questions remained: what was at the root of weinstein’s monstrousness? how, and why, was it never checked? why the silence? how does a man run the day-to-day operations of a company with hundreds of employees and revenues in the hundreds of millions of dollars, and at the same time live a shadow life of sexual predation without ever being caught? how much is this a story about harvey weinstein, and how much is this a story about hollywood and power?

in pursuit of the answers, auletta digs into weinstein’s life, searching for the mysteries beneath a film career unparalleled for its extraordinary talent and creative success, which combined with a personal brutality and viciousness to leave a trail of ruined lives in its wake. hollywood ending is more than a prosecutor’s litany; it is an unflinching examination of weinstein's life and career, embedding his crimes in the context of the movie business, in his failures and the successes that led to enormous power. film stars, miramax employees and board members, old friends and family, and even the person who knew him best—harvey’s brother, bob—all talked to auletta at length. weinstein himself also responded to auletta’s questions from prison. the result is not simply the portrait of a predator but of the power that allowed weinstein to operate with such impunity for so many years, the spiderweb in which his victims found themselves trapped.











finding me


oprah’s book club pick • a harpers bazaar best book of 2022 • a parade most anticipated book • a marie claire most anticipated book
“it’s clear from the first page that davis is going to serve a more intimate, unpolished account than is typical of the average (often ghost-written) celebrity memoir; finding me reads like davis is sitting you down for a one-on-one conversation about her life, warts and all.”—usa today
“[a] fulfilling narrative of struggle and success….her gorgeous storytelling will inspire anyone wishing to shed old labels.”—los angeles times
in my book, you will meet a little girl named viola who ran from her past until she made a life-changing decision to stop running forever.
 
this is my story, from a crumbling apartment in central falls, rhode island, to the stage in new york city, and beyond. this is the path i took to finding my purpose but also my voice in a world that didn’t always see me.
as i wrote finding me, my eyes were open to the truth of how our stories are often not given close examination. we are forced to reinvent them to fit into a crazy, competitive, judgmental world. so i wrote this for anyone running through life untethered, desperate and clawing their way through murky memories, trying to get to some form of self-love. for anyone who needs reminding that a life worth living can only be born from radical honesty and the courage to shed facades and be . . . you.
finding me is a deep reflection, a promise, and a love letter of sorts to self. my hope is that my story will inspire you to light up your own life with creative expression and rediscover who you were before the world put a label on you.











lost & found


'extraordinary . . . a profound and beautiful book . . . a moving meditation on grief and loss, but also a sparky celebration of joy, wonder and the miracle of love . . . witty, wise, beautifully structured and written in clear, singing prose' – sunday times

longlisted for the 2022 national book award for nonfiction

eighteen months before kathryn schulz’s beloved father died, she met the woman she would marry. in lost & found, she weaves the stories of those relationships into a brilliant exploration of how all our lives are shaped by loss and discovery - from the maddening disappearance of everyday objects to the sweeping devastations of war, pandemic, and natural disaster; from finding new planets to falling in love.

three very different american families form the heart of lost & found: the one that made schulz’s father, a charming, brilliant, absentminded jewish refugee; the one that made her partner, an equally brilliant farmer’s daughter and devout christian; and the one she herself makes through marriage. but schulz is also attentive to other, more universal kinds of conjunction: how private happiness can coexist with global catastrophe, how we get irritated with those we adore, how love and loss are themselves unavoidably inseparable. the resulting book is part memoir, part guidebook to living in a world that is simultaneously full of wonder and joy and wretchedness and suffering - a world that always demands both our gratitude and our grief.

a staff writer at the new yorker and winner of the pulitzer prize, kathryn schulz writes with curiosity, tenderness, erudition, and wit about our finite yet infinitely complicated lives. crafted with the emotional clarity of c. s. lewis and the intellectual force of susan sontag, lost & found is an uncommon book about common experiences.

'an extraordinary gift of a book, a tender, searching meditation on love and loss and what it means to be human. i wept at it, laughed with it, was entirely fascinated by it. i emerged feeling a little as if the world around me had been made anew.' – helen macdonald, author of h is for hawk

"a delicious, dark, adrenaline rush of a book. i'm already dying to see charlie hall's next con." - new york times bestselling author, alix e. harrow

#1 new york times bestselling author holly black makes her stunning adult debut with book of night, a modern dark fantasy of betrayals, secret societies, and a dissolute thief of shadows, in the vein of neil gaiman and erin morgenstern.

charlie hall has never found a lock she couldn’t pick, a book she couldn’t steal, or a bad decision she wouldn’t make.

she's spent half her life working for gloamists, magicians who manipulate shadows to peer into locked rooms, strangle people in their beds, or worse. gloamists guard their secrets greedily, creating an underground economy of grimoires. and to rob their fellow magicians, they need charlie hall.

now, she’s trying to distance herself from past mistakes, but getting out isn’t easy. bartending at a dive, she’s still entirely too close to the corrupt underbelly of the berkshires. not to mention that her sister posey is desperate for magic, and that charlie's shadowless, and possibly soulless, boyfriend has been hiding things from her. when a terrible figure from her past returns, charlie descends into a maelstrom of murder and lies.

determined to survive, she’s up against a cast of doppelgangers, mercurial billionaires, gloamists, and the people she loves best in the world—all trying to steal a secret that will give them vast and terrible power.

“one of my favorite authors.”—colleen hoover

an insightful, delightful, instant #1 new york times bestseller from the author of beach read and people we meet on vacation.

named a most anticipated book of 2022 by oprah daily ∙ today ∙ parade ∙ marie claire ∙ bustle ∙ popsugar ∙ katie couric media ∙ book bub ∙ shereads ∙ medium ∙ the washington post ∙ and more!one summer. two rivals. a plot twist they didn't see coming...

nora stephens' life is books—she’s read them all—and she is not that type of heroine. not the plucky one, not the laidback dream girl, and especially not the sweetheart. in fact, the only people nora is a heroine for are her clients, for whom she lands enormous deals as a cutthroat literary agent, and her beloved little sister libby.

which is why she agrees to go to sunshine falls, north carolina for the month of august when libby begs her for a sisters’ trip away—with visions of a small town transformation for nora, who she’s convinced needs to become the heroine in her own story. but instead of picnics in meadows, or run-ins with a handsome country doctor or bulging-forearmed bartender, nora keeps bumping into charlie lastra, a bookish brooding editor from back in the city. it would be a meet-cute if not for the fact that they’ve met many times and it’s never been cute.

if nora knows she’s not an ideal heroine, charlie knows he’s nobody’s hero, but as they are thrown together again and again—in a series of coincidences no editor worth their salt would allow—what they discover might just unravel the carefully crafted stories they’ve written about themselves.
