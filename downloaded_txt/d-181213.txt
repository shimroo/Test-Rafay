chris christie's diner tour





who's chris christie?


he's the republican candidate for governor in new jersey and he's doing all he can to run from george bush, who's christie's political sugar daddy.


and as much as i am a stickler for hospitality, i just had to roll out the welcome mat.... but the story doesn't end well.

with bh honey, you can judge a book by its cover. 


bh honey review

first impressions



great packaging, best i've ever seen for honey. cool and modern but not oppressively so. the square-shaped jar is quite unique and speaks to foodies, design geeks and just about anyone who might be willing to spend $20 for 12 ounces of honey.  



the smell test



smells like honey.  this may seem obvious, but far too often commercial honeys can smell too pungent  or too "sweet" thereby changing the flavor profile of 1) the product and 2) whatever it's sweetening.  thankfully in this case, the bh honey has the perfect amount of "sweet, sunny" taste and it won't leave your senses overloaded before you've even had a taste.



bee nice and show me the flavor!



flavor alone is superb. vaguely, mildly spicy. tastes like honey is supposed to taste which is increasingly rare is a world where infusions, blends, and artificial aromas are increasingly used to "tempt" our over-stimulated palate.



when used in a steaming cup of lady grey black tea, bh honey enhances the taste without altering the flavor profile of the hot black tea.  nice sweetness, not too perfume'y, floral or spicy.



likewise bh honey went superbly with tazo passion red hot herbal tea.  the flavor and sweetness elevate the fruitiness of the tea for a pleasurable cup.  bh honey's mild, smooth fruity taste is most apparent with this tea.



other stuff



this delicious honey is trucked in from the pacific northwest which is rather unfortunate in terms of carbon miles.  with foodies looking increasingly locally for their wares, i'm afraid this product's 3,000 mils journey does not comport with that vibe at all.   for me, this is worth a few demerit points. 



the website for bh honey is pretty cool.  gives off a very "west coast" sensibility. not very current with their blog.  on the plus side, the website offers up a good range of gear for first time bee keepers.  



the conclusive buzzzzz



tastes great. looks great.  my tendency to purchase would come down to price point and (perhaps more importantly) how is was merchandised. 



with its sleek packaging and superior flavor, this honey should stand out for the right reasons.

bluejersey blogger lands spot in this weekend's edition of power&politics





if you're one of those political junkie types who can't get enough of the redistricting debate, you simply must tune into this weekend's edition of power&politics on news12.  the show airs saturdays and sundays at 10am and 3pm.   



several segments discuss the state's new congressional boundaries, and i get a chance to weigh in as well, debating my (mostly) friendly rival, chris russell from south jersey.   monmouth u. poll-meister patrick murray, montclair state political scientist brigid harrison, gop lobbyist tom wilson and politickernj's alan steinberg guest star as well.

with less than a month until election day, is trouble brewing within the republican ranks in one of nj's most closely watched races?apparently vince polistina's nasty campaign style is too much for even his running mates to handle.  so they ditiched him according to the press of ac they ditiched him:republican assemblyman john amodeo said that...he and his assembly running mate, chris brown, separated their campaign from that of their state senate running mate, assemblyman vince polistina, because of a disagreement over the negative tone.says assemblyman amodeo, "after a period of time i brought on my own consultant because that's not the direction i wanted my campaign to go in."polistina is running against incumbent democrat jim whelan to represent nj's newly reapportioned 2nd legisltive district.here's the real deal on vince polistina: policy wise he's a political lapdog.  when he's not following chris christie around trenton like a lost little man-child, vince polistina and his engineering firm are down in south jersey suckling off the taxpayer's teat to the tune of over $6.6m! gaspso notwithstanding corrupt republican vince polistina's "scorched earth" campaign tactics, is it any wonder even his fellow republicans want nothing to do with him?
