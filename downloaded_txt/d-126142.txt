it has been documented that financial troubles can cause all sorts of ailments, the most common of which is sleeplessness. the anxiety created by the inability to pay bills and the embarrassment of talking to bill collectors at work makes it very difficult for many people to fall asleep or sleep through the night. filing bankruptcy will provide debt relief, eliminate bill problems, and stop creditor harassment.

some words from clients:

a very pleased client


mr. wrobel handled my case with excellence, detail, attention, and dedication. there were many hours of research, emails during and after hours, careful consideration of what would be in my best interest, and just overall great counseling and advice. mr. wrobel walked me through the entire process, and assured me the days ahead would be brighter and that i would be in a better financial position after completing my bankruptcy. i would not have gone through the process with confidence if mr. wrobel had not prepared me the way he did. he went above and beyond to assist me, and the manner of professionalism was 5-star service. gwendolyn posted in may 2024
