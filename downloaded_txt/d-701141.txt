compute for good
the science of computing has propelled innovation in nearly every aspect of modern life. computer science courses at um immerse students in the protocols used to transform society via computation. social structures have yet to adapt to the astonishing rate of change produced by computation. throughout our program ethical considerations are highlighted, and the practice of computing for good emphasized.
our faculty are highly accessible, teach a broad range of topics, and have developed strong research programs that provide many opportunities to our students. teaching and research assistantships are available to some of our graduate applicants. please explore our site and contact us with any questions.

csci 443: ui design portfolios


pairs of students are tasked with designing, prototyping, and evaluating an interactive software prototype. particular focus is given to understanding and employing universal principles of design and to the iterative process of user centered design.








					internship spotlight
				

					all year long, our students practice the skills they are learning through internships.
				





autonomous aerial systems office



abby kabalin - research intern

abby interned with the inbre (idea network of biomedical research excellence) team, helping to build a web application that tracks particulate matter concentrations to better warn of poor air quality in montana, particularly during fire season. she worked on filling gaps in the data currently unavailable due to cloud cover and snowfall, by imputation with available data.






cognizant



billy boone - software engineer intern

billy interned with the software engineering team, tasked with several different projects including the standard software engineering training program called the apex accelerator. he presented code reviews based on the training platform’s projects in the apex programming language. apex is a very similar platform to java in syntax and allows direct integration with salesforce. billy also participated in one large and one small group project in which solutions were presented by intern teams to solve real business problems.






consumer direct care network



kenneth hondl - software engineer intern

    								kenneth interned with consumer direct care network (an in-home care provider) working on a user creation tool to allow the software development team to streamline the process of code testing. 
    							





karl storz



 cass orr - software testing intern

    								cass interned with karl storz (a medical device manufacturer) in their software quality assurance department where she wrote and conducted manual and automated software tests on various products. her testing covered user interface, cybersecurity, microservice integration, and overall functionality using her knowledge of object-oriented and modular programming to draft test scripts.
    							





consumer direct care network



madeleine gallegos lyons - software engineer intern

    								madeleine interned with consumer direct care network (an in-home care provider) working on a user creation tool to allow the software development team to streamline the process of code testing. 
    							





autonomous aerial systems office



aspen morgan - research intern

aspen used geographic information system (gis) functions on google earth engine (gee) to preprocess remote sensing data and correlate it with pm2.5 ground station data. then, she tuned and compared machine learning regression models for predicting pm2.5. using the model with the lowest testing error, she built a web app on gee to display daily predictions for montana.

a machine learning approach



assistant professor doug brinkerhoff is providing a machine-learning approach to understanding the complexities of tidewater glaciers in greenland as part of a brand-new collaboration with researchers from across the globe. the project seeks to inform advanced glacier models with an unprecedented collection of atmospheric, oceanic and glaciological measurements.
