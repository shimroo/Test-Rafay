 ennis center for children has been working with abused and/or neglected children for over 46 years with our services reaching over 6,000 michigan children and families in crisis annually. on any given day, we help over 500 children in our foster care program alone. ennis center for children serves all counties in southeast michigan with locations in genesee, ingham, oakland, st. clair, saginaw and wayne county. we are a leading agency in finding adoptive families for children, including those with special needs. ennis center also works with delinquent teens, helping them stay safe, stay in school and on a path toward a productive adulthood. our regional resource team helps recruit, train, and retain foster families in 17 counties of the state. our mission: “with the support of the community, we preserve families when possible and create new families when necessary” drives our trained, dedicated and compassionate staff as they guide children and families toward a future better than their past.
