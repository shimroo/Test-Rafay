the doctors are fabulous at moc. i started to have knee pain after working out with a personal trainer. i made an appointment to see doctor redondo and he instructed me to do yoga and pilates for now and take it easy. i was very happy with the quick and pleasant service. my friend also went to a moc a few months back and saw doctor branovacki. we both were very happy with the experience

dr. garras is still treating me. he is who you want your surgeon to be – one with a very reassuring demeanor and obvious terrific skills. i will be forever grateful for what dr. garras has done and continues to do for me and my family. i also would like to thank carrie (dr garras’ physician assistant), who also took wonderful care of me. i cannot end without a shout out to sharon (oaklawn office) who has always gone above and beyond, for her, i am grateful.
