    wellcraft scarab 1



nice condition scarab with lots of extras and improvements. owned for the last 10 years only put on about 100 hours in that time. full freshwater cooling system since before i got it. working trim tabs. recently refreshed the 270hp 350 magnum engine with a full edelbrock performer-rpm top end package (cylinder heads, rpm air-gap manifold, and carb) comp cams gold hi-lift 1.6 roller rocker arms, k&n marine air filter - flame arrestor, catch can for oil, new gauges and switches (still have working originals), new compass, new depth finder, new alpha one shift cable & shift cable bellows & main bellows 2 years ago, new alpha one water pump ready to go in and the boat will be ready for use. always use the best amsoil synthetic marine engine and outdrive oil. very fast, approx 400hp. with this amount of power it can use an even bigger prop for higher top speed if needed but as is its got powerful acceleration and can achieve high enough speeds for almost anyone and sounds amazing. recently had our second child and just dont see any time within the next 5 or 6 years where we will be able to use this so it should go to someone who can enjoy it. yamaha - mfi trailer is included. as a side note, buyers and sellers on this site be aware of scammers trying to get you to purchase "boat history reports" only to never hear from them again. they didnt get me but they will get someone. two phone numbers that have tried so far are 786-652-0814 & 281-219-9784.. located in stamford connecticut.

    wellcraft scarab 38 thunder



1994 wellcraft scarab thunder 38'.
twin mercruiser 502 efi engine and bravo 1 drives.
well cared for clean boat which is turn key ready and needs nothing. oil and filters changed frequently. port side engine has roughly 380 hours and starboard engine has roughly 470 hours. boat runs flawlessly. it cruises around 50mph and will do 70mph. the boat is in overall very nice condition. it's always been a freshwater boat from what the previous owner stated. we had a complete camper and bimini top built for this scarab about 2-3 years ago. this boat will not dissapoint. very reliable, clean and quick boat for the size. the trailer has all new bearings, brakes, and tires. we do have the original wellcraft fridge for the boat although it is removed right now just for extra storage space. this boat will sleep 5 in the cabin and even more people can fit under the camper top if needed. we aren't in a hurry to sell this boat and we will continue to use it until we find it a new home. this scarab has always been stored inside, and covered while outside. it never sits in the water for more than 5-6 days at a time. joy rides are welcome with cash in hand. please email with any questions or for more pictures.

    skipjack cabin cruiser



this is a 1976 skip jack cabin cruiser that i started to restore three years ago and then ended up dropping the project. it sits on a pacific 10,000 pound dual axle galvanized trailer that could use new springs and a little love but its generally in good shape and has four new load range, e tires. the trailer has notched bunks for hoist launch and galvanize side rails with ladder for ramp launch. the boat has been sanded, prepped and primed with two coats of seahawk epoxy primer, which has powdered due to uv exposure.. the cockpit was not painted, but a good deal of grind and epoxy fill was performed on spider cracks in the gelcoat. the engine is a volvo penta 350 v8 with 600 hours and brand new heads. it is fresh water cooled with heat exchanger and a unique aftermarket flushing system (not the bunny ears). it runs like a swiss watch. the outdrive is a volvo penta 290 dual prop which has been gone through, shafts, removed, re-metallized, and re-machined. all new seals were installed and the props only have about 20 hours on them. it has the original skipjack 110 gallon, heavy duty aluminum fuel tank, which is in good condition. it has hydraulic trim tabs that work well, as well as hydraulic outdrive trim, which also works well. it has a fully enclosed head, sparkling, clean 10 gallon holding tank, a macerator pump, and you can either pump to the holding tank or overboard.a small galley with on demand pressure water sink, a norcold dual voltage (110 - 12 v) refrigerator that works well a portable single burner butane stove,,a dinette that converts to a double bunk, and a v birth, that sleeps two. the upholstery is dark, blue, nautical themed, and in very good condition,. it also comes with two brand new tinted opening side windows with screens to replace existing($1000)it has two igloo ice chests that fit in built-in chocks against the bulkhead and serve as wonderful foot rests for both driver and passenger, plus they make it possible to spend extended periods out of the islands! it has a very nice lewmar, pro fish, winless, good anchor, roller, two anchors, and a small anchor locker. it has a nice teak swim step that sits on stainless steel brackets with a pull out stainless steel swim ladder attached to the bottom. it has a bait pump, and a large poly propylene bait tank that attaches to the swim step. it also has a brand new, heavy duty wiper motor and stainless steel articulating arm for the windshield which is needed because when it is snotty, the windshield gets quite wet. it is not a walk around, but can fish three easily in the cockpit. there is also a brand new, stainless steering wheel with a suicide knob (not installed).
what it needs : paint, the primer will need to be sanded, re-primed, and the boat finish painted excluding the cockpit. i have done some rewiring to make the electrical more accessible but someone with 12 v wiring skills will need to sort it all out. it has built-in battery trays for two banks of two batteries each. there is one new battery in the engine compartment that was purchased two years ago and needs recharging. the railings are off, the swim step is off, and the gelcoat in the cockpit can use more grinding and filling after which the combing can be painted . i can supply receipts for all work performed. i could part the boat out for three times what i am asking.) and for the right guy who is handy and capable, a couple of months work will turn this wonderful boat. back into the island camper - fish, slayer, that it was for me and will give you years of wonderful experiences offshore!
please keep in mind that this wonderful little boat has as much accommodation as most 30 footers and at the end of the day you can put it back on the trailer, no slip needed. thanks for reading my mini boat novel.. located in ventura california.

    ranger tug r23



this 23' boat has 3 berths, i kid you not!!!! the 3rd berth is under the dinette, so really this is the perfect 2-adults-and-a-dog-go-on-an-adventure boat. 



upgrades: bow thruster, westerbeke generator, webasto heater, factory installed solar power



very comfy cabin for bad weather but incredible visibility. with a dramatic, curved windshield and visor, accompanied by several overhead skylights there is no shortage of light or visibility - four opening roof hatches, sliding side windows, and an opening glass bulkhead, providing an open and airy feeling inside and out. opening portlights also allow for a nice cross breeze in the cabin.



the well-appointed galley on the r-23 is standard with refrigerator - freezer, cooktop, and microwave. the forward head includes a marine toilet with holding tank, shower, sink, and mirror. the ranger tugs r-23 comes standard with a garmin 943xsv gps chartplotter with sonar and is available with optional xhd radar. vhf to stay in touch, illuminated compass, cabin night light, cockpit and exterior side trail lighting, and our built-in safety trailering lights (brake, turn, and reverse) are all standard equipment making the r-23 ready to cruise.



the cockpit on the r-23 is built to fish and ready to entertain with standard rod holders, optional downrigger pads & outlets, and a folding double seat. perfect for overnighting or extended cruises, it incorporates many of the same amenities as a larger cruising yacht that until now were not offered on a boat of her size and price point.



consider this if you're doing the great loop, if you want a trailer-able yacht (5,000 pounds empty, built in trailer lights and fold-down mast) that you can move to friends on different lakes, or if you just want an easy boat for one. trailer not included.. located in harwood maryland.
