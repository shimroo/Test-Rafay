i first contacted bgs in 2019 by way of the company website.  my wife and i had selected one of the existing plan options but i needed to discuss some of the options offered since the building location was in northern california and in a mountain region.  when i contacted bgs i was introduced to the designer.  loren was instrumental in matching the right building for our needs, along with several appropriate options for our build. loren's perspective on available options was invaluable and they came with an extraordinary level of knowledge and experience.   our final building design was perfect and we thoroughly enjoyed the outcome, as our permit was approved by the county even after the release of the new cbc 2020 requirements.  our plans came complete with stamped engineering calculations, which saved us time and money.   overall, the entire process was a success.  we broke ground on our new building in october and i am excited to share the outcome when finished. i will post photos of the completed building in early spring after snow season.  thank you so much bgs!
