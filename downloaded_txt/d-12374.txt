          volunteermatch is the most effective way to recruit highly
          qualified volunteers for your nonprofit. we match you with
          people who are passionate about and committed to your
          cause, and who can help when and where you need them.
        

          and because volunteers are often donors as well, we make
          it easy for them to contribute their time and money.

          the nonprofits, and in a way,
          it's its own search engine specifically for
