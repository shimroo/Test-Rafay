   welcome  to our medfield and millis communities, and beyond,

assisting families and friends with loss is our privilege and honor as funeral directors. given the reality of the covid-19 pandemic, it is important to know that funeral directors throughout massachusetts are taking precautions to limit exposure to the coronavirus. we have always operated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week making certain that those entrusted to our care and the families we serve are receiving uninterrupted service and attention, regardless of the cause of death.
 please know that above all, we are 100% committed to the families we serve. we remain focused on maintaining high standards and ethical practices as we serve the dead and bereaved with the health and well-being of our communities in mind as we move forward together.

we encourage all those wanting to attend services, but are still uncomfortable out in public, to please write meaningful messages to our families via our website. cards and such can also be sent to our main office by postal mail.  those will be forwarded to the family upon receipt.
