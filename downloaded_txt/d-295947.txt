meet the team: cyrus daniel-head guide

from the hollers of appalachia to the wild waters of alaska, cyrus daniel has spent his life chasing adventure in the great outdoors. growing up in greenbrier county, west virginia, he hunted, trapped, and fished for everything from largemouth bass to trout and catfish. his passion for the wilderness led him across the country, from ski resorts in west virginia to the shores of ocracoke island and the peaks of glacier national park.

in 2016, cyrus landed in southeast alaska as a rainforest ecosystem and bear guide, but it wasn’t long before he found his true calling—fly fishing. a chance meeting with a floatplane pilot introduced him to the sport, and from that moment on, he was hooked. with a rod in hand and an unstoppable drive to learn, he honed his skills and eventually earned a spot as a guide at the hook up fly shop.

now, he spends his days helping others experience the thrill of fly fishing in the stunning waters around ketchikan. whether you’re looking for your first catch or the fish of a lifetime, cyrus is ready to make it happen. tight lines and tall tales await!
