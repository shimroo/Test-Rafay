 muzzleloading rifles & pistols  
 




around  1725 / 1750 in lancaster, pennsylvania immigrant craftsmen from germany designed  a light, slender, accurate and graceful long rifle. it was the first truly  american made firearm and became to be known as the kentucky rifle.
              this  rifle became the primary weapon of the frontiersmen in the wilds of tennessee  and kentucky. the kentucky rifle was considered to be a necessity by  frontiersmen, and most frontier families owned one. rifle shooting was a way of  life on the great american frontier.
