 our history
											




home-kim group, founded by jongil kim, was established in manassas virginia in 1984 as a small siding contractor. originally a warehouse occupying a 138,000 sq. ft. facility consisting of a window factory, office and showroom; weâve gone through extensive transformations and in return provide our clients with the service they want and deserve. weâve stepped out of our manufacturing days and have concentrated our focus on high end quality remodeling and new construction. we encourage all customers to visit our facility and show room to witness our operation first hand.
