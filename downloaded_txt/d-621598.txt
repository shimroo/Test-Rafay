mount hope hdj review: eating with sinners and tax collectors at the table



the table is easy to find in downtown mount hope full disclosure: we love this charming little place in downtown mount hope and have had many delightful lunches there. with some terrific sandwich meats and salads, it is an oasis in the food desert of mount hope. they also have a small selection of fresh and delicious baked goods, perfect for an after-lunch treat. the staff has been ever-so-friendly and service has always been fast and efficient.on our most recent visit, however, they were offering a hot dog special that we couldn't pass up, although now we kinda wish we had. "why does your teacher eat with sinners and tax collectors?"with expectations high from our prior experiences, our first disappointments came rapid-fire when we saw the new england style split top lobster roll buns and slaw served on the side. then we noticed that bun had separated on the bottom and the weenie had already fallen through the crack and was resting on the paper-lined tray.  after we applied our coleslaw properly to its proper place on the top, then came the difficult task of trying to pick the thing up and taking a bite without having a lap full of deconstructed hot dog. before long we were forced to use a fork, which is the world of hot dog eating is like -- well, having to use a fork! not at all a satisfying experience.once we were able to get a taste of the elements, we found that they were decent. the slaw was more than decent, it was actually very good. the chili was lackluster and the weenie was not very good at all, overcooked and kind foreign-looking like something you'd find in chicago. that bun, though. nah. don't try to be so fancy. the bun wasn't up to the task.overall we're going to have to give the table a low 1.5 weenie rating, and it pains us to do so since we like the place so much. our recommendation is to stick with the regular menu. we'll be back for one of your excellent sandwiches, but not for hot dogs.

parkersburg hdj review - the root beer shack



who doesn't love frozen root beer? after the last a&w in charleston closed in the early 80's there was no other root beer place around that offered this frozen goodness. we'd pass by huntington's frostop root beer and see the giant mug on top of the restaurant with its representation of a head of frozen root beer, but it was only a cruel joke: frostop has no frost on top. nor does stewarts. nor does farley's. it seemed that frozen root beer had become just another reason to long for the good ol' days. so when we saw some chatter on a recent wv hot dogs facebook post by a hot dog enthusiast from parkersburg about the hot dogs at the root beer shack, it piqued our interest.  we were thrilled when he mentioned that the root beer was "icy," hoping that meant that it was full of the wonderful icy sludge. but enough about root beer, for now; we're here for hot dogs, right?well, you're gonna have to wait on that. because we sure did. arriving (we thought) before the lunch rush would allow us to get in and out in short order, but before we even placed our order we were warned that there would be a 20-25 minute wait for food. ok, no worries because we didn't have anywhere else to be so we got our root beer and found a table to wait. (we noticed that many other patrons who came in after we were seated did not choose to wait. while we were there at least 12 people left after hearing about the long wait.)we had to request mustard and onions as extras, because the shack's "slaw dog" only comes standard with chili (except since this is the ohio valley it's called "sauce") and slaw. we were asked to choose between "spicy" and "sweet" sauce, so we got one of each. after the expected delay, our hot dogs arrived at our table and we immediately noticed that they were prepared on new england style buns (and for the umpteenth time, there is no such thing as an "english" bun!) that had been buttered and toasted. the slaw looked decent if a little coarse (although the presence of carrots will offend some purists), but the flavor was a little odd. like maybe it was a bit past its "best by" date. the spicy chili was a little spicy, but nothing like fairmont spicy. the sweet stuff was bland. overall the hot dogs weren't very good. filling, yes, mostly because of the voluminous bun, but not deserving of more than a 2 weenie rating. the consolation prize was that we did get to wash them down with some really good root beer with a frozen icy head, just as we hoped we would find.

charleston hdj review - bogey's 



we finally made it to bogey's at capitol market to try their wv hot dog. billed as "award winning" because some amateur hot dog influencers made a video a while back that concluded that bogey's original location in tornado had west virginia's best hot dog. seems like every time we tried to get to the original location it was closed, but their new place has more predictable hours.bottom line is that it's absolutely not the best hot dog in wv, heck, not even in the best in downtown charleston, but it is pretty, pretty, pretty good. we'd have added a fourth "pretty" except that the bun was stiff, having obviously been  dry-heated instead of steamed. even after traveling a few miles in the paper coffin it was still pretty crunchy on the outside. bogey's wv hot dogthe slaw is a bit too coarse, but still very creamy and it tasted great. the chili was really very good. very finely ground meat and terrific flavors. we say "flavors" because it was quite complex, with some sweet, some tangy and some savory notes. it paired perfectly with the slaw. we're going to give bogey's a 4 weenie rank because of the overall quality of the hot dog. a fine example of a "genteel dog," presented with care but missing the mark on flavor and textures by >this< much.

the great kanawha valley hot dog joint tour of 2023



the secret ballot formlast week stanton and three other hot dog enthusiasts decided to sample hot dogs from six different hdjs in one long lunch hour. beginning in nitro and ending in marmet, they selected the six from a long list of potential targets, basing their selections on both quality and convenience: all hdjs had to have achieve at least a 4 weenie score on their last review, and they had to be places you could be sure to get in and out quickly, because time is money. to make the trip go quicker, orders where placed to go and judged in the car. not the most comfortable dining spot, but it proved efficient.  please note: no claim is being made that these six are the best in the valley, but it was felt that they offered a good representation of the variations that exist in the kanawha valley hot dog culture, so spare us your flaming comments.at each hdj, two hot dogs were ordered with chili, slaw, mustard and onions. each of the four reviewers were given a half to judge. they were asked to score on our official weenie scale, using a private ballot form as to ensure their review was not influenced by the others. at the end of the trip, scores were to be tallied and the six hdjs would be ranked. reviewers were also instructed to take notes to be used as tie-breaking criteria. nitro dairy queennitro dqthe tour began at the nitro dairy queen, which is a locally owned "treat" franchise that -- unlike "chill & grill" locations -- is not beholden to dq corporate on how to make its hot dogs which means that "everything" means chili, slaw, mustard and onions, just like god intended hot dogs to be dressed. arriving at their opening time of 11:00, our reviewers were treated with a delicious utilitarian dog with perfect-looking slaw sitting atop equally perfect looking chili. wrapped in wax paper, the hot dog had nicely steamed itself and was soft and warm. three people said the hot dog seemed small, but everyone agreed that it was well-executed and tasty. bammy's chili dogsbammy'sjumping over the bridge to st. albans, the tour continued with a stop at bammy's chili dogs. when the cashier heard the order placed as "two hot dogs with chili, slaw, mustard and onions" she read it back as "two west virginia hot dogs" which on this blog is worthy of extra consideration and should have scored bammy's an extra point or two in their scoring. turns out, they would need the extra points because our reviewers didn't like the too-large onion pieces and said the chili's taste was, in the words of one reviewer, "a little off." kudos, though, for wrapping the hot dogs in both aluminum foil and wax paper to maintain their freshness. next stop was supposed to be hot diggity dogs in north charleston, but as luck would have it, they picked this week to close for vacation, something our team didn't know until they drove up to the front door.  faced with this dilemma, the team had to improvise quickly and choose an alternate hdj, preferably one that wasn't far away.  after a brief conference they decided to visit the most recently reviewed hdj on the blog, dancing dog ice cream on charleston's west side. wimpy the weenie wonk had given this place a 4.5 weenie score just last month so, it seemed promising.dancing dog ice creamdancing dog ice creamat dancing dog in elk city, our reviewers found it easier to get out of the car and do their judging inside, where they were greeted by a friendly staff and the only grilled bun of the day. the bun was grilled on top and bottom, but the sides were still soft and supple. the bun also held the snappiest weenie they found at any of the six hdjs. reviewers mostly liked the chili and slaw combination and overall seemed impressed by the quality of the entire hot dog. one reviewer didn't care for the grilled bun, and another thought it made the hot dog better. if presentation mattered in the scoring, dd would have gotten some extra points, as it would have for friendly service. super weeniesuper weeniea quick trip across town found our group at super weenie on quarrier street. here they only had to order a "west virginia hot dog" because the well-trained staff knows what that means, and it is posted on a sign that lists several optional ways to get your wv dog, including a "polite wv dog" which comes with no onions. we've always found that super weenie lives up to its motto "we're serious about these hot dogs" but on this day the reviewers were a tad disappointed in the taste and texture of the weenie, and one felt the chili was too spicy. of course there are several other options for good hot dogs in downtown charleston, but time was short so the group headed across the bridge and up mccorkle avenue to kanawha city. the pepperoni grill pepperoni grillwhen the team arrived at the pepperoni grill, they were thankful to have a covered picnic table where they could escape the car's lackluster dining ambiance while they waited on their order. once it arrived they quickly noticed and remarked on the generous amounts of toppings piled high on the hot dogs. this had also been the slowest order of the day, and after one bite they understood that the delay was due to a well-grilled weenie that was still piping hot. three out of four appreciated the extra effort and felt the grilling treatment made the weenie delectable. one reviewer found the chili and slaw to be too sweet, and one thought it was "too bready," but the overall consensus was that the hot dogs were filling and satisfying. chum's hot dogschum'slast stop of the tour was chum's hot dogs in marmet, the home of the yellow slaw. it might have been a little apples-and-oranges to include chum's because when you're having yellow slaw it's recommended to leave the mustard off of your standard order, so they did. also, being the last stop of the day with the remnants of five other hot dogs in your belly, it might be hard to judge fairly due to "hot dog fatigue." nevertheless, our team bravely faced the unique yellow slaw variation with as much objectivity as it could muster. only one reviewer felt chum's was up to snuff, with the others having complaints "too vinegary" or "a cheese-like flavor." one was disappointed because of his fond memories of yellow slaw at a hdj of yesteryear that chum's didn't measure up to. resultsat the end of the tour, here's how these six ranked on this day:1. nitro dairy queen - simply a great west virginia hot dog.2. pepperoni grill - delicious and satisfying but the chili is a little too sweet.3. tie - super weenie & dancing dog ice cream - our team couldn't break the tie, finding both of these hdjs a perfectly adequate for a lunchtime hot dog with nothing negative to say about either. 5. bammy's chili dogs - when four hot dog experts agree that the chili was a little off, it's probably a little off. 6. chum's - unique doesn't mean it's better, just different. too different from the others on this day.

barboursville hdj review -  dog haus biergarten



editor's note: this is wimpy's second review this week. not bad for a beginning weenie wonk! keep it up, wimpy!opening in december 2021, dog haus brought its 50th location, and its first one in west virginia, to  barboursville in cabell county.they currently have restaurants in 10 states, primarily in texas.they’ve had success too, as entrepreneur magazine chose dog haus no. 2 on its top food franchises: hot dogs list for 2021, up from no. 4 in 2020.with a variety of other foods, one might be tempted to order chicken sandwiches or burgers, but the company calls itself a dog haus, right?and perhaps in an effort to ingratiate itself to its new fan base and customers, they immediately put a “almost heaven” hot dog on the menu, with chili, slaw, mustard and onions when coming to west virginia.someone did their homework.dog haus’ bun is unique for hot dogs found in our state.for starters, it’s three kings hawaiian rolls that have not yet been pulled apart. so it makes a big hot dog bun. it’s toasted only along the top, remaining soft and fresh otherwise. still, it merits a slight point deduction for a non-steamed bun.grab a lot of napkins, because they don’t skimp on the amount of toppings.the chili/sauce is a slight bit spicy but not at all overpowering while the slaw is creamy and finely shredded.they pair together nicely.the yellow mustard is served on top of the slaw, along with finely shredded onions. this weenie wonk prefers mustard applied first, but it still works.the star of dog haus’ almost heaven is the weenie, dense and packed with flavor. and pretty good size, filling the remarkable bun size appropriately.proud of the quality of its product, dog haus displays a framed motto on its wall:“our haus dogs are made from beef that is raised without hormones and antibiotics. our proprietary recipe includes a unique spice blend of brown sugar, bay leaves, garlic, salt, and black pepper.”one can certainly discern dog haus’ difference in the quality of the weenie. it’s stellar.the almost heaven dogs earns 4 weeniesfor those who enjoy a “cold one” with their hot dogs, there’s plenty of options at this location, a biergarten serving craft beers and cocktails. there’s ample indoor seating and an inviting outdoor patio as well.kids meals are offered, so bring the little ones if you wish. there’s also soft serve ice cream, shakes and floats if you still have room for dessert.dog haus is open:10a-10p monday through thursday, 9a-10p friday & saturday,and sunday 9a-9p.dog haus biergarten6310 us route 50barboursville, wv 25504

st. albans hdj review - butcher's black angus



 editor's note: this is the first review from wimpy, our newest weenie wonk. welcome to the team, wimpy!the hot dogs at butcher’s black angus are carry-out only, but chances are, they won’t make it past the parking lot.sure, you can do some shopping at this small, neighborhood market. but you’ll want to saunter over to the deli case and order a couple of hot dogs to take home (or to the car.)they’re delicious.hot dogs are “made your way” with chili, ketchup (!), mustard, onion and slaw listed as options.slight score deduction for the ketchup hiccup and the added cheese offering.be sure to upgrade to the all beef weenie, because of course, we go premium.it takes a few minutes, no matter how busy the store is. they take their time steaming the buns and applying the toppings neatly. it’s a generous portion of toppings, yet they hold their place. save the napkin for your mouth afterwards.the chili/sauce is meaty, finely ground beef with a good proportion of spice. it marries well with the slaw, perfectly blended between creaminess and its shredded cabbage.(the in-house made chili/sauce and slaw are also available fresh made daily to purchase from the deli cooler.)this hot dog seemingly melts in your melt, yet with a crisp snap of the beef weenie. the taste of summer, available 12 months a year in fact.butcher’s black angus is known for its quality meats and specialty item availability. and there’s plenty of lunch meats, salads and spreads to choose from.if it seems like a blast from the past when you walk in, i’m sure that it is intentional. good stuff, that will likely take you back a few years.4 weenies.butcher’s black angus722 kanawha terracest. albans, wv 25177304-727-1234

welcome to the w.va. hot dog blog!this blog contains hot dog joint reviews from around west virginia and serves as a discussion board for those reviews, as well as providing a space for general discussion of west virginia hot dogs. what is a west virginia hot dog?a true west virginia hot dog is a heavenly creation that begins with a wiener on a soft steamed bun. add mustard, a chili-like sauce and top it off with coleslaw and chopped onions and you have a symphony of taste that quite possibly is the reason that many transplanted west virginians can never really be happy living anywhere else. different parts of west virginia have variations on the theme but the common elements are sweet, creamy coleslaw and chili. anything else is just not a true west virginia hot dog!
