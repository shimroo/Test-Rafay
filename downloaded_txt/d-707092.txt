alberto betella


        i am the co-founder of rss.com, a global leader in podcast hosting, analytics, and audio technology. i hold a phd in affective computing (emotion ai) and have built a career at the intersection of innovation and technology, focused on creating impactful products and solutions that people love to use.
      

        before rss.com, i served as chief technology officer at badi, where 
         we secured over $50 million in venture capital funding and scaled the platform to over 
        one million users. later, i joined alpha, the moonshot factory created by the telco giant telefã³nica, as the cto, where we spun out our health moonshot with a â¬30 million vc round.
      

        my academic work included the  development and validation of wearable tech, as well as real-life applications of virtual reality and artificial intelligence, years before these technologies became widely accessible and part of everyday life. this early exploration continues to inform my approach to building innovative products.
