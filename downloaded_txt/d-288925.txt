the lenco bearcat® began with input from the first-responders and soldiers who put themselves in harm’s way every day. built from mil-spec steel armor plate and ballistic glass, bearcat tactical, armored response and rescue vehicles can withstand the impact of high-caliber assault rifles, mortar frag grenades, ieds — and even storm debris propelled by 100 mph winds. it is capable of negotiating rugged terrain and flooded streets with ease, and can turn on a dime to get out of tight situations.
a custom-modified commercial truck chassis delivers warranty-covered repairs, affordable maintenance and easy part replacement. the bearcat’s high standards of safety, versatility and reliability make it the first choice for law enforcement agencies, state police and sheriff’s department swat teams — as well as the united states department of defense, department of state, department of energy and fbi.
