what's  the  story ?

              it was america, 1952, the "summer of saucers...," the biggest ufo 
              flap in us history! append to this... freshly minted orders to the 
              military to shoot those ufos down.  stir in the flatwoods 
              affair, the auspicious end of the summer of saucers, and you may 
              have an undeclared and secret air-war with et...war where many men 
              and much equipment was lost forgetting the huge collateral damage 
              right here in the united states. i unabashedly report that that's 
              where the data leads, eh? no apologies here.
no?

              then, what did bluebook chief edward ruppelt mean when he said, 
              "...there have been other and more lurid 'duels of death'..."
what did general benjamin 
              chidlaw, head of air defense command mean when he said, "..."we 
              have stacks of reports about flying saucers. we take them 
              seriously when you consider we have lost many men and planes 
              trying to intercept them."

                  amazon review. 5 out of 5 stars.

                  by russell richmondon. july 29, 2017.
 

                  a real eye opener. meticulously researched and a real page 
                  turner. i know this is what the [flatwoods] event is called 
                  but a different title would be justified to equal the content 
                  and credibility of the book. i was blown away. i would say 
                  more but would reveal too much. very highly recommended.

               the 
              "braxton county monster" is a classic close encounter incident and
              


 one 
              of the most baffling cases i've heard of in ufo history.  much 
              of that bafflement disappears thanks to frank feschino, jr, who  committed 
              himself to researching, understanding and explaining the flatwoods 
              incident,  despite 
              the efforts to keep the ufo events of september 12, 1952 quiet.   i 
              first met frank back in the fall of 1991 and reviewed his data of 
              ufo  and 
              crop ring research in braxton county. during that meeting, it was  clear 
              to me that this well-balanced young man really meant business. as  a 
              few years passed by, we continued to collaborate about his ufo  research 
              in braxton county, which now included the flatwoods case. 



 when 
              frank talked to me about the "flatwoods monster," i detected the  "switch" 
              had turned on inside of him. it 
              was the same kind of "switch" that i felt turn on  inside 
              of me when i got involved in my crop circle study, and "once the 
              switch has been  activated, 
              it becomes one's way of life." 






 feschino's 
              new video documentary is compelling, well-done and most of  all, 
              it is just not a story or myth. it is a well-documented series of  events 
              the author has shown us and as uncomfortable as it may be to  many, 
              the facts speak for themselves as to what actually took place.  frank 
              is to be commended for his persistence, personal generosity,  expense 
              and the many years of his life he has dedicated to ufo research.

                    subject: hello, 
                    frank
 




                    frank feschino,

                    from one frank to another, i am writing to you again after a 
                    long hiatus because i am reading the braxton county 
                    monster irevised) cover to cover for the third time (at 
                    least). again i have to praise you for some of the best 
                    research ever conducted into a complex ufo/flying saucer 
                    event. we have known about the sutton monster, flatwoods 
                    monster, braxton county monster for decades, but the event 
                    was mired in uncertainty and, of course, disinformation from 
                    the government. i remember sanderson's articles and gray 
                    barker's book, but your book is the definitive and 
                    incontrovertible documentation that proves the case. only 
                    joe nickell can protest, but i often wonder if he read your 
                    book before promoting his six-foot owl theory. csicop 
                    publications, supported by the government, are irrelevant 
                    though on the periodical shelves of all university 
                    libraries.

                    of course i also have shoot them down, in which your 
                    indefatigable research revealed to me something i never 
                    knew. the list of usaf combat aircraft that crashed in the 
                    domestic theater during the early 1950s is astonishing, 
                    especially when you point out that losses over the united 
                    states dwarfed the number of combat-related crashes in korea 
                    during three years of war. the air force has never explained 
                    some of the sensational disappearances of interceptors who 
                    disappeared while chasing ufos, from capt. mantell and 
                    forward.

                    i also envy your superior artistic talent that has served to 
                    illustrate the flatwoods vehicle and even suggesting a 
                    reptilian species of alien such as seen and described by 
                    george snitowsky's family. 

                    again, my fulsome thanks for powerful writing and images. 
                    the sky is still the limit.

                    best regards,

                    frank thayer, co-author of the aztec ufo incident with 
                    scott & suzanne ramsey

the truth is out there!



by eeevee on october 7, 2016


format: paperback verified purchase



i'm a "collector" of ufo-related books; have 
                  several of them. in my opinion, this book by frank feschino 
                  jr. is probably one of the best!



the author has taken his time -- over about a 
                  20 year period -- to thoroughly research this incident -- and 
                  related phenomena on the same date -- in exacting detail.



in the book, he provides images of much of the 
                  documentation related to his narrative. plus, he interviewed 
                  many eye witnesses to the event. from his dogged research, 
                  it's not hard to believe that, truly, "the truth is out 
                  there"!

great read!
i just finished up reading this book and must say that 
                      frank feschino hit it out of the ballpark with this one! 
                      very detailed read with numerous facts to back up 
                      occurrences.
definitely a must read for anyone interested in 
                      learning more about ufos, particularly about the flatwoods 
                      monster sightings. his timelines and illustrations truly 
                      add to this book. great read!

i see no plausible reason to summarily minimize, or 
                            to look askance at any aspect of this ominously 
                            complex case, which mr. feschino has now so 
                            meticulously pieced together, and reintroduced (with 
                            all proper seriousness and scrutiny) to a world that 
                            simply deserves to be told the truth, no matter how 
                            frightening it might actually be. the revised 
                            publication about the incident is a must-read for 
                            anyone who wants to receive an intelligent and 
                            vastly illuminating rebuttal regarding the 
                            government's idiotic cover story.

this 
                book is worth every penny!!! frank feschino wrote this book with 
                an objective to get people to know what happened, and the way 
                the book is written and with the illustrations, he accomplished 
                this. frank, you should really be proud of this work, i wish 
                more cases had books with this much attention to detail. i have 
                studied the subject for over 30 years, and have read tons of 
                material....

 

i was even an 
                investigator for a while. this is a serious book for those 
                leaning toward real investigations. frank, i also believe this 
                case was key to the attitude of our government relative to ufos 
                and how the data is put out. shortly after this, the robertson 
                panel came about, and those of us that know the subject know 
                this was the genesis of this overtly flippant attitude 
                established about ufos. in fact, i believe this case is probably 
                the most important case relative to what came about after the 
                robertson panel. with this said, i was one of those people that 
                dismissed this case for years, due in 
                part to the original artist drawing that made it look silly. i 
                would buy this book again if lost!! great work frank, and great 
                investigation, this case and your book, should be studied by 
                anyone serious in ufo research. thanks man!!!!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 the "flatwoods monster" incident is arguably one of the 
              most
              terrifying and intriguing ufological cases to grip the 1950's 
              "saucerscene." i applaud mr. feschino for his thorough analysis of the 
              case,which has been exceptionally well-organized in his new 2013 
              "expanded"edition book, and now documentary.
              his documentary succinctly and intelligently constructs the

"the biggest ufo event in history!"

 


whitley strieber
 

"don't miss this book!  this is the best book 
              on this subject

this 
              complicated, incredible and important subject

that has ever been written... or probably ever will 
              be written!"
 

               

               



               

pioneer ufo researcher 

major donald keyhoe writes in 1953

               

"the air force hands-off attitude seemed 
              peculiar to me. for the monster story was having a serious effect, 
              in addition to letters from worried americans... if the air force 
              had sent investigators publicly in hopes of killing the story, it 
              might have backfired. papers and magazines would picture the 
              intelligence officers as making a serious investigation. it might 
              seem proof, to some people, that the air force was soberly 
              impressed by the report - or at least that giants from space were 
              considered a strong possibility... it was far better to brand the 
              whole thing as a hallucination - which intelligence evidently 
              believed was the answer... whether or not the air force analysis 
              is correct, one point is certain - intelligence carefully avoided a 
              public investigation in order to prevent hysteria."

you want "extraordinary evidence" for 
              "extraordinary ufological claims"? i expect you will find it here, 
              in spades, bells, and klaxon horns. too, it is the 
              extraterrestrial hypothesis so far up your nose you feel alien 
              knees scrubbing your top lip; there are no apologies for that. 
              moreover, roc-sized owls and meteorites fall decidedly _short_ in 
              explanation, but thanks for playing dr. nickell. see, folks living 
              for generations in one part of the country are fully aware of the 
              size, appearance, and demeanor of their owls in the first place, 
              and meteors don't linger in the sky for 21 and a half hours, fly 
              below 200 mph, or change direction 90 degrees in the second. this 
              is a story of the--now revealed--aviation history involving the 
              memories of forgotten servicemen acting on orders to shoot ufos 
              down during the biggest ufo flap ever and brave flatwoods citizens 
              who lived with the consequences of those orders. how can this book 
              not be read?  this is the summer of 1952: the biggest ufo 
              flap in us history, a flap leavened with newly minted orders to 
              the military to "shoot ufos down"... followed by credible reports 
              of ufos crashing in flatwoods, west virginia... what would one 
              expect?  buy this book!  -- alfred lehmberg

      the 2012 very needfully corrected, revised, and 
      updated edition of:

             the braxton county monster 
       the cover-up of the 
      flatwoods monster revealed, originally by quarrier press 

    this first book, which was  "fumbled" by the 
      original publisher, is 
      now vindicated with feschino's  new 2012 revised edition...  a 
      vindication at huge personal cost! 



genuinely stalwart author and ufo investigator frank c. feschino, jr.,  leader 
      of a
      groundbreaking investigation into the 1952 "flatwoods monster" case, has
      released a new edition of his (no fault to frank) errantly published, 
      error filled,   


and therefore 
      problematic original book, the braxton county
monster. (sic above)  

      after a more than 20-year investigation into the world's most terrifying ufo
      close encounter, feschino is back to set the record entirely straight!

      discover the highly strange history of a massive cover-up regarding a 12-foot-tall
      extraterrestrial crash-landing in a small rural town amidst a nationwide ufo
      frenzy on september 12, 1952.  yes, that's right.  sqeegee the 
      eye or have facts
rolled into a tube to jab same.

 our government dares to shoot 
      ufos down without notification or informed consent of the population it 
      serves and without regard to where spent shells and rockets might fall. 
      astonishingly, this is forgetting for a moment where the intended 
      target of those munitions might land!  action has consequences.  
      on september 12, 1952, one such consequence found its way to the fisher 
      farm in flatwoods, west virginia.

      alfred lehmberg, u.s. army officer, retired.
      veteran master aviator and writer



          
      on september 12, 1952, shocked american citizens contacted the pentagon, 
      military authorities, police stations, caa officials and the media, to 
      report ufos passing over and landing throughout the eastern united states. 
      during 21 hours of sustained ufo activity that day, several ufosincluding 
      four damaged objectshad 
      penetrated united states air space and crash-landed on american soil. at 
      8:00 p.m. edt that night, one of those damaged ufos, called the flame 
      over washington, passed west over washington, d.c. at a low altitude and 
      scared numerous citizens. the large flaming object continued on a western 
      heading, flew over virginia and then passed over west virginia. shortly 
      after, it redirected south over braxton county toward the geographical 
      center of the state, flatwoods. 
 
          after traveling 206 miles 
      from the capitol, it reached the small town of flatwoods and flew over a 
      group of boys playing football on the local school playground. moments 
      later, the object crash-landed on the mountaintop of the nearby fisher 
      farm and began to glow. quickly, several of the curious boys left and went 
      in search of it. along the way, they stopped at the nearby house of mrs. 
      may, mother of two of the boys in the group. the boys told their story to 
      mrs. may and gene lemon, an adult cousin who was visiting. the boys 
      convinced the two adults to go onto the farm and left moments later. 
 
          meanwhile, the downed 
      craft relocated to a field in the lower section on the farm where it was 
      less conspicuous to the neighborhood locals. shortly after, an alien 
      occupant abandoned its damaged craft and sought refuge in the nearby woods 
      that bordered the property. meanwhile, the group reached the farm in 
      search of the downed object and neared the woods. minutes later, the 
      unsuspecting residents encountered this alien, a gigantic being clad in a 
      metallic-like space suit that sent them running for their lives. this 
      giant became known as the braxton county monster or flatwoods monster. 


          this terrifying encounter 
      instantly made world headlines, was one of the top stories of 1952, and 
      became an icon in ufo literature. yet, there was a downside to the 
      occurrence. the government covered-up the event; the press had a field day 
      with the story and the incident became filled with inaccuracies. even 
      though the case was investigated by several individuals, the story was 
      very fragmented and the truth was never fully known. moreover, the 
      witnesses were ridiculed by many, and the event was eventually written off 
      to folklore. then an artist named feschino made a trip to 
      flatwoods in 1991.  he began looking into the case and discovered the 
      history books were wrong. he also discovered the usaf had revealed shoot 
      down orders against saucers only six weeks prior to september 12, 1952!
      

          this 2012 revised 
      edition book by author/illustrator frank c. feschino, jr. contains new 
      information about the braxton county monster case and has more than 200 
      visuals, including unseen photos, articles, graphics, maps and 
      illustrations, which credit it as the most detailed account of the case to 
      date. feschinos ongoing 20-year investigation reveals a startling 
      invasion of gigantic extraterrestrial beings that occurred on september 
      12, 1952. he reconstructs a precise timeline of events and recreates the 
      frightening scenario, which includes the braxton county monster 
      incident, the frametown monster encounter, the bashful billy wheeling 
      monster and the cover-up a usaf jet fighter, which vanished that night. 
      after 60-years of conspiracies and cover-ups, learn what the government 
      has held back from the american public since 1952... we are not alone in 
      the universe!
 
       




...just when you thought it was safe to go back into the woods at 
      night... you have to start worrying about those pesky giant owls?  
      ...no, but thanks for playing, "dr." nickell...
       
"the sutton [flatwoods monster] story wasn't so 
      easily downed. radio and
      commentators repeated it all over the country. a newspaper syndicate ran
      a series of articles. then mrs. may and the lemon boy appeared on 'we
      the people' and retold their frightening experience...
      people will remember it later, if something breaks." donald keyhoe,
      1953.
       
this writer suspects they will, indeed, and continue 
      to have, reader!  
mr. keyhoe was spot on!  it breaks, and 
      people remember!

      learn why this this ufo close encounter case is still 
      captivating
      audiences worldwide!

explanations

      intelligence officials at project blue book recorded their explanation
      of the "flatwoods monster" in a document titled, "project 10073 record
      card." it stated:

      "the west virginia monster so-called. actually the object was the well
      known washington area meteor of 12 sep. landing near flatwoods."

      furthermore, the  project 10073 record card document states the official
      usaf evaluation as, "conclusion: was astronomical." 

      on september 13, 1952, the new york times printed an article, "flame
      over washington - brilliant streak across the sky probably a meteor." it 
      reported:

      "washington, sept. 12 (up) -
      a brilliant flame, apparently a meteor, flashed across the sky near the
      nation's capital tonight, prompting jittery washingtonians to believe
      they were in for another 'flying saucer' scare."  

      the sept. 12 project blue book case file documents also contain a report
      from the "akron astronomy club" in ohio. intelligence officials at blue
      book based their meteor conclusion on this report which reported the
      object as a, "typical meteorite (fireball)." 

      the akron astronomy club sighted the object at "approximately 7:00 p.m.
      est" and said it was traveling at a speed of, "actual velocity: 27 miles
      per second." yet, this alleged "meteor" landed in flatwoods, west
      virginia, approximately 206 miles away, 
      at 7:30 p.m.  est,  30 minutes later!  the reader can see 
      that this time disparity is problematic.

      the harvard meteor project, which was active between 1952 and 1954
      recorded 2,401 photographic meteor orbits but does not have any record
      of the "well known washington area of 12 sep." that made a "landing near
      flatwoods, w. va." 

      the astronomy magazine, "sky and telescope," has no record of any meteor 
      activity on september 12, 1952."

      the smithsonian institute catalog and several astronomy historical
      documents only record three separate meteorites to have landed in west
      virginia. none of these three meteorites landed in flatwoods, west
      virginia on september 12, 1952.  

      why is this alleged september 12, 1952 "meteor" only recorded in the
      project blue book files and not recorded in any astronomy history or
      record books?          

      why was this alleged meteor that was said to have made a "landing near
      flatwoods, w. va." never found? why is there no meteorite impact pit in
      the flatwoods area?   

      in 1953, usaf spokesman albert chop stated the following information
      about "the west virginia monster" sighted in flatwoods:

      "the group did see two glowing eyes, probably those of a large owl."

      "underbrush may have given the impression of a giant figure."

      the usaf uses speculative terminology in these quotes, "probably" and
      "may have." 

      frank feschino, jr. has spent  20-years investigating the
      "flatwoods monster" incident. his investigation is the longest
      investigation into this case in history. learn what really landed in
      flatwoods, west virginia on september 12, 1952!




 






attention readers &

some "amazon" reviewers!
 
some "amateur aviation historians" and the 
      like, too conservative aviation writers, or other uninformed individuals 
      working in the aerospace industry, pontificate widely on that which they 
      know 
      nothing.   these believe and otherwise counsel that "air 
      wars" between ufos and american fighter aircraft can only be science 
      fiction.  they protest too much and without the smallest competence 
      as they do so.
it remains, just to start, that air 
      force intelligence at project blue book documented twenty-eight official 
      "unknown" cases involved american fighter aircraft and ufos. 

      these ufo incidents, reported officially by crack american fighter pilots, 
      include: intercept attempts, running and head-on passes made by ufos, the 
      individual chases made after them, and then other direct close 
      aerial encounters with "unknown objects," seemingly under intelligent 
      control. these 28 incidents occurred between 1948 and 1960. thirteen of 
      these fighter aircraft/ufo cases occurred during 1952, alone. 

      in 1956, former 1952 project blue book chief, captain edward j. ruppelt 
      wrote, "in the summer of 1952 a united states air force f-86 interceptor 
      shot at a flying saucer." he also stated:




"other assorted historians point out that normally the "ufos" are 
          peaceful, gorman and mantell just got too inquisitive, they just 
          weren't ready to be observed closely. if the air force hadn't slapped 
          down the security lid these writers might not have reached this 
          conclusion. there have been other and more lurid duels of death."


     

      so much for the "historians," the "aviation writers," and the 
      "uninformed," eh?  moreover, history would repeat itself.  
      consider reader, during the united states' greatest ufo flap ever, 
      the summer of saucers 1952, the american military air, land, and ships at 
      sea was under now well known and unambiguous orders to shoot those ufos 
      down!
science fiction?  that's not the record, 
      reader, for the record!   
many of these self-same "amateur 
      aviation historians," "writers" and "aerospace technicians" claim that the 
      vast majority of our american fighter plane crashes are attributed to 
      pilot error, including running out of fuel.  yes, it is absolutely 
      true that some 
      fighter aircraft accident cases were caused by pilot error, which led to 
      death and destruction.   yet, there are several 1950s fighter 
      aircraft accidents occurring under more unusual and mysterious 
      circumstances. the questions leaping forth regarding why so many of these 
      fighter aircraft accidents occurred at all beg answers! was it 
      pilot error, running -out-of-fuel, faulty aircraft... or consequences 
      accrued encountering ufos?
      
how about a few facts while we're
      here reader to raise a little neck hair! 
the following information was found 
      in the new york times.  this list is only a tiny 
      sample of the fighter aircraft "accidents" occurring over america during 
      america's biggest flying saucer flap... where pilots were ordered 
      to shoot those ufos down! i digress, but there were also numerous and 
      correspondingly mysterious fighter accidents and vanishings 
      throughout the rest of world, as well.

      men they carried," were "believed to have crashed" in the area of "white

      house. the three others crashed nearby...there was no indication that the 
      planes were in collision before striking the ground." the usaf also 
      reported, "the formation was starting its descent from 27,000 feet and 
      would report again at 11,500 feet, but the fliers were not heard from 
      again." in closing, "officials at dobbins base said all the men were 
      experienced jet pilots and they knew of no reasons for the crashes."
       
      this is only the tip of the iceberg! there are many, many more folks. 
      
science fiction?

"i congratulate frank feschino for finding the 
          story of our missing airmen in his many years of research into the ufo 
          phenomena. 'shoot them down' is an important historical record of the 
          deaths of brave men who were ordered to engage ufos."

"i have personally heard of 
          seven instances in which military planes chasing flying saucers were 
          never heard from again. the chasing isn't surprising, in view of the 
          official usaf 1952 orders to shoot them down if they don't land when 
          instructed to do so."  
"if i have heard of seven such events, then surely there have been 
          more. (more details are given in shoot them down by frank feschino, 
          jr.).  one can perhaps understand the reluctance of the 
          government to admit that such losses have occurred (even though major 
          general roger ramey admitted in 1952 that more than 300 interceptors 
          have been scrambled)."

          evidentiary substance at all...  mr. lee: "as alfred points out, 
          there is a real story that goes beyond a  'monster' in the 
          flatwoods case, but sincerely exploring that story would be 'culture 
          changing,' as al puts it and we can't have that."

during the summer of 1952, 
          americans reported a record amount of ufo sightings to "project blue 
          book" which resulted in the highest amount of "unknown" cases in blue 
          book's 17-year history.    
 in "shoot them down," 
          frank feschino, jr. focuses on the 
          numerous aerial encounters and confrontations occurring 
          between us. fighter planes and ufos over america and throughout the world during the 1952 
          indian summer.    
feschino researched, 
          investigated, and now reports on the overwhelming amount of suspicious 
          fighter accidents and mysterious vanished planes leading to a 
          shocking amount of pilot deaths during the early to mid 1950s. 
additionally, he  writes extensively 
          about the key ufo cases from the 1952 summer including the july 
          washington sightings and the most complete and detailed story in print 
          of the horrific "flatwoods monster" incident of september 12, 1952.
          
the author unflinchingly 
          documents an in-depth historical account of united states military 
          aviation history that has been overlooked and long forgotten 
          for more than 50-years.
frank feschino, jr. has indeed 
          provided for 
          a segment of american military aviation history not making it 
          into the books of official history .  
the book contains 90 
          photographs, illustrations and maps.

the 1950s military research 
          investigation that  frank feschino, jr. conducted is absolutely 
          phenomenal. for years, he gathered an amazing amount of aviation data 
          and historical material, then put it all together in an eye-opening 
          book about our fighter jet encounters with ufos.    
the overwhelming number of accidents and 
          disappearances of our fighter pilots and jets in the 1950s over 
          america and the world, is beyond comprehension.
being a fighter jet mechanic in the 1950s, 
          we never sent our guys up in unsafe planes... never! we would not put 
          the lives of our pilots at risk...never!
the explanations as to why so many of our 
          jets were crashing during that era are ridiculous. for instance, 
          several jets crashing at once because they all "ran out of gas," does 
          not happen! this excuse was repeatedly used and a very common one. 
          there were several other poor excuses...one right after another.
the fighter pilots and war veteran pilots 
          that crashed or vanished into thin air over this country during the 
          ufo "shoot down" era is shocking.  this book, "shoot them down!" is a 
          must read for any american veteran brother interested in military 
          aviation history. i applaud and thank feschino for his years of hard 
          work.

a  letter from oz...
 
dear 
      frank,

   please let me compliment you on a fine piece of detective work that 
      you have presented in your book, shoot them down!  it's no wonder that 
      stanton friedman has endorsed your book!

         not only have you kept my interest up whilst reading this book you have 
      added some pieces to that big jigsaw puzzle which has bothered me ever 
      since i was a kid who happened to watch a tv program about the 1952 saucer 
      flap over washington...

         i wish to also add my support for your book as it is blatantly obvious 
      to any serious researcher that a cover up has been in place since at least 
      the late forties. now your book has allowed me to put together some more 
      pieces to that jigsaw puzzle. 
 
thank 
      you for a very fulfilling book. 

      book reader
      mr. terry, police officer retired.
      new south wales, australia.




 




shoot them down!

          late in his career, general douglas macarthur stated that the next 
          american war would be waged against aliens from another world. a slip 
          of the tongue?

          author frank c. feschino, jr. reveals ample evidence that macarthur's 
          hostile attitude pervaded the american military and created a theater 
          of engagement in the skies over the united states in 1952.

          from the cities and farms of west virginia to florida's gulf coast, 
          and project blue book's unexplained case # 2086 in santa barbara, ca, 
          to unexplained case # 2099 in portland, me, feschino skillfully uses 
          eyewitness accounts, contemporary documentation and testimonials of 
          experienced military observers to finally put and end to our 
          government's cover-up nonsense.

  "shoot them down," 
          is more than just another conspiracy book about a massive ufo cover up 
          by the united states government, it is a history
          lesson by a dedicated author. feschino spent years researching 
          archives and compiled a chronological record  of events between 
          american fighter planes and ufos in the 1950s.

              he thoroughly researched records, interviewed eyewitnesses and 
          presents the reader with the true story of the ufo activity during the 
          summer of 1952. edward ruppelt's book was only the tip of the iceberg, 
          this book tells the rest.

              i would classify this author as an investigative reporter who lays 
          out the facts for the reader. this book is a must read...finally the 
          truth.

donald keyhoe, 1955...
"in 1949 the air force told me they had been ordered to 'get' a flying saucer by any possible means. this was admitted by an intelligence officer at the pentagon ... major jere boggs. in front of general sory 
smith, boggs told me that one air force pilot had fired at a saucer over new 
jersey."
the san francisco examiner. july 29 1952...
"the air force revealed today that jet pilots have been placed on twenty-four-hour nationwide 'alert' against 'flying saucers' with orders to 'shoot them down' if they refuse to land." the louisville courier-journal. july 30, 1952..."maj. gen. roger ramey, deputy chief of the air force staff for operations, told the news conference [july 29] that interceptor planes have raced aloft several hundred times as a result of reported sighting of unidentified objects. he said that was just standard procedure."robert farnsworth, president of the u.s. rocket society...

telegram to president harry truman,  july 29, 1952:  " i respectfully suggest that no offensive action be taken against the objects reported as unidentified which have been sighted over our nation. should they be extraterrestrial- such action might result in the gravest consequences, as well as possibly alienating us from beings of superior powers. friendly contact should be sought as long as possible."
captain edward j. ruppelt, 1956...
"other assorted historians point out that normally the 'ufos' are peaceful, [fighter pilots] gorman and mantell just got too inquisitive, 'they just weren't ready to be observed. if the air force hadn't slapped down the security lid these writers  might not have reached this conclusion. there have been other and more lurid 'duels of death.'" 
leonard stringfield, 1977..."back in the early 1950s, when i knew of the jet scrambles that sometimes led to disaster, i agreed wirh major keyhoe's writings that in these we may know the intent of the ufo.  i also agreed that 'losing our aircraft to the ufo' may have been the reason for official secrecy, fearing that the public would panic if they knew the truth."general benjamin chidlaw, head of air defense command...  

uncontested quote, as told to investigative writer robert gardner in february of 1953. "we have stacks of reports about flying saucers. we take them seriously when you consider we have lost many men and planes trying to intercept them."
cia memorandum - "subject: flying saucers."  dated sept. 24, 1952...
h. marshall chadwell, asst. director of scientific intelligence: "a world-wide reporting system has been instituted and major air force bases have been ordered to make interceptions of unidentified flying objects."

the fullerton news-tribune, ca july 26, 1956..."the united states navy will not publicly admit that it believes in flying saucers, but it has officially ordered combat-ready pilots to 'shoot to kill' if saucers are encountered, ocns [orange county news service] has learned. the information was first learned when navy pilots navigating trans-pacific routes from the united states to hawaii were ordered in a briefing session to engage and identify ' any unidentified flying objects.' if the ufos (saucers) appeared hostile the briefing officer told the pilots of los alamitos naval air station reserve squadron vp 771, they are to be engaged in combat... it was found that the orders are not unusual."


donald keyhoe, 1973..."in the late 1950s, as a number of futile us chases mounted, some pilots were convinced that the ufos were immune to gunfire and rockets. several intelligence analysts believed the aliens might be using some negative force linked with gravity control to repel or deflect bullets and missiles. but the top control group disagreed. in a special evaluation of us. and foreign reports they found evidence that ufos were not invulnerable. some had been  temporarily crippled, apparently from power or control failures, and a few others had been completely destroyed by strange explosions.   in one or two cases, it appeared that missiles or rocket fire could have been the cause."

moreover...
 
the unidentified craft appeared to take efficient controlled evasive action. --fbi memo, describing chase of ufo over the north sea, 1947.
  

before we could do any more, the army, after conferring with [u.s.] officials, ordered the investigation stopped. --dr. paul santorini, on ufos over greece in 1946.

  
the reported operating characteristics such as extreme rates of climb, maneuverability (particularly in roll), and action which must be considered evasive when sighted ... lend belief to the possibility that some of the objects are controlled ... --general nathan twining, head of air material command (amc), 1947.
  

i was called one afternoon [in 1948] to come to the oval office  the president wanted to see me.... i was directed to report quarterly to the president after consulting with central intelligence people, as to whether or not any ufo incidents received by them could be considered as having any strategic threatening implications ....--general robert b. landry, air force aide to president harry s. truman.

  
 from their questions, i could tell they had a good idea of what the saucers are. one officer admitted they did, but he wouldn't say any more. --commercial pilot, after questioning by intelligence officer, 1950.
  

army intelligence has recently said that the matter of unidentified aircraft' or unidentified aerial phenomena,' otherwise known as flying discs,' flying saucers,' and balls of fire,' is considered top secret by intelligence officers of both the army and the air forces. --1949 fbi memo on ufos. 

  
information is desired if this was some new or experimental aircraft or for any explanation whatsoever. --1949 cia memo. 
  

[object] described as flat on top and bottom and appearing from a front view to have round edges and slightly beveled ... no vapor trails or exhaust or visible means of propulsion. described as traveling at tremendous speed.... pilot considered by associates to be highly reliable, of mature judgment and a creditable observer. --air force intelligence report, following ufo sighting by f-51 pilot, 1951.

  
...some propulsion method not in the physics books. --scientist who witnessed a ufo in 1952.
  

for six hours ... there were at least ten unidentifiable objects moving above 
washington. they were not ordinary aircraft. --senior air traffic controller for the caa, harry g. barnes, 1952. 

  
based on my experience in fighter tactics, it is my opinion that the object was controlled by something having visual contact with us. the power and acceleration were beyond the capability of any known u.s. aircraft. --f-94 pilot, after encountering a ufo, 1952. 
  

in view of the wide interest within the agency ... outside knowledge of agency interest in flying saucers carries the risk of making the problem even more serious in the public mind than it already is. --cia memo, 1952

  
it was silvery in color, had a bun-shaped top, a flange like two saucers in the middle and a bun underneath, and could not have been far off because it overlapped my windscreen! --raf fighter pilot, 1954. 
  

maximum security exists concerning the subject of ufos. --cia director allen dulles, 1955.

  
some military officials are seriously considering the possibility of interplanetary ships. --fbi memo on ufos, 1952. 
  

pilot of helicopters wished to stress fact that object was of a saucer like nature, was stationary at 2000 ft. and would be glad to be called upon to verify any statements and act as witness. --emergency report from maxwell air force base on air space violation by ufo, 1954. 

  
i have discussed this matter with the affected agencies of the government, and they are of the opinion that it is not wise to publicize this matter at this time. --senator richard russell, head of senate armed services committee, regarding his sighting of a ufo during a 1955 trip to the soviet union.
  

what bothers me is what's happening to our aircraft. --anonymous air force officer, 1955. 

  
the air defense command in 
baton rouge was on the phone, waiting for our report, when we landed there. --commercial pilot following a ufo sighting, 1957. 
  

saucers exist (i saw two). they were intelligently flown or operated (evasive tactics, formation flight, hovering). they were mechanisms, not united states weapons, nor russian. i presume they are extraterrestrial. --lt. colonel richard headrick, radar bombing expert, 1959 

  
reliable reports indicate there are objects coming into our atmosphere at very high speeds and controlled by thinking intelligence. --navy admiral delmar fahrney, public statement, 1957.
  

congressional investigations ... are still being held on the problem of unidentified flying objects and the problem is one in which there is quite a bit of interest.... since most of the material presented to the committees is classified, the hearings are never printed. --congressman william h. ayres, 1958 

  
behind the scenes, high-ranking air force officers are soberly concerned about ufos. but through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense. --former cia director, roscoe hillenkoetter, public statement, 1960.
  
 when the team was about ten miles from the landing site, static disrupted radio contact with them. five to eight minutes later the glow diminished, and the ufo took off. another ufo was visually sighted and confirmed by radar. --classified report by an air force strike team at minot afb, 1966. 

  
... reliable, but off the record information from the pease afb in 
portsmouth, indicates frequent radar blips and fighters are constantly scrambled to pursue these objects. --journalist john fuller, 1965.  
  

i think there may be substance in some of these reports ... i believe the american people are entitled to a more thorough explanation than has been given them by the air force to date. --congressman gerald r. ford, march 1966. 

  
if 'they' discover 'you', it is an old but hardly invalid rule of thumb, 'they' are your technological superiors. --national security analyst, lambros callimahos, 1968. 
  

my own present opinion, based on two years of careful study, is that ufos are probably extraterrestrial devices engaged in something that might very tentatively be termed 'surveillance'. --dr. james mcdonald before congress, 1968.

  
 

...all of preceding are frozen moments in our ufological past and, collected together, are a largely unimpeachable indication regarding the actuality of some larger reality... a grand physical existence from which we are being, very suspiciously, "protected" by a conflicted, corrupted, and likely criminal mainstream.   
 

somebody knows.

conceived in sincerity and efficacious diligence, supported in an unstinting and selfless fellowship, and then executed with imagination, intelligence, and bravery... the event is a bona fide success.  this writer hopes that, as a result of this in all likelihood seminal incident of cooperation and appreciation, the people of west virginia realize two things.
 
one, that they are top dead center on the short list of one of the most astonishing and precipitous events of modern times, and two, that they owe larry bailey and his three fine sons, especially gilbert bailey... a hearty vote of thanks for bringing the preceding to them.
 
a special salutation goes out to freddie may, who missed the event due to poor health.  he was sorely missed, often thought of, and fondly regarded both days... 
 
...please send a kind thought freddie's way.
 

the flatwoods fuse is lit folks.  buckle in.
