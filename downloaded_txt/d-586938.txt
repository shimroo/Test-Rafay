green cafe






hours



please, appointments only, until further notice. 
our email is info@greencafe.com and our phone 
is (951) 659-6000.



we are located at green cafe55260 south circle driveidyllwild, california 92549







as of may 5, 2025, green cafe will be twenty-eight years old. yes, we have been happily in idyllwild the whole time.




services


we are an internet service provider, located at an elevation above
5,500 feet. our services include website design, dsl, cable internet, wireless and computer assistance.



we are idyllwild based and provide some specialized computer and internet
related services. additionally, if you came up "the hill" for the weekend and
somehow forgot something technically important, we might be able to tell you where in town,
or near town, where you can get the item.




our primary focus is the advancement and preservation of the arts, 
culture and the environment through the use of digital technologies. we
strongly believe that idyllwild is much more than a collection of
pleasant shops ... but in fact a collection of creative talent
located in a dramatic environment that rivals any other area on
earth.







around the shop
what type of person hangs around the green cafe? have a seat, hold your breath and look at some of society's greatest public enemies...





---












longtime idyllwild greenster, sculptor, landscaper, poet, author, artist, environmentalist, teacher, archer and musician, almadeus star, lost his home and practically everything, including fifty plus years of his artwork and intellectual efforts, to the recent altadena wildfire. a gofundme page has been created to help him get back on his way and to start teaching and creating new and beautiful art again. as of february 17 @ 02:58 pm, the gofundme site has received 70 donations and raised $7,838 towards the goal of $10,000.

cafe cinema, home of classic films, is back.
 
for our second event, we will examine the history of copyright law 
in the early portion of the development of moving pictures. believe it or not,
there was no such thing as intellectual property in the film industry during 
its the early going. it took a film called "ben hur" and a landmark supreme court 
ruling to forever protect the 
media rights of all those in the trade. 




this online only event is by invitation only and, as always, is free. 
the event date and time will be emailed to cafe cinema club members. 




if you are a 
"greenster" and are interested in participating, please email us at    
projectionist@cafecinema.org or sign up at the  cafe cinema website.

as so much has rapidly changed on the idyllwild scene, we thought we
would completely revamp our links section. below, a new listing for 2024 has
 been initiated and we anticipate you will find that each entry embraces a substantially
 idyllwild centric and integrated nature.

satellite
 weather




satellite imagery is an indispensable tool
for determining weather conditions. below is a
recent satellite depiction of the western united
states and the pacific ocean, albeit with state boundaries superimposed. the satellite image is updated
 every five minutes. if the land mass is brown or the circle is green, then its daytime. blue means the imagery is from nighttime. in case you are curious, the green 
circle is centered on idyllwild, california and the red dot approximates the hand of a clock at the time of image capture. a yellow circle indicates nighttime. 




current satellite view: air mass  
goes satellite view will return. yellow circles are not in effect in air mass view.

*** to view an animation ***






there are three animated satellite sequences to choose from: 1 hr, 4 hr and 16 hr. when clicked, the image below the tab is a snapshot of the cloud conditions from that many hours ago. for example, if you selected the 4 hr tab at 5 pm, then the image shown below portrays the action at 1:00 pm. 







to view the animation from that time to current, simply move your mouse pointer near the green or yellow circle below. wait a few seconds for the animation to start all the while keeping the mouse pointer near the green circle. the last image will pause for about seven seconds and represents the latest view before the loop starts again.
