preliminary information

on the next page you'll be asked to select an implicit association test (iat) from a list of possible topics . we will also ask you (optionally) to report your attitudes or beliefs about these topics and provide some information about yourself.  
	  we ask these questions because the iat can be more valuable if you also describe your own self-understanding of the attitude or stereotype that the iat measures. we would also like to compare differences between people and groups.
 data privacy: data exchanged with this site are protected by ssl encryption. project implicit uses the same secure hypertext transfer protocol (https) that banks use to securely transfer credit card information. this provides strong security for data transfer to and from our website. ip addresses are routinely recorded, but are completely confidential. we make the anonymous data collected on the project implicit demonstration website publicly available. you can find more information on our data privacy page.
important disclaimer: in reporting to you results of any iat test that you take, we will mention possible interpretations that have a basis in research done (at the university of washington, university of virginia, harvard university, and yale university) with these tests. however, these universities, as well as the individual researchers who have contributed to this site, make no claim for the validity of these suggested interpretations. if you are unprepared to encounter interpretations that you might find objectionable, please do not proceed further. you may prefer to examine general information about the iat before deciding whether or not to proceed.
if you have questions about the study, please contact project implicit
at questions@projectimplicit.net.  to obtain more information about the
study, ask questions about the research procedures, express concerns
