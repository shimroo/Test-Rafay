new film! through a lens darkly and the emergence of a people













through a lens darkly, directed by thomas allen harris is a film that explores how african american communities have used the camera as a tool for social change from the invention of photography to the present. this epic tale poetically moves between the present and the past, through contemporary photographers and artists whose images and stories seek to reconcile legacies of pride and shame while giving voice to images long suppressed, forgotten, and hidden from sight. 



a salute to lgbt artists

following the film there will be a q & a with photographer's ocean morisset, lola flash and michael chambers.



view the trailer and order tickets at the link below! limited enagement through september 9th at nyc.s film forum.

call on the ancestors for healing










black and brown people: in troubled times like these we must call on our ancestor's for healing. rocks thrown at the strong arm of injustice will land flatly on the ground, but the work of our ancestor's strengthens, protects and lifts us to greater, unreachable heights. 


we come from a legacy of resilience and must never forget. we will continue the work of our ancestor's and in doing so, they will continue to bring vital support to us to fulfill our potential here on earth.







we do not act alone. we are loved.

black youth in particular are problematized, stigmatized, marginalized and pushed into an underclass by society as a whole. we are made to fear our youth--the voiceless tribe of today--so it's no wonder many of them choose to tune out and escape into other worlds of their own.

"ocean, what kind of camera should i get?"







i get questions all the time from friends and acquaintances about which camera is the best one to buy. to that question, there are a myriad of answers based on what you plan to do or shoot with the camera. even though photography is a technical field, those aspects don't particularly interest me. i get bored with conversation with other pro's about lenses, dof, and photography rules. while i agree it's important to know the basic rules of composition, light and of course camera usage i think honing the "eye" is a much more useful lesson to the layperson embarking on a journey through photography. there are many roads to take towards arriving at a successful image and at the end of the day, the viewer will decide based on how the image moves them (or not).in my opinion, there's no reason to spend thousands of dollars on camera equipment. i've seen "photographers" with the latest of everything and the photography vest to match, but will use their camera on "a" automatic mode, or do all the "photography" using photo-editing software.to answer the question about which camera to get, i'd say spend little on a camera with an m (manual) mode. this allows you total control of the camera and will force you to learn about exposure, depth of field and shutter speed. you will of course need much practice with composition--how you "frame" what you're shooting, and that takes much practice so shoot a lot!nowadays, there are advancements with camera phone technology and we've all seen what the iphone can do! i happen to shoot often with my iphone, but my main pro camera--a nikon d80-- is considered an antique in the rapidly-changing landscape of dslr and technology. yet, i still get the job done, pleasing clients and "fans" alike. when i think about how we revere images from the past-- those taken by "master" photographers--i note that most of those camera's used to shoot historical images are now antiques! this reaffirms the notion that good photography is not only achieved by the (good/expensive) camera, but mostly by the "eye".the most important thing in all of this is to enjoy photography. whatever genre interests you, be it fashion, photojournalism, landscape, still life, etc., it's important to have fun, treat your subject matter with the utmost importance, and try new perspectives.these days, everyone claims to be a photographer thanks to the mass accessibility of camera phones, so it's important to stand out from the pack in some way, learn from your mistakes, never compare yourself or your work to another photographer and always remain true to yourself!(iphone) photo copyright ocean morisset photography. peekskill, n.y

ode to harlem besties












piggy back ride



transportation of love



with laughter as its fuel



it never tires, 



not for a sister 



or a bestie...



it rages on like fire.







our friendship



fits like a glove;



passion- burning warmth



on the coldest days



and darkest nights



moved beyond the depths



of all that inspires,



the joy of which takes form



of these words i write. 







a moment in precious time



in the face of a neighborhood 



and a world



in transition



--uncertainty--



thick like african musk oil



vaporizes in the heat of a 



harlem summer



and joins the breeze



as together, we take flight.







and while all things inevitably change



my love for you stands 



the test of time



and soars 



like an iridescent kite.
