											testimonials from our clients										
see what people are saying about our work







“having access to a 24-hour guest services team sure made a huge difference for us ——  at 4:00 a.m. we were awakened by the sound of running water coming from the laundry room.  after investigating, we found the water line attached to the washer had ruptured, so i quickly turned off the water source.  a call to prestige accommodation’s 24 hour service team had a plumbing technician and a clean up crew at our home by 6:00 a.m.  i couldn’t have asked for anything more”.


															steven z. from discount tire company														





“thank you for delivering a rice cooker to my apartment. your company provides everything a person could ever need.”


															amin p. from jda software														





“my family has been relocated 3 times over the past 7 years, and we’ve never been treated better by a temporary housing company. the fact that you thought of my children and purchased presents for them, was way beyond thoughtful. i’ve already spoken to my v.p. of human resources and told her how impressed i am with your company.”


															doug r. from petsmart														





“you really do care about your guests. thank you for the complimentary groceries you had delivered. it really made my first few days in tucson easier.”


															sandra a. from avnet														





“i appreciate you making this so easy on us, the apartment is great.  living at san capella is like being at a luxury resort.  the kids think they’re on vacation, taking full advantage of the pools and clubhouse.”


															jeff r. from freeport mcmoran														





“i received a call from nick, my prestige representative, a few days prior to my arrival at remington ranch.  he informed me that i’d been upgraded into a two-bedroom apartment home.  great news since my son will be visiting me for long weekends and now he won’t have to sleep on the couch.  thank you guys so much.”


															carol m. from  amazon.com														





“my department head asked me to analyze our temporary housing spend in 2018.  i was happy to be able to report we had saved over 8% from the previous year by teaming up with prestige accommodations and taking advantage of prestigerewards.”


															chris f. from mayo clinic														





“after a day of airline delays, it was nice to open up the front door to my new home and see three days worth of groceries waiting for me.  i couldn’t imagine having to go out at 10pm and find a grocery store.  your team really is the best.”
