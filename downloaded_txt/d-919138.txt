what our customers are saying








frosch has been partnering with magnatech now for over three years. it has been an amazing relationship. the unused ontrack plus solution is exactly what we needed, and were lacking to provide the end 2 end customer experience. our clients have a high volume of unused tickets and the features magnatech offers reduces money that would be lost for them, as well as reduces our agency overhead due to manual processes. the support is outstanding. thank you!
