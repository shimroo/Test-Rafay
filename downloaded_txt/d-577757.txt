what real chicken tastes like

redbird farms has been providing fresh chicken since the 1940s. as we’ve grown and expanded to more territories, redbird farms has maintained a commitment to quality and integrity.   





































why we’re differentwe believe the original way of processing chicken is still the best.  we rest our chicken for at least 6-8 hours after harvest, prior to processing.  this ensures the most tender and juicy chicken available.
