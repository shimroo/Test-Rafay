when i sat down to write this review of the englander sports pub and restaurant, the louvre was the first thing that came to mind.
if you just spit out your morning coffee, give me a few minutes to explain.
a good sports pub never deviates from what it is — an unpretentious space where fans can catch their favorite teams in action while sipping on their favorite drinks and munching on some guilty, greasy delights they swore to abandon after new year’s day.
the reason the englander sports pub and restaurant reminds me of paris’ louvre museum — home to the legendary mona lisa painting by da vinci — is that it focuses on its simple objective, that is, presenting some of the greatest art on the planet. nothing more, nothing less. it is this specialization in masterpieces that truly makes louvre a world-class museum. fancy microbrews and corn dogs? head out of the museum and into a sports pub.
simplicity and minimalism are the key ingredients that a beer-strained sports pub and a hoity-toity museum have in common. rather than have a lot of things going on, these two establishments specialize on a few items and do it well. being a jack of all trades in this case is not the optimal business model. sports pubs that chose to diversify rather than specialize learn this sooner, or later. specialization is the hallmark of a great sports bar and what separates legendary sports pubs from ordinary ones.
if you love sports pubs — more specifically british sports pubs — we’ve got a splendid recommendation for you: the englander sports pub and restaurant. since its launch, this restaurant has become famous in california’s bay area and beyond. it is one of the best sports pubs to catch matches of your favorite teams internationally with people who are reasonably knowledgeable about sports. what’s more, there won’t be any drunk soccer fans like you would expect in london.
