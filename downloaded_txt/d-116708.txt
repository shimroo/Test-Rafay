nigerian granted uk asylum for joining terror group

the third-worlders britain’s moonbat rulers are importing to displace the native population can achieve “asylum” any number of ways. for example, a colonist from nigeria might join a terror group:
the 49-year-old woman joined the indigenous people of biafra (ipob) in 2017, six years after arriving in the uk.
ipob, which has been blamed for acts of violence against the nigerian state, is banned as a terrorist organisation in nigeria but not in the uk.
the judge was aware that she joined the group as a ruse to get asylum.
upper tribunal judge gemma loughran ruled the woman had a “well-founded fear of persecution” despite noting she wasn’t honest about her political beliefs.
could be judge gemma isn’t honest about her political beliefs either. otherwise, she might admit she bestowed the lifetime ticket to ride the welfare gravy train not because the nigerian had any legitimate claim to it, but because moonbattery.

usaid support for islamic terror

if only us-taxpayer support for muslim terrorism through usaid were limited to enriching jew-baiting rappers. it gets worse:
[c]urrent and former u.s. officials who worked closely with the embattled aid group say they watched for years as it funneled millions of dollars to anti-israel advocacy groups and entities linked to terrorism. …
in november 2022, for instance, usaid awarded $100,000 to a palestinian activist group whose leaders hailed the popular front for the liberation of palestine, a designated terror group. just six days before hamas’s oct. 7 assault on israel, usaid handed $900,000 “to a terror charity in gaza involved with the son of hamas leader ismail haniyeh.” …
a february report from the middle east forum think tank found that usaid had awarded “millions of federal dollars” to “organizations directly in gaza controlled by hamas.”
given the ongoing war of eradication islam has been waging for 1,400 years, this represents treason against western civilization:
“before and after oct. 7, usaid flowed uncountable hundreds of millions of dollars toward hamas that enabled it to launch the attack and keep battling israel afterwards,” [senator ted] cruz [r-tx] said. “the full story of usaid funding hamas is vast and much of it was done in secret.”
in addition to funding terrorists,
under samantha power, former president joe biden’s pick to run usaid, agency officials fought pro-israel policymaking at the state department, often urging their colleagues at foggy bottom to pare down statements that praised the jewish state, former officials said. in 2021, during a period of conflict with hamas, power herself refused to meet with israel’s ambassador unless israel reached a ceasefire with the iran-backed terror group.
in the context of fighting terrorists, ceasefire is often equivalent to surrender.
the depth of usaid’s maleficence may never be known, because according to inspector general paul martin, it “does not maintain a comprehensive internal database of subawardees.” they do not want us to know where our money has been going.
however, we do know that with leftist kooks like obama’s un ambassador samantha power in charge, it has not been going where we would want it to. in her capacity as usaid administrator, this malevolent moonbat even opined that fertilizer shortages that cause food shortage are good, because climate ideology.
usaid is a hill the democratic party seems willing to die on. die it will — and not a moment too soon.

dem rep escalates rhetoric and draws guffaws

the black lives matter riots — driven by the liberal establishment through media propaganda, corporate support, democrat officeholders, etc. — worked out great for the party of government, intimidating voters and helping to dislodge trump from office. as they grow increasingly desperate, democrats may resort to such tactics again. in case their base takes repeated references to fighting in the streets too figuratively, peruvian-born rep robert garcia (d-ca) calls for “actual weapons” to be used against elon musk for exposing their waste, fraud, and abuse.
“actual weapons” could be construed as a reference to the kind employed by thomas matthew crooks and ryan wesley routh in their recent assassination attempts.


omg.
elon and doge should investigate who paid for this. pic.twitter.com/e2b42muq5u
— libs of tiktok (@libsoftiktok) february 12, 2025
 
disturbing as their rhetoric has been getting, it is hard not to burst out laughing at democrats’ trademark projection. after doubling down on his assertion that elon musk is a “dick,” garcia denounces his colleague marjorie taylor greene for not having enough decorum and even proclaims that she “is not a serious legislator and she shouldn’t be treated as such” — as if garcia himself were a serious person.


just in: democrat rep. robert garcia says democrats need to fight elon musk with "actual weapons," says it needs to be done for "democracy."
"i think is really important, and what the american public wants is for us to bring actual weapons to this bar fight."

usaid gave $3.3 million to anti-jew rapper

i thought its commitment to lgbtifying children would be the millstone that drags the democratic party to the bottom of the sea, but maybe it will be usaid. among the latest revelations: this quintessentially democrat federal agency gave $3.3 million of our money to an organization headed by an anti-semitic rapper.
via daily mail:
new york rep. mike lawler, 38, slammed the agency for providing tomorrow’s youth organization, an ngo that helps palestinian youth, with the multimillion-dollar grant in 2022, he said in a press release.
“helping palestinian youth” is usually liberalese for supporting the terror campaign against israel.
the republican called the organization’s executive director, american-born raffoul saadeh, a ‘vicious anti-israel rapper who advocates for jew hatred in his music.’
the song “scars of gaza” reveals that saadeh is as oblivious to irony as any moonbat. he compares the palestinian experience to what the jews hamas wants to eradicate experienced in auschwitz — as if nazi death camp inmates were in a position to launch 10/7-style terror attacks on the german civilian population. a video for the song that has been pulled from youtube reportedly “ends with a call for violence.”
it would not be much of a stretch to say that by showering money on people like saadeh, usaid is calling for violence.
meanwhile, democrats dig in and defend usaid, launching a hate campaign against elon musk for exposing it. they have made it arrogantly obvious that if they have their way, what usaid has been doing with our money will continue. why would any sane country trust democrats with power after this?

teacher succumbs to end-stage tds in front of class

for an idea of how well liberals are taking trump’s success, let’s have a look in the classroom:
a teacher at an all-boys catholic high school on staten island resigned after going on an anti-president trump tirade during class that descended into calling one of his students a “punk a–” during an unhinged outburst, according to a recently leaked video clip.
the unnamed teacher at monsignor farrell high school was recorded last wednesday by a student while speaking vehemently against trump — criticizing the president’s order to release billions of gallons of water in california to fight the los angeles wildfires and labeling him a dictator…
apparently the students did not receive his msnbc-style rant with appropriate solemnity:
“i’m not kidding when i say, ‘wipe that smile off your face.’ detention, i just wrote you a referral mentally. you’re going to detention for bringing up politics in class,” the instructor aggressively yelled at a student at the private school.
here’s a taste of what students are served:

squad member ayanna pressley lets mask slip

listen to them when they tell you what they intend to do to you. looking like a villainess from a weird science fiction movie, rep ayanna pressley (d-ma) has proclaimed the following:
“we are all willing to work with anyone who is serious about doing the work of censoring the american people and advancing progress.”
whether this was some kind of freudian slip or pressley is too dumb to hide the ball, she really did say that. she was at a rally protesting the hold trump’s people put on a rogue agency, elizabeth warren’s tyrannical consumer financial protection bureau:


ayanna pressley just said the quiet part out loud: democrats are willing to work with anyone who is serious about censoring americans.

democrats admit why they erased henry hyde

even as names erased as part of their war on history begin to be restored, democrats continue to cancel the disfavored dead.
from suburban chicago’s daily herald:
the courthouse [in wheaton] became the henry j. hyde judicial office facility in 2010, three years after the republican lawmaker from wood dale died at 83 years old.
[dupage] county [illinois] board members voted 10-5 along party lines to remove hyde’s name from the building.
here’s why tolerant liberals want to inflict postmortem punishment on hyde, even though he shared their hostility to gun rights:
republicans strongly opposed the decision. but the resolution was supported by democrats, who referenced the hyde amendment, legislation introduced by hyde in 1976 to block the use of federal funds to pay for abortions, with some exceptions.
democrats want you to be forced to pay for other people to kill their own children, thereby making you morally complicit in genocide to the extent that you agree to live under the us government. hyde will not be forgiven for having the decency to stand in their way.
explicitly referencing the hyde amendment, democrat dupage county board chair deborah conroy crowed:
“i believe our actions should reflect our values.”
that they do.  again we are reminded that the democratic party goes well beyond merely being wrong.

“manufacturing” deleted from newspeak dictionary

it is no longer politically acceptable to use the word “manufacturing.” this official newspeak dictionary deletion comes from on high. presenting rep jan schakowsky (d-il), ranking member on the commerce, manufacturing, and trade subcommittee of the energy and commerce committee:

says it “turns off” women.

dems bring in blind man to not see waste

this was taken not from the babylon bee, but from not the bee. it is for real:


the democrats' star speaker, dylan hedtler-gaudette, director of government affairs at the ngo "project on government oversight" (pogo), says he can't see any widespread abuse or waste from government spending. he is also blind, and is literally unable to see anything. the… pic.twitter.com/xlibqiekbi
— ian miles cheong (@stillgray) february 12, 2025
 
democrats correctly figured that only a blind man could fail to see the waste, fraud, and abuse prevailing in the swamp, now that doge is shining a klieg light on it.
hedtler-gaudette has at least one other qualification in addition to being largely blind. his ngo is bought and paid for by a conspicuously influential democrat donor. pogo…
…gets a large chunk of its money from the open society foundations, a grantmaking entity created by the one and only george soros.
no one will be surprised to read at the portland press herald that during his testimony at a congressional hearing yesterday,
dylan hedtler-gaudette used his opportunity to directly challenge some of president donald trump’s early moves under the name of government efficiency.
hedtler-gaudette pointed out in his opening statement that the federal government already had a team of inspectors general focused on rooting out waste, fraud and abuse in executive branch agencies. trump fired 17 of them days into his second term.
given the revelations that have resulted, replacing them with musk and his team was obviously the right move. yet hedtler-gaudette denounced it as an “unlawful midnight purge.”
he congratulated himself for defending the swamp’s waste, fraud, and abuse at the hearing, proclaiming himself to be on “the side of the angels.”
in addition to allowing him not to see what democrats have been doing with our money, his handicap has other advantages:
when [rep marjorie] taylor greene interrupted him during his opening statement to say his time was up, he apologized. “i can’t see the flashing light,” he said with a grin.
democrats can’t run the government, but they aren’t bad at staging a farce.

12-year-old girl denied heart over covid vax

they cut off their own children’s genitals to make them lgbt-compliant or even tear them to pieces in the womb. so they won’t lose any sleep over a 12-year-old girl being denied a heart transplant because her family wouldn’t give her the covid jab:
adaline deal, a distant relative of [jd vance] by marriage through his half-siblings, was born with two rare heart conditions that her family knew would one day require a transplant, her mother janeen deal told the cincinnati enquirer.
adaline — who was adopted from china when she was 4 — was treated at cincinnati children’s hospital for nearly 10 years, and her parents hoped she would get the transplant there.
but the hospital requires transplant patients to be vaccinated, and declined to make an exemption even when told it goes against the family’s religious beliefs as nondenominational christians, the parents said.
when will covid tyranny end? when they launch the next pandemic.

schumer: americans really don’t care

american blood is boiling as doge provides new revelations regarding the massive amounts of our money the federal government has been flushing away in the most outrageous manner conceivable (e.g., promoting sexual perversion in third world countries). you might think democrats would have the presence of mind to distance themselves from waste, fraud, and abuse rather than confirming their guilt by attacking elon musk for exposing it. they might even promise to mend their ways. but all we get is unhinged rage of the f*** trump variety.
democrats have still not composed themselves because outrage over the usaid scandal caught them by surprise. in their arrogant contempt for us, they don’t expect us to object to being robbed.
remember the looting spree obama passed off as “stimulus”? schumer didn’t think we would mind it was packed full of pork.  from 2009:
what’s wrong with a little pork in a more than $800 billion economic stimulus bill?
that’s apparently the stance taken by democratic sen. chuck schumer.
while helping himself to our money, he speaks for us and proclaims we don’t mind:
“and let me say this to all of the chattering class that so much focuses on those little, tiny, yes, porky amendments, the american people really don’t care,” schumer said on the senate floor.
problem is, the prime ingredient is pork — and calling it “pork” is putting it politely.
abuse even the most patient people again and again and sooner or later, the worm turns.
