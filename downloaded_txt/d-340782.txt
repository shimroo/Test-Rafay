    sundays live online at 9 & 10:30am
  
















discovery is a group of people who are pursuing god’s best in the middle of our messes. together we’re learning about jesus and the life to the full he wants us to experience. whether we connect in person or online, we want to bring heaven to earth in our homes, our neighborhoods, and around the world. 













church center is an all-in-one app for you to rewatch the weekend messages, manage your serving requests, give, connect, take attendance for your groups, and so much more. this will replace our previous discovery app so you can have everything all in one place! so make sure to get rid of the old app, visit the app store (apple or google), and search for “church center”. hit that download button and follow the set up instructions. you can also follow this link to get connected to discovery’s church center.if you have any issues, contact kate at ksartori@discoverypgh.com

current message series












god wants to take you on an adventure of a lifetime. he sent his son, jesus so we could experience life to the full. our new series, lessons from the mountain will dig into four events in the bible where god meets with his people in the peaks (and sometimes valleys) of life and what we can learn for our journeys ahead. 




    watch the series
  









  in your family as it is in heaven



let’s partner together as you lead your kids and students in pursuit of god’s best! our discovery crew is always creating fun and safe environments for the next generation to experience a journey that leads to a life dedicated to following jesus.
