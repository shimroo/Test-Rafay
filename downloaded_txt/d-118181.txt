photo gallery






the beauty of lafayette square is irresistible to anyone who sees the world through a camera lens. professionals,  hobbyists, and smartphone-savvy photographers alike enjoy capturing the neighborhood in every mood and season.
it's difficult to take a bad picture when nature, architecture, people, pets, and wildlife all conspire to create postcard-worthy vistas everywhere you look. but when we issued an invitation to have photographs of lafayette square featured here we were overwhelmed with the variety and quality of the submissions.
this gallery contains some of our top favorites, but come back often because there will be additions to the collection each season.
