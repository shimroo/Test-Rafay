better student outcomes start with better learning environments. 














we envision a future where better school design is the rule, not the exception.

the collaborative for high performance schools (chps) is a nonprofit organization that works to ensure all k-12 students have access to environments that support learning and wellness. we help facilitate and inspire transformational change in america’s education system by changing the way schools are designed, constructed, and operated. 


























student centeredstudent outcomes including academic performance, health, wellness, and safety are at the core of our work, and the foundation upon which chps’ strategic programs are built upon. 















school focusedchps is the first and only building performance standard developed to meet the unique needs of k-12 school districts and we see schools as a critical catalyst for change.















collaborativechps works to align the industry around a powerful vision and collaborates with diverse partners involved in improving the lives of students through the lens of school buildings.



























improving k-12 schools nationwide



school facilities constructed or renovated using chps high performance building criteria are more energy and water efficient, and make a difference for students, teachers, and communities. chps has worked with over 60 school districts nationwide on more than 700 projects to give millions of enrolled students better learning environments.

deepening engagement and impact 



while chps is best known for its performance criteria and recognition programs, there’s more to be done — and quickly — to address the state of our schools and give all students access to the learning environments that they deserve. our new 2024 strategy has resulted in a robust portfolio of new programs in various stages of development designed to deepen industry collaboration and scale impact.

supporting our members 



we work with and grow a collaborative of chps members — a diverse group of experts and other stakeholders committed to improving student outcomes through the lens of buildings. members gain access to chps criteria, bespoke project support, a network of experts, and other resources to effectively plan and execute high performance schools.
