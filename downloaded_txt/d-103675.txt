download display driver uninstaller ddu  - display driver uninstaller is a driver removal utility that can help you completely uninstall amd/nvidia graphics card drivers and packages from your system, without leaving leftovers behind (including registry keys, folders and files, and driver store).  the amd/nvidia video drivers can normally be uninstalled from the windows control panel, this driver uninstaller program was designed to be used in cases where the standard driver uninstall fails, or anyway when you need to thoroughly delete nvidia and ati video card drivers. the current effect after you use this driver removal tool will be similar as if its the first time you install a new driver just like a fresh, clean install of windows. as with any tool of this kind, we recommend creating a new system restore point before using it, so that you can revert your system at any time if you run into problems.

intel is gearing its next batch of discrete graphics cards using a new architecture called xe3p. this design is a tweaked version of the earlier xe3 setup and is meant to work better with panther lake core graphics. what’s different this time is that intel isn’t just outsourcing the chip-making to companies like tsmc anymore; they’re planning to do it in-house. this change could mean more control over production, smoother integration with other intel products, and maybe even fewer delays when rolling out new tech.» read full story

microsoft has updated its processor list for windows 11 version 24h2, and this update is mainly aimed at helping device makers pick the right processors for new computers. the new list now includes several recent amd chips like the ryzen 7 8700g and ryzen 5 8500g, along with a few other ryzen 5 and ryzen 7 pro options. on the flip side, some older intel processors—from the 8th, 9th, and 10th generation core series—have been dropped from the list. this change is all about making sure that new windows devices have the right kind of performance, security, and reliability that windows 11 expects. rest assured, though, that if you’re already using windows 11, your system isn’t affected by these updates.» read full story

passmark recently released a cpu performance report that shows some interesting trends. they’ve been tracking performance on windows pcs since 2008 by looking at benchmark scores from the best-performing chips. up until around 2016, cpus were steadily getting faster. but starting in 2023, the top x86 processors seem to have hit a limit, with little improvement seen in the most recent years. this slowdown is expected to continue into 2025, and it has many experts wondering if the old rule of thumb—moore’s law—still holds true today.» read full story

the latest nvidia geforce driver release, version 572.42 whql, addresses several technical issues that have impacted game performance and system compatibility. this update corrects a crash-to-desktop error in valorant at launch, resolves system freezes when exiting final fantasy xvi, and eliminates performance drops in delta force when resizable bar is enabled. moreover, it remedies an unexpectedly low score in the 3dmark dxr feature test for rtx 50-series blackwell gpus and resolves problems caused by mismatched dynamic link library files. some known issues remain, such as the delay in updating the “display gpu activity icon in notification area” until after a system restart and reduced performance on cuda vpath tests with vray 6 on blackwell gpus.

the european union has planned new measures to reduce unnecessary packaging in the retail market for desktop processors. under the packaging and packaging waste regulation, which became effective on february 11, 2025, manufacturers must update their packaging practices within an 18-month period. currently, processors sold in retail settings are packaged in boxes that are much larger than the processors themselves and often include extra items such as stock cooling devices needed for standard operation. in contrast, products shipped in bulk to original equipment manufacturers are packaged in a more streamlined manner. the new regulation aims to minimize waste by requiring a shift to simpler packaging that excludes nonessential components.» read full story
