"have you broken 
				trail on snowshoes? mushed your huskies up the river, dared the 
				unknown, led the way, and clutched the prize?" - robert service



(â© best in snow)
						 







welcome to north wapiti kennels. we are located 
				in the beautiful tawatinaw river valley, near perryvale, 
				alberta, canada.  
our 
			siberian huskies
				are competitive in many different arenas â most notably, 
			in racing and conformation. we are very proud to be the only 
			siberian husky kennel in canada to have attempted and completed the 
			grueling 1151-mile iditarod trail sled dog race.
north wapiti kennels has successfully completed 
				the 1000+ mile iditarod sled dog race in 2001, 2004, 2006 and 
				2008 
				using only purebred siberian huskies. the north wapiti team 
				finished the 2001 race with more dogs than any other iditarod 
				2001 team, being the only team to finish with 15 of the 16 dogs 
				that started the race. during the 2008 race the team was able to better their personal best finish 
				time by a few hours. their finish time was the 
				third fastest in iditarod history for a purebred siberian husky 
				team.   









many thanks to 
				our sponsors!!
