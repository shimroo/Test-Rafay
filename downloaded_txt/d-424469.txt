samn johnson
consolation
"consolation" is a song cycle composed by samn johnson for vocalist tis kaoru zamler-carhart, setting latin poetry from boethius's consolation of philosophy. it features layers of tis’s voice accompanied by samn’s electronics and instrumental recordings. 

boethius wrote the consolation in 524 ad while awaiting execution after his political downfall. he is visited in prison by the feminine allegorical character of philosophy. through their imagined dialogue, it is apparent that both characters are in fact himself, both male and female, both free and captive, facing his own questions about his life choices: money, fame, power—did they make him happy?

mechanical licensing & royalties | hosted by serona elton
new on “digital harmony: music creation in a digital world,” serona elton explains the various aspects of u.s. mechanical licensing and royalties including which rights under copyright law are involved, the difference between a voluntary vs. compulsory license, and a work-by-work vs. blanket mechanical license, what is meant by a first use vs. second or later use, and which party has the responsibility to obtain the mechanical license and pay the related mechanical royalties (record label or dsp) in difference scenarios.
this web-series is part of acf’s digital media expansion to empower artists, made possible with funding from the john s. and james l. knight foundation. learn more at https://knightfoundation.org/ and follow @knightfdn on social media.

american composers forum
 
the american composers forum honors and acknowledges the anishinaabe and dakota people, the ancestral caretakers of this land; we take this time to consider the acts of violence, displacement, and unjust treatment toward them that have occurred over many generations; we offer our respect and gratitude to the elders of the past, to those living today, and to those who will come in the future, for their careful stewardship of this land and its resources and for the rich cultural legacy they will continue to create here.
the american composers forum enriches lives by nurturing the creative spirit of composers and communities.
