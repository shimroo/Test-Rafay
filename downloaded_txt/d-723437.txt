e. coli genome project






















e. coli genome project overview
 
   our group at the university of wisconsin - madison sequenced 
      the escherichia coli k-12 genome, and continue 
      to maintain and update its annotation. we created knockouts of many genes, 
      archive clones of many orfs, and an extensive gene expression data set under 
      a variety of physiological conditions. these  data sets are made available 
      freely to the community.
   we also sequenced six pathogenic enterobacterial 
      strains, related to e. coli k-12, as well as a number of plasmids.
      the comparative genomics aim of this effort is to characterize 
      the gene pool of horizontally transferred elements and virulence determinants 
      known as the pathosphere.
   the asap database, developed in collaboration with dr. nicole 
      perna, is a platform for community sharing of annotation information and 
      data which is made available for downloading by the community.
