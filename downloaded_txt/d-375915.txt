start with a homepage
once b2evolution is installed on your own web server or web hosting account, you might want to introduce your website with a home page.
change the photo, the title, the intro text... and you've got your very own homepage.
when you're done with the home page, you can start adding more sections (a.k.a. collections) to your site. they will appear in the main navigation bar at the top...
b2evolution runs your site on your own domain. 
it can also run on a subdomain, in a subfolder or on multiple domains.
this optional site-wide header can be used as a top-level navigation menu for your site.
front page container
you can configure which widgets appear here and in which order.

add a blog
with 3 additional clicks your website gets a blog section.
write something. hit "publish". it's live!
you may also immediately start customizing your site design:

choose a different skin: example 1, 2, 3, bootstrap
customize your skin with skin settings
add, remove and re-arrange skin widgets
optionally customize your css
if you fancy, dig into the open-source php code

you can configure the urls for each of your collections. in this case we chose a sub-folder.
header container
though this will typically display the blog title, you can configure which widgets appear here and in which order.
menu container
you can configure which tabs appear here and in which order.
sidebar container
you can configure which widgets appear here and in which order.
when you write an intro post, it always appears before regular posts. you can write a global intro but also specific intros for your categories or tags.
same content, different skin
changing skins doesn't change the content. i just gives a different look to your site (or a section of your site).
same widgets, different styles
when changing skins, your widgets remain in the same order, but each skin may style them differently.

multiple blogs done right!
multiple blogs can be used as different sections of your website.
you could also have loosely connected blogs by letting each member of your organization, community or family customize their own space to their own taste.
b2evolution was designed for multiple blogs from day one and makes management really easy:

all skins and all plugins are compatible with multiple blogs ;
each blog can run in a different subfolder, different subdomain or different domain ;
you can easily move posts and comments from one blog to another ;
you can cross-post into multiple blogs at once !

configurable navigationeach of your blogs or collections may or may not appear in your main site navigation. you have total control.
this blog has been configured to have a special front page with a global intro for the blog.

share your photos
photo albums
organize your photos into albums and show them off in a neutral design that lets your art shine!
albums open into contact sheets of thumbnails of customizable size. each thumbnail can be viewed in full screen through a lightbox which allows zooming in to the highest available resolution of your photos.
slideshow mode & keyboard navigation included.
photo blogs
if you prefer a linear story with added text, we also have skins just for that!
albums view
this page shows your albums. clicking on an album will open the thumbnails view.
thumbnails view
this page shows thumbnails for all photos in an album. clicking on a thumbnail will open the photo in a lightbox.
zooming in on details
if the original image is of higher resolution than the viewer's screen, the mouse cursor will turn into a spyglass allowing the user to zoom in on any part of the image.

connect your community
by adding forums – a.k.a. bulletin boards – to your website, your community can stay in touch with each other by sparking conversations on the topics they care about.
b2evolution’s forums can be enabled on your site in 3 clicks. no plugin necessary. no integration issues.
feature highlights:

file attachments in discussion threads
user profiles & directory
private messaging between users
advanced multi-level moderation
efficient spam killing features

b2evolution includes full community features, including customizable user profiles and private messaging.

publish with structure
manuals, books and documentation often require a structured hierarchy of chapters and sub-chapters, contrary to blogs, which are typically organized by date.
each manual can have its own assigned contributors. each page can have its own attachments (images, videos, downloads) as well as a feedback/comment feed if needed.
manuals can be navigated hierarchically or searched in full-text. you can also easily create transverse hyperlinks from one page to another using easy wiki-like markup.
tree-view browsing
the most distinctive feature of a manual-type collection is that its contents are organized into chapters and sub-chapters rather than a linear "by-date" ordering.
