    rural small business energy grant opportunity

september 17, 2024

green energy expert/usda grant for small rural businesses                                                                                     the link of the map provided by the usda is to determine if you reside in an area that meets the requirements for this grant providing 50% back for any energy reduction project for a small business. the usda has the 50% budgeted again for next year, but it is not approved. if they do not get approval for the 50% it will revert the standard 20% back on any energy reduction project for a small business in a rural area which is still very attractive.                                                                   ﻿                                                                                                                             grant map eligibility

(please note: if you have already contacted robertson county and made changes for this tax year we may not have those corrections in our system. we can’t ‘see’ into their system and they can’t ‘see’ into our system.)
