say hello to the new nutrasweet
same name, new mission. we replace sugar naturally while delivering better quality sweet taste leading to better health for consumers in a sustainable manner that benefits the planet. made in the u.s.a. on a revolutionary new technology platform built to deliver a 100% natural, plant-based, zero-calorie sweetener that doesn’t compromise taste for health – nutrasweetm.™

















welcome to the
new science
of sweet

nutrasweetm™ is a natural, zero-calorie sweetener with a superior taste profile when compared to other stevia-based sweeteners on the market. our clean sweet sugar-like taste makes nutrasweetm™ the perfect sweetener for use in beverage, bakery, and confectionery products.

the secret behind our sugar-matching sweetness is rebaudioside m or reb m, a sweet compound found in the leaf of a stevia plant. reb m sets nutrasweetm™ apart from other forms of stevia which are less soluble and carry a bitter aftertaste.
