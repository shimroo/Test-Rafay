observed section trials 
(mud trials or sporting trials in 
					other parts of the world) are an integral part of the 
					austin 7 club. austin 7s are no longer driven in ost 
					competition, except for the odd exhibition run, and trials 
					cars are now highly specialised cars, built to a specific 
					formula & utilising modern components. 

the most famous trial, originally 
					named the park orchards trial because of its location in the 
					melbourne outer suburb of park orchards (now covered in 
					houses) has been relocated and named the john pryce memorial 
					trial, in honour of the renowned club member who introduced 
					the sport to australia in 1950.
					around 12 trials are held annually.


					 entry fees are very low, admittance to trials is always 
					free and new members are always welcome. trials car 
					passengers are mandatory and we often need new member 
					volunteers for this.


					 we 
					are always pleased to help anyone wanting to build a trials 
					car. give anyone on the  

					trials committee
                  	a call, and see grant campbell's advice on trials cars
                  


					here.
