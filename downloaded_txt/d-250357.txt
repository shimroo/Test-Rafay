open door animal sanctuary, celebrating 50 years of service since our founding in 1975, is proud to be the largest no-kill shelter in the greater st. louis area and the state of missouri. for half a century, we have been dedicated to rescuing stray, abused, neglected and unwanted cats and dogs, giving them the care they need and the love they deserve while helping them find their forever homes. every day, we provide shelter, food, medical attention, and endless affection to more than 400 animals, ensuring every one of them has a safe haven and a second chance at life.
