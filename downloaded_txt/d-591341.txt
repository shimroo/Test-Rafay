deadstar assembly bi0graphy

 

prologue deadstar assembly; a troupe of musical avant-gardes who float like demented seraphim and deliver a sinister sound that burns. their poisonous blend of hard rock, metal and electro-industrial hardstyle is about to set the world ablaze once again with no apologies. act i the bleak and barren landscape that is today’s music scene isn't news to america's youth... it looks, sounds and smells like commercial accountability, and there are a growing number of alienated audiophiles that aren't buying into it. the industry has breast-fed a generation of entertainers so enthusiastically willing to sell themselves that any inkling of artistic integrity is muffled by the sound of their endorsements. gap-tastic hipsters, suburban rap warriors, plastic pop divas, and costumed clowns... they make great marketing fodder, but seldom great songs. everyone seems to be searching for a hook, and the hook never seems to be the music. enter deadstar assembly.  act iidsa knows what they're not: the butterfly band that is born, lives, and dies within the confines of a record label's fiscal quarter. dsa knows what they are: a primal, soul-scorching nightmare machine built for speed, possessing the sonic tools for staying power. their much anticipated upcoming release “blame it on the devil” is an overture of fury that injects chaos straight into the vein portraying themes of good vs. evil, positivity and negativity and the consequences we face based on the choices we make. infectiously catchy songs such as the intoxicating “will not die” and the haunting ballad, “into light,” paint the vivid landscape of undying determination and suppressed angst, while commanding tracks such as “filth” and title track “blame it on the devil” feature massive guitars, twisted orchestration colliding with elements of hardstyle, metal and razor blade vocals that are determined to raise a misguided generation to their feet.  act iii dsa’s larger than life sound and stage personas are proof that rock is not dead. their phonic darkness is a hybrid that fuses the best elements of 80’s metal, electro-industrial and a dose of cinematic tension resulting in epic sized rock anthems that could quite possibly make them the bastard children of motley crue, a badge of honor they wear on their sleeve. their distorted image soaked in war paint symbolizes a clenched fist to the mundane and serves as a means of escape for both it’s members and their devoted fan base worldwide.  with international touring under their studded belts and a scorching live show to boot, dsa is once again ready to launch their musical delirium into the masses. dearborn’s vocals are diverse ranging from dark and gritty to uplifting and melodic while dreggs delivers an amplified tsunami of chord-crushing guitars. mubo’s praying mantis style stage presence is electrifying emitting a wall of synths which embodies an electronic messiah. the dsa rhythm section features fallen angels the dro whose bass provides a undeniable low end that is guttural and the technically proficient percussive assault of kriz d.k. whose hard driving blistered beats provide a tempo for destruction and a rapid fire to ignite your inner deviance.  epilogue for a growing legion of alienated youth looking for relief from commodified hipness, searching for a voice that won't be co-opted by volkswagen, a teen-angst anthem that doesn't sell product, deadstar assembly is a twisted savior. they are an explosive exploration in aural alchemy; sonic salvation that is equal parts 80’s metal, 90’s industrial with a modern sheen and attitude with big hooks. a genre-bending juggernaut poised to be respected by disillusioned youth and emulated by future artists. dearborn: vox, guitars, programming and orchestrated mayhemmubo: synths, circuitry, the electronic messiah the dro: bass, pyro and subsonic tremorsdreggs: crunch guitar and digital anarchykriz d.k.: percussion, beatings and hysteria
