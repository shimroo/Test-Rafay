welcome to my 
      world!!!!
this is my first 
		attempt at creating a web page. it hasn't changed much in design since 
		it was first posted back in '03. it holds various parts of my life, 
      some more important and ongoing than others, but all will be there because 
      they are what makes me who i am. 
these pages will also 
		be in a constant state of construction/upgrade, as new ideas may come 
		and get implemented and updates will be taking place. 
or not - as the 
		mood strikes me as i'm finding that web page creation comes when 
		inspiration hits me, which seems to be few and far between theses days.

ahhh.... here's where 
      things have changed since i last typed anything on this page. i will go in 
		order of the topics at left.*****
my 'about me' page has changed once again. 
		life changes that have actually stabilized and gotten consistent (for a 
	  change).. 
*****the knights 
      of silver and rolemaster pages are active once again, as the group has 
	  regrouped as they say to form yet another iteration. welcome to matt carp 
	  and welcome back jonathan!
also thank you to matt 
	  samuelson for coming into rolemaster and allowing the game to continue, or 
	  at least until everyone dies.  
 
	  updates for each page will be coming shortly so watch for them!*****my gates mcfadden page 
		has hit a bit of stagnation as my 
	  interest in finding new pics has been dwindling for a while now. i may 
	  post a few new ones here and there, but it's pretty static now. 
*****
my music page hasn't changed as my 
	  musical situation hasn't changed much, so nothing new there.
*****
the links 
      page has been updated yet again to include a few new ones and delete a few non 
      working ones.
