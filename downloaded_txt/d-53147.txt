    who we are
  
























 

curious about the state of peace and security funding?in november 2019, we launched our funding map to provide an evidence-based understanding of funding for peace and security issues. we maintain this online map as a resource for the field to better understand the landscape of peace and security philanthropy; for grantseekers find funders; and funders to find partners.
