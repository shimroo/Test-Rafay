                                                        i live in  michigan
                                      and   have   enjoyed     tying    knots
       for      a   number          of    years.          recently,     i
discovered            polymer      clay     and       began      utilizing
        it    in   my  hemp    jewelry.     each        polymer      clay
                          picture bead   is   individually       hand crafted,
         making            it   unique.        these        beads       are
used     in   macrame'             hemp      necklaces,         or strung
        on leather          cord,    according            to  your   preferences.
            some      of the more  detailed           designs           may
  look    painted     on  in the     photographs.       please      know
     these   designs   are   not  painted,   but     crafted     of polymer
     as well.
i have   
        added many new styles of beaded necklaces this year. they have been
                                      added      to various new pages in
my   examples         section.
necklaces 
          may                  also   be  personalized       by  including 
                                         a   vial   containing           
    a   grain           of   rice     with       your        name    on it.
  any     name      or    word         may   be written               up
 to  9   letters      on each  side.            the vial     contains   
  an    oil,    magnifying           the  tiny   letters           so they
 can      be   seen.        the     top  has    a  rubber  stopper      
  and    is   permanently            attached       to prevent   fluid  
    from      leaking.       hand-blown              glass     vial     
 shapes    available        are:  test-tube,           mushroom,     dolphin, 
      heart,         cross, tusk,    and  anchor.
         
                  hemp name bracelets are very popular and come in  a  wide
                                  variety     of  colors.     i  have also
 seen     them     used     as   keychains                              
        and   nametags     for    book   bags. these       hemp        bracelets
           may    also        be   presented      as a  gift   tag    on
   that  special    present!

                     usa bracelets and cause ribbons have recently been added
                                      to   our    pages.       these   are
 very     popular        and    readily        available          in  many

hemp     
                keychains are available in the same styles as the hemp  
name     bracelets.           you   may have any name, pet, car, hobby, sport, 
                                    etc.    spelled out   on   them.     these
       are    popular        in   favorite         team     or school   
colors.        metal     pewter   finish         number   beads      are used
   for    graduation         years.

    additional                   photos   may  be seen   on  the  new    
items    page. i have added an additional page where you may view some of 
my original fine artworks.             
be   sure
     to check   out my craft  show schedule.     i travel   the craft   
                    shows in michigan    and have many   more  jewelry products 
                                               not    pictured     on this 
 site.      i  would        love     to   meet       you    at    one    of

    are also     other places   where   my  work can   be seen  listed  on
   the awards   and    honors page.

   i   am 
                         working on a number of new pages full of information 
                       for      fellow       craft      lovers.    these pages
     may    not    be     completed        for     some  time,   though 
  i  beleive          they   are       beginning   to     take  shape.  
   they   will include       features       such as   tips   on getting 
     started    in   the arts      and crafts    business,     a  free  arts
  and crafts         show directory,             arts     and crafts    books,
 and  more.    i hope you     will check      them out    and   let  me 
   know what you  think (constructive         critisism   is  welcome).
