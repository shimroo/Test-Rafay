 petersburg is an island community that continues to make a living from the sea. we have three beautiful harbors which attract the smaller cruise ships, private yachts and pleasure boats to town in the summer months. leave the crowds behind, and take a trip to this thriving fishing village with a strong norwegian heritage. visit with our hardworking and friendly residents and learn about our abundant marine life.
petersburg is located on frederick sound near the summer feeding grounds of hundreds of humpback whales. the stikine-leconte wilderness area, with the spectacular leconte glacier calving off tons of bright blue icebergs, is just a short boat ride away. visit a place that still hold on to its small town roots.
step back in time for our 2-day fourth of july celebration or take a mini-visit to scandinavia during 4 days in may as we celebrate norwegian constitution day with our little norway festival. we are proud to share our petersburg hospitality and help you to enjoy the breathtaking wilderness that surrounds us. whether your interest is hiking our many beautiful trails, flight-seeing over the glaciers, chartering a boat for whale watching or a glacier trip, birding, sports fishing or sightseeing, petersburg has it!
