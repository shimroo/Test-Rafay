amazing muscle building secrets revealed inside secrets on building massive muscles!
in case you didn't know, most people in the supplement and bodybuilding 
  industry will not share their techniques and secrets. sure they may show you a 
  workout plan in a magazine and try to get you taking supplements. true 
  bodybuilders never give out the real secrets. they are guarded secrets; the 
  cherished nuggets of gold that make them what they are. giving these secrets 
  away would be giving away years of hard work, years of trial and error and helping their competition. 
i'm sure that you are wondering why i am revealing these secrets. 
  well, frankly, it's because i, like you, have finally reached the conclusion 
  that we are getting taken advantage of... we don't get what we deserve and we 
  are spending ridiculous amounts of money to try to build muscle, on programs and supplements that don't work.
if you want to build muscle quickly, you need this 
  information. the information basically covers all aspects of building muscle, 
  from training to nutrition. it applies to everyone especially those who are 
  genetically average. it doesn't matter if you're young or old, the information 
  is, in some cases, shocking!
a few years ago i totally gave up on trying to build the body i wanted. i 
  thought how is it possible for us to put a man on the moon, clone animals, 
  replace organs in humans and not be able to help genetically average people 
  build impressive physiques? i wondered if people like me and you who have 
  genetically average bodies could make dramatic changes in our physiques? i 
  mean wouldn't you want to have a lean, strong, muscular body? if so, then i'm 
  telling you now that i've found the answers!
the answers are: it is possible for you to pack on slabs of ripped muscle 
  mass fast! it is possible for you to completely change your body, no matter 
  what shape you're in now, even if everything you've tried previously hasn't 
  worked!

i'm living proof!!

the truth is, i hated the way i looked. i was embarrassed to take my shirt 
  off in public. i even hated taking off my clothes in front of my girlfriend. 
  for ten years i desperately wanted to improve my body; to look like a bodybuilder.
i had joined gyms countless times, read every muscle magazine and book i 
  could find, tried every supplement out there, worked out everyday, ate like 
  crazy to put on weight and nothing, i mean nothing really worked. even when 
  i'd see a little improvement, the gains would fade and so would my 
  enthusiasm.
i would give up and then after a few months, i would try again thinking 
  that this time would absolutely have to work. each time despite my efforts, i 
  would get frustrated with my lack of progress and lose focus.

but, i'm not writing this to tell you about my 
  failure...

i'm writing to tell you how i finally achieved success! how i added over 
  thirty pounds of solid muscle to my skinny body! you see i was going about 
  everything all wrong. the books, the magazines, the trainers, the jocks at the 
  gym all know nothing about the real truth to packing on 
  slabs of muscle. it took me over ten years of trail and error to find out what 
  it really takes to dramatically change your physique and build massive muscles 
  fast, even for genetically average joe's like me and you.
i'm far from being the best built guy in the world. but with what i've 
    learned i only can get better and better every month. i've built a body i can 
    be proud of.
i've never had so many people compliment me on the way i look and ask how 
  on earth i made such an extraordinary change in my physique in such a short 
  period of time. the truth was that i stumbled upon some cutting edge 
  information. information that supplement companies and muscle magazines would never reveal. 
the first thing i did was share this information with my personal training clients. soon they too started to change their bodies dramatically. finally people started telling me to write this information down so 
  they could get it out to others, so here it is now!
by reading this you'll be saving time and money, avoiding mistakes and 
  disastrous situations, and learning secrets other people only wish they 
  knew.

would you like to know how to add more muscle without years of hard work? 
  you will not find out how from physique magazines, they're geared to sell 
  weight gain powders and make money off of you. if you want to join the few 
  that have learned how to pack on muscle quickly you'll need to know these 
  closely guarded secrets:

and many more tips and secrets!

unfortunately, all this information is not available in muscle 
  magazines and books. that's because 95% of these books and magazines are 
  printed by supplement companies. as a result, it's not unusual to 
  find articles or information warped so that the company benefits in the end. 
  
how many times have you read about "studies" done by "scientists" that show 
  a certain supplement or pill "worked"? then on the next page see that they 
  conveniently happen to have an advertisement for that product, with an 
  endorsement from a bodybuilder or celebrity? don't get me wrong - at times, 
  these magazines are excellent sources of information. they occasionally have 
  very accurate, thoughtful and intelligent articles. the problem is, however, 
  that a person trying to find definitive answers can get confused very quickly 
  and get tainted with inaccurate information and unscientific rumors. the 
  supplement companies benefit - in terms of $$$ - from your confusion. 
  
unfortunately, this pattern does not give us any more answers, but only 
  more questions, wasted time, frustration and empty wallets. how does one 
  escape this cycle and find success? by using a unique 
  system i have put together called "muscles express!". 
you see what you have just read is only a small sample of the exciting 
  information you will get when you use  the muscles express! program

  revealed in a step-by-step, easy to understand format. the ebook is 
  one-of-a-kind and not found in bookstores. muscle express! is quickly becoming the most popular muscle building ebook on the internet.
don't think you can just go to the gym and get some huge guy to workout 
    with you and follow what he does. what works for him will not work for you. 
    he could have great genetics or could be using drugs. i'm going to show you 
    how to get around these obstacles, quickly and easily.
over the past several years i've grown tired and have become frustrated 
    with the information out there to help people like us. everything that i 
    know of is tainted and geared towards having you buy more pills or books or
