the max planck institute for psycholinguistics is a world-leading research institute devoted to interdisciplinary studies of the science of language and communication, including departments on genetics, psychology, development, neurobiology and multimodality of these fundamental human abilities. 
we investigate how children and adults acquire their language(s), how speaking and listening happen in real time, how the brain processes language, how the human genome contributes to building a language-ready brain, how multiple modalities (as in speech, gesture and sign) shape language and its use in diverse languages and how language is related to cognition and culture, and shaped by evolution. 
we are part of the max planck society, an independent non-governmental association of german-funded research institutes dedicated to fundamental research in the natural sciences, life sciences, social sciences, and the humanities. 
on this website, you will find everything you need to know about our institute, departments, research groups, researchers and their publications, as well as our upcoming and past news and events.
