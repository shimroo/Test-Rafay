flying u cotton rosser


for the past several decades, cotton and his family have worked to make the flying u one of the most successful stock contracting firms in professional rodeo. cotton has long been known for his outstanding rodeo productions, including the flamboyant opening ceremonies presented at the national finals rodeo, the houston livestock show and the grand national rodeo in san francisco just to name a few. rodeo is show business as far as he is concerned. according to cotton, "you have to run the show, you can't let the show run you. if you don't keep the audience entertained they will go somewhere else."
