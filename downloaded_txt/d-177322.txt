this artificial intelligence stock could be a 100 bagger





there’s a convergence of two massive technology waves happening presently, offering a once-in-a-lifetime wealth-changing opportunity.artificial intelligence, or ai, is the fastest growing software market. even though it just started, it’s already the same size as the mobile application market.ai is expected to grow 10 x’s to $1.6 trillion in just 3 years.not only that, microsoft just invested $10b in the parent company of chatgpt, the ai application that google declared a “code red” for their entire online advertising business.the other technology wave in play here is web 3.0 when the physical world merges with the digital world.experts predict that web 3.0 will be at least 1,000 xs larger than the current web.instead of just 1.5b pcs and 4.5b smartphones generating, sharing, and retrieving digital content, it will consist of 100b+ devices like (drones, robots, surveillance cameras, street lights, cars, etc…)here’s the problem though; these 100b+ devices can not use the existing protocols (html and http) to start web 3.0.however, there is one company that offers an artificial intelligence operating system, platform, and protocols for this “new web” or web 3.0. is this years away? unequivocally no, it’s here right now!not only that, their first contract was for $26min addition, their first application with this very same first reseller is expected to generate up to $1b in revenue.perhaps even more important, the ieee, which sets the standards for wifi, ethernet, bluetooth, etc… is in the process of making its’ protocols the standard for web 3.0 find out what this nanocap is, before google and microsoft do! enter your email to get the full report.

duckduckgo search engine not as private as you think





 from bleeping computer.com ""duckduckgo browser allows microsoft trackers due to search agreement"the privacy-focused duckduckgo browser purposely allows microsoft 
trackers on third-party sites due to an agreement in their syndicated 
search content contract between the two companies. duckduckgo allowed trackers related to the bing.com and linkedin.com domains while blocking all other trackers.in spite of what you may think, or see in their ads, you are not private when you use duckduckgo.google can determine what sites you visited and the searches you made.the government can determine your search and browsing history.is duckduckgo really private?duckduckgo proved it themselves that there is no such thing as a private search engine.

the real reason elon musk put twitter deal on hold





 elon musk. nobody can argue the guy is brilliant and thinks 5 steps ahead of everyone else. today he announced that the deal to buy twitter is on hold.they are saying " elon musk put his $44-billion deal for twitter inc (twtr.n) "temporarily on hold" on friday while he awaits data on the proportion of its fake accounts"everyone knows twitter is loaded with bots. so could there be another reason why the deal is hold? i think so.elon absolutely knew that twitter was filled with bots. he cannot be surprised about this.he sold billions worth of tesla stock before and after he announced this tender offer. the share price of tsla is now 30-40% lower.this guy is a visionary...he knew the market was in trouble months ago.so...1. he got much higher prices for tsla stock while the due diligence was taking place.2. he knew twitter was loaded with fake accounts.3. he tells everyone deal is on hold due to misleading figures.4. the twitter management team is going to called out for this discrepancy.5. he can get twitter for much less.the guy is brilliant. think this was all part of a plan?

facebook meta hiring slowdown is a warning to email marketing 





  facebook plans to reduce hiring.from cnbc.com "wehner reiterated to investors that privacy changes apple instituted on its ios devices last year will hurt growth, after the company had already predicted the move would reduce revenue this year by $10 billion."those "privacy changes" are impacting more companies and industries than just facebook.not only do they prevent facebook from tracking users across their apps on the iphone, but the new privacy features will have enormous ramifications for email marketing companies.“mail privacy protection hides your ip address, so senders can’t 
link it to your other online activity or determine your location. and it
 prevents senders from seeing if and when you’ve opened their email.” appleit basically sends an email into a "holding tank" so it appears that every email has been opened. read more about apple's email privacy solution.

10 ways netflix can get their momentum back





netflix, once a pioneer in the video entertainment business, is now turning into a "has been". for the first time in a decade, netflix lost customers."the streaming giant is scrambling to find new sources of revenue growth,
 with execs hoping to monetize password-sharing freeloaders and — 
previously unthinkable at the big red n — planning to introduce 
advertising-supported plans."here are 10 ways netflix can get back on track1. offer a real "review" solution. there is nothing more tiring that having to google the reviews of a movie or series you never heard of. maybe buy rotten tomatoes?2. highlight the shows i have already watched. nothing more frustrating that clicking on a program to see that i already watched it...or worse i started to watch it and turned it off after a few minutes. (where are your algorithms netflix?)3. stop changing the thumbnails to trick me into clicking a program i have already watched. "oh is this a new bill burr special?" no, netflix just changed the thumbnail and tricked me into clicking on it.4. introduce a "sharing" feature in social media. how many times do i have to ask my friends "seen anything good on netflix?". either "share this on social media or through email".5. start poaching some of the creative talent on youtube and twitter. there are some brilliant minds on those channels. offer them to have their own special on netflix. youtube pays peanuts, this would be a no brainer.6. offer a "suggestion" box for content. let people share some of their creative video work for a chance to get exposed on netflix. 7. have a siskel ebert type channel. a channel each week that reviews new listings.8. take a clue from the discovery channel and offer more survival type content. very low budget to produce and based on the dual survival, naked and afraid, dude you're screwed demand...this is a big niche.9. find a way to embed links into the content. if you're threatening to introduce ads, why not make product placement interactive?10. big idea. offer a category called "politically incorrect". be daring and let people see content that we really want to see. put some bullshit "i accept that the content i am about see my be offensive" so people can shut their piehole about being offended.here is your chance to give people what they really want to see but are too afraid to do it on their own.

did fidelity just validate cryptocurrency investing?





 today fidelity announced they offer crypto in retirement accounts this year. "the largest retirement plan provider in the united states, announced
 plans to offer bitcoin in 401(k) retirement accounts to its account 
holders later this year.  the company is set to allow investors to 
allocate up to 20% of their 401(k) accounts to bitcoin, though employers
 will have the ability to lower that cap" if fidelity is letting investors buy bitcoin, what does that do to cryptocurrency broker services like coinbase?does fidelity become a crypto exchange platform? not only does this bring in a new crop of crypto investors but does it make investing in crypto safer?if your bitcoin is held with fidelity, would you need a crypto wallet?is this the tipping point for crypto to be considered a "valid" investment?

how to treat ulcerative colitis without medication





here is how to treat ulcerative colitis without medication. relax...ulcerative colitis can be treated..so stop worrying! i was right where you are today. you feel hopeless and maybe you're starting to think some dark thoughts. there is hope...and here it is.here are the 3 steps to cure ulcerative colitis.understand what it is and causes it.  determine everything that is threatening your subconscious mind reprogram your subconscious mind (sm)first, you must realize that ulcerative colitis is considered a "condition", which means it can be changed.any condition that ends in an "itis" relates to an inflammatory condition.the medical community adds an "itis" to the end of a common condition to make them sound more severe. if you want to get yourself even more worked up, here is where you can  read the definition of ulcerative colitis. (hint i wouldn't)want to feel better?there are roughly 2-4 million of us that have or had this condition.did you notice i said "had"?...because it can be cured. that number skyrocketed during covid...why?fear...the number of people that got shingles also exploded....fear or anxiety was at an all time high for our society. don't you find it odd that your body can mend a broken bone, heal a deep cut, but that annoying rash won't go away?  the best & fastest ulcerative colitis treatment without medication email for ulcerative colitis helplet me tell you what causes ulcerative colitis (uc).when you were born, you had 2 fears that were automatically programmed in to you. the fear of heights and the fear of loud noises. as you grew up, you learned all of your other fears. (this is the only science part i will offer..i promise)...we all have 2 minds, a conscious mind and a subconscious mind.the conscious mind is what we use to learn things. (5% of brain activity)the subconscious mind is programmed to keep us alive. (95% of your brain activity).as a baby, you came into this world and your sm kicked in your breathing and all of the other neat bodily functions.the first one you were aware of was hunger....to keep you alive.so...your conscious mind learned how to satisfy this need by sucking on a nipple. that was probably the very first thing your conscious mind learned.example: when you first learned how to drive a car, you had to use your conscious mind to really think how to this. the more you drove, the less you had to think....see where this is going?now when you drive, you are actually using your subconscious mind.you know that phrase, "i do it without even thinking about it"...yup that is your subconscious mind in action.here is the nutty part...it is always thinking, even when you're sleeping. when you're born, your subconscious mind (sm) is working 24/7 to look for any threat that could end your life.it controls the functions of your body like breathing, sweating...and yes pooping (we'll get to that in a bit).ever hear that phrase "fight or flight"?that is exactly what the sm is programmed to do..it automatically will prepare the body to fight or flight in certain life threatening situations.now...are you ready to be blown away?when you watch a horror movie and you get scared and flinch...that is your sm at work. you're sitting in your chair knowing full well that axe murderer isn't going to to kill you, but your sm doesnt know that.your sm cannot determine the difference between a real or fake life threatening situation...when your boss calls you in his office, when you have to give a speech, or try to ask a pretty girl for their phone number..what happens?you heart starts beating faster, blood flows from your internal organs to your legs or face. it is getting your body ready to run from this threat or get ready to fight.these are all preprogrammed conditions, which you cannot control. well when we are about to face a "life threatening" situation like an irs audit, we get stressed out and produce cortisol. cortisol is a steroid naturally produced in your body to reduce inflammation. well your body just cranked up the production of it for this event.ok the meeting with your boss is over, the speech is over and the girl tells you to pound sand...what happens next?heart rate goes back down, you stop sweating..life threatening situation is over....the cortisol producing stops or slows way down.what happens when the event never ends? what is happening to you with uc is that your sm thinks your life is under a constant threat and it is trying to save you.the sm takes every threat as life threatening..even though they aren't. (losing your job, getting a divorce etc). here is the problem..instead of your heart racing it is trying to "save you" by getting your attention in another way(s).in your case, it is the uncontrollable urge to go to the bathroom.if it really wants to get your attention, it will make those bowel movements bloody. blood in the toilet will get your attention.that is your sm telling you.."hey, fix this problem!!!" here is how to stop a ulcerative colitis flare up, or keep having them without taking drugs.there is a stressful situation in your life that is never ending...you are causing it...and you can fix it.whether you realize it or not, your sm sees something that feels is life threatening and keeping you in the fight or flight state. your body is constantly fighting this threat and producing cortisol.2. you need to determine what your sm is afraid of. your body is in a constant state of fight or flight mode and you need to address what it is afraid of.if you're saying to yourself..."nothing is bothering me". you're not being truthful.this is really important ok?you need to write down everything that is causing you to be angry or afraid. when you write down your thoughts, you are bringing them out from the sm to the cm. the conscious mind can now see what is really bothering you.don't lie to yourself when doing this..it won't work if you aren't truthful.start with the phrase "i am afraid of", or "i really hate" and just start writing.write down every little thing that is bothering you. you will be amazed at where this takes you. you're trying to get at what your sm is afraid of..anger is another form of fear too.this process should take a an hour or two.as you start writing everything that is bothering you, you're going to immediately start to feel better..i promise you!!i don't want to get all technical with you here, but what you are doing is expressing repressed feelings. it is called cathartic.yes, it is a form of therapy...it is the best therapy for this condition.you are sharing your problems with your best friend, you.what you are also doing is getting them on paper so they are visible. this reduces their control of you. don't be surprised if you start to shed a tear. this process is very emotional. it needs to be.you need to find out what your sm is constantly fearing.  the fastest ulcerative colitis treatment without medicine 3. reprogram you subconscious mind to treat ulcerative colitis.let me stress this is not the same thinking as positive thinking. positive thinking just masks the problem, we want to fix it.that thing that sits on the top of your shoulders is the most powerful computer you will ever own or use.the problem is that you were never given a manual on how to use it.i am going to show you how.you call tech support or the geek squad to make your computer run faster or get rid of viruses. what i do is help people make their subconscious mind run better and get rid of "emotional" viruses. (if you need help, send an email to)get ulcerative colitis helpright now picture your computer with numerous pages open. you can only see the page that is open but your computer is using power and memory to run all of those other pages.that slows down your computer and can sometimes force it to be rebooted.when you write down your problems on paper (or on a digital document), what you are doing is closing each window that is running on your computer.it is freeing up memory...it is also freeing you. trust me. ok...you closed all of the open tabs and your "computer" is running better.now we need to reprogram the subconscious mind.would you believe it is easier than learning how to drive a car?or algebra, the sats...(insert anything you have ever had to study).why is reprogramming your subconscious mind so easy?because you know you. you know what makes you tick.you know what you fear or what angers you.you can learn how to change these. do you want to control your ulcerative colitis?do you want a better life?i promise you that once you learn how to reprogram your mind, you can control your uc....in fact, your entire life will be better.i have helped hundreds of people get control of their uc (and psoriasis, dermatitis, rosacea and many more issues.are you ready for help?

how to hide your browsing from google





 there are a bunch of solutions out there (vpn, tor, duckduckgo etc) that claim they can hide your browsing from google.here is the truth....while they are all good products, they don't hide your browsing from google.google has some type of their script on almost every website. (analytics, ads, maps, youtube, recaptcha etc).so when you visit a site, google can identify you by your computer. it doesn't matter if you used a private search engine, a vpn or a private browser.to see how many google trackers are on a website, visit pagexray.there you can see just how many google trackers are on a site. you can test to see if google is able to track you online with this simple test. try this with your vpn, tor or brave browser.go to google imagesclick the camera icon.  then click upload an image, then click browse. if it opened your computer, that means google is able to see and basically touch your computer on every site they have script on.  in order to hide your browsing from google, the browser cannot run on your device, but in the cloud...a cloud browser or a virtual private browser.google will still be able to track this browsing, but they will tracking a server, and not your computer.so every search, on every search engine,  is private. every site you visit you will be anonymous.when you want to be completely anonymous and virus free on the web, get the only virtual private browser.
