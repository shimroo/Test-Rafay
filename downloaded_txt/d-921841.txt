sequoia-kings canyon
park services company






		 


 

sequoia-kings canyon park services company 
		is pleased to offer our guests lodging from which to explore sequoia and 
		kings canyon national parks.  

we are pleased to 
        offer hotels, lodges, and cabins, 
			dining, and shopping to those visiting sequoia & kings canyon 
			national parks, and the giant sequoia national forest.
 
sequoia national park, america's second 
			national park, was created on september 25, 1890, by president 
			benjamin harrison. one week later, general grant national park was 
			created by congress to protect the grove of giant sequoias, 
			including the general grant tree, the second largest tree in the world. kings canyon national park was created by congress on march 
			4, 1940, and included the tiny general grant national park and much 
			additional land north of sequoia national park. in 1965, cedar grove 
			and tehipite valley were added to kings canyon national park, 
			bringing the park to its current dimensions.  
 

thanks to the work of john muir and other early 
		conservationists, the natural beauty of kings canyon and sequoia 
		national parks has been preserved from the depths of the kings canyon to 
		the summit of mount whitney in sequoia national park.
 
		

we invite you to be our guest while you discover the 
		pristine beauty and majesty of these national parks.
