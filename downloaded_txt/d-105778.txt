lt. joe petrosino, trail-blazing 
		fighter of organized crime
 


 
hero's
          send-off for a fallen nycpd officer
 



 
new york city declared the day lieutenant joe petrosino was buried a holiday,
          so all those who wanted to pay their respects, could.  on april
          12, 1909, over  250,000 people paid their respects to the fallen new
          york city police department officer, who was killed in the line of
          duty, and who had an amazing  25 year career with the nycpd.
 


 
they lined the streets from old st. patrick's cathedral to calvary
          cemetery. they watched the procession of hearse, widow, relations,
          friends, colleagues, police units, fire-fighters, italian-american
          associations, civic groups, school children, and the police band
          playing verdi's requiem.  they stood for  5 and 1/2 hours.
they told reporters covering the event of joe petrosino's heroism
          and of how he'd touched their lives.  they stood together to show
          their disgust for the  organized-crime cowards who had taken joe
          petrosino's life at the age of 48, leaving behind a grieving widow and
          a daughter only a few months old.  
crime
          fighting career - the right stuff of heroes
 
joe petrosino was born part of that 1% of us who has the rare
          combination of a great capacity for human empathy, and a capability of
          using force when necessary, when the other 99% would turn and run for
          their lives.  to put it bluntly, in these rare people, when faced with aggression,
          
          the 'pissed-off' response far out-weighs the 'piss-in-your-pants'
          response.  his rugby-player physique and strength served him
          well.
 

 that rare combination is the
           stuff of heroes.  the tough good-guy is
          the stuff of lore and every action hero story ever told.  but joe
          petrosino was the real thing.  and the people of new york city
          knew it, and they knew how lucky they were to have him on the streets protecting them.joe petrosino
          was not only a  tough cop, he was also a smart cop.  he recognized that
          crime-fighting required more than brute force and reacting to crimes
          committed.  petrosino pioneered techniques that are considered
          standard-operating-procedure today in the fight against organized
          criminal gangs.
          

he set up the  first bomb-squad in the u.s. to study the bombs
              used by the gangs to intimidate their extortion victims.  his
              team learned to traced the components and the bomb makers.

he set up the u.s.'s  first organized-crime-task-force called the
              italian squad (later the italian legion), to study and infiltrate the gangs.  he had
              his team chart the organizations and trace all their connections, illegitimate
              and legitimate.  

he set out their  strategy of disrupting the gangs' systems from
              all sides to make their operations unprofitable, relying on
              intra-agency cooperation, which was very rare in those days. 
              they worked closely with customs and immigration officers, and
              with the treasury department's secret service agents.

he stressed the need to  put away the gang leaders  for any crime
              they could link to them, from murder, to tax evasion, to
              jay-walking, to illegal immigrant status, all in an effort to disrupt the gang's
              growth and to promote in-fighting in the illegal organizations,
              which provided a steady stream of informants.

his group set up a vast network of informants, paid and un-paid. 
			he pioneered  witness protection and intelligence-gathering programs 
			to gain inside information into the crime groups.  

he stressed the need for  infiltration of the organizations 
			to gain first-hand information.  he was famous for having a 
			closet full of disguises, everything from a newly arrived italian 
			immigrant outfit, to a priest, to a hasidic jew.

 
martyr to justice
          and civil society
 

 
on march 12, 1909, joe petrosino was
           lured by an informant to an ambush.  he was shot dead in a square in palermo, sicily.  
petrosino was in sicily on orders from the nyc police chief, to uncover
          information that would allow for the  deportation of hundreds of
          organized crime foot-soldiers from new york city back to italy.  

          he was well on his way to accomplishing his task, which is the
          direct reason he was
          killed, as were, later, several of his colleagues who continued the
          work.  
it was later determined that the nyc police chief, through
          incompetence, put petrosino in danger by sending him on such an
          exposed mission, and compounded that danger by detailing it to the
          press beforehand.
 
a moving tribute
 
far and away the  most moving tribute to joe petrosino is, in my humble
          opinion, the one on the
          officer down memorial page, inc site.  the reflections left
          by other officers and admirers show how one man can make a difference,
          and inspire others, even when his life is cut short by cowards. 
          i found this simple message left by a fellow officer the most
          poignant: 
"rest in peace brother joseph, you are a true hero and will
          never be forgotten."
amen to that.
