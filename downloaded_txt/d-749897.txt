healthy body &
not a pain in the wallet!you'll enjoy yourself so much you won't even realize you're getting exercise! you'll find yourself standing taller and winking at the mirror! and you can be at the studio 2-3 times per week, or more, for one low price!
all you need is you!no partner? no problem! we rotate partners throughout our group classes, so everyone dances with everyone! it's a great social activity and you'll learn so much faster by learning to dance with everyone!  you can also enjoy 1-on-1 private lessons with your instructor!
2 left feet, you say?
that's our specialty!don't worry if you feel awkward or uncoordinated - that's what we're here to help with! or, you've got one of each foot, and you're a seasoned competitor?

no problem, we teach newcomer through advanced open dancers!
whatever your level, we're excited to work with you! think you might be too young or too old?  if you're age 12-112, papermoon is for you! ballroom is exciting, for you and your grandma!
we teach the rhythm/latin dances, such as cha cha, swing and salsa; as well as the smooth/standard dances, such as waltz, tango and foxtrot; and the club dances, such as ny hustle, west coast and argentine tango!

"how do i get started?" great question!  it's easy! simply show up for your first beginner group class, during the first week of any calendar month! you can try your first week for free and, if you like it, stay for the rest of the month for a discounted rate! rather get started 1-on-1 with an instructor, instead of jumping into a group? just give us a call or send us an email and we'll be happy to schedule your first lesson! your instructor will help you feel comfortable and have fun, no matter how coordinated (or not!) you feel; whether you know what dance(s) you want to learn, or need guidance on where to start! we promise that walking through the door the first time will be the hardest part - you'll be amazed at how comfortable and happy you feel as soon as you enter!enjoy these videos of our
