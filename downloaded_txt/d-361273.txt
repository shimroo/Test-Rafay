karaoke in australia
most karaoke gigs are held in pubs and clubs, and often not advertised - unless you happen to be there on the night, chances are you'll never know about their karaoke.  that's why the where2sing.com website is the most visited karaoke website in australia, being the meeting place for both karaoke hosts and singers.
where to find karaoke in australia?
you'll find karaoke gigs listed on where2sing.com for act, nsw, nt, qld, sa, tas, vic & wa.  new south wales has the most venues, followed by queensland and victoria;  south australia, western australia and the australian capital territory have even fewer gigs, tasmania has a sprinkling, and the northern territory is in last place.  but only where2sing.com has the constantly updated national karaoke gig database.
karaoke in sydney, melbourne, brisbane, adelaide, canberra, perth and darwin
karaoke in melbourne, sydney and brisbane can be found almost every night of the week, and karaoke can be found in the other major cities late in the week and at weekends - and most major towns will have karaoke somewhere on a friday and saturday night.  rural towns will often have karaoke at the weekends in the rsl or sporting club, and taxi drivers are another good source of karaoke venue information.  but there's nothing to beat checking through the where2sing.com karaoke gig listings.
why does where2sing.com have the biggest karaoke listings?
since about 2005, the where2sing.com database has been built by phone calls, personal visits, emails and the contributions of australia's hosts, singers and karaoke venues.  the database was designed from the ground up exclusively for listing and tracking karaoke gigs, and is today the most up-to-date source of karaoke gig information.
what's wrong with the gig lists on other websites?
you'll find that the where2sing.com database is often more up-to-date than even karaoke hosts' own websites (except those who have their own gig listings powered by the where2sing.com database).  and the other seemingly major sites such as singing.com.au have simply pirated where2sing.com listings, and are hopelessly wrong as the information changes so quickly.  only the where2sing.com database has the all important 'last confirmed date' that is crucial to knowing whether the gig listing is accurate and current.  essentially, whilst others are simply static lists, where2sing.com is a dynamic database serving up the very latest information.
where do i find karaoke competitions?
where2sing.com has a special karaoke comps page where just the venues running competitions are listed.  in many cases you'll also been able to see the prizes, heats, semi final, and grand final dates.  where2sing.com was, for a couple of years, a sponsor of the australian trials of the 'karaoke world championships', and during the heats had a special page devoted to listing participating venues - now, participating venues are listed in the competitions section with all the other comps that you might enjoy.
i need to find karaoke venues for kids
where2sing.com has an under-18s karaoke gigs list, and any kids competitions are also listed here.
karaoke restaurants, karaoke rooms, karaoke hosts, karaoke suppliers
all these have their own karaoke lists on where2sing.com, plus other pages for karaoke links, karaoke judges, and lists of previous 'karaoke news stories' and 'karaoke gig reviews'.
where can i chat to other karaoke singers and karaoke hosts?
the where2sing.com 'general' karaoke chat forum provide a place where singers get together and discuss all aspects of karaoke.
what else can i find on where2sing.com?
the main page features a different venue each couple of days, including photos and a detailed description of the gig.  also on the main page is a 'favourite top 10 karaoke gigs' list, and each day a couple of short stories from singers about their karaoke experiences.  singers also leave their feedback under gigs in the karaoke gig listings, and the more interesting or entertaining of these are shown on the main page.
