about the rides


   ride leadership is shared by riders. if you have a 
  questions about a ride, please call the leader for that ride. 

  we are an informal group of friendly bicyclists - we do not scout the routes or sweep the rides 
  (look for lost riders)! in order to have a good time (i.e., finish 
  before sunset), you should be able to ride twenty hilly miles in two hours and 
  know how to follow a map and cue sheet, on your own if necessary. 
  for everybody's safety, please be alert when riding in a group. ride a 
  straight line, and look behind you before stopping or passing, especially at 
  the start when everyone is bunched together. 
  on these country roads, be particularly careful 
  turning corners, where sand and gravel can cause you to skid. when 
  cars approach from ahead or behind, alert your fellow riders and pull into 
  single file.             
            ("car up!" 
  and "car back!" are the standard warnings.) 
  whenever possible, when parking on town and county 
  roads, park with all 4 wheels off the road - it's the law. 


recommended equipment 

bicycle helmet 
  multi-speed bicycle in good condition - there can be serious hills on wnbr 
  water (and maybe a little food) 
  spare inner tube, tire irons and a tire pump 
  rain gear, windbreaker or sweater depending on the weather 
  cell phone
