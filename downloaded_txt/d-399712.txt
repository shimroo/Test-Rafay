clients in contract disputes, licensing disputes, securities disputes, trade secret misappropriation actions, unfair competition claims, information security breach liability claims, software ownership disputes, lender liability claims, information technology defect claims, product liability claims, and more. often, business litigation involves disputes over contracts. for an agreement to be deemed a valid, enforceable contract, there must be an offer, acceptance, a bargained-for exchange of promises, and sufficiently definite contract terms that would allow the court to enforce them. business litigation also can require the interpretation and application of intricate federal and state laws that implicate ip, privacy, and unfair competition. for example, a case could involve the copyright act, the lanham act, and privacy statutes, along with state common law. as silicon valley business attorneys who are deeply familiar with information technology, we do not need to spend as much time or money to get up to speed on your case as a firm with less it experience would.corporate & securitiesbusiness formation can have a huge impact on the success of technology companies and
