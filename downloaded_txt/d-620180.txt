link | leave a comment | share | flagtoo early on a sunday to be disappointedoct. 1st, 2006 | 04:53 ambefore i can get on with this...does the word "on" have the privilege to be capitalized in a header? does the word "be"? why don't i know this? if i don't at least know the basic rules of english composition, what do i know? end thought. the disappointment i refer to is something related to the quality of the more expensive kind of frozen vegetable gyoza i sampled upon returning home an hour or so ago. needless to say, the 50-cent cheaper variety is much better, and aren't entirely filled with chives. my contacts are now almost fully clouded over, and i can't see my computer screen. taking them out means that i'm also going to sleep, since taking the lens apparatus from my eye seems to hasten any impulse to nod off. nod off i will, and it'll be a good one, i'm sure.

devon's camera claimed most of the photos from friday's assemblage of the goodfellows. the few i took are posted on my flickr page, but trust me, hers are much better.

link | leave a comment | share | flagreal-life issuesjun. 23rd, 2006 | 04:44 pmi've accomplished nothing this week, and the spirits are low. lest i enter the weekend in such a manner, i'll find my way back to fine by merciless attacks on the aesthetic choices of others (maaco, not to be confused by the auto shop franchise of the same name). i'll conduct this session simply by listing things that i don't like. the justifications for these dislikes are all based on confidence in my superior judgment.1. scrapbooking. i won't go into detail on this because i'll get too heated and won't be able to move on to #2, even though the achievement of such passion and the subsequent boosting of spirits is the intention of the post.2. selective trimming of facial hair. obviously this is directed at men who discriminate between what parts of the face to shave, but i'll leave it open. indeed, there are so many variations on the facial landscape that i've often thought of making a documentary on the relationship between men (here i'll be exclusive) and their beards. let it be known that i approve of clean-shaven, slightly scruffy, and full-growth, but find little to admire in isolated patches of growth such as the goatee, mustache, chin-strap, soul patch....you get the point.3. impractical footwear. this is not merely an aesthetic blunder, but also causes the foot to revolt against the entire body, which faces limited mobility, acute pain, and impatience. comfortable shoes are not always the most attractive, but uncomfortable shoes most certainly transform the wearer into a damn fool, which is always unforgivably unattractive.the hour forces me to close here, but i feel better already. until next time,marcie
