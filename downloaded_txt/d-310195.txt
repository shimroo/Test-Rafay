always on time and courteous and knowledgeable. the schedulers help you above and beyond. we use them every time we fly to get us to omaha or silverhawk! airports on time for our flights and wheelchair de vice as needed.  try omalnk - it is so much easier to sit back and let omalnk drive you there!some of the other comments that are negative must be from old owners as i really have never had those problems they talk of.thank you omalink for getting me to airport and home safely!- pam and evelyn

omalink is a great service. my driver met me at the omaha airport, waiting for me with a sign, even though my plane was a half hour  early. my reurn flight was at 6am, and the driver was right on time at 4am to pick me up in lincoln for the ride back to omaha. very reliable  and very courteous drivers. excellent service.- nadine f.

i had the pleasure of riding the shuttle m-f, twice a day for training from omaha to lincoln for about 6 weeks. obviously, i spent quite a bit of time in the shuttle and got to know most of the drivers pretty well. they take their jobs very seriously and care about their customers genuinely. they want to do their best to limit wait times at airports and get people where they need to go, sometimes having to juggle around multiple schedules due to flight delays and last minute pick ups. (you do learn alot riding for 2 hours a day).each and every driver (with the exception of one), was extremely friendly, prompt, and had safety as their number one priority.i was initially dreading having to be shuttled every day for so long. now i can say that i am gonna miss my morning chats with tom, and my afternoon rides with jack and al.thanks for making my trips bearable and putting up with my chattiness! i will definitely be using you if i need a ride in the future.- christina e.
