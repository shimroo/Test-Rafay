welcome to the church of scientology of new york.
originally established in 1955 as one of the first churches of scientology in the world, we are honored to serve the city where the global
dianetics and scientology movement began. for it was here, in 1950, that dianetics: the modern science of mental health— authored by founder l. ron hubbard in nearby bay head,
new jersey—rolled off a manhattan press to take the world by storm.

who are scientologists? meet nina, a new york city guide.“living in new york city, being busy, traveling, i was not good at managing my time. no matter how early i got up in the morning, the last 10 minutes was always a bit of a panic. it was always like ‘don’t talk to me, i’m trying to get out the door.’ and i didn’t want to be like that,” says nina. “and taking the course effective time management i became more productive. i got more things done. it really changed my life.”

who are scientologists? meet mike, a logo designer from the usa.“you asked me what it was like to be a scientologist, well, what is it like to be free?” says mike. “the stuff you learn, it’s all about life and what makes it tick and just how this affects that and all that. it’s very satisfying.”








                                                    
                            talia—attorney
                        
                        

who are scientologists? meet talia, an attorney from the usa.“my life before scientology was like going to the best restaurants and being at openings here and there and buying gorgeous dresses. it was very materialistic and superficial,” says talia. “i have to say that scientology helped me find more of a purpose in my life. i have learned things that help me help other people.”








                                                    
                            sandra—personal assistant
                        
                        

who are scientologists? meet sandra, a personal assistant.
“i’m a scientologist because i found that it works for me,” says sandra. “it makes me happy. i can actually take the things that i learned from it and apply it into my life. the things that are important to me are my integrity, my moral code. i run my own life.”

who are scientologists? meet jeff, an aerial advertising specialist from the united states.“i’ve always wanted to be a pilot,” says jeff. “when i first started flying, there’s a lot of guys who could fly the plane, great. but you had to take a written test and they couldn’t pass that written test. and because of the scientology study technology, i was able to get a lot more out of the materials and pass that written test.”








                                                    
                            jessica—graphic designer
                        
                        

who are scientologists? meet jessica, a graphic designer from the united states.“i’ve always been very creative throughout my life. but there’ve been moments where i haven’t been so into it, just my interest level had dropped. and through scientology, i’ve really been able to rekindle my passion for art and design and just being creative, and i couldn’t be happier.”














                what is scientology?

            

scientology is a religion in its highest meaning, as it helps bring man to total freedom and truth. the essential tenets of scientology are these:

you are an immortal spiritual being.
your experience extends well beyond a single lifetime. and your capabilities are unlimited, even if not presently realized.
furthermore, man is basically good. he is seeking to survive. and his survival depends upon himself and his fellows and his attainment of brotherhood with the universe.

dianetics: the modern science of mental health
by l. ron hubbard
indisputably the most widely read and influential book ever written about the human mind, dianetics fully describes the reactive mind, the previously unknown source of nightmares, unreasonable fears, upsets and insecurities, and how to get rid of it.
