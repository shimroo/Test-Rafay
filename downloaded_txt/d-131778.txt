welcome to the barony of southron gaard, wherein you may step back in time to the world before 1600. join us and dance at a tudor court, draw a mongol bow, cheer a chivalrous german knight, relax in heian hakama, listen to a norse saga, swap war stories with a persian man-at-arms, or cook a feast from the mughal empire.
southron gaard is based in the south island of new zealand (principally in christchurch, dunedin, timaru, nelson, and invercargill) and is a branch of the international non-profit educational organisation, the society for creative anachronism, new zealand (scanz).
the sca is dedicated to the research and recreation of pre-17th century life and cultures, with a particular focus on its practical applications in arts and sciences, including costuming, cooking, martial arts, dance, calligraphy and illumination, metalwork, archery, music and so much more.
our organisation’s initial focus was on western europe’s middle ages and renaissance. while that remains a strong influence, over the past 50 years we’ve broadened our scope to explore the many and varied pre-1600 cultures from around the world. come join us and see history with new eyes.
