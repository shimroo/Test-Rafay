fell pony stud book - grassroots online registry 
this service, which gives access animal details, member details,
          pedigrees and progeny lists, is free to fell pony society members and
          has been available since spring 2009. 
log in via the grassroots link below, using your fps membership
          access number (it is printed on your magazine envelope address label;
          it is not your annual membership receipt number) plus your password. 
grassroots online registry
grassroots has been updated (25 may 2022) and members now allocate
          their own password. 
new fps members will receive a link via email to set a password
          when they join the society. 

 if for some reason as a current member you no longer have your log
          in details, then you need to go to the grassroots log in screen and
          click to reset password. you will be sent an email containing a
          link, using the email address that we have for you. you use the link
          in that email to reset your password.


 membership renewals for 2025
 thank you to all members who have renewed your membership. however, we have received several payments at the old rate.
to save us time in having to contact you individually, please can you check and if you have paid the old rate, send the extra payment as soon as possible, then we can issue your new membership card. the 2025 rates can be checked on the membership page and on p12 of the autumn 2024 magazine.
priority will be given to those who have paid correctly. members are only eligible to vote for council if their subscription has been paid *in full* by 15 february, and we cannot guarantee you will receive a reminder by this date and therefore you will miss out on the opportunity to vote. thank you for your attention to this matter. 
happy new year!

payments to the society
payments to the society can be made by post, bacs or bank transfer.
        cheques or postal orders should be made payable to "the fell pony
        society".  bacs details can be found here. members
        can also find these details in the fees and charges section of the fps
        magazine. updated october 2024 

overseas payments
all bank transfers should be in english pounds sterling and any charges
        should be paid in the country of origin. our bank makes a charge for the
        receipt of an electronic transfer  from overseas   so if
        you are not in the uk, please add £2 for transactions up to £100 and £7
        for transactions greater than £100 (if sending payment from within the
        uk there is no need to add anything). 
the society does not have the facility to take card payments.
if you wish to pay your membership by standing order, please request a
        mandate to set the payment up with your bank, because the society cannot
        do it on your behalf.

new functions in grassroots online registry
one of the benefits of joining the fell pony society is access to the
        grassroots online registry which gives members access to the society's
        pedigree database. members can use the database to research pedigrees,
        find offspring or see ponies marked as for sale or available for ai. 
        a new breed analysis feature is now available on grassroots, called
        check mate. 
        check mate allows members to select any male from the database and any
        of their own females or those flagged as for sale. it creates a simple
        four generation "what if" pedigree with any common ancestors highlighted
        in colour.
details of how to use the function are linked on the health page.
