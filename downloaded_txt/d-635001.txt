is it time to paint your garage door this month 2021?
                    
most quality steel doors come with a baked on polyester enamel coating.
                to finish the door, the following procedures are recommended. to improve the adhesion
                of the paint, lightly sand the door’s surface with a fine steel wool to reduce gloss
                (steel wool only). do not expose bare metal. any exposed bare metal be coated with
                a primer specifically intended for galvanized metal. clean your door with a phosphate
                free laundry detergent. rinse the door thoroughly with clean water and let dry completely
                before painting. solvents are not recommended for cleaning. do not paint in direct
                sunlight ~or~ if the door surface is warm to the touch. dark colors are not recommended
                where the door is exposed to direct sunlight for extended periods, such as a southern
                to western exposure. dark colors absorb and retain the heat. a top coating of a
                high quality rust-oleum brand paint is recommended for the door. at this point,
                care must be exercised not to paint joint and edge seals, in that, surfaces painted
                and pressed against the seal will adhere and cause seal damage. also, to ensure
                the finish paint is compatible, always paint sample area to test adhesion. finally,
                check your paint manufacturer’s instructions carefully for any additional recommendations
          and future maintenance requirements.
