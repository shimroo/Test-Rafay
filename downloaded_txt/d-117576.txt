the "chinese, japanese,  vietnamese, and mongolian language site"  (aka cjvlang.com) is an armchair excursion into four fascinating languages
          of the orient. cjv stands for chinese / japanese / vietnamese, the original focus of the site, but mongolian has been added as one of the main areas of interest. (note: "cjv" is also the iso code for the choave language of papua new guinea.)
what you will find on this site:
projects
1. days
          of the week in chinese, japanese,  vietnamese and mongolian - why should three
          east asian languages that are often so similar in vocabulary be so different
          in naming the days of the week? and how is mongolian related to the rest? at first it all seems rather easy,
          but the more you look, the more fascinating it becomes.
2. allusions
          to classical chinese poetry in pink floyd - a surprising link between
          one of the rock icons of the 20th century and the poetry of an ancient
          civilisation.
3. harry
          potter in chinese, japanese, vietnamese, and mongolian - an international
          best seller translated into the three cjv languages plus mongolian. names of characters, chapter titles, lexical comparisons
          (comparisons of vocabulary), word play, etc. (links to chinese-language
          site map (simplified); chinese-language
          site map (traditional), japanese
          language site map.)
4. le petit prince (å°çå­, æã®çå­æ§, hoã ng tá»­ bã©) -- 'the little prince' in chinese, japanese,  vietnamese, and mongolian. there are far more translations of this book than harry potter! 
5. cjv
          writing systems - a description of the chinese, japanese, vietnamese, and mongolian writing systems which
          attempts to cover what i consider the essence -- less about the exotic
          forms of the characters and more about how they are used to write
          the language.
quasi-blogs
6. spicks & specks - miscellaneous
          items that don't belong anywhere else: 'year of the sheep or year of
          the goat?', 'weapons of mass destruction', a sign encouraging people
          to flush the toilet, translation of the chinese word fengqing,
          'mind the gap' in japanese and cantonese, the perils of translating
          via a third language (in this case, chinese), the naming of the bell miner, vinegar museums around the world, and much else.        
7. different waters - miscellaneous
          articles not written in english. all corrections welcome! 
other
8. pictorial - pictures
          of  the goomeri pumpkin festival in australia, stone lions...        
9. a collection of mongolian-language texts in both traditional and cyrillic scripts.
10. listening to mongolian: a section of audio clips from a popular sitcom allowing you to listen to actual spoken mongolian and compare it with the written word.

i've done a certain amount of background
          research for this site, mainly to prevent gross errors of fact. however,
          my information is neither exhaustive nor authoritative. much is from
          dictionaries. i would be delighted to receive corrections or further
          information.
