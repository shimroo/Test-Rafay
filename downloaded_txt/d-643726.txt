our mission is  to encourage & equip women who minister to women.
we are a group of diverse women united as one from many churches and ministries who learn from and inspire others to excellence in leadership and ministry.  whether you serve in a church, a non-profit or community ministry or lead a small group in your neighborhood, lift is here to support and equip you!  we find strength in our connection with like-minded women and we are lifted up when we support one another.
