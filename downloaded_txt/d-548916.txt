darren doran 5 stars! 
 my wife and i spent the weekend here and had a great time! quiet and relaxing time, mostly snowbirds but they were extremely nice, cant say that enough. the owner deb was very helpful, she left us on the honor system, just do it and pay when your done. what a nice pool, so warm.  






toni sanchez 5 stars!

 lake in the forest is my own little slice of heaven. debbie, oma and staff are top notch. grounds are kept in great shape. activities abound or just chill and have a beer next to the fire. every trip so far has been awesome. thank you debbie and i hope to enjoy more visits for years to come.   






nancy hintz 5 stars! 
 we have never looked forward to winter until this year. after spending two weeks at lake in the forest last year, we have decided to make this our winter home! the grounds are so nice and peaceful with sammy the llama keeping guard. the staff and residents were friendly and welcoming.  






debbie hilliard 5 stars! 
 we love coming to lake in the forest. we camp there whenever we can. debbie and omi are both wonderful people. and so is the rest of the staff. the pool is excellent and the trails give you great exercise for walking. and you can get wood there for fire pit.
