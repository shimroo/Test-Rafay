bay area divers scuba club 
					location is in the south houston / clear lake / galveston 
					texas area. 


bad strives 
					to provide opportunities to dive locally in order to improve 
					skills and  

offers affordable scuba dive 
					trips abroad.  our local dives gives new 
					divers the chance to practice
 and to dive with seasoned 
					veterans. it provides experienced 
					divers a reason to get wet (and we never get enough of 
					that!) 

if you are a visitor to 
					our site and are in the houston area, please come to our 
					dive club monthly meeting. 

the general public is
