podcast | arun sok nhep | how do you survive a genocide and learn to forgive?
watch or listen to arun sok nhep, who serves united bible societies as head of member relations and translation roadmap coordinator for asia-pacific being interviewed by seasoned journalist lorna dueck. in this episode, arun shares his stories about growing up in cambodia and surviving the khmer rouge genocide. while fleeing the country and finding himself in prison, he encountered another prisoner who gave him a bible. this turning point in his life enabled him to encounter the love and forgiveness of god and directed him along a path that resulted in finishing the translation of the bible for the people of cambodia years later.
