public art is often created in response to the place and community in which it resides. it interprets the history of the location, its people, and perhaps addresses a social or environmental issue. it can take a wide range of forms, sizes, and scales - and can be temporary or permanent. public art can include murals, sculpture, memorials, integrated architectural or landscape work.
