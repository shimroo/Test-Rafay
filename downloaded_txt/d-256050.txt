‚Äúin 2014, a friend and i visited for porcfest. after a few intense days spent camped out in the valley, i looked out at the white mountains and wept ‚Äì overwhelmed with feelings of hope.‚Äùpatrick, mover from california















‚Äúi came here wanting to find reasons to stay put. but my negativity was totally disarmed with the warm welcome we got. we met awesome free staters at a meetup they specifically created for us, ate amazing seafood, and met the budweiser horses in nashua!‚Äùtiffany, mover from michigan
