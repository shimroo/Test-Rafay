alligators on river bank
by john white



 
 
a tribute to the
		
		endangered wildlife of florida;
those with leaves and those with 
		legs,
so goes the ecosystem, so goes 
		humanity.
 
there are over 
		100 endangered or threatened species
      in florida,
however, this web site will only 
		focus on the following: 
the critically endangered
		panther,
the tiny
			 key deer, the shy
			black 
			bear,
the outrageous and noisy
			scrub 
			jay,
the magnificent
               sandhill cranes,
the graceful
			
			turtles and owls,
the cunning
			alligators and
			 crocodiles,
the gentle, graceful
		manatee,
the rare, beautiful,
         okeechobee gourd
or indian pumpkin,
and finally, the most endangered
and threatened of all florida 
		species, 
her

      indigenous or first people.
