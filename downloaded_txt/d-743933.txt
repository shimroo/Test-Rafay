couldn’t have asked for a better place to take our beloved bulldog stamford, what’s was wonderful is that we were able to drop him off ourselves to lincolnshire pet cremation and pick him back up a few days later.
we didn’t need to leave him at the vets pending pick up, we were able to take him on our final journey ourselves.
the staff are wonderful and treated him with complete dignity and us. the beautiful chapel of rest is a great touch for grieving families to say their final goodbye thank you so much the richardson‘s.

good evening, 
i just wanted to thank you wholeheartedly for the beautiful box i picked up from holmer vets for my huskamute luna today - her casket is absolutely stunning and her paw print (hair and all because it was always everywhere) was just so perfectly done. thank you so much for making a horrific week so much more beautiful and for memories to last forever.

our gorgeous dog tootsie passed away on the 4th july and pcs cremation services dealt with her cremation with dignity and kindness. her ashes came back to us in a beautiful casket, with messages of kindness and we would highly recommend them for anyone going through this very sad journey.
