free proxy minds



if you are concern about your privacy using only one proxy server then is proxy chaining probably more attractive method. proxy chain stand for using several proxy servers in chain before you reach your final destination. more proxy server in chain and it will be harder to trace you back but your connection speed will be slower too. another drawback is that if one proxy server during chaining process become unavailable then is chaining not possible.

proxy server

                  a proxy server is a server that retrieves web pages for you,
                   providing only its own identity to the sites it visits. 




 
     
  requesting data comes first to the proxy, 
                   and through the requested proxy, the data is transmitted to you.
                
                  usually, proxy server are used to increase the effective 
                  network speed of your connection to the internet 
                  because they save 
                  informations and files that are requested by many many users in a special 
                  database what is called "cache".







                  when you retrieve pages behind proxy, then proxy server first look into "cache" 
                  and if the same information is found you will gets directly because of previsly storing
                  in "cache".

                  the owners of the internet resource force some limitation on 
                  users from certain countries, cities, geographic regions or even
