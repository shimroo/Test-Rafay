march announcement. . .






hello friends!  while we are very close to launching our new website, it seems that march has arrived and we still aren't ready.  i hope to have an update soon on our new launch date.



in the meantime, our current site is still stocked and be sure to check out our new home for crafting on etsy - jbs mercantile craft.  we are adding new items every week and will continue to do so.



please note that we have discontinued the magpie box.  thank you to our loyal subscribers who have been following along with us through each transition!  if you love the idea of getting a coordinated kit of vintage crafting goods, be sure to favorite us on etsy as we will be adding kits from time to time there.



thanks to everyone for their patience!

announcing jbsmercantilecraft on etsy!!












jbs
 mercantile has evolved in many ways over the past several years.  it 
seems as we have hit the road on the show trail and jumped deeper into 
the antique and home decor industry, the need to re-imagine our website 
and brand has become clearer.  but in the process of doing this, we 
hesitated to totally abandon our love for all things vintage-craft, and 
more importantly, our dear friends (that's you!) who have faithfully 
followed us for the 10+ years we've been in the craft industry.  and 
that's where etsy comes in!




welcome to jbs mercantile craft -
 our new home for all things vintage and vintage-style crafting on 
etsy.  here you will find many of your favorite flea market items from 
our current site with many new-to-you items thrown in.  be sure to add 
us to your favorites and check in weekly for new additions.


until we launch our new website later this month, www.jbsmercantile.com is still live and stocked with hundreds of antique and vintage items, many of which are one-of-a-kind and will only be available on this site. stay tuned later this month for a complete undate on the new site and all of the exciting changes we have in store.
