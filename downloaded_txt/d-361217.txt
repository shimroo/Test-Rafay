cartoon by kyle bravo




when was the last time your newspaper made you laugh?


at funny times, we think goofing off is serious business. for nearly 40 years, we’ve been the nation’s leading cartoon and humor newspaper, both in print and online. we’re 100% independent, ad-free, and lovingly edited by real humans like you. life’s too short to be bummed out! in this dumpster fire of a media landscape, funny times is a beacon of good vibes, biting satire, and uplifting laughter.


while you’re here, we hope you subscribe, shop for swag, or join our free cartoon newsletter. if you get lost, let our customer service faq guide the way.




many magazines are informative, insightful, even important, but only one is absolutely essential to understanding the human condition in this postmodern era.  that magazine is, of course, funny times.

new year’s day always brings an unparalleled opportunity to start fresh and turn your life around. especially if you feel, as i do, that your life has recently gotten turned upside down and backwards, this might be a great time to quit moping and hiding in bed with a dog-eared copy of project 2025 and make some mood-changing new year’s resolutions. here are mine:
