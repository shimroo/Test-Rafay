new in february 2025
finishing off
often poets will be told that their 
				poem is good but needs tightening-up. this course, put together 
				at the request of students, looks at what this means and some of 
				the techniques that can be used to get the best result and let 
				the poem come to life for the reader.  the course is over 
				three weeks at a cost of â£30.

new in march 2025
60  viewpoint and tense
choices made by the poet will impact 
				the way the poem is presented and how engaging and accessible it 
				is to the reader.  this course will look at the issues of 
				viewpoint and tense and in doing so consider authenticity and 
				what the poem is doing and how it can do it best.  the 
				course is over three weeks at a cost of â£30
