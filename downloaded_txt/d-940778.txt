ca to wa team info page






help unlock
free daily club gift on the tripeaks web page. 
create a shortcut on your phone or tablet and remember to go there first
everyday before you sign on.  you will be
helping the team and you also get a free gift. 
if you click on your free gift daily, after a week you will get a free
gold chest!  please take advantage of any
freebies the game is offering!  help yourself
and the team. how to play the gem (digging) game
first of
all, if you sign up and qualify you must dig or risk getting dropped from the
team.
playing the gem
card games: 
when you
qualify it is recommended you try your best to win the qualifying game and get
all 3 shovels = 3 digs.
how to get
all three shovels or 3 digs:  this will
come as you learn, but most important is winning the game which gives
you 1 shovel (1 dig).  you may need to
use boosters to win!  
next, winning
the game within the time frame also gives you 1 shovel (1 dig). some games
allow you to buy more time, but not always.
thirdly, getting
double red stars also gives you 1 shovel (1 dig).  in order to get this you will need use a red
star doubler booster.
if you win
all the above and qualify, wait and watch for the game to begin.  one way to tell is when you see chat activity
on the chat board.  then you can jump in!
 
the goal is
to find gold bars by digging in tandem with your teammates.  you are not going to find gold by digging a
bunch of single holes. this actually hurts the team. so dig where you see someone else has
dug.  you will see the started hole. deeper holes yield more gold but take many
digs by alternating players to strike gold. it is courteous to post on chat
what hole/holes you just dug before you begin your next game. that way someone
waiting to dig will be alerted.
until you
know what you are doing it is best not to start new holes. leave that to more experienced players. you
can ask on chat if anyone can help dig. also you can post a time when you are
free to dig. when you are new it’s also
best to dig the first day rather than to wait and possibly forget. you can always ask questions on chat.

 
tips for experienced diggers:  
first,
before the game, check to see if there is an extended time clock.   if so
you know you can take it a bit slower and buy extra time if you need it.
next check
to see if there is a red star doubler. 
if you want this extra shovel, this is the way to go.
did you know
that the totem popup can really help!! make a mental note of what the card and
suit are for the totem.  in order to get
the red star doubler dig, once the booster is employed you have 3 sets of 3 sequential
digs to secure the win.   so let’s say you have king, queen, but no jack.  but the totem has a queen spot, use this to
help you get the first of the three needed runs.  you will see the progress bar. now learn to
use this to your advantage.  you can use
it twice by once using the suit and next time using the face card of the totem.  
this
strategy is extremely helpful if you get a game with no star doubler
available.  in this case it will take 3
sets of 6 runs to win.  use a wild
card if you must to get that 6th in each section of the run.  

if you want
to use a bomb diffuser, that will also add one card per bomb to the run count.

more to
come! 
 for co-leaders: 

how to recruit new players:
one easy way
is to click on a player on your red star leader board.  click on their name close to the left of the
board.  (if you get “add a friend” pop-up,
try again further left. use the “invite to club” button.  or you can also click on “view” team
button.  and surf around their team.  look for high scores and high tribute
counts.  don’t waste your time on inviting
leaders or co-leaders, they usually won’t leave.  
you can use
this same method on your friends list, if you have older friends on there from
other teams.  
(another tip
is do not accept friends from unknown gold or higher clubs, they want to raid
our club. and delete friends from old gold or higher clubs for the same reason.
) 
finally you
can find players by going to our club list, were you see our players names, and
click on the tab at the top “discover”.  scroll down to any club that is below a gold
league and click on it and surf for members with high score and high tribute
counts.  obviously this works better
towards thursday when counts are high.

saying goodbye - elizabeth taylor





indeed it is a sad day for me. how odd to think that someone i never met could feel like family, and the loss there of to feel so deep.  i always fancied running in to her some day in la, not sure when or where i thought this was going to happen.  yet i vividly created the scene in my mind.  i would say, "oh liz i am such a big fan and have been though the years.  we share the same birthday, you know.  and wherever someone wishes me happy birthday, i always say ... and  liz taylor too".  and she would smile and say, "well aren't you sweet" and give me a hug and say, "happy birthday to you too".  aside from our birthday, i always felt a deep connection to her, again i can't say why.  maybe it was just a deep admiration.  yes i am a fan, but i haven't seen all her movies, nor do i know all her husbands, but i do know her.   i know her passion, i know her humor, i know her love of animals and i know her compassion towards people. i deeply admire that she stood up to hollywood, spoke out on issues that were close to her heart.  i will truly miss her, and will remember her always.
