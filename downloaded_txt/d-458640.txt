through our mission, we work "to find and care for the abandoned poor and to be family with those who have  none."bethesda project is a nonprofit organization that provides shelter, housing, and supportive services across 11 locations to adults experiencing homelessness in philadelphia. here, our guests and residents experience a safe environment — and most importantly — a home where they can stabilize, regain their dignity and self-worth, and find community.

  at bethesda project, we meet people where they are. 










































bethesda project operates a continuum of care throughout center city philadelphia utilizing a housing first approach that minimizes barriers to access and allows each individual to take their journey of healing at one's own pace. we also provide guests and residents with individualized case management which helps guests and residents become more stably housed and increase their overall independence.
