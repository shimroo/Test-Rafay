the last showgirl***





the last showgirl is a slight film at just shy of 90 minutes and slighter still in plot and characterisation.  the pull is that pamela anderson gives a lovely performance as an ageing vegas showgirl called shelly whose long-running and old-fashioned revue is being shut down.  this prompts her to attempt to connect with her estranged daughter hannah (billie lourd).  hannah is resentful that shelly put her "nudie show" ahead of being a good mother, but shelly rightly points out that she was doing the best with what she had. it's an exchange that drips with sincerity from anderson's shelly but lourd is just not giving anything as her scene partner.  perhaps unsurprisingly, in a script that never surprises, shelly is more of a mother to her "found family" - two younger dancers played beautifully by kiernan shipka and brenda song. all three have to some extent bought into shelly's myth of following one's passion and being a dancer, but in a brief and heartbreaking scene, shipka's character hints at what happens when you take on an unconventional job to your family's disapproval. we feel that the younger girls may have a future, but what of shelly? she shouts to an uncaring but honest producer (jason schwartzman) that she's 57 and beautiful but we know her career is basically done.  is her delusion dancing on stage any better or worse than that of her best friend who waitresses and gambles and is now homeless? jamie lee curtis was nominated for a bafta for her role, and it's vulnerable and bold, but as with so much of this film never really moved beyond the obvious.  i just wanted more depth from kate gersten's script and more from the lo-fi direction from gia coppola.the last showgirl is rated r and has a running time of 88 minutes. it played toronto 2024 and was released in the usa in december 24.  it will be released in the uk on february 28th 2025.

sly lives! aka the burden of black genius*****





questlove returns to our screens with another banging music doc, and the second this month, with his investigation of the genius that is sly stone.  we begin in the 60s in the bay area where this gangly multi-talented multi-instrumentalist is dj'ing across genre-lines. pretty soon sly forms a band that will cross colour and gender-lines and make some of the most iconic funk tracks of the late 60s and early 70s. these are tracks that suffused by childhood on my parents' vinyl and then dominated the airwaves when sampled by the artists who decorated our walls and filled our bedrooms in the 80s - from prince to public enemy.musical talent from andre 3000 to chaka khan to nile rodgers to jimmy jam and terry lewis are on hand to tell us just why sly and the family stone's tracks were so gripping and so continuously influential. they are interspersed with archive footage of the band rehearsing and playing, and contemporaneous interviews with sly. we see a man who is evidently a musical genius and demanding of his collaborators.   a man whose progressive message and musical style were overtaken when the 70s turned bad.  and a man who ultimately wasted his talent on decades of drug abuse.  he could have become an influential producer himself - like nile rodgers. questlove's message is ultimately hopeful. sly lives! through every artist influenced by him today.  but i wasn't convinced by his thesis that there is something uniquely difficult and burdensome about black genius. the film argues that black artists are disposable commodities for a cruel entertainment industry and still predominantly white audience.  but having just watched heartbreaking documentaries about boyzone and robbie williams (and i am not claiming equivalence of genius), i think the perils and pitfalls and exploitation are endemic in the industry no matter the colour of the artist.sly lives! aka the burden of black genius has a running time of 112 minutes. it was released on hulu earlier this week.

bridget jones: mad about the boy****





first the irritating stuff.  why oh why must london-set dramadies always be set among the 1 percent? because let's be clear, most newly widowed mothers don't go back to work for a rebrand. they go back to work because they are financially insecure.  most of them don't live in lavish picture-perfect hampstead houses and have two kids in private school.  most can't afford a full-time nanny. and most can't just waltz back into the same job they had a decade prior.second irritating point.  renee zellwegger.  the whole awkward tampon up the arse walk. the gurning.  the ditziness that is impervious to ageing and wisdom. the fact that she seems to have an endless stream of handsome men declare their underlying love for her.okay so that's two pretty major problems with this film.  but i still enjoyed it!  why? because author and screenwriter helen fielding has something moving and hopeful to say about grieving a loved one and about emotional growth.  we see bridget as a widow navigate grief with her two small children, have a passionate summer fling with a hot younger man (the white lotus' leo woodall) and then form a more mature attachment with her son's teacher (chiwetel ejiofor).  i believed in her grief, her joy, her contentment. because renee zellwegger is actually a good actress when given something meaningful to do.  and what of the emotional growth? well that's all on the part of hugh grant's delicious rake daniel, who comes to the realisation that he ought to forge a relationship with his teenage son. he has all the best lines and provides all of the film's comedy. oh, except for a really superb cameo from isla fisher. renee's prat falling does not count. (shirley henderson and the other best mates are all sadly underused.)bridget jones: mad about the boy has a running time of 124 minutes and is rated r. it is in cinemas in the uk and on peacock in the usa.

all we imagine as light*****





i am very late to watching all we imagine as light but i can confirm that all of the good things you heard are true.  payal kapadia's second feature is a beautifully observed, delicate, emotionally impactful story of three women who comfort and support each other in contemporary mumbai.  they embody durkheim's industrial ennui, unnoticed and under appreciated cogs in a brutal wheel of commerce and onward development.  this shows on their faces, darker-skinned than bollywood heroines. in a funny and cathartic scenes they deface a billboard showing a shining vision of india's middle class dream - light-skinned and affluent.  despite being professional women, this comfortable picture of a conventional family unit is something denied to them. especially to chhaya kadam's party who is desperate to save her home from developers when she has basically no property rights. but it is kani kusruti who anchors the film with her role as prabha, an earnest small-town girl desperately lonely in arranged marriage with absentee husband.  prabha's narrative arc will see her work through those frustrations and emotions with a touch of magic realism. it's no surprise that this happens when she is away from the city and grounded in village life.prabha is shocked at her friend anu (divua prabha) an affair, but anu's sex positivity is a breathe of fresh air in contrast with prabha, as well as her ability not to over-complicate having an affair across religious lines in modi's india. it's also a breath of fresh air to see a woman being pleasured in any kind of cinema let alone indian cinema.all we imagine as light has a running time of 118 minutes. it played cannes, toronto, telluride and london 2024. it is available to stream.

september 5*****





september 5 is a stunning film depicting the horrific and murderous attack on israeli athletes at the 1972 munich olympics by the palestinian terrorist group black september. where kevin macdonald's superb and comprehensive documentary one day in september gives us all the angles and the whole story, this new film tells the story from the perspective of the abc sports journalists who were in the olympic village.  as it happened, this was the first olympics that took advantage of satellite broadcasting to bring live coverage to the world.  as a result, this was the first terrorist attack broadcast live to the world - well before mumbai or 9-11.  and it created both iconic images which are used as live in this film - but also deep moral questions about how far live coverage enables and recruits for terrorists.as the film opens we are in the dark, claustrophobic abc sports-room recreated by director tim fehlbaum in precise detail.  the journalists hear shots fired and suddenly realise they are in the midst of an attack.  they have to figure out how to wheel heavy camera equipment out to the village to shoot footage of the apartments where the olympians are being held.  and they have to wrestle satellite slots to broadcast what they have.  in a powerful and pivotal performance, leonie benesch (the white ribbon) plays a young german journalist who has to become an impromptu translator, listening in to police radio and local news reports.  meanwhile, the always brilliant peter sarsgaard plays the sports-journo boss who has to wrestle with his home news team who argue that mere sports reporters are out of their depth, and retain control of "his" story.  there are two iconic and notorious moments. the first is when the journalists realise that the terrorists are actually watching their footage, and can see german cops attempting a rescue operation, because no-one switched off the tv feed to the apartment block. it's then that we get that iconic image of the hooded terrorist looking out of the apartment window and straight down the barrel of the tv camera.  the second iconic and notorious moment is when an abc journalist (played brilliantly here by john magaro) chooses to relay an unconfirmed report that all the sportsmen have been released alive and well. he wants the scoop. simple as. kudos to fehlbaum, his production team and in particular his editor hansjoerg weissbrich, for creating a film of such taut, spare, suspense and high stakes.  the look and feel of it take you right into 1972 and into the fast-paced need for judgment.  it gives you sympathy for real people making tough choices in uncharted territory. most of all, i loved the way in which the real footage of on-air broadcasts was seamlessly woven into the fictional recreation. so you can see magaro's character speaking apparently to an on-air presenter and that presenter relaying the information he has been given. it's a masterclass of editorial brilliance.september 5 is rated r and has a running time of 95 minutes. it played venice, toronto and telluride 2024. it was released in the usa on january 17th and in the uk on february 6th.

the order****





i bloody love the films that justin kurzel makes.  they focus on disturbed and disturbing people committing or manipulating people to murder.  they feature spare stark scripts and searing brutal performances. and long-time collaborator and dp adam arkapaw often sets the moral corruption of man against a backdrop of stunning landscapes.  snowtown, macbeth and most recently nitram gave us character portraits of tortured evil.  kurzel's latest film, the order, casts that character study within a police procedural.we are in early 80s small-town mid-western america and this film is based on a real-life story.  the feds are on the trail of a young charismatic neo-nazi who is orchestrating a series of bank robberies to fund his war on america.  his foundational text is the same one that inspired the jan 6 insurrection.  nicholas hoult is the cult-leader bob mathews - handsome and convincing.  mathews is sinister in how low-key he is but also how swiftly he can whip up a mob.  jude law continues to give career-best performances in his middle-career - following his turn as a truly sinister henry viii in firebrand - with this self-effacing performance as a decent but scarred and often ill-judged fed called terry husk.screenwriter zach baylin (creed iii) crafts a spare and slowly-ratcheting anxiety-inducing script.  the pivotal relationship is between husk and mathews who contain enough humanity to somehow not be able to take that pre-emptive shot. but i also loved the scenes between hoult's mathews an his father, a david duke type figure played convincingly by victor slezak.  the order plays like an old-fashioned police procedural, much as the recent juror no 2 (also starring hoult) played like an old-fashioned courtroom drama. i am here for it. i love the feeling of being in a handsomely-made, well-played, slow-burn, patient, unflashy, grown-up thriller.  there is nothing not to like about this film.the order played venice and toronto 2024 and is available to stream on amazon prime. it is rated r and has a running time of 116 minutes.
