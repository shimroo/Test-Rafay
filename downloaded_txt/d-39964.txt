time to learn more about precision mixed martial arts. we look forward to showing how the martial arts lifestyle can help you become happier and healthier than you ever thought possible. precision’s goal is to inspire each of our members to utilize martial arts training as a catalyst for positive life changes. i began my martial arts journey 15 years ago as a high school sophomore who struggled with low self-esteem and social anxiety.i wanted to learn self-defense after a friend of mine was hospitalized after being attacked in my neighborhood.little did i know, scheduling my introductory lesson would be the most important decision i ever made in my life. at my martial arts school i found a place that i belonged and a skill i could be proud of. unlike other sports which too often catered only to the naturally strong, assertive or athletic, my martial art instructors and fellow students patiently encouraged me and nurtured my growth in the art despite my lack of confidence or natural talent. martial arts allowed me to confront my greatest fears and gave me the tools to overcome them. with each technique i learned i became more self-assured and more willing to test my limits. martial arts taught me to welcome challenges rather than run from them and redefined what i considered possible for myself. before martial arts, reading a book report in front of my high school english class was practically impossible. after martial arts, facing professional fighters in front of sold out crowds in atlantic city was a walk in the park. i could hold my head up high and face the world with confidence and excitement rather than fear and apprehension. the greatest part of my martial arts journey is still underway – sharing this amazing experience with people just like you within the walls of my academy – precision mixed martial arts.   at precision mixed martial arts we are serious about changing lives. we make an investment in each of our members so that their

mma. i feel like the group of regular guys are a family and we all work hard to make each other better and not hold back when it comes to helping each other. i also enjoy the style of teaching brian uses. it is very personal and he is constantly making sure that everyone in the class from the most skilled student, to the beginner is doing everything correctly. as a teacher he is very involved with his student’s progress and does everything he can to make his students better. this is something that i don’t get when i trained at other schools.” joe weinstein“training at precision mma has
