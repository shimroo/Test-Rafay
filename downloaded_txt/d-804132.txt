i have only great things to say. the service is wonderful. the manager, reservationist and groundsmen happy to assist with questions and adjust reservation.  we enjoyed the fireplace and the outside patio with the view of the water.
yelp reviewer











a perfect location, too, to get to most places. right next to nauset beach and walking distance to groceries and restaurants. couldn’t have had a better place!
yelp reviewer











this location has a deluxe orleans bay side view. right in the center of orleans, it is close to the ocean and bay and local fresh water ponds. nickerson park is nearby as well. the rooms are clean and well furnished.

wonderful location. there was a pretty great view and walking distance to some of the best bars and restaurants in the area. staff was really helpful and nice. room was clean and we'll stocked. my favorite part about my stay at the cove was the fireplace down by the shore.
