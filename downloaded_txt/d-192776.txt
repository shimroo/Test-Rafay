"i'm honestly not sure how to express how great things are at both the upper and lower schools. my entire career was in public school education, and my older daughter went to public school k-6. the difference is amazing. the kindergarten here is so much more developmentally appropriate and has all the things little ones need to thrive. we love it here. i wish i had more kids i could enroll here!"—carlyn clark, parent
