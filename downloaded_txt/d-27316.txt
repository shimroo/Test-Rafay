 who we are the la vista church of christ, located on the south side of omaha, nebraska, has no bowling league, no softball team, nor does it sponsor a boy scout troop. we have an air-conditioned building with several rooms for bible classes, but there is no kitchen, banquet hall, gymnasium, or party room. perhaps you are wondering what kind of church this is or what the church offers the community. quite simply, we are a church that follows the pattern of the new testament. we are not a social club, a civic organization, a political forum, or a welfare institution. while the influence of the church and its members is felt in all these areas, the church itself is none of these things. the church is a spiritual institution that administers the spiritual needs of its members and the community. the church founded by jesus christ fulfills a need that no human institution could possibly perform. we deplore the fact that so many religious organizations have smothered the true purpose of the lord's church beneath civic, social, and domestic affairs. they feed hungry souls with hamburgers, but we feed the soul with the teachings of christ (john 6:26-35). the church exists "in order that the manifold wisdom of god might now be made known through the church to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. this was in accordance with the eternal purpose which he carried out in christ jesus our lord" (ephesians 3:10-11). it is a sacred institution that no community social club can match, and to alter the church into a social club would cheapen the very institution for which jesus died (acts 20:28). some reading this may think, "we live in the 21st century. the church must meet the needs of modern society." if you think this, then you are right! our society has civic and social organizations that meet our community's physical needs. but what this day and time woefully lacks is an emphasis on man's soul, moral duty, and eternal welfare. the church must meet the need of mankind today -- the very greatest need of all -- instruction in how to serve god and keep his commandments (ecclesiastes 12:13-14). this congregation of the lord's people specializes in being a church as defined in the new testament. our primary concern is with the spiritual needs of men and women—their need for god, for the forgiveness of sins, for genuine god-pleasing worship, and for pure lives that live in accordance with god's word. come and visit us soon. we invite you to make an honest investigation of christ's church in this community. as part of our effort to teach god's message, we regularly place articles on this site. take time to read them. we welcome questions concerning the bible, which we will try to answer according to god's holy word (i peter 4:11). lessons presented at the congregation are posted for your use. we hope you will enjoy the information you find here and perhaps learn something that will benefit your life. enjoy the day the lord has given us, the saints at la vista
