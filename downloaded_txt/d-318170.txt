what is source water protection?

the focus of the hamilton to new baltimore groundwater consortium (consortium) is source water protection. in order to protect source water, the consortium uses a multi-barrier approach. this approach includes taking actions to prevent contamination of sources of our water including developing legislation that requires businesses to register their facilities with the consortium. the consortium has also delineated the source water protection areas and has mapped out these areas for communities that support protecting our water. the consortium has a detailed contingency plan for spill response and alternate water supply planning both short term and long term. greater cincinnati water works manages the groundwater monitoring program for the consortium. all the members of the consortium along with a team called the public education committee are directly involved in public education and the promotion of best management practices. the consortium partners with many communities to be smart about land use in an effort to minimize risk to groundwater in the great miami valley buried aquifer (gmvba). source water protection is imperative to the gmvba because it is sensitive to contamination. this sensitivity is due to the unconfined nature of the aquifer that can allow contamination to readily migrate through the aquifer and the number of potential contaminant sources within the protected areas of the aquifer throughout this region.

where does our water come from?

all members of the hamilton to new baltimore groundwater consortium produce water from an extensive sand and gravel aquifer known as the great miami buried valley aquifer (gmbva). the aquifer generally follows the course of the present day great miami river. the gmbva was formed through three successive waves of glaciating that started 2 million years ago and ended 10,000 years ago.

who is the consortium?

in 1991, seven major public, private, and industrial groundwater producers in southern butler and northern hamilton counties, ohio, began working on a joint groundwater protection program known as the source water protection. the multi-jurisdictional, multiple supplier approach taken by hamilton to new baltimore groundwater consortium was one of ohio’s first. today the consortium consists of the city of hamilton, greater cincinnati water works, the city of fairfield, molsoncoors, southwestern ohio water company, southwest regional water district, and butler county water and sewer.
