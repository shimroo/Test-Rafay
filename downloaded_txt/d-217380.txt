lonweb.org has been online since 1997 and 

has always managed to remain a not-for-profit website offering all its resources 

for free. most daisy stories, arranger stories and opal stories 

have been translated by volunteers who just enjoy translating and helping people 

learn languages using the parallel text system, also knows as the side-by-side 

method. 

becoming a volunteer is easy!

you can start 

right away using our table templates provided below which let you fit your 

translated bits very easily into the parallel text slots provided! before 

translating, you may want to check that the story has never been translated 

before. on the other hand, we love to publish more than one translation for any 

given story, so feel free to send us a translation of a story which has already 

been translated if you feel like it!



after 

completion, please send your translation to




it will 

be published in a matter of days, if not hours.





volunteering an mp3 audio recording of your translation

 

we know that our resources would really benefit from an audio 

recording to complement the reading. you can volunteer an audio recording in mp3 

format either of your translation or of anybody else's translation. 


we do not need a professional voiceover 

sort of quality, the audio just needs to be understandable and without excessive 

background noise. we look forward to receiving your audio recordings of the daisy, 

arranger and opal stories!
