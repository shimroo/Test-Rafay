“nccp is a true co-operative; the teachers and parents are deeply involved in creating and maintaining this environment where our children can learn and socialize through a supportive, welcoming and playful environment.”



kristin



mom to a rising star & super hero















“we have been members for 4 years now and have three young children. the oldest loves elementary school now and is thriving thanks to the foundation nccp provided. the coordinating sibling classes offered by nccp are amazing!  i can participate in class for all my children and don’t need to find a sitter on my work days.”

anti-racist anti-bias policyas a school community, we believe understanding and acceptance of all people are crucial in early education and we believe diversity in the classroom population is not only welcome but necessary to lifelong development. applicants will never be discriminated against. this includes, but is not limited to, discrimination based on race, religious belief, ethnic culture, sexual orientation, gender expression, family structure, cognitive or physical ability, immigration status or economic class. admittance is based only on the appropriateness of a student’s age for a certain class and available space.
