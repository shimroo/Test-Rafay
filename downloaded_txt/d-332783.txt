our renegade memorandum
for too long, audio companies have catered to the demands of retail partners, fixated on bloating their product with marketable features. after 25 years of bucking the retail model, the outlaws continue to focus on audio performance, in order to provide top-quality gear directly to consumers. cutting out the middlemen made us the black sheep of the audio industry. we, in turn, embraced the freedom to pursue the true spirit of the hobby: crafting exceptional equipment accessible to all enthusiasts. join the outlaws and bid farewell to mass market homogeneity sold by the same private equity-owned multinational manufacturers to the same big retailers. it's time to put performance first.
