prices
reduced on everything!
we've
decided to call it quits with the military surplus business.
all
military surplus merchandise is being closed out.
once
an item is sold out, that's it, it will not be re-stocked.
only
those items that show a quantity in stock are available.
you'll
find some items showing 0 "in stock", that means you missed out, they're
gone.
all
sales final - no returns, exchanges or refunds - no exceptions
since
we are closing shop all credit card transactions are processed through
our primary business overdrive custom guitar works (www.stratcat.biz), so all checkout screens
will present you with the overdrive custom guitar works name and logos
like below.
