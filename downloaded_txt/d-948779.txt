what is a star sign?
your star sign in astrology is known as your sun sign.  the position of the sun in relation to each star sign constellation on a given date is what determines which star sign a person is.
in babylonian times, it was noted by the first stargazers that people who were born under a particular sign each shared similar personality traits.  this idea has been researched and refined over time until the present day, where we are all (mostly) familiar with our star sign.
