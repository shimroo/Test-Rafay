*** please note, the internet is a scary place for puppies and easily abusable by less than ethical breeders and websites promoting online puppy sales for profit, brokers, etc. we have been getting various requests to link our 
                    site to "find a puppy" services. once you have a website, anyone can troll about and link to it - even without permission. often, our url has been  posted before we are contacted for permission - which is neve
                    r given.  therefore, we make every attempt to have our url removed from such listings when we learn we have been 
                    listed. if you got to our site through one of these websites, please let us know what one so we can request removal. ***
