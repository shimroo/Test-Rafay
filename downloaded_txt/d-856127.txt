performance updates


as we transition into the next phase of our season, we continue to grow and learn so much. with that said, for the next few shows we will experiment with a four-show model, removing our saturday at 11pm. this slot was a new addition to the cab for our season and for several reasons, we think both our student population and audiences will be better served by four shows than five.
the ability to reinvent and readjust what will best serve our community is a fluid process. the phoenix dies and is reborn again with every show, every kickback, reading, and party we produce. we hope you will continue to take flight and burn bright with us.
