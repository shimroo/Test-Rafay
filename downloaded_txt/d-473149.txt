conceptualizeworking with corporate leaders and developers, architects listen to each client’s needs, then develop practical and precise metal building solutions.


fabricationthe architectural design is precision engineered by the metal building manufacturer to optimize the use of steel.  building components are fabricated just-in-time and shipped to the jobsite ready to assemble.


constructionfabricated components arrive at the jobsite ready to assemble with no field welding and no jobsite scrap.  steel framing is bolted together making for a quicker, safer erection process.


completionthe shell of a metal building can be completed in 30-50% less time than competing framing systems.  the accelerated schedule allows for quicker completion of the building interior and occupancy by the owner.

metal building attributesbuilding owners and developers depend on metal building solutions for these important reasons:







building design, fabrication, delivery, and construction are all managed through one single source.







each building constructs quickly, saves energy, is long-lasting, and is environmentally friendly, with virtually no waste in the manufacturing process – and materials are fully recyclable. 







flexible interior and exterior elements allow numerous design alternatives. exteriors can be clad with steel siding, wood, glass, aluminum, masonry, or concrete.

































































power-packed steel solutions



steel is the only truly circular building material, with a robust lifespan followed by a rebirth as new steel through energy-efficient electric arc furnaces. metal building systems are one of the most flexible, efficient and resilient uses of steel in construction.learn more

sustainable & resilientmetal buildings are all created from recycled steel, are 100% recyclable, and produce a low carbon footprint.cool metal roof coatings repel heat, reduce the urban heat island effect, increase solar reflectivity (decreasing energy consumption), and are designed to simply clip on optional solar panels.metal buildings incorporate fiberglass or rigid board insulation of varying thicknesses to create an energy-tight environment. and, insulation can also be easily added and increased within the roof cavity, while the interlocking edges of metal building panels provide excellent weather-tightness.offsite fabrication reduces construction equipment emissions; and faster cleanup is achieved because metal buildings generate about 50% less jobsite waste than other construction materials.learn more

stunning structures masterful metals


“building textures, colors, and design elements can represent a company’s overall aesthetic. metal buildings provide versatility such as cladding products, alternative coatings, specialized steel elements, and unique structural formations to help buildings express a firm’s corporate branding goals.”

why choose metal







      metal building systems can be utilized for many building types due to their ability to enclose large volumes of space with an efficient use of steel—saving clients both time and money—while not compromising the architect’s ability to provide well-proportioned spaces that satisfy client needs and delight the occupants.

      we sought to not just get away from the stereotype of the basic box, but to ask ourselves how we could, in essence, destroy the box.
      david holmes
principal, capital studio architect






      when working with the [metal building] system, look at it as building blocks with infinite options. create a composition unique to your project.

      this building is massive and the function of pulling and inserting boats into storage bays is very challenging—especially the higher bays.
      pete ebersole
architect and partner, architectural alliance architecture, inc.






      horizontal siding with hidden fasteners distinguishes the structure from typical metal buildings.
