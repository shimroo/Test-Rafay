welcome







 ibmc
we ride. we camp. we are the international brotherhood of motorcycle campers.
welcome
the international brotherhood of motorcycle campers is a family-oriented, non-brand-specific club composed of a very diverse group of people who have one thing in common: we like to ride and camp. we ride all brands and all styles, and camp in everything from expensive motorcycle camping trailers to $29 walmart tents. we tour on big highway bikes, scooters, and everything in between.
members decide when and where they want to have a campout, and post the details on our web site; they’re also available in our bimonthly newsletter, the campfire ring. when the date arrives, people show up. there may be three campers or sixty-three. we have a saying in our club: “it only takes two people to make a campout.” we have campouts planned this year in every corner of the country, and a full three seasons of camping. our members hold their campouts in campgrounds ranging from the very primitive to those offering full services.
you’ll find the history of the ibmc here.
