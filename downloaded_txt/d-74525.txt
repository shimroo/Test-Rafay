    although the index is primarily an organized set of links to mostly
other folk music websites on the web, there is informational content here
that you won't find anywhere else, or at least not as complete:

   musician's birthdays and bibliographical references
for specific musicians found in print, detailed information and
bibliographical references for
wisconsin bluegrass bands and
their members, and
discographies, with a special
emphasis on documenting
wisconsin recordings
in all genres.
