we know rock
our extensive library of field data from around the world helps identify which cutting elements and configurations perform best for any given application. field success drives ongoing design improvements for superior, solution-specific bits that fail rock quicker and more effectively, withstand impact and wear longer, and crush rop standards by 50% or more, driving vast industry acceptance worldwide.  

learn more
our design process isn't about cookie-cutter solutions. we start at the rock with the kind of formation and lithology your bit will encounter. working backward from the rock-cutter interface, analysis continues upward along the drillstring, the drive system, individual bha components, and the total system on bit behavior in a dynamic drilling environment. the process also takes into account the specific operating parameters and the interaction between individual elements of the drilling assembly.
not every well is exactly alike—even within the same field. that's why we persist in having such a consistent and methodical process for delivering performance and improvements that make a difference. the outcome of this process is a range of application-specific bits that consistently outperform previous designs or third-party bits when measured against the same parameters. because when you get right down to it, you need a bit that eats rocks for breakfast.
