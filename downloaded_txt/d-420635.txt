melissa is an amazing editor and collaborator.

her strength in entering the project with an open mind, and listening to what my vision was as a director, and then helping to bring that vision to life was invaluable. there were many problems to be solved, and she brought her creativity and problem-solving to make the scenes work. i never hear her give up — her excitement about what is possible, and creating an open and supportive space for dialogue between us is so great.-sarita khurana, documentary filmmaker







you’re able to see the best story in a big swath of footage.

there was always a critical point when the footage was not completely making sense or there was an obstacle in the way of telling a story. you were the one who was able to see the forest through the trees and get the project on the right path.-devin gallagher, documentary producer/director







melissa was able to figure out how to structure my doc so that it made sense and kept the humor.

she mined the footage,made  use of some vox pop interviews that i didn't think could work, and  came up with a genius idea for the open. my film even won the best director (short) prize at the atlanta docufest.-cheryl hess, documentary filmmaker
