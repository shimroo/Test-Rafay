update - 5-20-2017i started my site in 1998 as an aol member page, back when they gave you a whole 5mb of space to host as many pages and pictures as you could (so that is why many of the original pictures here seem tiny). by 1999, i moved here, to a new .com site. much has changed in my life, and online since then. when i started this site my truck was my hobby. i had big plans. well, life got in the way, and none of them panned out, but i do still have my 77 chevy k/20 and my 80 gmc k/25. both have been sitting for the past 13 years, and i have not done anything to the 77, and i pulled the hood and fenders off the 80 gmc, and nothing else. i bought a 61 willys pickup, with plans to put the body on the 77 chevy chassis. that is still the plan, eventually. the 80 gmc has a jasper motor with less than 20,000 miles on it. it also has an np205 transfer case in it, and the trans also has less than 20,000 miles on it. that engine trans and transfer case combo is going in the 77 chassis, eventually.

today i own and operate smith brothers services. we sell, install, and service meyer snow plows. we work on all plows, and sell and install truck accessories, and do a little welding and fabrication. so while i now work on few if any 73-87 chevy trucks, i always get to work on and see all the newest from all truck manufacturers. they have come a long way. some good, some bad. i did a used plow install on an 85 a couple of years ago, so i will add some pics here. many parts for these trucks are finally getting scarce. jc whitney sells less than half of the parts for these 73 - 87 chevy / gmc trucks compared to what they used to sell. prices on most (body) parts have skyrocketed. i added new links to parts on jc whitney, because they have an odd search feature that makes it hard to find parts, strange i know. for instance, they list headlight bezels as "headlight door". why, i have no clue, but i added the link to the bezel, calling it a bezel, because it is a bezel, not a door. the pickup box front panel, they just call "body panel", gee, can you be more vague? i have always preached when looking for info online, the more specific you can be, the more specific the results of your search will be.

while i do not really have the time, as time allows, i am going to try and update my site here, and remove all the dead links, and add what new things i can add. ~chuck
