3 commentcomment on facebookhackers join the fight to inform the public about project 2025.

hacktivist group siegedsec, comprised of self-described "gay furry hackers," has released data from the heritage foundation, a conservative think tank behind project 2025, a set of proposals aimed at reshaping the government in a more authoritarian direction.

project 2025 is a plan to give donald trump a set of ready-made policies to implement if he wins the election. the plan aims to create a more conservative and authoritarian government.

siegedsec gained access to a website hosting content produced by members of the heritage foundation, including blogs and material from the daily signal, a right-wing media site affiliated with heritage. the data includes full names, email addresses, passwords, and usernames of people associating with heritage.

the hackers said they released the data to provide transparency to the public about who is supporting the heritage foundation. 

siegedsec claimed credit for over two years of hacktivism against far-right sites. they said they will not release more data but have an "extra surprise" coming soon.

project 2025: a comprehensive plan:

donald trump and the republican national committee (rnc) have been criticized for their lack of commitment to addressing climate change through project 2025. despite the initiative's goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, trump has used misleading rhetoric to downplay the severity of climate change and blamed other countries for the problem. the rnc has opposed expanding renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, and has instead prioritized fossil fuel production and infrastructure development. the administration has also rolled back environmental regulations, ignored scientific evidence on climate change, and used divisive language to polarize the issue. as a result, the united states has seen increased greenhouse gas emissions, rising sea levels, and more frequent extreme weather events, with negative impacts on public health, the economy, and international relationships. overall, trump's and the rnc's inaction on climate change has been a major obstacle to addressing this critical issue.

several republican lawmakers and candidates have ties to the heritage foundation and have played a negative role in pushing for the plan's implementation. 

weird, sick freaks: 

ted cruz, a senator running for reelection, has made false claims about the first article of impeachment, undermining the integrity of the judicial process.

jd vance, a proponent of project 2025, frames various socioeconomic issues in ways that may contribute to division and misunderstanding. this approach is evident in his foreword to "dawn's early light" and in the book itself, which generalizes the behaviors and values of certain racial and ethnic groups, perpetuating stereotypes that can alienate communities.

vance's economic critiques risk oversimplifying complex issues such as job displacement, wage stagnation, and the shrinking middle class. by blaming specific groups for these problems, he fosters scapegoating rather than fostering an understanding of the systemic factors involved, including globalization, technological advancements, and public policy failures. such narratives may hinder the development of effective economic policies, potentially widening the economic divide and deepening social inequalities. ultimately, vance's framing of socioeconomic issues and his generalizations may create an environment where understanding and collaboration become increasingly challenging, undermining efforts to build a more equitable and prosperous society for all.

kevin roberts, president of the heritage foundation, has praised the "blueprint to save america" budget plan, which could lead to devastating cuts to social programs and harm vulnerable communities. jim banks, chairman of the republican study committee, has used his position to spread misinformation and undermine democratic institutions.

deb fischer participated in a virtual event on nuclear modernization, which could lead to increased militarization and aggression. josh hawley delivered a keynote address on christian nationalism, which promotes a divisive and exclusionary ideology. larry hogan signed a bill creating education savings accounts in west virginia, which could lead to the privatization of education and harm public schools.

jim justice signed a bill praised by heritage, which could lead to further erosion of workers' rights and benefits. david schweikert participated in a virtual event on adoption and foster care, which could perpetuate harmful stereotypes and discrimination. rick scott partnered with heritage to create a video series blaming economic woes on president joe biden and the democratic party's agenda, which is misleading and divisive.

roger wicker participated in an event focused on military issues, which could lead to increased militarization and interventionism.

project 2025: a comprehensive plan:

social security: reduces benefits by 25% over 10 years, increases retirement age to 72 or 75, and reduces the number of people receiving benefits.

medicare and medicaid: cuts spending by $1.3 trillion over 10 years, increases premiums for medicare beneficiaries, and introduces cost-sharing measures.

federal employee benefits: reduces government pensions, eliminates collective bargaining rights, and replaces them with a merit-based system.

funding: reduces non-discretionary spending by $500 billion annually and increases defense spending by $100 billion annually.

regulatory reform: repeals or revises federal regulations, harming labor, environmental, and financial regulations.

immigration reform: prioritizes high-skilled workers and reduces family-based immigration, leading to social and economic consequences.

judicial appointments: allows senate republicans to block appointments without filibusters, undermining the independence of the judiciary.

election reform: implements voter id requirements, limits early voting periods, and restricts campaign finance contributions, suppressing voter turnout and democracy.

overall, project 2025 is a plan that threatens the well-being of americans and undermines the country's future.

73 commentscomment on facebookall i can say is this:  became a member of cfd in 1996.  at that time there were 32 stations.  almost 30 years later, a huge increase in population density, housing, apartments and business….   and only 3 additional stations have been built.   just saying, something definitely wrong here.at the end of the day does it matter? norwich will still cover the runs just like other areas that are “columbus territory”. because columbus relies on the townships to cover what they can’t.columbus can’t cover their own runs now. why don’t you cancel all mutual aid and see if you can swing your own runs for 1 day.view more comments
