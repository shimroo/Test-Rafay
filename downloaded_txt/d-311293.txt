before the 1997-98 nba season began phil jackson called it the last dance knowing it was going to be the final season for the team. bulls gm jerry krause was jealous of phil and wanted him gone. krause told phil before the season started that even if he went 82-0 he would not be back.jordan made it clear he wouldn’t play for another coach. pippen was unhappy because he was underpaid and because krause wanted to trade him. the bad news is that season would indeed be their last dance. the good news is they left bulls fans with an incredible ending that will never be forgotten.

 

$468,000. that’s how much an unused chicago bulls ticket sold for at an auction last year. what’s so special about it? it’s the only known unused ticket from michael jordan’s nba debut in 1984.after the bulls drafted jordan with the 3rd pick in 1984, they signed him to a 7-year deal for only $6 million. that's less than $1 million a year to have the goat on your team. 😲













best jordan cologne! the jordan legend is considered the best one by most people. it has a nice sweet gourmand scent. some describe it as pancakes soaked in maple syrup. for the price point, which is usually under $15, it’s an absolute steal.



phil jackson wearing the bred 4’s with a suit & tie. videomichael jordan’s 1996 mercedes sold for over $200,000. mj’s s600 coupe had a v-12 engine, chrome wheels, and tiny wipers on the headlights. even with 150,000 miles it sold on ebay last year for $202,200. photo﻿interview with the the last dance director. videosomeone stole mike’s jersey on valentine’s day in 1990. mj had to wear #12 with no name on the back because that was the only jersey the bulls had. a few days later they found his #23 jersey in the ceiling tiles of the visitor’s locker room. videoin a game against utah in 1987, jordan got the ball in the post, turned, and dunked on a short john stockton. a jazz fan in the crowd yelled, "hey jordan! pick on somebody your own size!" on the next play, mike got the ball, flew in the air, and dunked on mel turpin, utah's 6'11" center. as mike ran back on defense he looked at the fan and asked, "was he big enough?" 😂  videoin may 1995 against orlando, mike decided to stop wearing the #45 and switched back to the #23 after nick anderson of the magic said, “45 is not 23.” click here for highlights from that game. look closely and you'll see that he was the only bull with white shoes on (concord xi's). the nba considered that a uniform violation and fined him for not wearing black shoes like the rest of his teammates.

the reason jordan left the nba to play baseball. it was 1993 and the bulls had just won their third straight championship. michael was mentally exhausted and out of challenges. he felt he had nothing else to prove on the court. his father had tried to get him to retire in 1991 after the first championship, so he could give baseball a shot.then out of nowhere in july 1993 michael's father was murdered. his body was found floating in a creek in south carolina after being shot. his red lexus (a gift from mike) with license plate unc0023 was stripped and found in the woods near fayetteville, north carolina.michael wanted to honor his father's wish, so he retired from the nba and made an attempt at a baseball career.













coincidentally jerry reinsdorf, the owner of the bulls, also owned the chicago white sox. the birmingham barons were a double-a minor league affiliate of the sox, so mike made a deal with reinsdorf to play for the barons. michael worked his butt off everyday to get better at baseball. he finished batting .202 with 3 home runs, 51 runs batted in, and 30 stolen bases. in august 1994 the mlb went on strike. with nothing to do because of the baseball lockout mike decided to call his friend and former bulls teammate b.j. armstrong. they met up at bakers square near the bulls practice facility in deerfield, il. after they finished eating, b.j. invited mike to practice to see his old friends. phil jackson let mike participate in practices for a few weeks and that’s when the love for the game started to return. then on march 18, 1995 jordan sent a two-word fax to the media announcing his return:"i'm back."the rest is history.
