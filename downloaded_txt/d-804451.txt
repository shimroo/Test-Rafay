we ate our deepavali away



yesterday was deepavali, thus we got a day off.  we simply ate our day away!  on our off days, we would usually sleep in late.  as per all other off days, we woke up around 10+am and by the time we got ready to move out, it's almost lunch time.  we brought mil along and thus i chose chinese food so that it suits mil better.

we settled for canton paradize at star vista.  star vista had since became one of our regular food haunts due to it proximity to where we stay.






 



 

di di was as cheeky as ever, he was super happy with his bowl of wanton noodles. 




 

the dad was a happy man too cos the food was good.  the crispy char siew bun is a must try.  yummy!

 




even choosy kor kor slurp up most of his roast duck noodles.

after our lunch the dad brought the whole brood to bugis to pay respect at the temple before going home.  as i was bogged down by my chronic back pain, i suggested for the boys to go swimming while i rest at home.  naturally the 2 boys were thrilled, these 2 were simply water babies! they love to immerse themselves in water.  i made use of the time to snooze for nearly 2 hours.

by the time they came home, it's makan time again!!! god.... it's a tough job trying to stay trim!!  we had ichiban boshi for dinner! another of my favourite haunts. love their reasonably priced sets.  while waiting for food the dad started snapping photos to past time, can't even wait for me to get off the phone!




 



 

i wonder why kor kor looked kinda angry in these pic.  probably he hated eating.

 



 

on the contrary, di di looked super glad facing his food.  today he surprised all of us by asking for cha soba.  this is the first time he tried cha soba and he gave me his verdict after the meal - mummy i preferred cold noodles more than the hot noodles.  great! cos i am a cha soba fan as well.

 




kor kor still looking grouchy but cute hahahhaha




 

in the midst of the meal di di robbed me of my cardigan as he said he was cold. effect of cold noodles??

 



 

 

di di has got good appetite, after his cold noodles he asked for an extra servings for tamago maki.

 

 



 

after their food they got restless and started to poke fun at me.......... -_-

 

 


.
step by step picture of kor kor breaking into a sneeze while we try to pose for the last few pics hahahahh. so comical.

that was how we ate our ph away.... nothing really constuctive but we had a blissful day. :)

free style first born



ever seen anyone having supper in this manner? sprawled on kitchen floor book in front, cup of milo in between him and the book with his prized marks and spencer cookies at the side...

i have mixed feelings when it comes to my first born. he possessed a special character with a tad of undesirable attitude.. he can be kind of unpredictable... at times making me jump sky high with his lousy attitude (especially towards learning) yet on some occasions he can be soooo sweet that he makes me feels all warm and fuzzy....

frankly i am at a lost of how i should manage this boy.. he got his exam papers back this week, all his results have slipped and in my opinion he did quite poorly.  we spent quite some effort in coaching him before the exams. he did pretty well in most of the past years exam paper that we tested him on... and yet... his results were disappointing....

i felt super exasperated... if his learning attitude has been good... i would have felt better.. unfortunately he possessed super poor leaning attitude. he simply can't be bothered with anything, despite our various talks with him.  to him nothing really matters, he is only keen to have fun fun fun and more fun.... swear to god, we did not deprive him of any fun even though he has been showing poor results.  i seriously wish to find a balance... 

we've tried various options to help him with his work... enrichment centers, coaching, practicing... etc..nothing works. most teachers came back with the same old feedback of his simply bo chup attitude in classes... the next thing i'm gonna attempt is to get him a 1 to 1 math tuition teacher... to see whether 1 to 1 learning environment will be better off for him...

i am seeking solution to motivate him to improve his attitude. i am sticking to my words of canceling holiday plans if his results are poor, thus no holidays for us this year end...

what more can i do to correct his bo chup attitude?

we wanna be back



ok i am feeling bad... sometime back in september 2011... i happily declared that we are back.. very soon after.. we went into hiatus again... a comment on my fb from yl linking me back to my old wordpress blog brought back flashes of fond memories of me charting down the growth of my kiddos.  this is the post that urge me to come back again i do enjoy reading my old post and recollect what happened years back.  i guess i should really make effort to restart this effort.  i've lost a significant part of kenji's growth... he is now 5 years old already.. many lost years... sigh...

exercise!! exercise!!



i am trying really hard to keep fit nowadays... realised that i've been eating and eating but not really moving much.  tummy is building up...  though i may look slim overall.. but the tummy is protruding out more than usual and nooo! it is not no.3 on the way!

hopefully my once a week aerobics class and at least once or twice a week jog will help to prevent the tummy from protruding more if not cut it down.  i very much wanted to interest the kid to move with me.  dec is still quite ok, but kenji is kinda lazy... just a short walk and he'll be asking us to carry him... weak leh...

saturday morning all of us woke up early so we went for a morning walk and ended up at a fitness corner at sunset way.  i must say the fitness corner is kinda cool, with weight lifting and arm tonning stations etc.

i did some sit ups and kenji upon seeing me do that tried to imitate as well.  of course, his he dun have much strength at the abs so he only manage to lift his neck.  the dad then went on to help and teach him how to do sit up hahaha.  he looks really cute attempting really hard to achieve a proper sit up.  let's hope soon, my boys will be able to jog with me :)

my simply bo chup first born




i was waiting for declan to come home and this was what greeted me when he skipped off the school bus...

he actually survived the whole day with his shoes on the wrong side.... when i pointed that out to him he simply goes :" ohhh no wonder..."  probably just realizing how come his feet felt weird the whole day today....

that's my child...

we are back!



after more than a year hiatus, we are back!! what triggers me to come back to blogging you may ask.  i guess a big tpart of it is the fond memories that flooded me when i re-read the old posts that i did.  the posts charted declan's growing process well and i realised, nothing much was on kenji. i hope he won't grow up and blame me for not charting his growth on the blog. to avoid that from happening and to allow me to continue having a reliable channel to help me remember my kids growing years, i am back! or should i say we are back! as of today, dec is oredi in pri 1 and kenji is oredi in nursery 2.  oh boy.. how fast these babies grow... more updates on the way ;)
