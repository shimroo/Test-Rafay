link | leave a comment | share | flag(no subject)dec. 5th, 2005 | 09:32 pmthe greatest dance everso how many of you remember bruce springsteen’s “dancing in the dark” video? you know, the one where he looks into the crowd and spies a cute girl with short black hair. that girl was none other than courtney cox and most people consider this to be her first big break into the business. well anyway, as the video progresses bruce pulls her up on stage with him and they begin to dance. granted, they’re not “dancing in the dark” since it’s a well lit stage, but nobody seemed to care about that because one look at her and they’d be all, “awwww! look how cute she is dancing her little heart out up there with him!”cut to the 90’s with the show “fresh prince of bel air”. it was a funny sitcom sure, but in my mind there is only one magical thing that actually made the show truly worth watching: the carlton dance! if you are one of the few, sad, uncultured individuals who have never witnessed this amazing spectacle of rhythm and coordination, please feast your eyes upon the following two animations:the carlton dance! the carlton dance!breathtaking isn’t it? seriously, there never has and never will be a greater dance. well i recently found out that alfonso ribeiro (carlton) actually came up with the dance after watching courtney cox dance in the bruce springsteen video. his dance is simply an exaggerated parody of what she did in the video… and somehow that makes the carlton dance all the more hilarious when watching it.alfonso ribeiro i salute you. source:http://www.i-mockery.com/blabber/?p=9

link | leave a comment | share | flagfuck it i'm posting this is my other journal as wellmar. 30th, 2005 | 03:10 pmflip flops have to go, they have to. 99.9999999% of the population have ugly feet and flip flops are like walking outside in your y-front underwear with the body of archie bunker. plus, how fucking lazy are you? it takes 3 seconds to lace up runners. flip flops are fucking sloppy. southerners, i understand it's hot outside, but don't you even pretend like you are actually fucking walking somewhere. puhlease, i used to live in the south, i know goddamn well you guys will drive across the street instead of walking.shorts have to go also. shorts are so fucking heinous. three quarter length pants are just as cooling and a whole hell of a lot more put together. also, what the hell is wrong with a little skirt? unless you are wearing this exact outfit...shorts are not allowed."with flip flops this would just look kind of lazy. throw some chucks in the mix and it's "longtime girlfriend" fun. but matching orange stilettos? that's a level of hot so fucking high not even a good raping could put out the fire."my thoughts exactly. why is everyone outside walking around like it's laundry day? jesus. could we have a modicum of decorum here?
