evtolution: pioneering the future of urban air mobility10 february 2025rhode-saint-genèse, belgium
the horizon europe project  evtolution hosted its first public  workshop, "novel tools for novel aircraft”, on february 6, 2025, at the gkn technology center in bristol, uk.  at this milestone event, project partners presented the initial outcomes of their work and outlined their plans for the next stages of the project.  evtolution is the first horizon europe project aimed at enabling an efficient, decarbonized, safe and quiet urban air mobility (uam).read morewe are delighted to announce that prof. stefano discetti will join the von karman institute as a visiting professor starting january 1st, 2025. 1 january 2025rhode-saint-genèse, belgiumprof. discetti is a renowned expert in aerodynamics, machine learning-based flow control, and non-intrusive measurement techniques and the recipient of the prestigious erc starting grant for his project nextflow.
