sure has been a crazy year
          19 is so bad
          gotta keep going

 

 
not much going on in the coal
          fields. depleted seams, over regulation and less demand. sure
          there are a few mining, maybe from now on as coal is used 
          for other purposes than heating in a furnace. coal is what
          made america great...our vast resources have made us a mighty
          nation. all hard work sweat 
          and blood. the law of nature is the strong survive and the
          weak become the meat.

anatomy
                              of the blue gem coal seam
how much is the blue gem worth?
the specialty market
                                    for blue gem is where the value is.
if the seam meets certain specs
                                          such as low ash, low sulfur
                                          below 1%, low iron content then the blue gem
                                            is top dollar coal.
other
                                              specialty markets may have
                                              other specifications, in
                                              any case blue gem coal is
                                              the creme of the crop.

                                                and their mother is
                                                  after the blue gem,
                                                  there are only a few
                                                  players that can mine
                                                  the coal and meet the
                                                  specifications
