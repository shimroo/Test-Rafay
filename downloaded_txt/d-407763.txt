ght group-30a was extremely professional for our audio and video installation. they took care of everything i wanted in my system and more. the crew did everything perfectly and their attention to detail and concern for a good customer experience was beyond reproach.... i can’t say enough about how all 4 in their own way went above and beyond in my audio/video installation. from the beginning i could tell ben is very knowledgeable and a great lead man to interact with the customer. he even showed up on the morning of the equipment installation to make sure everything was going smoothly. in a few words, adam was diligent, helpful and more than capable for the job. he did it exceptionally. nick was knowledgeable, hard working and extremely patient and helpful. rich seemed like the subject matter expert and go to guy when a question needed answering. all together, the crew arrived, introduced themselves, got directly to work and cleaned up after themselves. if i owned a company these are the kind of guys i would want working for me and the only company in the area i would ever go to for all my home automation work.  read more   well-designed, thoughtfully constructed brandon s., birmingham
if you’re in the market for high-end, well designed and thoughtfully constructed audio/visual - you cannot do better than this. ght takes a mix of customer service you’d be happy to send to your grandma’s unannounced, technical engineering it would take a doctorate degree to parallel..., and an uncanny ability to do the right thing no matter what struggles come up - and blend that together.

i have been a customer of ght for the last 4 years and am constantly in awe of their customer service, technical and design skills, attention to detail and immediate response to any issues that arise. but they recently surpassed even my expectations when ...they coordinated a comcast xfinity appointment with their brilliant technician, koah. he not only had figured out the problem with the bad tv signal before comcast arrived, he stayed the entire time to make sure the issue was fixed and would not occur again. cooper etheridge kindly put me in touch with neil who coordinated the analysis with comcast tech support which meant i only had to have one appointment instead of three! they saved me a lot of time and money! ght is the best in every way… you can be sure kenny and all of his employees are at the top of their game. no need to ever deal with anyone else!  read more          why ght? ght group, formerly georgia home theater, is a full-service custom electronics design and integration company, proudly serving homeowners and businesses in buckhead, alpharetta, midtown, the greater atlanta area, santa rosa beach and the florida panhandle, and the entire southeastern united states and beyond. our solutions are designed to add luxury, convenience, and efficiency to your lifestyle. schedule a consultationreserve a free, no-obligation consultation with us by filling out the form below. we’ll contact you shortly.    subscribe to inspiration stay up to date on the latest smart technology ideas and innovations.     atlanta office 1625 cobb parkway se marietta, ga 30060 (770) 955-890930a office 790 n county hwy 393 santa rosa beach, fl 32459 (850) 529-4743birmingham office2732 central ave suite 130homewood, al 35209 (205) 225-9987  about companyservices locations florida panhandle 30abirminghamatlanta connected living indoor livingoutdoor livinga day in the life (harmony house)a day in the life (carol house) services residentialsmart home automationaudio / videohigh-performance audiohome theaterlightingshadingsecuritywi-fi networkingelectricalsmart home democommercialcommercial automationsmart boardroom demo galleries image gallerytutorial videos brands control4focallutronmarantzmcintoshmonitor audiosamsungsonancesonossonymore brands trade partners custom buildersinterior designersarchitects learn more blogcontact  pay now           powered by one firefly   |    sitemap   |    privacy policy    contact us now      ×    ×  thanks for your interest in our technology and lifestyle guide!to access the download, please enter your name and email address below, then click submit to access the guide.
