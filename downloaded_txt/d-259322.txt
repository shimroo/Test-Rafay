posted on february 12, 2025what should a business do if it receives an irs notice of intent to levy? 


receiving an irs notice of intent to levy can be an alarming experience for any business owner. this notice signifies that the internal revenue service (irs) is planning to seize business assets—such as bank accounts, wages, receivables, or other property—to satisfy outstanding tax debt. however, while the situation is serious, it is not without resolution. businesses that act swiftly and strategically can often prevent or mitigate the levy’s impact.
this article provides a comprehensive guide on what businesses should do when they receive an irs notice of intent to levy. we will discuss the implications of such a notice, immediate steps to take, ways to negotiate with the irs, and long-term strategies to prevent similar issues in the future.
understanding the irs notice of intent to levy
a notice of intent to levy (often issued as irs letter 1058 or cp90/cp297) is a formal notification from the irs that they intend to seize a taxpayer’s assets due to unpaid tax liabilities. this notice is not issued arbitrarily; it is typically preceded by multiple warnings, including a notice of tax due and a final notice of intent to levy and your right to a hearing.
the irs is legally required to provide at least 30 days’ notice before taking action, giving businesses an opportunity to resolve the issue. if the business does not respond within this timeframe, the irs can proceed with seizing assets.
immediate steps to take
do not ignore the notice
the worst response to an irs notice of intent to levy is inaction. ignoring the notice will lead to enforcement actions that can significantly harm your business, including frozen bank accounts, garnished accounts receivable, or even seizure of business equipment and property.
verify the accuracy of the notice
carefully review the notice to ensure the irs’s claim is accurate. check:

the tax years involved
the amount owed
any payments that may not have been credited
correspondence from the irs regarding past due taxes

if you believe the notice contains errors, you should contact the irs immediately to dispute them.
understand your rights
under the taxpayer bill of rights, you have the right to:

appeal the levy before it takes effect
seek an alternative resolution
request a collection due process (cdp) hearing
dispute the tax debt in tax court (if applicable)

understanding these rights can help your business take the best course of action.
contact a tax professional
dealing with the irs can be complex and stressful. hiring a tax professional, such as a tax attorney, certified public accountant (cpa), or enrolled agent, can significantly improve your chances of resolving the issue efficiently. a professional can help negotiate with the irs, file appeals, and explore alternative resolutions.
request a collection due process (cdp) hearing
if you disagree with the levy, you have the right to request a collection due process hearing within 30 days of receiving the notice. the cdp hearing allows you to present your case before the irs independent office of appeals, which may result in the levy being suspended while your appeal is considered.
exploring resolution options
pay the tax debt in full
if your business has the financial means, the fastest way to stop the levy is to pay the full amount owed. this will immediately halt any irs collection efforts. if full payment is not feasible, other options are available.
set up an installment agreement
an installment agreement allows your business to pay the tax debt over time in manageable monthly payments. the irs offers different types of installment plans, including:
short-term plans (paying within 180 days)
long-term plans (monthly payments over several years)
a tax professional can help you negotiate an agreement that minimizes financial strain on your business.
apply for an offer in compromise (oic)
an offer in compromise allows businesses to settle their tax debt for less than the full amount owed if they can prove that paying in full would cause significant financial hardship. the irs considers factors such as income, expenses, and asset equity when evaluating oic applications.
request a hardship status (currently not collectible – cnc)
if your business is experiencing severe financial difficulties, you may qualify for “currently not collectible” (cnc) status. this temporarily suspends collection activities, though interest and penalties may continue to accrue. this is often a short-term solution while working towards a more permanent resolution.
appeal the levy or request a penalty abatement
if you believe the levy is unjust or was issued in error, you can file an appeal through the irs appeals office. additionally, if penalties have significantly increased your debt, you may request penalty abatement if you can demonstrate reasonable cause, such as unforeseen financial hardship or reliance on incorrect irs guidance.
preventing future tax issues
implement strong tax compliance practices
to avoid future irs enforcement actions, businesses should establish sound tax compliance strategies, including:

filing all required tax returns on time
paying estimated taxes as needed
keeping accurate financial records
automating tax payments if possible

work with a tax advisor regularly
regularly consulting with a tax professional can help ensure your business remains compliant and is prepared to address any potential tax liabilities before they become an issue.
monitor irs correspondence closely
businesses should always respond to irs notices promptly and proactively address any tax discrepancies. keeping open communication with the irs can prevent escalation to more severe enforcement actions.
conclusion
an irs notice of intent to levy is a serious matter that requires immediate attention. while the notice signals potential asset seizure, businesses have multiple options to resolve the issue before the levy takes effect. by acting swiftly—whether by disputing inaccuracies, negotiating a payment plan, or seeking professional assistance—businesses can often avoid severe financial consequences.
proactive tax management and compliance are key to preventing future irs actions. businesses that maintain organized financial records, seek professional guidance, and respond promptly to irs communications can significantly reduce their risk of encountering tax levies in the future.
if your business receives an irs notice of intent to levy, don’t panic—act decisively, seek expert assistance, and explore your resolution options to protect your company’s financial stability.

 assess your skills and expertise
the first step in becoming a business consultant in new orleans—or anywhere—is assessing your own skills, experience, and areas of expertise. business consultants often specialize in a particular niche, so it’s essential to identify where your strengths lie. common areas of expertise for consultants include:
strategy development – helping businesses develop long-term growth strategies, market positioning, and business models.
operations and process improvement – assisting companies in improving their internal processes, reducing inefficiencies, and optimizing performance.
marketing and branding – advising businesses on how to build strong brands, attract customers, and implement effective marketing strategies.
financial consulting – helping businesses manage their finances, create budgets, optimize cash flow, and prepare for investment or expansion.
human resources and organizational development – supporting businesses in managing talent, developing organizational structures, and fostering positive workplace cultures.
technology and digital transformation – guiding companies through the integration of technology, software systems, and digital marketing strategies.
once you identify your area of expertise, it’s important to evaluate whether you need additional training, certifications, or education. business consultants with specialized certifications such as the certified management consultant (cmc) designation, or those with advanced degrees in business or related fields, can command higher fees and gain the trust of more clients.
build your network and reputation
new orleans, like many cities, relies heavily on personal connections and word-of-mouth referrals. building a strong network is crucial for establishing your consultancy and attracting clients. one of the best ways to do this is by attending networking events, joining industry associations, and actively participating in the local business community.
the new orleans chamber of commerce offers a range of events where local business owners and consultants can meet and collaborate. additionally, there are a variety of other professional organizations, such as the new orleans business alliance and the new orleans entrepreneur week (noew), which provide great networking opportunities for consultants.
by attending events, joining professional groups, and volunteering for committees or speaking opportunities, you can gain visibility and build relationships that may lead to consulting contracts. building a reputation as a knowledgeable and trustworthy consultant will encourage referrals, which can be one of the most effective ways to acquire clients in new orleans.

obtain legal and financial protections
before you start working with clients, it’s important to protect yourself legally and financially. there are several steps to take to ensure that your consultancy is set up correctly:
business structure: decide on the best legal structure for your consulting business. many consultants opt for forming a limited liability company (llc), which provides personal liability protection while allowing flexibility in tax filing. consult with a legal professional to determine the best structure for your needs.
business license: ensure that you obtain the necessary business licenses and permits to operate in new orleans. the city of new orleans requires business owners to register with the louisiana secretary of state, and you may need a local business license as well.
insurance: obtain professional liability insurance, also known as errors and omissions insurance, to protect yourself in case of a legal dispute with clients. this insurance will help cover legal fees and damages if a client sues you for negligence or mistakes in your work.
taxes and finances: set up a separate business bank account and bookkeeping system to keep track of your income and expenses. it’s also advisable to hire an accountant to ensure that your taxes are filed correctly and that you’re taking advantage of any available deductions for business expenses.
market your services

referrals: word-of-mouth is incredibly powerful in new orleans. once you have a few clients, ask for referrals and testimonials. these can be invaluable in attracting new business.
content marketing: publish blog posts, articles, or even white papers that highlight your expertise in your specific consulting niche. you can also create video content and share it on platforms like youtube or social media.
partnerships: partner with other businesses that serve the same target market. for example, if you’re a financial consultant, partnering with a local accountant or law firm can help expand your client base.
local advertising: consider using local advertising opportunities such as community newspapers, local radio, or sponsorships of events. these can help you build recognition and trust in the new orleans area.
deliver results and build long-term relationships
one of the most important aspects of being a successful business consultant is delivering results for your clients. your reputation will largely depend on the value you provide, so it’s crucial to develop customized strategies that help businesses achieve their goals.
additionally, building long-term relationships with clients is essential for repeat business and referrals. stay in touch with your clients even after the project ends, and offer ongoing support or follow-up services as needed. offering value beyond the scope of your initial engagement will help build trust and loyalty, turning one-time clients into long-term partners.
