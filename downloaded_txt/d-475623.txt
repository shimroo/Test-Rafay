leadership style













empathy & respectempathy and respect sit at the core of any good product team and its work. understanding the needs of a business’s customers and users provide a product team with purpose, direction, and inspiration. moreover, a healthy and motivated team is almost always comprised of people who feel safe, trusted, accountable, and empowered to do what they do well. that means creating environments where people feel listened to, empathized with, challenged, and given a clear vision that they can take ownership of.













holistic insightunderstanding the customer lies at the heart of every successful product. that said, successful product design can’t just be grounded in qualitative user research. it needs to be informed by quantitative data and an understanding of the greater impact to a business. a holistic diagnosis of a problem or opportunity leads to informed design decisions, intricate solutions, and effortless roadmap alignment among product and leadership teams.
