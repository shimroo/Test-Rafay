   cataracts


a cataract is a clouding of the eye’s crystalline lens, which is just behind the pupil and works with the cornea to focus light on the retina. any clouding of the lens is a cataract whether there has been a significant reduction vision or not. the most common symptoms of cataracts are blurring and dimming of vision. patients often describe a film over their vision or worsening vision with bright lights.

   cornea


the transparent part of the eye at the front, which covers the iris and pupil is the cornea. its primary purpose is to refract light and, while its focus is fixed, it contributes approximately two-thirds of the eye’s total focusing power. it consists of three layers: the stroma, which makes up most of the corneathe epithelium, which is several layers of cells covering the exterior of the stromathe endothelium, which is a single layer of cells lining the interior of the stroma

   diabetic eye disease is the most common cause of blindness in the us


diabetes is an increasingly common disease in the united states and, due to the damage to blood vessels caused by high blood sugar levels, it has serious consequences for your vision. when the condition is caught early and treated properly, vision loss from diabetic eye disease, which is a leading cause of blindness in the us, is often preventable. this is why regular comprehensive exams are recommended for all diabetics.
