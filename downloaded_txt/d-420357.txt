	on 23 january 2020, associate professor adam switzer, holding concurrent positions as principal investigator at the earth observatory of singapore (eos) and assistant professor at the asian school of environment, nanyang technological university, singapore, succeeded prof. kerry sieh as permanent representative of singapore to ccop.

assoc prof switzer is primarily a sedimentologist with interests in coastal geomorphology, palaeoenvironments and natural hazards. the overarching driver of his research is a desire to use geomorphological and sedimentological techniques to solve contemporary problems at local, regional and international scales. his main research interest lies in using coastal stratigraphy to define the recurrence interval of catastrophic marine inundation events (tsunami or large storms) and investigate the relationship between tectonics and climate change in coastal systems.
