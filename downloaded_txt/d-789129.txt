as active long term members of spata (swimming pools and allied trades association) whitewaters are instrumental in formulating and upholding the standards that guide our industry. spata is an internationally respected association and works alongside eusa (european union of swimming pool and spa associations) and other industry bodies to set international design standards and codes of ethics. as full members we not only have to meet membership criteria but we are also periodically inspected to assess the quality of our workmanship in terms of both design and construction, and our trading ethics. in addition, all design and service staff are members of ispe (institute of swimming pool engineers) and are enrolled in the ispe cpd scheme.
