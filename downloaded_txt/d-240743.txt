âthe significant problems we face cannot be solved by the same level of thinking that created them.â
âthe formulation of the problem is often more essential than its solution, which may be
merely a matter of mathematical or experimental skill.â
âif i had an hour to solve a problem i'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5
minutes thinking about solutions.â
â albert einstein
