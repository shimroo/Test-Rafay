our mission 



to connect people to the water through education and recreation.



the waterfront center (wfc) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization located in oyster bay, new york. we provide access to the waters of oyster bay harbor and long island sound through our marine education programs, recreational and instructional sailing programs, paddleboard, kayak, and sailboat rentals, and through harbor tours aboard our national historic landmark oyster sloop christeen. additionally, wfc is home to ida may, a replica of one of the first engine-powered oyster dredges, which now serves as a floating classroom, offering hands-on educational experiences that connect visitors to the rich maritime history of oyster bay.
