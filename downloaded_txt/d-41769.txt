 intuit champions the diverse voices of self-taught art, welcoming both new and familiar audiences. intuit presents the work of self-taught artists—also known as outsider art. these artists typically work outside the mainstream and may have faced societal, economic or geographic barriers to a traditional path of art making. by presenting a diversity of artistic voices, intuit builds a bridge from art to audiences. the museum’s mission is grounded in celebrating each of our abilities to be powerfully creative. the instinct to create is universal and the arts must embrace, represent and be accessible to all.
