 stewardship |committed to stewardshipwe believe the role of business in society is to create goods and services that help people improve their lives, and to do so responsibly. stewardship encompasses the responsible management of our actions and the resources entrusted to our care. our stewardship framework guides our actions in consuming fewer resources, contributing to the well-being of our communities and facilitating a workplace our people thrive in. we focus on individuals and bottom-up solutions rather than top-down imperatives in our approach to environmental, social and corporate governance (esg).see our stewardship framework
