  saving a species from extinction. one animal at a time.










 


canada's most endangered mammal






 


the vancouver island marmot is a remarkable animal. it is endemic to canada - one of only a small handful of mammals to occur in this country and nowhere else. unfortunately, it is also critically endangered.

in 2004, fewer than 30 remained in the wild. recovery efforts by the foundation and our partners have been restoring the population.
