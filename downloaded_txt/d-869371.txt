welcome to middlethorpe hall and spa
middlethorpe hall is a william iii country house just two miles from york’s city centre, yet is set in 20 acres of its own beautiful gardens and parkland – the best of both city and country.  built in 1699, it was once the home of the famous diarist, lady mary wortley montagu, and today it is renowned for its excellent food, luxurious accommodation and boutique spa.
middlethorpe hall is one of the three historic house hotels of the national trust. for an overview of the three hotels, you can download our group brochure here.
