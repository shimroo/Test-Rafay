how we’re making it happen


promoting sound, science-based, environmental policies.
we’re encouraging state laws, regulations, and programs that support and improve water allocation, watershed planning, and river protection.


protecting stream flow
to keep water in rivers, we’re advocating for better water allocation policies and compliance with the state’s existing stream flow standards and regulations.


restoring water quality
approximately 24% of the state’s wadeable streams fail to meet water quality standards. we’re working with our members and partner organizations to restore water quality through better permitting and enforcement of stormwater regulations.


championing investment in the environment
we’re working for state investment in greener water infrastructure and other programs that improve and restore rivers.


forging diverse partnerships
we’re working with our members, other environmental groups, and partners in government, industry, and academia to achieve our goals.


educating the public
we conduct educational programs and provide resources to the public to improve understanding and appreciation for our water resources and facilitate waterway preservation and restoration.













“like the arteries in our bodies, our rivers must be kept clean and healthy in order for us to live healthy lives in a clean environment.”
