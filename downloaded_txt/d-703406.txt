our mission 











by god’s grace, we are called to be a caring, healing and welcoming community who proclaim and celebrate the love of jesus christ, live as god’s servants and seek justice for all people.  



welcome statement 











we believe that the gospel is god’s gift to all people, to be shared unconditionally, without regard to age, race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, family configuration or relationship status, socio-economic status, mental health status, or physical or mental abilities. we know that the world is often an unloving place and that the experience of alienation is all too common. to those who have felt excluded here or elsewhere, we extend a particular welcome in christ’s love. we rejoice that diversity has enriched, nurtured and challenged the life and ministry we share as members of the body of christ and workers in the kingdom of god.
