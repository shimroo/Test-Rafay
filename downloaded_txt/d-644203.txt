serving people. saving pets.

winnebago county animal services is a department of winnebago county government covering more than 500 square miles and serving the more than 280,000 residents who call winnebago county home. we provide a number of services including pet licensing and registration, veterinary care to animals in need, animal welfare and cruelty investigations, pet adoptions, and more.  
the animal services department cares for an average of 4,000 animals each year, serves all municipalities, and is the only government run animal services/animal sheltering organization in the county.  we work to find homes for pets not reclaimed by their owners. if you are considering adoption we encourage you to view our adoptable pet listings, which are automatically updated every few minutes throughout the day.  if you don’t find the pet you’re looking for at animal services, also consider visiting other nonprofit shelters and rescues in the community.

 5   of   the   30   long   stay   dogs   have   been   adopted   so   far!   we   have   25   lonely   hearts   looking   for   a   family   of   their   own!
