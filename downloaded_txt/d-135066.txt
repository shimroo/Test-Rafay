accessible, inclusive subtitled/captioned shows enable film fans with hearing loss to enjoy rather than endure cinema. for a few hours, the disabling barrier is removed. they  provide social benefits such as equality, inclusion and community integration. in 2023, yourlocalcinema promoted 80,000+ captioned english-language screenings of 400+ films, across almost all uk/ire cinemas.  there were more than one million admissions to captioned shows!
