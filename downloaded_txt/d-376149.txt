our stories  

i joined the uu church, rockford, in 1982 after the birth of my daughter, erin.  my first visit was prompted by learning that i was 20 weeks pregnant, and facing raising my child as a single mother.

― teresa wilmot
 

brian and i were looking for a new church after having been on the church councils of two churches. we brainstormed our needs and wants in a new congregation…

― judy gustafson
 

time was closing in on my husband roger and i. rog’s parents, my folks, and many other family and friends were arriving for the baptism of our baby, quinn.

― barb oehlke
