on friday 8/14 john waited for me as my allegiant flight was very late, and took me to surprise my daughter/granddaughter at animal kingdom villas. i just wanted to say how wonderful my trip with him was and how safe i felt. i was very nervous traveling alone especially coming in at night, but there he was waiting at the bottom of the escalator, and when i saw him i knew i was going to be "ok". oh, and by the way, my daughter was so surprised and happy. she actually cried. thanks again.
