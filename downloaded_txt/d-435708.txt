testimonials
















"it was 2005 when i first had the pleasure of teaming up with central management, inc. “cmi,” and i cannot say enough good things about our partnership.
i am the owner and selected cmi to provide full-service commercial real estate services for holly view apartments in houston, texas. victor vacek and team listened to our business plan to completely renovate and improve the value of our asset. the property was in distress but with cmi’s professional and extensive experience, commitment to excellence, as well as consistent determination, the property has been renovated and is extremely successful.  
for any investor seeking to maximize profits, i highly recommend central management, inc. cmi is committed to professionalism, financial responsibility, reliability, and integrity. i have complete trust in cmi to manage my assets. (note: i reside in california.)"
