nutrition facts for healthy living
one of the main components of living a healthy lifestyle is proper nutrition. by eating a balanced diet you ensure that your body is receiving all the nutrients it needs to stay active, healthy, and strong.
a nutrient-rich diet should include plenty of fruits and vegetables. incorporating more plants into daily meals reduces the risk of illnesses and increases your intake of essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber.
along with plants, getting enough protein is crucial. protein provides energy, supports cognitive function, and helps the body repair cells and make new ones. fish, poultry, nuts, and plain low-fat yogurt are good sources of protein.
starchy carbohydrates are another important nutrient. they help you feel full for longer by slowly releasing energy throughout the day. whenever possible, choose high-fiber or whole-grain carbohydrates, such as brown rice or whole wheat pasta.
fats
fat is an essential macronutrient that provides energy and helps the body absorb vitamins. it’s critical, however, to pay attention to the types of fat you are consuming.
unhealthy fats, such as saturated and trans fats, can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke. they are typically found in butter, fatty meats, palm oil, fast food, and highly processed foods.
“heart-healthy” fats (i.e. monounsaturated and polyunsaturated) can improve blood cholesterol levels, stabilize heart rhythms, and decrease inflammation. healthy fats can be found in vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, fish, tofu, and soybeans.
in the healthy eating section, find information and advice on nutrition and diet. in addition, access penn state extension’s 'lets cook' workshops to discover creative recipes and culinary skills.
living with a chronic disease
being diagnosed with a chronic disease can be frightening, but learning how to cope with the daily challenges of living with your condition can make a world of difference.
part of the treatment for many chronic illnesses requires making lifestyle changes such as increasing physical activity and eating healthy. switching to healthier habits can help individuals maintain a good quality of life.
if you’ve been diagnosed with type-2 diabetes, penn state extension’s dining with diabetes online course can help you learn more about diabetes management and dietary strategies.
preventative care
while environment and family history influence the risk of developing certain illnesses – such as cancer and alzheimer's – your everyday choices can make a difference. smoking, lack of exercise, consuming processed foods, and overexposure to uv light are all risk factors for cancer.
although rare, nutrition-related diseases should not be overlooked either. conditions such as gout and scurvy are easily preventable by eating a nutritious diet that includes iodine, vitamins d and c, and anti-inflammatory foods.
to learn more about preventing and coping with life-long conditions, have a look at the chronic diseases section.
active living
getting enough physical exercise each day promotes happiness, better sleep, and a sense of accomplishment. what’s more, exercise can help the brain and body to improve mental health and self-esteem.
if you are trying to increase physical activity – and keep with it – remember to start slow and set realistic goals. consider walking, jogging, as well as strength and aerobic training.
inactive to moderately active adults can take advantage of penn state extension’s lift program. lift offers group strength-training sessions specially designed for people aged 40+. the program helps participants improve their well-being and reduce their risk of diabetes, osteoporosis, and heart disease.
