comb first!
why comb? combing benefits
“because it’s not about lice, it’s about kids.”

combing is a safer, more effective head lice solution! “diagnosis of louse infestation using a louse comb is four times more efficient than direct visual examination and twice as fast.”
thanks to the licemeister® comb (you can order one here), parents can screen their children regularly at home!


what to do about head liceparents naturally put their children first, constantly seeking information to keep their families nurtured and safe. but when it comes to head lice, they’re often confronted with conflicting guidance and misinformation—leading them to make potentially risky and ineffective treatment decisions. among the hazards are serious health effects from repeated exposure to various pesticide remedies, treatment failures, lice resistance, and chronic infestations that make parents and children feel desperate and overwhelmed. the npa advises parents to comb first, to discontinue the use of any treatment at the earliest sign of failure, and to avoid using other chemicals. manual removal of head lice with a comb is the best option whenever possible.

about licemeister® comb
the npa developed the licemeister® comb in 1997 to accomplish its mission by providing a higher standard for lice combing tools and a safe, cost-effective treatment alternative to pesticides. all proceeds from sales of the licemeister comb allow the npa to be self-sustaining and independent from product manufacturers while accomplishing its mission of protecting children from the misuse and abuse of pesticide treatments for lice.

since 1997, the licemeister comb has been the preferred choice of many health professionals and the gold standard in combing tools for lice and nits (lice eggs). it is an fda cleared medical device (510k) for the purposes of routine screening, early detection and removal of lice and nits, and it is the only comb to carry the name of the national pediculosis association.
