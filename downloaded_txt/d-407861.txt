california family law
california divorce proceedings
the process of divorce in california is known as a "marital dissolution." dissolution of marriage is one of three ways to terminate a marriage in california. another way to terminate a marriage is by an annulment. the parties to a marital dissolution action are the "petitioner" and the "respondent." the petitioner is the spouse who files the petition for dissolution. the "respondent" spouse must be served a copy of the petition along with other documents. generally, the respondent has 30 days to respond to the petition.
a marital dissolution proceeding will ultimately result in a "judgment"" entered by the court. the judgment sets forth orders which resolve the issue of your case. usually, issues in the judgement include child custody, visitation, support, and division of assets and debts. a judgment can be obtained by "default" if the "respondent" after service does not respond to the petition. the spouses may also decide to agree to the contents of the judgment. if no agreement is reached, the issues will be decided by the court after a trial.
in california, a judgment for dissolution of marriage can not be entered until six months and one day from the earlier of when the respondent was either served or filed a response to the petition.

child custody and visitation
the courts may intervene if the parents in a divorce or paternity action are unable to agree upon the upbringing of a child. in california, such an action is designated as dealing with custody and visitation. increasingly, this type of action is referred to as developing a "parenting plan". traditional preferences for paternal or maternal custody for children of particular ages have largely been eliminated. the law assumes that the mother and father are potentially equally capable of providing for the needs of the child.

                                            the firm practices in all california state courts, including los angeles, chatsworth, pasadena, lancaster, santa monica, van nuys, torrance, long beach, and pomona. the firm's attorneys provide intelligent and aggressive enforcement of your legal rights. 
                                        














family law


family law is the branch of law that deals with many of the issues relating to families, including divorce, paternity, and domestic partnership cases. each of these cases is as individual and unique as the people who have come to the court. however, the court may not be aware of the important and legally significant facts that each judge must have in order to make a fair decision regarding the specific issues relating to the parties in each case. 













divorce law


going through a divorce can be one of the most stressful times in a personâs life. the choice to seek marital dissolution can be a difficult decision, especially when children are involved. the los angeles divorce lawyers at fierro law hope to make it easier for you and your children. we represent clients in both contested and uncontested divorce. at fierro law our family law attorneys in los angeles listen to you and answer all of your questions.











child custody


a los angeles child custody lawyer can help determine if specific factors will have a role in determining child custody in the state of california.  children have the right to enjoy time with both parents, provided they are safe and cared for in the appropriate manner. many aspects of your childâs care are up for negotiation during the divorce process, and when it comes to custody the issues fall into two broad categories of legal custody and physical custody.











child support


the lawmakers in california believe that every child has the right to be financially supported by both parents if at all possible. child custody, support, and visitation issues are often the core of the divorce litigation and settlement. an experienced los angeles child support attorney can assist you in making sense of the confusion that goes along with child support guidelines, financial affidavits, income withholding orders and more.











paternity


while the identity of a child's biological mother is usually known, the father's identity may not always be as certain. legal matters relating to paternity testing, child custody and visitation rights for fathers are often emotional and contentious. whether you need help legally compelling a person to take a dna test or want to reverse a voluntary declaration of paternity you signed, it's important to choose an attorney with whom you feel comfortable.











domestic partnerships


same-sex couples can register as domestic partners and receive rights such as hospital visitation privileges. a domestic partnership in california is a legal relationship available to same-sex couples and to certain opposite-sex couples. it affords the couple âthe same rights, protections, and benefits, andâ¦the same responsibilities, obligations, and duties under lawâ¦â as married spouses. call if with any legal questions or concerns.











prenuptial agreements


california is a community property state, which means that in the event of a divorce, all marital property is subjected to asset division. a prenuptial agreement may not be something you and your soon to be spouse want to think about, but it is an important and helpful legal tool that can provide you both peace of mind and assurance. a prenuptial agreement can offer stability and protection of your assets should divorce or death occur. 











alimony & spousal support


the court may order monthly payments by one spouse to support the other spouse pending a divorce or legal separation. formerly referred to as alimony, spousal support may continue after the conclusion of the divorce, depending on factors outlined in section 4320 of the california family code. spousal support is awarded in addition to any child support.
