we had a great time on a long weekend to new york city. we stayed at the hotel beacon on the upper west side. a fantastic hotel located conveniently near many restaurants, museums and of course central park.
										the small hotel ambiance was excellent. the room was quite nice and very, very comfortable. this place is definitely on my list for a return stay!

location - upper west side - close to the 72nd st subway, close to a number of supermarkets - fairways, west side markets, 2 blocks to central park one way and 2 blocks to the hudson river bikeway the other
										way. rooms - always clean and have everything you need. we stayed for 22 nights and couldn't be happier with our choice. we will be back hopefully sooner rather than later.

our first time in ny, hotel was recommended by our travel agent in australia. i am glad we picked the hotel beacon, with the in room kitchenette and the market across the street it was good to be able to
										prepare food after a long day on the go. the subway is only 2 blocks away and the hop on hop off bus a short walk to central park. the staff are extremely helpful.
