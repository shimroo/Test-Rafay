spirit - kitchen - garden


































experience authentic northern italian cuisine without having to leave the east village. gnocco is a casual restaurant that specializes in authentic italian food made with fresh and imported ingredients, complemented by an extensive italian wine list, selection of italian beer, and a full bar. named for the fried dough puffs sold with prosciutto and salami on the streets of modena, gnocco strives for italian authenticity.



we pay extra attention to the ingredients that helps gnocco shine overall. for example, we only use the best tuscan olive oil for all cooking purposes and import as many dop ingredients (denominazione di origine protetta -- protected name of origin) as possible, ensuring that your meal will meet the high standards of quality that has been set.
