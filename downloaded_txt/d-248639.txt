when you put together top quality products with top quality customer service, you get rcc turbos. i've been working with richard and his team at rcc for a number of years now for my pro street hayabusa and i keep going back. the large amount of r&d that they have invested in their products shows for itself with the high quality of systems that are built, how they perform, and how reliable they are. rcc also provides excellent customer service, ensuring that all of your questions are answered, will work with you for custom requests, and will only recommend what you 'need' and not try to sell you something you dont need. rcc turbos is the benchmark for motorcycle aftermarket performance and continues to push boundaries for what can be done.

i've been a customer of richard's (rcc turbos) for 8 years , i've bought a complete turbo system , intercooler system , up grades and many more products . the reason i keep buying products from richard is because he makes the best products on the market and he backs up his work . richard is always there to help if their is a question , when richard is building a system he does it wright the first time and its always of high quality . i have always been very satisfied with his work .

rcc turbos has been part of my race program since my first turbo kit in 2003. ive had the pleasure of owning a stage 1, stage 2, and two ultra kits. richard and team has always been the very best. from awesome record setting turbo kits, to a simple miscellaneous item, to great tech support. they've been a huge part of all the personal best and success that i've experienced throughout my racing career. could've not done it without you guys. keep up the great work!
