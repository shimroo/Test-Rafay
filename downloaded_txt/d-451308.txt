              lots of diplomats



welcome to farley's page, the internet's largest and oldest still-active resource for information regarding the dodge
diplomat and its mopar siblings the plymouth gran fury and chrysler fifth avenue (the “m” bodies). this site was originally a shrine of sorts to my
own diplomat, a 1979 four door sedan named farley. it
              is safe to say that farley is now the world's most famous dodge
              diplomat. please enjoy your visit, and thanks for stopping
              in!                 —  frank
