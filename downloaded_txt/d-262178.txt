thanks to your support, marl has placed over 62,000 animals in loving homes





welcome to
mississippi animal rescue league
marl is an “open admission” shelter- that means we accept every animal that comes in the door. other shelters in the area are "limited admission", meaning they accept a limited, finite number of animals. in our state, it is primarily left to private organizations and city animal control agencies to provide shelter and care for unwanted animals. read more about marl








50 + years
chartered in 1969, we are the largest full service animal welfare organization in central mississippi providing care and basic medical services for thousands of homeless and unwanted animals each year.

pet care
most pets and people are born with a healthy body. their bodies begin with extra capacity to make up for the wear and tear of time. some systems slow down while others lose their “fine tuning”.

adopt a pet
our mission at marl is to find loving, forever homes for our animals where the pet is a member of the family.
to us, the animal comes first.
