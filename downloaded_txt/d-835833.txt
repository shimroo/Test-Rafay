"i support the embdc because the work it does to market our community is necessary for our region's success, and that work must continue. economic development is a numbers game.
meridian is competing with similar-sized cities within mississippi and in the broader south. many cities just like meridian have much larger economic development organizations with staff dedicated to the research and marketing necessary to tip the numbers game in their favor. we need to support the embdc to make sure we are stacking the odds in our favor for a win."
