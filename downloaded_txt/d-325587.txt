    about the work

my work embodies an interest in mythological imagery, symbolism, and philosophies from historic and ancient cultures. i love to travel and i am intensely interested in ancient civilizations, symbols of ritual art, ancient myths and how they connect us, most deeply, with our own nature and our place in this world.

  about the process

the casting process is intense and involves ladling the molten glass directly from the furnace at 2300° f. timing, temperature and the casting team all have to work together with absolute accuracy to create each piece. gott frequently works with a rigid sand mold technique, for it allows detail and the ability to work on a large scale.
