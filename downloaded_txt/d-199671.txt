villa la massa, a stay to experience

built in the 13th century as an enchanting country house for an aristocratic florentine family, villa la massa was owned by european aristocrats until 1948, before it was transformed into a luxury hotel. after a complete renovation, it reopened and its hundred-year-old history lives on, with every nook telling us tales of renaissance splendor and the lifestyle of florentine aristocrats. a proud member of the leading hotels of the world, villa la massa has been part of villa d’este hotels since 1998.
