celebrating our 70th anniversary





lab-metal ready-to-use repair and patching compound. aluminum-filled dent filler for thousands of repairs. "spreads like paste, hardens into metal", simply by exposure to air.Â 
lab-metal fills dents and flaws in metal and nonmetal parts easily and economically. apply lab-metal right from the can with a putty knife or similar tool. no two-component mixing or measuring is necessary, therefore there is no waste. heat, special tools and specialized skill are unnecessary. 
lab-metal adheres to any clean and dry metal, wood, glass, plaster, porcelain and hard plastic surface. its strong bond withstands vibration and other difficult conditions. lab-metal hardens quickly without heat, providing a durable metal surface.

application tip: lab-metal and hi-temp lab-metal harden upon exposure to air, thus the user may need to keep the applicator wet with lab-solvent in order to aid in smoothing the application (and reduce "pulling"). 









new - lab-metal "450"





similar properties to lab-metal but will air dry and withstand 450f without the need for "heat curing" unless sanding is required.
