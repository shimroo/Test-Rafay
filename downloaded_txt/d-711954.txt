"we don't just sell filtration,we sell iso codes."



























“we are very pleased with the performance of the filtroil units in use. we have five of them in use, and iso codes dropped almost immediately upon installation. we have some oil that is five years old still in use at our facility because of the filtroil units. very pleased!!”

— jason brinkley, maintenance planner, ashgrove cement, cement plant
