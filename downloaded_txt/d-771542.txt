tube talk on hiatus



photo: parker donovan billerby jennifer squires billerhello, tubers. long time, no talk.to say it’s been slow here for the past year is like saying grey’s anatomy has no behind-the-scenes drama. (have you heard the latest about eric dane’s naughty video? tsk. tsk.)i’m sorry i haven’t blogged much during the past year, but as some of you know my personal life has taken a dramatic turn that has left me with little time to watch television, let alone write about it.my days are now spent changing diapers, singing songs, dancing silly, reading stories, building forts, chasing bubbles, exploring the outdoors and, well, smooching the most adorable blue-eyed blonde since brad pitt. (see the above photo for evidence.)i’ve tried to keep tube talk up and running, thinking that tomorrow i’ll have time to write a witty column or review one of the new fall shows. but sadly, when tomorrow comes, that time never becomes a reality. so, i’ve decided to put tube talk on hiatus until my little one gets a bit older, and i will actually have time to watch and discuss television again.during tube talk’s most fruitful years, i spent 8-10 hours per day reviewing shows, doing interviews and research, and writing. i simply don’t have that kind of time anymore, or frankly, passion for the genre, considering how disappointing television has become. i pray this fall we’ll see a new freaks and geeks, felicity, the west wing, friends, or seinfeld, but i’m not holding my breath.i’d like to thank all of my loyal readers who have supported me since the days this column was in print at the exponent telegram newspaper for 20,000 readers. tube talk was born out of my love for television and grew to be one of the web’s most popular tv sites, with readers in more than 50 countries all over the world. i just checked my sitemeter this morning, and people were reading tube talk in austria, france, spain, germany, mexico, canada, the united kingdom, colombia, ireland, saudi arabia, italy, turkey, portugal and more. it still amazes me after all these years. the power of the internet is incredible. tube talk was named one of the web’s best tv blogs, next to tv guide, e!online and zap2it, and is a proud member of the tv blog coalition, a pretty cool accomplishment, considering at the time i had a staff of one - me. (don’t cue the orchestra yet, please, i have a few more folks to thank.)first, a big thank you to my dedicated columnist ashley gouveia, who has loyally written commentary with a co-ed every friday for the past couple years, and literally kept the site alive when i was deathly ill during my pregnancy. next, but certainly not second in any field, is my good friend radio host jack logar, at wwlw 106.5. jack, thank you for making me laugh each tuesday, when we do our morning-show segment about the latest news in the world of television. you’ll never know how much i appreciate you for being a fellow “geek,“ for your encouragement through the years, and for your impressive sat vocabulary skills. (although, you’re still the whitest man i’ve ever met, literally. but you’ve got great hair to go with that albino complexion, so don‘t sweat it.) also, i’d like to thank becky and bethany, who provided some great american idol commentary through the years here at tube talk, and believe it or not, actually got me to watch reality tv for a few hours one year.finally, thank you to all the networks that have worked with me through the years by sending screeners, arranging interviews with the stars, and running contests for me here at tube talk. fox, nbc, usa, fx, cw and tnt were especially kind to me when i first started out and did not discriminate because i was a blogger. and thank you to the celebrities who have given me a few minutes of their time to chat. my favorite interviews have been with the scrubs crew zach braff and bill lawrence and the psych boys james roday and dule hill, as well as john schneider and kelly carlson. thank you all.as for this fall’s tv crop, i’m excited to see glee, the new v, cougartown, and vampire diaries, and i may check out melrose place just for curiosity’s sake. if i find something i can’t live without on my dvr, don’t worry, i’ll pop on here and tell you all about it. thanks again, tubers. hopefully, we’ll talk again soon.

commentary with a co-ed: new fall shows



photo: the vampire diaries, cwby ashley gouveiathe new television season is just weeks away and there are so many new shows that are going to be creeping into our primetime lineup. but which ones are worth our tivo space? i think i have chosen a few picks that have the possibility and potential to be my new favorites.flashforward (abc): when i saw the promo for this new abc drama, i thought it had some slight undertones of lost. the premise is that the entire population blacks out for two minutes and 17 seconds. during that blackout they have visions of their lives six months in the future. the show centers on a group of people who share these visions and try to discover why this happened. this show has the potential to drive me nuts with all the questions that are sure to pop up on the characters’ quest to discover the truth. but it also could be an intriguing hour of television that keeps you guessing, in a fun way.eastwick (abc): something totally different than my first choice but still on my list of shows that i’m willing to give a try. it’s about three women who discover that they have magical powers. no, it’s not a charmed reboot. this series actually looks more light and whimsical and has some sex and the city similarities. it stars rebecca romijn as one of the magical women. i think this will be a fun series that you can enjoy, without having to think too much about it. i’m curious to see if the viewing audience will get enchanted by this newbie.three rivers (cbs): i am not a fan of medical dramas at all. but alex o’loughlin is the reason why i’m going to check this one out. the new drama centers around these doctors that perform organ transplants. i’m all for watching a new show with alex in it. after moonlight’s untimely demise, his reappearance on my tv is a long time coming. bring the tissues, folks. it looks like every week is going to be a tearjerker.vampire diaries (the cw): there are two main reasons why i’m going to give this show a shot: one, i love vampire stories, two, ian somerhalder. he could make me watch anything. i think the premise and look of the overall series reminds me of my old favorite roswell. if this show is half as good as that, then it’s in good shape. it’s all going to rely upon the chemistry of the actors themselves. if it’s not there, then i fear many will tune out. but i think it has a good chance to be a cw hit.what new show are you excited for? let me know in the comments.commentary with a co-ed is a weekly column at tube talk new every friday.

commentary with a co-ed: big brother thoughts



by ashley gouveiading dong! the rat is gone!yes, i am talking about big brother. it is still my summer guilty pleasure, as all you long time tubers might remember. each summer i get hooked on this show for no other reason other than it’s just mindless entertainment, as is much of reality television.all the bb fans out there know that thursday nights are eviction nights. one houseguest gets the boot out the door but not without some drama. ronnie, the video-game geek, was up for nomination, along with lydia, the tattooed, offbeat makeup artist. i was so glad that ronnie was finally put up on the chopping block. out of all the seasons i have watched of big brother, (which are a lot, don’t judge), he is one of the most annoying contestants ever.his final plea speech last night just proved everything that i thought about him. he called out michelle for being a “horrible human being,” but then frequently repeated that it’s just a game. huh? first, i don’t think that michelle is the best player that has ever walked through that door, but she doesn’t deserve to be attacked like that. i haven’t seen any evidence to back up ronnie’s cruel claim. if i were ronnie i would be ashamed at how he handled himself last night.a lot of what he said last night made no sense. he was upset with michelle because she was out for herself and had no loyalties to anyone. um, hello! that is what it all boils down to in the end. nobody in that house has any loyalties to anyone. when it comes down to it, they are all in it for themselves. if ronnie thought that jessie and natalie were actually going to stick by him until the end then i think he was fooling himself.he’s finally out the door and we don’t have to worry about him being on the jury either. so i am extremely happy with the eviction results. goodbye ronnie!i’m thrilled that america gave jeff the power of coup d’etat, although i laughed when he couldn’t pronounce the word correctly. jeff and jordan are my favorites this season, so i’m hoping that their showmance goes on and they stick together as long as possible.chima was crowned the new head of household. the only person that could have been worse would have been natalie. since chima and russell, the former hoh, had a massive blowout a few nights back,  i’m thinking he’s going up. but you never know, he just might be able to save himself.who do you think chima will nominate? are you happy that ronnie is out of the game. sound off in the comments.commentary with a co-ed is a weekly column at tube talk new every friday.

emmys nominations 2009: well done!



 photo: emmy nominee simon baker of the cbs drama "the mentalist" by jennifer squires billerif you haven’t heard, the emmy nominations were announced on thursday.we have to wait until september 20 to see who takes home the naked statues known as emmys and who shows up with their mother as their date, but meanwhile, here’s a look at the nominees.overall, i’m quite pleased with this year’s list. (no, i haven’t been drinking.) it seems emmy voters may finally be getting that there is more to television than hbo.i’m absolutely over-the-moon that pushing daisies’ kristin chenoweth, how i met your mother’s neil patrick harris, and the mentalist’s simon baker scored nominations. also, a great big high five for boston legal - which delivered some emmy-worthy television in its final episodes - and for vanessa williams, who is always downright delicious playing a devilish diva on ugly betty. and i’m hoping that this is the year chandra wilson gets her well-deserved emmy for her work on grey’s anatomy.oh sure, there were several snubs, but not like we usually see. most notably, where was josh holloway of lost? he has done excellent work and should be recognized. also, there is no excuse for the complete shut out of friday night lights. it’s one of the best dramas on tv! just as disappointing, was the lack of love for psych and its stars. dule hill and james roday make me laugh out loud every week.that’s my opinion. what do you think of this year’s nominees?best series, drama'big love''breaking bad''damages''dexter''house''lost''mad men'best series, comedy'30 rock''entourage''family guy''flight of the conchords''how i met your mother''the office''weeds'best actor, dramabryan cranston 'breaking bad'michael c. hall 'dexter'hugh laurie 'house'gabriel byrne 'in treatment'jon hamm 'mad men'simon baker 'the mentalist'best actor, comedyalec baldwin '30 rock'tony shalhoub 'monk'jim parsons 'the big bang theory'steve carell 'the office'charlie sheen 'two and a half men'jemaine clement 'flight of the conchords'best actress, dramasally field 'brothers & sisters'glenn close 'damages'mariska hargitay 'law & order: special victims unit'holly hunter 'saving grace'kyra sedgwick 'the closer'elisabeth moss 'mad men'best actress, comedytina fey '30 rock'christina applegate 'samantha who?'julia louis-dreyfus 'the new adventures of old christine'sarah silverman 'the sarah silverman program'mary-louise parker 'weeds'toni collette 'united states of tara'best supporting actor, drama serieswilliam shatner 'boston legal'christian clemenson 'boston legal'aaron paul 'breaking bad'michael emerson 'lost'john slattery 'mad men'william hurt 'damages'best supporting actress, drama seriesrose byrne 'damages'hope davis 'in treatment'chandra wilson 'grey's anatomy'sandra oh 'grey's anatomy'dianne wiest 'in treatment'cherry jones '24'best supporting actor, comedy serieskevin dillon 'entourage'tracy morgan '30 rock'neil patrick harris 'how i met your mother'rainn wilson 'the office'jon cryer 'two and a half men'jack mcbrayer '30 rock'best supporting actress, comedy serieskristin chenoweth 'pushing daisies'kristen wiig 'saturday night live'amy poehler 'saturday night live'jane krakowski '30 rock'vanessa williams 'ugly betty'elizabeth perkins 'weeds'best reality-competition program'american idol''dancing with the stars''project runway''the amazing race''top chef'best host for a reality or reality-competition programryan seacrest 'american idol'tom bergeron 'dancing with the stars'phil keoghan 'the amazing race'heidi klum 'project runway'jeff probst 'survivor'padma lakshmi and tom colicchio 'top chef'best variety, music or comedy series'late show with david letterman''real time with bill maher''saturday night live''the colbert report''the daily show with jon stewart'best guest actor in a drama seriesedward asner 'csi: ny'ted danson 'damages'jimmy smits 'dexter'ernest borgnine 'er'michael j. fox 'rescue me'best guest actress in a drama seriessharon lawrence 'grey's anatomy'ellen burstyn 'law & order: special victims unit'brenda blethyn 'law & order: special victims unit'carol burnett 'law & order: special victims unit'cch pounder 'the no. 1 ladies' detective agency'best guest actor in a comedy seriesbeau bridges 'desperate housewives'justin timberlake 'saturday night live'steve martin '30 rock'jon hamm '30 rock'alan alda '30 rock'best guest actress in a comedy serieschristine baranski 'the big bang theory'gena rowlands 'monk'betty white 'my name is earl'tina fey 'saturday night live'jennifer aniston '30 rock'elaine stritch '30 rock'best miniseries'generation kill''little dorritt'best lead actor, miniseries or moviekevin kline 'cyrano de bergerac'brendan gleeson 'into the storm'sir ian mckellen 'king lear'kevin bacon 'taking chance'kiefer sutherland '24: redemption'kenneth branagh 'wallander: one step behind'best lead actress, miniseries or moviechandra wilson 'accidental friendship'shirley maclaine 'coco chanel'drew barrymore 'grey gardens'jessica lange 'grey gardens'sigourney weaver 'prayers for bobby'

commentary with a co-ed: legend of the seeker review



by ashley gouveiathis week i had to let every tube talk reader know about a show that i’m currently obsessed with. it has already finished airing its first season but i am just now getting into it. it’s called legend of the seeker, and it’s awesome!the very cute craig horner, who looks like a younger version of nathan fillion, plays richard cypher. he discovers that he is the seeker, the man destined to kill the evil darken rahl and save the world. no pressure, right?on his journey he is accompanied by a wizard named zed and a woman named kahlan. she is what they call a confessor; she knows when people are lying and has the ability to make any person do what she wants. that’s certainly a nifty power, but not so great if you’re in love with the seeker.the love story between richard and kahlan is what makes the show for me. craig horner and bridget regan have off-the-charts chemistry that could be compared to the likes of buffy and angel from buffy the vampire slayer. that’s something you can’t fake, and they have it. the whole “star-crossed lovers” thing is definitely present in their relationship. as a viewer you just get wrapped up in their story and just want to see if they’ll ever end up together.the series is made by the same man who created the hercules and xena shows. i was also a big fan of those two series, so i was excited to watch this one. if you’re also a fan of those two throughout legend of the seeker you will see some familiar faces from both shows, which is really cool.seriously, if you haven’t watched this show yet you must. you can watch the entire first season on hulu or check your local listings. i am halfway through the season and i can’t wait to see the rest.are you crazy about this show? let me know in the comments.commentary with a co-ed is a weekly column at tube talk new every friday.

neil patrick harris to host emmys



by jennifer squires billercall it the hosting trifecta. first, neil patrick harris made me laugh out loud hosting the tv land awards with his brilliant musical number and jokes. then, he moved on to make with the funny as host of the tony awards, garnering acclaim and the highest ratings for the show in three years. now, he’s scored the job of host of this year’s emmys. congrats, neil! i’m sure that the network was impressed with his tony performance, but i have to say that i’m partial to his job at the tv land awards. he killed in the musical number and his ongoing computer gag was hilarious. i’m sure the emmy folks already have this in mind, but i’m begging here, please let him do a musical number. harris can actually sing, and it would be a treat for all tv fans to see him poke fun at our favorite shows. nominations for the emmys will be announced thursday, and it’s likely (if i have my way) that harris will be up for an award for supporting actor in a comedy for his role as barney on the cbs sitcom how i met your mother. the 61st primetime emmys airs live at 8 pm/et on sept. 20. tune in, please. i think it will be, as barney says, “legendary.”

oscar nuñez shines in the proposal



by jennifer squires billermichael scott would be proud.the office’s oscar nuñez ,who plays “oscar” on the nbc comedy, is stealing the spotlight in the new sandra bullock film the proposal. nuñez scores the biggest laughs in the movie, a tough job considering one of his co-stars is betty white.nuñez’ character on the big screen, ramone, is the antithesis of oscar on the office. trust me, if you’re a fan of the office, you have to watch this movie. his antics are hilarious.yes, the movie is a typical romantic comedy, but nuñez, white, and a gorgeous ryan reynolds make it worth the ticket price. also, for all you guys out there, sandra bullock has a funny semi-nude scene. you’re welcome.you know i get excited when one of our weekly tv stars steals the spotlight on the big screen, so i had to share. another familiar tv face is also in the film: craig t. nelson, or “coach,” as you may know him.so, go check out “oscar” on the big screen. you can thank me later.

commentary with a co-ed reviews "10 things i hate about you"



by ashley gouveiawhen i first heard the abc family network was going to be airing a television adaptation of the movie “10 things i hate about you,” i was understandably weary. my thoughts on it were probably the same as many fans of the film, which was how could it ever measure up to the movie? for those of you who haven’t seen the movie…why? i have seen it more than a dozen times. it’s one of those movies that you grab off your dvd shelf whenever you want to watch a good old-fashioned chick flick. i like to think of it as my generation’s “pretty in pink.” what’s not to love? there’s cheesy teenage angst, laugh-out-loud moments and heath ledger in one of his first major roles. so on tuesday night, i decided to give the tv version a shot and see how it would compare to the movie. was i instantly hooked? or did it become more of a wait and see game? i knew it was going to be near impossible to sit through this show without noticing the changes that the show runners made. for one, the two sisters, kat and bianca, are new in town and are just starting padua high school. their mother didn’t walk out on them but died in some way that has yet to be revealed. kat, originally played by julia stiles, still has the brooding misunderstood vibe to her. glad to see that hasn’t changed. her younger sister bianca is still a naive social climber, but i found this version to be a little too perky. however, it was great to see the same actor from the film play their father. we got to see a glimpse of the character patrick verona, originally played by heath ledger, in the first five minutes. this version’s patrick, played by ethan peck, certainly has the mysterious thing down. all the staring could be considered creepy, like what kat thinks at first, but we all know that he isn’t the scary guy everybody at padua thinks he is. i do think that ethan peck is a little too abercrombie and fitch to ever be considered terrifying. heath ledger had a certain look that made you believe that he could have been one of the offbeat kids in high school. the most important element of this show is how good the chemistry between kat and patrick plays onscreen. it’s a bit early to tell, but i think all the actors need time to adjust to these roles. the character of cameron is way too nerdy for my taste. i don’t remember him being that much of a pushover. plus, joey donner is supposed to the epitome of a self absorbed womanizer, but he just seems to be a dim surfer dude who lets his bossy girlfriend chastity push him around. i was surprised to see how they made the role of chastity more of a lead, where as in the film she has a minor role. i guess they need a “villain” of sorts for the girls to be at odds with.all in all, it was a mediocre pilot. i’ll continue to watch and see where these characters go. i’m eager to see more patrick and kat scenes, and maybe cameron will grow a backbone in the meantime. the show will almost win me over if ethan peck’s patrick breaks out into his version of “can’t take my eyes off of you.” did you watch? what was your take on this remake? sound off in the comments.commentary with a co-ed is a weekly column at tube talk new every friday.

pushing daisies returned with a bang in its final episodes



by jennifer squires billerabc, you wound me.just when i’d made peace with the fact that some of my favorite shows from last season won’t return (eli stone, pushing daisies, etc.) you do the unthinkable. you air the first of the last few episodes of pushing daisies, and the entire episode is about olive and ned as a couple, a pairing i’d been rooting for since the show’s debut. sure, the engagement was only pretend for the sake of olive’s old pals, but i’ll take it. we even got a kiss, and at the very end ned admitted he was jealous of olive and her new guy. (gulp.) talk about a cliffhanger.were the pushing daisies people really going to pursue a potential olive/ned relationship this season? oh, abc, to be so cruel that you give and then take away. i’ve been preaching the olive/ned connection for months, and it seems that abc may have realized that kristin chenowith and lee pace have undeniable chemistry.the sad part is there are only a couple episodes left of the show, ever, as abc put a fork in it. perhaps if they’d jumped on the olive bandwagon a little earlier, then the show would have scored a little better ratings. or perhaps it wouldn’t have made a difference. but one thing is for sure: olive and ned, you will be missed.

commentary with a co-ed: friday night timeslot woes



by ashley gouveiathe television season is over and we are beginning to head into the land of seemingly never-ending reruns, but not before the networks announced their fall lineups. this begs the question, “just where exactly our favorite shows are headed?” it probably shocked a lot of you fellow tube watchers to find out that ugly betty and smallville are both being moved to friday nights. what were the networks thinking, and is this the kiss of death for these shows?i think we have all had one of our favorite shows move to another night. that usually means that the network is trying to find a better spot for the show. it could also mean that the networks believe the show is on its last season and want to finish it off on whatever night is available. but a move to friday nights is a sign of worry, more than any other night. why is friday a bad move? well, the majority of the demographic that primarily watches these two shows is not home on friday nights. the other bad thing about it is that even if the fans decide to record it, there is no way to show those numbers in the overall ratings. do the networks even look at the tivo numbers?it’s a known fact that many shows that move to fridays or premiere on that night don’t last too long. remember the amazing moonlight? or more recently, terminator: the sarah connor chronicles. i was holding out hope that terminator would not be cancelled but i knew that moving it to fridays would not be a positive thing for the show. i know that ghost whisperer thrives on friday nights, but that may be because it’s targeted for an older audience.even though i thoroughly enjoyed this past season of ugly betty, many thought that it lost some of its original charm. the ratings and the critical acclaim did suffer so is that why abc decided to move it to its new time slot? do they believe that ugly betty only has one more season left in them? i don’t think that’s true. i saw a lot of this show’s magic return in the season finale. if they fix some minor things, then betty and co. could live to see another season.smallville on the other hand is an entirely different story. this show has been on for eight seasons and many feel that it has worn out its welcome. it would seem that the cw would agree since they moved smallville to friday nights before an encore, (yep, encore), of america’s next top model. ouch! that move really doesn’t display much confidence from the network.do you agree that moving to fridays is a bad sign for any show? will you still watch ugly betty and smallville at their new times?

dancing with the stars: gilles marini was robbed



no offense to adorable and talented shawn johnson, but gilles marini should have gone home with the mirror ball trophy this week on dancing with the stars. marini was, hands down, the best dancer of the entire crop of celebrities each week. his performances were entertaining, sexy and passionate.i guess i have to remember that this competition isn’t about the best dancer though. it’s about popularity. otherwise, one of my favorite celebrities of the batch, ty murray, would have gone home weeks ago.johnson did an excellent job each week, especially considering her youth and the maturity that some of the dances required. kudos to johnson for her fighting spirit and technique, but i still preferred marini’s routines each time, and so did the judges. so, i’m perplexed at how johnson upset the leading scorer, marini, to take home the trophy. it must have been the fans. she had a fan base from her olympic gymnastics career that apparently gave her the popularity vote.this isn’t the first time the best dancer hasn’t won the competition. remember mario lopez? he didn’t win, despite being the best dancing celebrity we’d ever seen at that time. instead, mr. personality emmitt smith took home the trophy.congratulations to johnson and her partner mark ballas and to marini and his partner cheryl burke for making it to the final. but, i want to give a special thanks to ty murray for giving us such an entertaining season. since it’s a popularity contest, i almost wish he could have won, simply so we could have heard his final speech. if the bull-riding thing doesn’t work out, i think he has a career as a stand-up comic.
