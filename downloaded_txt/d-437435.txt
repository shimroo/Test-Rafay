medicare




making sense of it all

from enrollment deadlines, coverage gaps and choices in medicare plans, we can help you better understand medicare, how it works and how to make the most of it. for retiring employees and even for the ‘sandwich generation’ caring for their elderly parents, we break medicare down so you can understand the options. as medicare plan experts, carecounsel offers the specialized knowledge employers and employees need to get the most out of medicare.
do you have employees approaching retirement or are you in need of help learning about medicare?
