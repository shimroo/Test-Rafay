        this site is dedicated to those men and women who fell fighting for their 
        country. recorded here are various war memorials within a variety of counties, 
        it is fully intended to complete as many war memorials in the united kingdom 
        as possible. a war memorial is a building, monument, statue, plaque or 
        other edifice to celebrate a war or victory, or (predominating in modern 
        times) to commemorate those who died or were injured in a war. the counties 
        and the war memorials completed for each are listed on 
        a separate page. photographs have been taken of the majority 
        of the memorials, details of the men included and their photographs where 
        possible. all counties are based on the pre-1974 reorganisation of the 
        political divisions in the united kingdom. the main sections have a 
        menu at the top of the page of sections that are available, these 
        are on drop down lists. a site map has been 
        provided as well.


        currently we have a huge backlog of memorials to be put on-line and edits 
        to existing memorials ranging from the year 2016 to present; this totals 
        around 3,500 emails. this is a voluntarily run website, one person owns 
        and maintains this site with a few volunteers researching and transcribing 
        memorials. although we do try to reply to emails the volume is such that 
        we cannot guarantee a response, sorry but there is a huge amount of emails 
        coming in and it is just not possible. 
        
 





the 
        war memorials and rolls of honour cover a variety of regiments, 
        airfields and air bases as 
        well as the memorials and cemeteries in the countries 
        overseas where the men fell.
much 
        of the information has been found using the commonwealth 
        war graves commission site. to supplement this information the soldiers 
        died in the great war cd's and the roll of honour books all available 
        from naval 
        & military press were also used. other resources include 
        the london gazette, local newspapers, facts from family members and various 
        other pieces of information from old books and magazines.
all 
        the information here has been supplied by volunteers. if you have any 
        information about the various items appearing here or wish to supply information 
        then please use the feedback form. we will 
        publish searchable databases and war memorials plus photographs accreditation 
        being to those who own or have supplied the various content.
for 
        those of you wanting to visit the places where these men and women are 
        buried we have compiled a page devoted to tour companies 
        that specialise in this area.
aims of 
        this web site
 this website: 
        

  promotes 
          historical knowledge as a tool for peace and understanding between peoples 
          and nations.
 does 
          not seek to glorify the british empire or any form of imperialism.
  does 
          not seek to glorify war, or advocate war as a solution to disputes. 
          
  uses 
          crown icons and other royal/imperial symbols as an historical device, 
          and not a political statement. 
 endeavours 
          to be as accurate as possible but sometimes is not; any entries that 
          are erroneous will be changed in the fullness of time given notification

war 
                poems...written by: tam d grey





 

the 
              naval & military press offer specialist books and ground 
              breaking cd-roms for the serious student of conflict. their hand 
              picked range of books covers the whole spectrum of military history 
              with titles on uniforms, battles, official and regimental histories, 
              specialist works containing medal rolls and casualties lists as 
              well as titles for genealogists, medal collectors and researchers. 
              the innovative approach they have to military bookselling and their 
              commitment to publishing have made them britain’s leading 
              independent military bookseller. 




 query 
              policy


due 
                  to the lask of resource it is not always possible for us to 
                  reply to emails, especially research of individuals. we are 
                  not a full-time organisation with staff, we are amateurs trying 
                  to collate as much information as we can. as such we research 
                  memorials as and when we can. the volume of emails received 
                  precludes us from answering all but we do try.


for 
                  military family history 
                  research information and resources there is a page to help 
                  you.


occasionally 
                  people are looking, for a variety of reasons, for various families 
                  of those who died in conflict. the latest requests are held 
                  on the information requests page.


some 
                  photographs have been supplied but the subjects are unknown 
                  - do you know any of these?






want 
              to help
we 
              are always looking for volunteers to help. all information included 
              on the site is accredited to the person who worked on it. you need 
              help with transciptions, research and photographs. 
contact 
              the site owner, martin 
              edwards, if you are interested in helping. there is a word 
              template available for those who wish to you use it to transcribe. 
              if you left click on the link (not right) it will load into word 
              and you can save it into your templates folder as a base for new 
              transcription documents. 


stop 
                    press


currently 
              we have a huge backlog of around 10,000+ emails to get through containing 
              new memorials and amendments. as we are volunteers we can only devote 
              so much of our spare time to this so please bear with us. although 
              we do try to reply to emails the volume is such that we cannot guarantee 
              a response, sorry but there is a huge amount of emails coming in 
              and it is just not possible.
