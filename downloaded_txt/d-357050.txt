institute for applied mathematics
our aim is to develop mathematical techniques and ideas which are relevant for applications in the natural and social sciences, and to investigate their implications in selected case studies. mathematically, we focus on nonlinear analysis (calculus of variations, partial differential equations), numerical mathematics, probability theory and stochastic analysis. presently the main application areas are physics and mechanics.
 our institute is a founding member of the excellence cluster hausdorff center for mathematics (hcm) in bonn and consists of the following research groups: applied analysis (s. conti) functional analysis (j. lópez velázquez) interacting random systems (p. ferrari) partial differential equations and inverse problems (a. rüland, hausdorff chair) pde and applications (b. niethammer) probabilistic combinatorics (l. sauermann, hausdorff chair) probability theory (a. bovier, a. eberle) stochastic analysis (t. sturm) variational methods and mathematical aspects of materials science (s. müller, hausdorff chair; m. disertori) bonn research chairs m. gordina m. ortiz v. gayrard bonn junior fellows j. alt c. brennecke e. peltola (former bjf with partial affiliation in bonn) heisenberg fellow (heisenberg-stelleninhaber) i. karabash interdisciplinary research units a. effland emeriti s. albeverio, h. w. alt, j. frehse, r. leis, m. schäl
