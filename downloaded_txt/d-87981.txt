in these times of turbulence and possibility, it was important to find resources and partners with whom the college could navigate change well. friends at in trust helped eased concerns by providing rich resources, a presence of accompaniment and access to consultants who have helped us imagine thriving in ways we might otherwise have been unable: thank you!





dea. dr. richard manley-tannis, principalst. andrew's college at the university of saskatchewan













the resources and initiatives of the in trust center have been extremely valuable to our board resulting in increased board engagement.





sonny gan, board chairlogos evangelical seminary













without question, my call to in trust as i began my service as president-elect was one of the most fruitful calls that i have made as a leader. the outcome of the resources that in trust provided far exceeded my vision and the expectations of our staff, faculty and board. thus, i owe a debt of gratitude to in trust for faithfully walking with us through an early and critical transition period.
