hmmmm..........been couple of wks since my last updatemy ankle got worse as the doctor say the x ray show the bone got seperated then he say an operation is to be done.so went for a operation on wednesday was pretty nervous about it cause it was the first time that i got admit into hospital, and first time doing a operation in a coma.the operation went well with the doctor who was very friendly and kind , staying in hospital was really boring than i thought and also troublesome need to do this and do that also muz call the nurses but they are really nice ppl who is willing to help , i guess those older day those older kind of nurse who is damm fierce and will complain here and there when u ask for help does not exist anymore le ba.discharged after 4 day of stay in hospital (damm i should be in taiwan now -.-) come back home at first very hard to get used to the life cause alot of thing cannot do and need to do it in a hard way.but as day goes by got used to it lor.yesterday went to see the doctor again he say need to get my leg excerise more cause it is very hard and cannot bend (sian ar now my leg damm straight like monster) he arrange a physiotherapy session for me to get myself back on track again.thankz you to all of you (u know who u all are) who care about me in the whole process.
