i had an amazing experience, the mechanic that did my inspection (kyle) did a great job,
                      knew his stuff, and was very thorough and honest with us. would highly recommend this service!

i think bluestar is an excellent resource for anyone looking to buy a car who isn't mechanically inclined and wants peace of mind before purchasing.

cory did a great job and helped me feel a lot more comfortable and at ease about the car i was purchasing. i was hesitant to spend the money for a
                    bluestar inspection at first, but i'm glad i did!

really good value. ismael and crew thoroughly inspected all major components of the used car i was considering. they took their time going through the detailed report and made sure all of my questions and concerns were addressed, allowing me to make a much more informed decision about the car. flexible scheduling and fast wifi. seriously, i can't recommend bluestar enough. well done, guys.

really great experience with cory helping me out and preinspecting before i saw the vehicle. that enabled me to concern myself only with if i wanted to purchase, comfortable with the mechanical condition in advance.

bluestar is the bomb! sold a used car recently and referenced the bluestar report several times. gave me the facts i needed to stay firm on price and to give the buyer confidence enough to purchase. highly recommend!

search through our vehicles
most listing sites are great for showing the nice looking pictures dealers want you to see.  they list the vehicle specs and some even tell whether or not the price is fair.  what they can’t tell you is whether or not the car is in good condition.
                    they won’t show you pictures of the undercarriage.  is it really a good price?  bluestar can help you find out!

inspect

get a world-class inspection
90% of used cars we inspect have issues. vehicle history reports are not always accurate because not everything gets reported properly.
                      even if they were accurate, vehicle histories are not enough.  you need to know the current condition of the car! the only way to do that is to get a thorough mechanical inspection. bluestar can make that happen!

protect

service protection offered
bluestar’s current condition report can help you avoid buying a car with a pre-existing condition.  but let’s face it - vehicles break down, and when they do, repairs can be quite costly. engines, transmissions, fuel pumps, ac compressors, etc. can cost thousands of dollars to repair.
                      avoid the risk of a big repair bill with bluestar’s certified pre-owned vehicle protection plans.




bluestar's vehicle protection plans






why you need an inspection
the lowest price on a car is not always the best deal. to offer a vehicle at a rock-bottom price and
          stillmaximize profits, many dealers avoid making needed repairs. here's what you need to know.


 




buyer beware
most used cars are sold "as is". this means you as the buyer are on the hook for any needed repairs.







dealer bias
most dealers tell you they inspect and repair their cars. however, many do not recondition all worn or damaged items, and inspection standards vary greatly by dealership. 




 




warranties
warranties can be expensive and rarely cover "pre-existing conditions". most maintenance and wear items are not covered either and those can add up. make sure the car is in good condition before you buy.







vehicle history
carfax and autocheck do not tell you if the car is in good condition or in need of repairs. they tell you the history, not the current condition.








why choose us?

thorough
bluestar ase-certified techs test drive and lift every vehicle as part of the 225+ point inspection.
