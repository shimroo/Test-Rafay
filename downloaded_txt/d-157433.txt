northern thailand
khao soy is a signature of northern thailand, chiang mai but
                    makes little appearances in bangkok. this mouthwatering dish kicks
                    off with a strong base of red and yellow curry powder, followed by
                    simmering coconut milk and chicken broth to develop its flavor.
