"jazz great benny golson
is young again"
read a review of benny's performance at the lincoln center in new york in january 2014






a letter from the office of the president of howard university 
	the board of trustees of howard university wishes to include in its official record an expression of sincere condolence to the family of mr. benny golson, internationally renowned tenor saxophonist, innovative lyricist, composer and arranger, and gifted music educator. 
	the young benny golson arrived on howard's campus from his home in philadelphia in the fall of 1947 at a time when jazz music classes were not part of the school of music's curricula. he and fellow classmates played for no credit in the school's jazz band, and benny also performed with the howard swing masters. benny left howard after three years to pursue his passion, but always credited howard with helping to shape his career and with giving him a broader outlook on life and how he  "fit into things."

  reviewed by jack bowers


  at age eighty-seven, saxophonist benny golson is one of the last surviving links to the golden age of modern jazz, ushered in by the likes of charlie parker, dizzy gillespie, bud powell, kenny clarke and others in the early '40s .....

  ..... at an age that is far past retirement for most mortals, benny golson not only keeps working but showing a younger generation that when it comes to contemporary jazz, maturity and experience are dependable allies in the ongoing battle with father time.

obituary - wrti - by shaun brady - 9/22/2024
	benny golson, a master saxophonist revered as much for the durable standards he contributed to the jazz repertoire as for his eloquent tenor sound, died on saturday at his home in manhattan. he was 95. his longtime manager and agent, jason franklin, said he died after a short illness. golson played an integral role in the transition from bebop to hard bop through his short but vital tenure with art blakeyâs jazz messengers, and with his own influential jazztet, co-led by trumpeter art farmer. but his place in the jazz pantheon would be secure even if he had never played a note. few jazz musicians can claim as many bona fide standards to their credit: bedrock compositions like âwhisper not,â âstablemates,â âi remember clifford,â âalong came betty,â âkiller joe,â and âblues march.â âevery stroke of his pen became another classic,â trumpeter eddie henderson, a member of one of his bands, tells wrti. âhis signature sound was undeniable: he could play one note and you knew it was benny golson. thatâs the mark of a true artist."

    'with the publication of this handsome book we get a closer look at some of the out-takes of art kane's excellent work. it's heartwarming to see some of these people greeting each other as the cabs roll up to the appointed place. there's no ego on display here. these are great artists who recognize each others' gifts.

i would heartily recommend this book to any jazz and/or photography lover.'
