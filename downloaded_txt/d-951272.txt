		“i thought that they were angels, but much to my surprise;
		we climbed aboard our starship and headed for the skies;
		singing, ‘come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me, lad;
		come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me;
		come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me;
		come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me.’”

		










lyrics by styx from “come sail away” from the grand illusion album





the purpose of this website is to provide the “real physics” involved with developing “warp drive” and “making star trek a reality.”  gravity manipulation and amplification is the key that unlocks the milky way galaxy and the rest of the universe.  by navigating the heavens on a starship using an amplified gravity field propulsion system, man will no longer be bound to a portion of our sun’s solar system.  the first step to making star trek a reality is to determine just what gravity is.  albert einstein dedicated his life to developing the unified theory which would have included gravity.  although albert einstein became famous for developing his special and general relativity theories (general relativity deals with gravity and accelerated reference frames) he was never able to come to a complete understanding of what gravity was before his death on april 15, 1955 (at least that is what the “official record” states).  my nuclear gravitation field theory is the first step to making star trek a reality because i demonstrate just exactly what gravity is.  my nuclear gravitation field theory is provided here on a separate web page for your reading pleasure.

what led me to continue on my quest to make star trek a reality?  i learned about a bizarre event that took place in new england in september of 1961.  i will discuss this event in greater detail a bit later.
albert einstein claimed the speed of light was the ultimate speed and stated that no object with rest mass could even reach the speed of light.  relative to earthbound objects, the speed of light, at 299,750 kilometers per second (equal to 186,300 miles per second), seems extremely swift.  however, when one considers that it takes light 4.28 years to travel from proxima centauri, our solar system’s nearest neighboring star, to reach us, the speed of light is a relative snail pace with respect to the interstellar medium.  it takes light 80,000 years to cross our milky way galaxy.  if the speed of light is the limiting speed, it appears that interstellar space travel is impossible.  the snail pace for the speed of light is still virtually an instantaneous speed compared to the nominal speed for man’s current space travel technology.  the voyager 2 space probe has left our solar system at an approximate speed of 36,000 miles per hour.  at that speed, it would take voyager 2 over 80,000 years to reach proxima centauri.
however, that bizarre event i mentioned earlier may provide just the evidence needed to prove the speed of light is not the ultimate speed.  gravity may propagate much faster than light and may provide a means for interstellar space travel.  the web page on my website, “history of my research and development of the nuclear gravitation field theory,” shares with you the history and the background information, including the details of that bizarre event, which led me to develop the nuclear gravitation field theory.
i originally developed my nuclear gravitation field theory in a rough collection of notes and information.  i stumbled upon a couple of articles that led me to organize my ideas and formalize the theory.  the web page on my website, “supporting information for the nuclear gravitation field theory,” shares with you the information i came upon that gave me the confidence that my nuclear gravitation field theory was absolutely correct.  i have provided a summary of the physics of gravity field propulsion for interstellar space travel on web page “the physics of star trek and subspace communication:  science fiction or science fact?” on my website.
