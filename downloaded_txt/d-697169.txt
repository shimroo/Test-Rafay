okay, so i have not done anything to this site in, oh, 3 years!
i am still doing research, just not as often as i used to. i'm going to try to do
a redesign and maybe even a relocation of the site soon. i have other webspace. the
name would change, and wouldn't be as direct, but that's cool. it doesn't really matter.
i have the other space that i pay for, so i should use it :o)

this began as the kerry family genealogy page, but has become more like a 
natchitoches parish, particularly the gorum, derry, cloutierville area, 
genealogy page. everyone is related somehow! :o) i am looking 
for any family histories that anyone would like to share. i would love 
to have any information that anyone would like to share on any of the families 
listed below, and even those not listed that are related. questions, 
queries, etc. can be posted to the guestbook, but i get e-mail 
faster (ishapespaceatgmaildotcom).

please send me any additions, corrections,
omitions, or anything else you'd like to see on here. this page is not just for me,
 it is for everyone searching for their roots in the natchitoches parish area.
 don't let the name fool you. it began for the kerry line, but it has become 
something much greater. i thank everyone who has submitted infomation to me and
i wish luck to everyone who is doing research.

gorum cemetary
this is my transcription of the gorum cemetary
taken in late 2002. i have alphabetized the listing i took, finding it is easier to find names
that way. i also am listing it as a .txt file, in an attempt for a simpler, easier to read,
and printg format.

**note: in these records their are many 
      misspellings of names and inaccurate dates. also, the last name kerry, is 
      also often spelled quierry , keri, cary, carriere, thierry, or 
      quierri and many other ways. persons in records from natchitoches parish 
      la. often actually have the last name kerry.
