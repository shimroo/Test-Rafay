over one billion public records can now be searched for free
black book online, the free public records site, has just launched an online lookup of over one billion free public records. the new service is 100% free to use and includes over 6,000 public record databases from all 50 states.
"public record websites have exploded over the past 15 years but the problem is, its time consuming to click from one public website to another to another to another,"says black book online editor and private investigator robert scott. "we wanted to break out of that paradigm and make the data more accessible with a single name search that searches thousands of public record sites at once."
according to scott, black book online has scanned but not copied thousands of free public record websites and built an index so for any given name, its known where records exist. the site then provides users with a link to the public record site where they can look up the information at the source.
"investigators have better things to than clicking around at websites looking for data that may or may not be there. our new search system allows them to only search at sites where there's a high probability of success. imagine doing public record research and doing it in a matter of seconds, not minutes or hours. that's what we are striving for."
black book online, the free public record search site, can be found here.
