the different types of moving services




when discussing moving companies, people will not normally bring up the different service types that exist. there are quite a few service options when considering moving companies, and here are three of the most common.
full service
full service movers are the most well-known and most commonly used services when people choose to relocate. a full service move is just as it sounds: all services are provided. the company provides a truck that best matches the amount of goods you need to be moved, as well as an appropriately sized team for the job. this team will pack all of your items, if you haven’t decided to pack them yourself. they load all of your things onto the provided truck, and drive the truck to your new residence. they unload all of the items at your new location, and all you have to do is decorate your new home. full service companies alleviate as much stress as they possibly can for the duration of the moving process.
moving labor
this is the lesser heard of service that is provided. hiring moving labor is mostly for those who have already rented a van or truck, or have access to one, and don’t have the energy or patience to pack and load their own things. moving labor crews will come in, pack your things, load your things into your truck or storage unit, and unload them as needed. they can also move large items within your home, if need be. the trouble with moving labor is that they are not usually associated with any accredited companies, so you’re taking a chance with them showing up on time or at all.
portable storage container movers
portable storage container movers provide a storage unit and drop it off at your location. then, you’re responsible for loading your things into the unit. you can do this yourself, or hire the aforementioned moving laborers. in either case, once the storage unit is fully loaded, you can call the movers, and they will drive the storage unit to its new residence, and you are, once again, responsible for the unloading of its contents. with portable storage units, you should be mindful of how many things you actually own, and be sure to request a unit with an appropriate size for all of your belongings.
other services
while those are the three main services provided for moving, there are a few other mentionable ones. specialized movers can be useful if you have unique items that require special tools or care to move. specialized movers commonly deal with things such as pianos, safes, pool tables, art, antiques, jacuzzis, and things of that nature. there are also self-service moves, where a company provides you with a truck and a driver, but you are responsible for the loading and unloading of the truck. finally, instead of hiring professional movers, there is the do-it-yourself method, where you are responsible for every aspect of the move.
having a knowledge about the different services that are actually available can help in determining what you actually need assistance with and how much you can save during your move.

countdown to moving day a week-by-week relocation checklist




planning to relocate can easily turn into a hectic endeavor. the best way to overcome the frenzy that is moving is to have a plan. brought to you by dc moving company – cheap movers dc, here’s a play-by-play on how to best utilize the weeks leading up to your moving date.
8 weeks
this is the time for you to plan the basics. will you use a moving company or rent a van? do you have kids or pets that will need caretaking on the day of the move? make note of these topics, write reminders for yourself, and place it all in a folder dedicated to the move. be sure to obtain all necessary documents and forms that you’ll need at your new location, i.e. medical records, school records, etc.; these should be placed in your moving folder, as well. make an attempt to draw a floor plan of your new home, or obtain one online. this floor plan will help to give you an idea of how much you can take with you and where to place it all. start listing all of your belongings and decide what you want to take with you and what you’ll get rid of.
6 weeks
at this point, you should file a change of address kit with the post office. inform banks, insurance, and all other necessary agencies of your new address. do you plan to pack your items yourself, or will you assign that task to a moving company? if you plan to pack yourself, determine how much you’ll need, in terms of packing supplies. if you plan on ordering these online, do that around this time.
4 weeks
take this time to clean out your house. get rid of all the junk that you meant to throw out months ago; throw away damaged items, and set aside any items to be donated. schedule a few in-home estimates, to get an idea of how much your move will cost you. during this time, you should also call your utility companies and arrange cut-off dates for their services.
3 weeks
review your list of items you plan to keep and see if there is anything you can pack in advance, i.e. excess clothing, toys, etc. make a call to your movers and confirm that they will be available on your move dates; draw out a written agreement with the company, confirming rates and your final estimate. if you plan on renting a van, do the same: call the company, confirm your dates.
2 weeks
if you’re moving to a new state, be sure to arrange travel plans (flight times, hotel reservations, etc.). once again, review your item checklist, crosscheck it with the physical items in your home (packed and unpacked) and dispose of any items too dangerous to move, such as strong cleaning products. now’s the time you should arrange to have the utilities at your new home turned on.
1 week
prepare a 72-hour kit for your new home, until your utilities and kitchen items are unpacked. if you’re staying at a hotel, you can skip this step entirely. pack your suitcases and keep them separate from the boxes being loaded into your truck/van. reconfirm with your movers the dates and estimated times for your move.
moving day
check boxes off of your list as they are loaded onto the truck. anything you planned to take in your car, i.e. suitcases, should be loaded into your car right now. exchange phone numbers with your movers, in case contact is needed during transit.
post-move
you’ve reached your destination. unload all of your items, keeping things organized by room. pay your movers, and send them on their way. congratulations! you’ve just successfully moved.

seven professional mover tips for packing your apartment




moving is a time that is both fun and nerve-wracking. while you’re excited to get into a new place, the fear of breaking or leaving something behind is always on your mind.
to help with the transition process, consider these seven tips from professional movers at cheap movers las vegas (101 n pecos rd suite 113, las vegas, nv 89101, (702) 660-4699) on how to pack up your apartment.
1. mark every box
every person has heard the same familiar cry: “where did i put [blank]?” it’s frustrating, time-consuming, and, most of all, unnecessary.
to alleviate this concern, take out a sharpie and mark every single box with a loose description of what’s inside. it can be something as simple as “kitchen dishes,” but make sure that you know what’s there at a glance. check out these labeling tips.

2. place breakables in the center of the box
items that have a spout or glass handle should always be placed towards the interior of the box rather than the outside. you never know when a box will bang up against a wall, or even worse, fall on its side, so make sure everything that’s breakable has as much interior protection as possible.
3. don’t skimp on packing materials
it’s tempting just to roll up your expensive china in a towel and place it on the inside, but you’re just asking for problems if you do so. pack as much paper, bubble wrap, or other cushiony material as you can to make sure those stay safe. otherwise, your decision to save $20 on boxes and wrapping materials could end up in thousands lost.
4. do not pack dangerous items
flammable items, aerosol cans, corrosive materials, and other dangerous materials are illegal to transfer by professional movers, and for a good reason: it’s dangerous. by not knowing that it’s there, they could unintentionally create a fire or explosion, possibly hurting or killing others in the process. a good rule of thumb is if you can’t ship it in the mail, movers can’t take in their truck, so it’s best to throw it away or donate it if possible.
5. pack a “day one” kit
your first 24 hours in your new place are, in a word, chaotic. make the transition easier by putting aside one box with some clothes, soap, towels, laptop, snacks, etc., that you will need on your first day in your new place. move that box to your bedroom where you can get to it, and mark it clearly on the side of the box.
6. use the right boxes
professional movers see everything and more, but one of the most common is people who will use the wrong kind of box for an item, like a flimsy soft-ply box filled to the brim with heavy books. not only will this not work, but it can also be dangerous for the movers as they try to transport it. bix a heavy box for heavy items, light boxes for light items, and do not skimp on quality.

7. buy packing supplies ahead of time
there is nothing more frustrating than being two hours into a move and running out of tape. or boxes. or packing peanuts. constant trips to the store are time-consuming and just plain wasteful, so make sure you have more than enough materials to get the packing done when you start.

movers discuss the most common reasons for people to move




every day, there are hundreds of people in america that move to a new residence. a recent us census shows us that, between 2012 and 2013 alone, 35.9 million people over the age of 1 year moved to a new residence. that’s 11.7 percent of the population that relocated over the course of a year. the reasons for these decisions to move all vary across the board.
buying a new home
one of the top reasons for many people to relocate is because they’ve decided to buy a new house. for obvious reasons, they do not need to remain at their current residence once they’ve purchased a new one. the second most popular reason for people to move is due to a change in their relationship status. when people get engaged, or married, they will usually decide to move in together. they either stay in one partner’s residence, or they both uproot and choose a new home together. in either instance, they are relocating. a similar effect happens when two people break up or get a divorce altogether. either one partner leaves the house, or the house is sold and they both move away.
changing jobs
cheap chicago movers (movers chicago il) say the next most common reason to change homes is a job change. it’s not uncommon for people to choose a new job with better pay that happens to be in another city. commuting is terrible for some, and it tends to be much easier to move closer to the job than drive an extended period every day. sometimes, people simply need a change of scenery, which drives them to relocate. they’ll choose a new home to simply refresh themselves and start over in a new place. financial hardships can be grounds for relocating. oftentimes, keeping up with a mortgage or rent becomes too pricey, and people are forced to downsize, or simply move to a less expensive area. when finances come into play, a lot of compromises and sacrifices tend to be made.
change in life stage
age is often a deciding factor in relocation. the most common thought in regards to age and moving is the teen who’s finally old enough to move out. they leave the nest and find their own place to live. the other half of this coin is when seniors are at a point where they need live-in care or supervision, and their children either move them to a retirement home, or move them into their child’s home.
upgrading real estate
a final reason for moving is another obvious one: upgrading. in some cases, people finally gain the finances to move into the home they’ve been dreaming of for years. in other cases, a family is simply expanding, which calls for a much larger home and more space.
for some, it’s a conscious move towards a higher status and a better appeal. for others, it’s simply a necessary step towards improving their lives. in any regard, moving is a very large aspect of the american lifestyle, and it will likely remain that way for a long time.

home and apartment movers – understanding your moving estimate




when most people hear the term estimate, they can usually associate it with its use, as far as moving. moving companies offer estimates to give homeowners an idea of how much they’ll be paying for their move. there are a number of variables that factor into how much that number comes out to be. here are the factors that ultimately affect the estimate you receive from a moving company.
travel time – companies typically will not charge for the distance between your current home and your new home; that is covered under the hourly wage. this travel time is in reference to the time it takes for the truck to get from their warehouse to your home, and then from the new home back to their warehouse.
weight of belongings – this is the most widely known factor in regards to a moving estimate. the more your furniture and other belongings weigh, the more you will likely you are to be paying more for your move. you can use helpful moving calculators to estimate the weight of your belongings. keep in mind that most long distance moves cost around $100 per 100 lbs., though this figure will vary based on the distance you’re moving. for local or in-town moves, a nationwide mover with locations in austin-round rock and hampton roads, says that weight of belongings is less of a factor. for local moves, moving companies provide estimates based on the number of hours it will take to move your things.
access – people don’t usually understand what companies mean by access, initially. the term ‘access,’ in this instance, means how easy it will be for the movers to actually get your things to and from the truck. ideally, a moving van should be able to back the van up to the front step of your home and bring things in directly. things such as stairs, elevators, long hallways, etc. make this difficult. curbside parking and parking meters also make this a bit of a problem. to deal with these obstacles, a moving company may assess addition access-related charges.
last minute changes – contracting a moving company is the same as making a reservation or a doctor’s appointment. if you don’t show up, or there’s a delay with no notice, there’s typically an additional fee. when you tell a moving company that they aren’t able to move your items into your new home on the expected day, they have to store your items. when this happens, they’ll often charge you by the day that they have to hold your things. also, if you aren’t ready to load your things into the truck on the day you planned, they’ll charge you an additional fee for delaying their services.
additional services – there are a number of optional services that most moving companies offer. some of these services include packing boxes, disassembling and reassembling furniture, removing debris, and carrying bulky articles. when a company says ‘bulky articles,’ they are thinking of pianos, large appliances, automobiles, and items of that nature. some companies will also offer extra insurance protection, in regards to the amount they will pay if something is damaged, as well as storage-in-transit services. all of these services will result in extra fees factored into your initial estimate.
all in all, there are quite a few things for you to evaluate when it comes to your moving estimate. the easiest way for you to minimize any additional fees is to ensure you are on schedule for the duration of your move, pack your own things, and keep things as simple as you’re able to keep them.

moving van vs professional movers




which would you prefer: a team of movers carrying your things on their schedule, or you moving everything yourself and operating on your own time? this is a common debate many homeowners have with themselves when preparing to move to a new location. it’s a difficult decision to make, so here are some pros and cons to both sides of the coin.
renting a moving van
pro – when you rent a moving van for your move, you control the timeline you’re under. once you’ve picked up your van, you decide how quickly or slowly you load your boxes. you aren’t constrained or rushed by a team of movers; you can move at your own pace.
con – logistically, you’re obligated to pick up and return the van on a certain day. and you have less help to load/unload your things, to ensure you get the van back at a decent time. you’re responsible for packing, loading, unloading, and unpacking. you, of course, can put your family members to work, but that’s the extent of your moving team.
pro – the expenses, overall, for renting a van are much less than that of a moving team. you pay upfront for the time you plan to be using the van and a flat price for the size of your van.
con – occasionally, companies will apply additional charges for holding the van longer than the intended time span or how far the van was driven (charge per mile), and things of this nature. if you aren’t careful, the additional charges can add up quickly.
hiring professional movers
pro – you have less responsibility when working with a team of professional movers. while they are packing and loading your belongings, you have time to focus elsewhere, such as arranging a sitter for your kids or pets for the day of the move, and ensuring things are set up at your new home.
con – professional movers come at a price, and usually a very high one. movers will often charge by the hour; this encompasses the time to load your belongings, drive to your new home, and unload your belongings. that is a time consuming process, and that hourly rate will add up quickly.
pro – no heavy lifting is required of you. you can sit back while the movers handle all the manual labor. after all, that’s what they’re getting paid for, right?
con – with moving companies, you’re risking being ripped off. scams happen very often in this industry, so you have to be extremely careful as far as who you hire and how your agreements are drawn out. if you need to find a trusted and reliable long distance moving company, check out great guys (https://www.greatguyslongdistancemovers.com/) to get cheaper options.
