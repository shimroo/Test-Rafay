i love my new pan flute…
  i'm over the moon with this beautiful pan flute. it has a gorgeous sound and is so beautifully made. i know i made the right choice going with your pan flutes! and i could never ask for better customer service. i don't think there is anyone else out there that can match that--you two are special!
i am so delighted to have learned about your panflute shop and about both of you. you are making the world a better--and happier--place! thank you so much!
blessings to you both!
