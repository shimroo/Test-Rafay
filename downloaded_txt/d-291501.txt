#zoedavidson #associatemembercsc @zdavidsonand that‚Äôs a wrap! a huge shoutout to carolyn wong for the honor of hosting‚Äîthank you for this incredible opportunity!this journey has been a dream come true, and i‚Äôm beyond grateful that i get to pursue my passion as a career.of course, it‚Äôs not always smooth sailing. there are long days, late nights, and moments of uncertainty. but when you love what you do and have a clear goal, there‚Äôs no such thing as ‚Äútoo much effort.‚Äù you go all in.for those just starting out or interested in becoming a director of photography, here are some tips:1. gear doesn‚Äôt define you: i‚Äôve seen stunning films shot on a 5d iv and disappointing ones filmed on equipment that cost ten times more. at the end of the day, every dp‚Äôs goal is the same: tell the story.2. people are kind: i was so nervous meeting experienced dps at first. but they‚Äôre just people‚Äîrockstars, yes, but also kind people who are genuinely interested in seeing others succeed. if you‚Äôre starting out, reach out! you‚Äôd be surprised how willing many established dps are to offer advice or mentorship. just ask.3. just get started: the hardest part of any new journey is taking that first step. it‚Äôs easy to doubt yourself, but trust me: action is the best way to improve. put in the work, and you‚Äôll grow into the dp you‚Äôre meant to be. time and effort will get you there.thanks for following along! until next time, and happy black history month!zo√´ davidson

#zoedavidson #associatemembercsc @zdavidsoni‚Äôm in the final stages of making a film that dives deep into jamaica‚Äôs turbulent 1970s‚Äîa time marked by political unrest and fear. this story is told through the voices of jamaicans who, for the safety of their families and hopes of a better future for their children, chose to leave their homeland.as they built new lives in canada‚Äîstarting businesses, raising children, and creating generations who now call canada home‚Äîtheir journey bridges two worlds.while this is a story rooted in jamaica, it‚Äôs also a powerful testament to the strength and resilience that defines the canadian experience.jamaica‚Äôs motto, ‚Äúout of many, one people,‚Äù speaks not only to jamaica‚Äôs rich diversity but also to canada‚Äôs. it‚Äôs about unity in the face of adversity.here‚Äôs a glimpse of the film.

#zoedavidson #associatemembercsc @zdavidsonone of the most pivotal moments of my filmmaking journey was shooting and directing my @howard1867 mfa thesis film, canada‚Äôs unchecked racism.the short documentary explores the experiences of two young black canadians and the challenges they‚Äôve faced growing up in canada.it was a personal project, and creatively, it pushed me further than any other film i had worked on up to that point. i constantly asked myself: how do i best tell this story? what message do i want to share? the goal was never to simply revisit the painful moments of the past but to inspire change‚Äîchallenging canadians to do better and be better as we move forward.canada‚Äôs unchecked racism went on to screen at over a dozen festivals worldwide and won several awards‚Äîan achievement i was incredibly proud of. at the time, it felt like my biggest success.but, as nelson mandela wisely said, ‚Äúdo not judge me by my successes, judge me by how many times i fell down and got back up again.‚Äùsuccess isn‚Äôt just about the big wins‚Äîit‚Äôs about the countless times we fall, get back up, and keep going. this wasn‚Äôt my first film; it was the culmination of years of late nights, failures, and perseverance.success isn‚Äôt instantaneous. it‚Äôs built on a foundation of setbacks, resilience, and the willingness to rise after every fall. it may take weeks, months, or years, but success is only achievable if you don‚Äôt give up.

#zoedavidson #associatemembercsc @zdavidsonhere are a few stills from ‚Äúthings at rest‚Äù, an experimental short directed by @kalei_des_scope. this film offers a stunning reimagining of the black aesthetic, deeply inspired by the matriarchs of classic african-american literature.each scene is a visual ode to a different literary classic, which resulted in unique vignettes that each felt like a new film. this dynamic approach challenged us to experiment with our techniques, all while maintaining a cohesive narrative.we filmed during the height of the pandemic, which brought its own set of challenges. with actors and crew members getting sick, we were constantly adapting to unforeseen changes. but despite these hurdles, we managed to make a beautiful film, and ‚Äúthings at rest‚Äù remains one of my favorite projects.‚ú®

#zoedavidson #associatemembercsc @zdavidsonfilmmaking is a team sport, and one of the most important lessons i‚Äôve learned as a cinematographer is the power of the right team. if you‚Äôre able to surround yourself with people you enjoy working with, who you can trust, and whose work you truly admire, it‚Äôs easy to create something unforgettable.over the years, i‚Äôve been fortunate to be a part of some incredible teams, and work on many amazing projects. even when things don‚Äôt go according to plan‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a tough subject, a lack of equipment, or other unexpected hurdles‚Äîit‚Äôs the team that pulls you through.getting to do what i love is a gift in itself. getting to do it with friends is like winning the lottery.‚Äúif you want to go fast, go alone. if you want to go far, go together.‚Äù

#zoedavidson #associatemembercsc @zdavidsonlike many cinematographers, my passion for film began with photography. in high school, i joined the photography club, where i spent countless hours in the darkroom, watching images come to life as they developed.what i love most about film photography is how it challenges you to embrace limitations. you only have a limited number of shots, so each frame becomes an intentional choice. that mindset is something i‚Äôve carried into my digital work as well‚Äîworking within those constraints pushes me to be more thoughtful and ultimately create better images.one of the self-imposed limitations i love to work with is focal length. while a zoom lens offers convenience, sticking to a single focal length, like a 50mm prime, forces you to think outside the box and challenge yourself, creatively.i took these photos several years ago while visiting three of my favorite cities‚Äînew york, d.c., and toronto‚Äîeach shot captured with a challenge in mind: limiting myself to black and white, experimenting with long exposures, or capturing a single frame that tells an entire story. every shot was captured with a 50mm prime lens. üì∑

#zoedavidson #associatemembercsc @zdavidson‚Äúi never lose. i either win or learn.‚Äù ‚Äì nelson mandelaas a cinematographer, especially in the early stages of your career, not every project will be a success, make it to a major festival, or land distribution. sometimes, a film just doesn‚Äôt find its way. other times, external factors‚Äîlike a global pandemic or budget constraints‚Äîcan prevent a film from reaching its full potential.the reality is, as cinematographers, we don‚Äôt always control the outcome of a film after the camera stops rolling. there are countless projects we‚Äôve all worked on that looked beautiful on set but ultimately live only on a hard drive or in our reels.it‚Äôs easy to view these moments as failures.but in reality, every time you‚Äôre lucky enough to step onto a film set, you‚Äôre presented with an opportunity to learn something new‚Äîregardless of the final outcome.the frames i‚Äôve shared here are from a few of those unseen films.the experiences i had with these projects were not a waste of time or a failure, in my eyes. with each project came an opportunity for growth, new connections, and a chance to learn.
