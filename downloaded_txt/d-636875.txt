experience reverieexclusive first listen to reverie no. 1 - paul wright iii feat. dave cleveland available september 13, 2024

  

hey there, welcome to reverie.welcome! i'm honored to have you here, and i hope you'll enjoy the melodies and harmonies i've poured my heart and soul into. whether you're a music enthusiast or just looking for a pleasant escape, i hope you find something that resonates with you in this intimate musical journey. i’m truly excited to share with you my very first solo project, "reverie." this instrumental piano project is accompanied by soul-stirring strings, which together take listeners on a profound journey through a realm of god-inspired dreams and raw emotions. the delicate interplay of the piano melodies and the lush orchestral arrangement creates a sonic experience that evokes a beautiful sense of enchantment, nostalgia, and profound contemplation. as you listen to these ethereal pieces, let yourself be transported to a place where time stands still, where every note and every chord reflects a deeply personal story, and where each harmonic progression carries the weight of unspoken emotions. 

  











“i hope you'll enjoy the melodies and harmonies i've poured my heart and soul into”



  

so, as you explore my journey through "reverie," let the melodies wash over you, allowing them to ignite your senses. imagine the serenity that embraces you, and the unparalleled joy that fills your heart. take your time, listen, and immerse yourself in the music that has been composed with love and dedication. your presence here means a lot to me, and i'm grateful for your visit. much love,paul
