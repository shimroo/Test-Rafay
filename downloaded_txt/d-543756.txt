jonathan sumption - cursed kings: the hundred years war iv





everything that i have written about the first three volumes of jonathan sumption's epic history of the hundred years war is also true of this, the fourth and penultimate volume. sumption's account is enormous in scope, with a masterful grasp of the archival material and an eye for interesting detail that enlivens the sheer volume of information. readers will like me sometimes lose track of the bigger picture, but that's a limitation of the format.volume iv however does feel different to the other books, and this is mostly to do with the period it covers. much of the book is shaped by the descent of france into violent civil war, as the mentally distressed king charles vi, becomes increasingly unable to rule for prolonged periods of time. charles' frequent "absences" mean that the ruling class is riven by internal differences and tensions. to cut a long story short, two men come to represent the different approaches to ruling france as regent for louis of valois, duke of orléans and john the fearless, the duke of burgundy. louis was close to charles, though by no means a pleasant character. sumption describes him as "extrovert, self-indulgent and extravagant" but a "politician of exception ability, charming and gracious, politically astute, highly intelligent and articulate in council". while unpleasant, and "addicted to gambling and womanising" he was thus an enormous barrier to the john the fearless' own ambitions. within feudal society such rivalries could easily become open warfare, and this is what happened. john has louis murdered, and the quest for justice and resolution leads to a massive civil war, with both sides courting the english kings henry iv and v for assistance in the war. as with sumption's early books, there is much detail of various alliances as the hopes of both sides ebb and wane. what makes this period different to earlier work to a great extent, is the involvement of the masses of paris in this contest. while it would seem like the mass of the population would care little for one wing of the ruling class over another, john the fearless proved adept at promising reform and change to benefit the lower classes. in particular he promised, and indeed did move, to enact some reforms and sack many corrupt ministers and servants of the crown and civil service. thus the civil war that followed louis' murder saw the involvement of ordinary people in a very different capacity to just being soldiers dying on the battlefield. their protests, insurrection and risings helped drive events forward.then, as now, paris was both the capital of france and its principle city economically. sumption ably describes the power the masses had in the capital:the growing power and volatile temper of the parisian guilds would come to be associated with the most powerful and dangerous of them all, the corporation of the grande boucherie. this guild controlled the largest of the parisian butcheries, occupying a maze of covered alleys west of the chatelet, beneath the shadow of the church tower of st-jacques-la-boucherie... the butchers were a self-contained hereditary clan, much intermarried... their members were not much esteemed. they were 'men of low estate, inhuman, detestable and devoted to their dishonourable trade'... in spite of their low social status the butchers were rich, enjoying the benefits of a tightly controlled monopoly and a growing market for their product. with wealth came ambition. their leaders coveted status and power, they relished their position as kingmakers, once the rivalries of the princely houses spilled out onto the streets. concentrated in the narrow lanes of their quarters, they could summon up mobs in minutes, calling on hundreds of muscular apprentices and journeymen...no wonder then, that "fear of revolution in their capital had been an abiding anxiety of the kings of france for many years". this power shapes the ensuing civil war. john's opponents, the armagnac family, who take power in the aftermath of louis' death, experience the strength of the parisian power when up to 5,000 of the count of armagnac's followers are killed by them. the war itself is equally brutal, with john's forces rampaging their way across the country repeatedly defeating the armagnac forces. one of the fascinating things that sumption draws out in this, is the relative impoverishment of all those nobles who are fighting, both in the french civil war and their opponent in england. feudal kings were desperate short of cash to fight battles. keeping their armies in the fields cost a fortune, and the shortage of money (and consequently food and troops) is a key factor. it also helps explain why the masses of france were so volatile and angry at taxes, and open to the influence of someone who told them it would end.into this mess comes henry v, whose invasion of france in 1415 seems to sweep all before him. the civil war has left france with limited ability to respond, and the massacre of the french nobility at agincourt hamstrings the french nobility for years. by 1420, with the signing of the treaty of troyes (1420), henry v has captured normandy and expanded the english state into one of the most important parts of france. paris itself is threatened and charles has no option but to sign, making henry regent and heir to the french throne.it was a brief moment of success for the english throne, though it does not end the immediate conflict. but the death of both henry and charles in 1422, where this book finishes, pushes the war into a new era. while henry gained fame as the victor of agincourt and the winner at troyes, it was built on tenuous grounds. as sumption points out, the success was:by its nature impermanent. [henry's] ambitions depended too much on the slender resources of his english kingdom. his conquests had owed too much ot the extraordinary circumstances of france during his reign: fifteen years of civil war, the backlash provoked by the murder of john the fearless, the political and military misjudgements of the dauphin's advisers. and they had owed too much to henry's personal qualities: his reputation, his military skills and his iron will and energy.it could not survive henry's death. the war, and bloodshed, would continue.related reviewssumption - trial by battle: the hundred years war isumption - trial by fire: the hundred years war iisumption - divided houses: the hundred years war iiigreen - the hundred years war: a people's historybarker - conquestbarker - agincourt

adrian tchaikovsky - alien clay





*** spoilers ***adrian tchaikovsky is known for his big scale science fiction that often has unusual takes on alien planets and lifeforms - intelligent octopuses and city building spiders are just two. but alien clay is a novel about first contact with a very different form of alien ecology, and to further interest this reader, it is centred on a group of revolutionaries and radicals, albeit ones who have been captured and exiled to another planet.the book opens with the arrival of professor arton daghdev on the planet kiln. he doesn't arrive as an explorerer of scientist ready to study the planet's unusual life, instead he is there as a political prisoner, exiled by the despotic mandate to an interplanetary gulag. forced labour on kiln is brutal, and the environment unforgiving. but the workers are not digging for raw materials, they are aiding the project of unravelling kiln's ecological and archaeological mysteries.for kiln is the site of ancient alien ruins. among the chaotic and dangerous flora and fauna there remains no sign of the intelligence that surely must have built and inscribed the ruins with mysterious writing. the labourers, including daghdev are set to clearing the jungle from the ruins and trying to understand the animal life. it is daghdev's dream, one he is uniquely trained to do as a exo-biology scientist, but one fraught with danger. some of this comes from the threat formed by the planet itself, but mostly it comes because he has to tackle a difficult contradiction. mandate orthodoxy states that humans are the pinnacle of a neat evolutionary process. alien intelligence that goes against this threatens to not just to turn science upsidedown, but to turn the mandate's ideology inside out. this is why daghdev had no idea of kiln's reality before the arrival on the planet.on the planet life is cheap. the brutal camp commandant whose need to enforce mandate orthodoxy is only partly tempered by his desperation to understand kiln as much as his prisoner scientists. he has plenty of scientists, for in a earlier life daghdev was one of a growing revolutionary underground, and while daghdev was one of that movement's leaders, he was also part of the intellectuals whose opposition to the mandate found tiny ways to challenge the "ruling ideas" of society.these twin strands of alien exploration and revolutionary action intertwine on kiln and tchaikovsky does a brilliant job of using his intellectually unorthodox main character to be the eyes and ears of the reader as we ourselves learn about the reality of kiln. and what revelations await. even with the spoiler tags at the start of this review i don't want to give too much away, but tchaikovsky shows how thinking outside of the box is box helpful for both revolutionary leadership and for scientific enquiry. the dawning awareness of what kiln really is makes for a great story: who is actually doing the "first contact" between kiln and humanity. tchaikovsky unveils this brilliantly.unusually, i read this as an audiobook. normally i prefer physical books, but alien clay worked as audio primarily because it is a first person narrative. in places this it is borderline horror, not just because of the alien life's impact on humans, but also because prison worlds and gulags are horror filled places. the commandant knows all too well that rule comes from the barrel of a gun. in his isolated, and numerically weak position, the mandate's man on the ground, can only rule - ideologically and physically - by mimicking the rule of the state back home on earth. as such, the novels ending is perhaps a metaphor for wider revolutionary change. alien clay is one of the most unusual science fiction novels i have read in recent years. it could be written by someone prepared to push the boundaries of the science bit in science-fiction. but adrian tchaikovsky's obvious sympathy with radicals and rebels means that the revolutionary bits to the story feel remarkably real. as such, this will appeal to science fiction lovers. but it will also be enjoyed by those sitting on revolutionary committees everywhere who need a bit of a break from the actual struggle.related reviewstchaikovsky - ironcladstchaikovsky - walking to aldebarantchaikovsky - children of timetchaikovsky - children of ruin

jane harper - force of nature





this entertaining, if unsatisfying, detective story is the second of jane harper's novels featuring the detective aaron falk. unfortunately i haven't read the first, but this did not seem to effect my reading of the book at all. force of nature follows the aftermath of a corporate team building exercise gone wrong. two groups of men and women are sent into the hills outside of melbourne and expected to make their way to the end point. despite it being a well managed event by organised guides, when the group of women finally make their way out, one person is missing and others have mysterious injuries.the story is efficiently told, with harper jumping back and forth between the investigation led by falk and the account of the women's trip. she handles the points of view well, and the story of the disintegration of the lost party as personal rivalries undermine the team. there's a real tension with the missing woman alice russell, as its not clear whether she is alive or dead. unfortunately i struggled to care for any of the corporate types and their motivations felt unlikely. the detectives felt a little one-dimensional at times, and the back story felt squeezed in. all in all its a quick, tense read that lacked the dynamism and pull of jane harper's the lost man. a good light read but one i fear i will forget rather quickly.related reviews harper - the lost manhøeg - miss smilla's feeling for snow

michael scott - royal betrayal: the great baccarat scandal of 1890





the baccarat scandal of 1890 might seem like a surprising topic of interest to a marxist like myself. after all it concerns itself with a complex legal case that followed events at a rather dull sounding weekend party at tranby croft house in yorkshire, when sir william gordon-cumming, a distinguished lieutenant colonel in the scots guards was accused of cheating during two games of baccarat, where one of his opponents was the prince of wales, the future king edward vii.my interest in these events was first piqued when i read flashman and the tiger which places flashman at the dinner party itself. returning to the real world, or at least history, the 1890 scandal is of interest for the way it exposed, and continues to expose, victorian ruling class snobbery. the substance of the scandal is relatively simple. gordon-cumming was observed by one member of the party to be adding to his stake while playing baccarat in a way that would increase his winnings. rather than confront gordon-cumming, the witness told other party members who then watched the game and gordon-cumming more closely the following night. when they thought they had seen him repeat the cheat, he was confronted by the prince of wales, and encouraged to sign a paper that swore he would never play cards again. it was essentially a confession, and when the paper became public, gordon-cumming faced ruin.there are, of course, lots of facts that don't add up. once it became clear that he was now publically accused of cheating gordon-cumming had only one option - a very public court case against his accusers. the problem was that while the facts didn't add up, it was difficult to prove anything and, the establishment moved to protect the heir to the throne. the prince of wales was a wasteral. he loved gambling, adultery, and parties. he was a man of limited grasp of politics, lacking interest in rule and frequently skirted scandal. it seems that gordon-cumming was made to sign the paper to protect the prince of wales by those who realised that another public scandal with the heir to the throne playing a forbidden game (it was banned outside of public homes) could well destroy the monarchy. indeed, so low was the view of the monarchy among the public that many people thought it would die with the death of queen victoria.michael scott's book tells the story of the events leading up to the court case, and the case itself. the ending is not a spoiler. despite enormous popular support in the world at large gordon-cumming was found to have cheated and his reputation was destroyed. he was, luckily for him, able to retire to his wealthy landed estate and live his life out in pseudo-feudal splendour. so it wasn't all bad.it is clear from scott's account (and indeed every other discussion) that gordon-cumming got no justice - the judge was biased, the legal process flawed and court-room procedure was laughable. but that shouldn't be a surprise. the establishment moved to protect itself was an external threat. gordon-cummings was its victim and was a fool for allowing himself to fall into the trap set for him. he probably believed a little more in british "justice" than he should have. it's hard to care much about anyone involved here - though the prince of wales was clearly a pig, and gordon-cumming's was likely not guilty. no one seems to have asked why the immensely popular and rich soldier would need to cheat, and its clear he was a pro at the game, playing in a style that was unorthodox, but not illegal. this was a situation entirely caused by the idle rich failing to solve a problem, and enjoying the subsequent gossip and shock while plunging headlong into scandal.what of michael scott's book itself? it has all the information, but attempts to draw out new information and details add little to the story itself. whether gordon-cummings was an agent of british intelligence seems besides the point, and irrelevant. the back story that scott provides to all the characters is overwhelming and adds little. it simply serves to show the author has read lots. there's a surprising reliance on us newspaper reports of the trial, rather than british acounts - which seems to place it a little third hand. there is also a typographical problem where the extended quotations are not distinguishable from the main text, leaving the reader a little confused between what are scott's words and those of his sources. this, i suspect, is a problem with print-on demand books.ultimately the real meat of the story ought to be a critique of the establishment and its struggle to protect its own. i agree with scott's conclusion that gordon-cummings was probably innocent, but in many ways that's actually irrelevant. i'd have preferred a deeper discussion of what the trial, and scandal, told us about wider victorian society. that said, at least one journalist of the time quoted by scott, understood some of what the trial exposed, though scott just says this is "predictable" from the press on that side of the atlantic:no magistrate thinkgs of arresting him [prince of wales] for doing what an ordinary gambler would be sent to prison for doing. when he enters court to give testimony concerning his law breaking, the entire audience rises to receive him, and he is placed on a bench beside the judge as an honoured guest. and when his gambling losses and his other squanderings bring him into trouble, he asks the bread-earners of great britain to pay his debts for him. how long are the 'plain people' of great britain going to stand the false system which makes of this gambler, debauchee, and idler, teir destined ruler, and exalts him to the headship of both the church and the state?how long indeed.one footnote of interest to those of us more interested in social history of the period. one of the guests at tranby house was the socialite daisy brook, known as "babbling brook" for her love of gossip, and mistress of the prince of wales. brook was known as something of a lefty, and when she became countess of warwick, was the person who helped the agricultural trade unionist joseph arch to publish his memoirs and wrote an introduction to his autobiography. related reviewsfraser - flashman and the tigerdavid - victoria's warsmingay - rural life in victorian englanddavis - late victorian holocausts: el niño famines and the making of the third worldarch - from ploughtail to parliament: an autobiography

elie wiesel - night





it feels inadequate, or impossible, to review a book like night. reading this short work is an incredibly emotional experience. it is the first hand account of elie wiesel's time in auschwitz and then buchenwald concentration camps. as such it is intensely brutal. it begins with his life in romania, before the nazis arrived, the naive illusion among the jewish community that the war would be over before anything happened. then the panic and despair as the community is forced into ghettos and onto trains. there is nothing cheerful here. wiesel sees his mother and sisters as they disappear in one direction at the gates of auschwitz, while he and his father, warned by a inmate to lie about their ages to make them eligible, become forced labourers.this then is an account of brutality, of despair, of hunger and of the loss of faith. it is the story of millions of tragedies told through the eyes of one teenage eyewitness. wiesel struggles to keep his father alive and is successful, almost too the end, when he dies just before liberation. as the jews on wiesel's train wait outside auschwitz, some discuss rebellion. even in their weakened state, some have knives and urged others to attack the guards. "but the older men begged their sons not to be foolish" says wiesel. as the world sees the growth of the far-right and fascists, from the us to eastern europe, the most important lesson for me from night is to stop the nazis before the world goes that far again. millions of people died in that death camp at the hands of the nazis. elie wiesel's night and indeed the remainder of his life, were dedicated to saying never again. that's why it must be read by every generation.related reviewsspiegelman - the complete mausbrowning - the origins of the final solutionroseman - the villa, the lake, the meeting: wannsee and the final solution

alan wood & mary seaton wood - islands in danger





islands in danger was first published in 1955 and claims to be the first full treatment of the nazi occupation of the channel islands in world war ii. these events have an interest beyond their uniqueness. they give an indication of what might have happened had the british isles themselves been occupied by germany. unfortunately this is not a tale of systematic resistance, but rather one of official connivence, a general "keep on keeping on" attitude and rare (but incredibly brave) resistance by individuals. in addition there was brutal violence by the nazis against forced labourers, the deportation of jews and violent retribution against those british subjects who dared to oppose them.the channel islands, jersey, guerseny, sark and alderney were unusual in their location, a few miles from  france, their semi-independent government and the vestiges of feudal relations. but they were, nonetheless, part of britain. photographs (not reproduced in this book) of british policeman with their characteristic uniforms, and nazi soldiers are available. the collaboration between the two one of the great stains on this era of history.the british authorities on the islands essentially carried on doing what they needed to do. their cooperation with the nazis was pretty much complete. the bailiff of guernsey, major sherwill, made this clear at the start of the occupation when he made a long address, that included the phrase:may this occupation be a model to the world - on the one hand tolerance on the part of the military authority and courtesy and corectness on the part of the occupying forces, and on the other, dignity and courtesy and exemplary behaviour on the part of the civilian population; conformity - the strictest conformity - with orders and regulations issued by the german commandant and the civil authorities.now sherwill, it is true, did eventually get imprisoned by the nazis for his role in protecting british commandos who had landed, but failed to escape. this was, it should be said, brave. but sherwill and others set a tone for the relations with the nazis, which saw british policemen enforcing and assisting in a nazi occupation. for some the consequences were appalling. was there an alternative? the authors of this volume suggest not. but the problem is not whether sherwill et al might have led a revolutionary movement against fascism, but the extent to which they greased the wheels for the nazis. they made it easy.the problem with this volume is that it fails to properly interrogate this. there is far too much about "dad's army" still shenanigans, humourous annecdoates about how the nazis were made to remove their shoes when entering various peoples homes, and funny stories about hiding wirelesses. there is far too little about what else happened.hundreds of forced labourers worked and died on the channel islands. their treatment is discussed at length, and there are some heartbreaking anecdotes of how individual islanders tried to help them. but the question of the islands' part in the holocaust is examined less well. we know, for instance, that alderney had a transit camp for french jews to be transported to auschwitz. three jewish residents of the channel islands died in the holocaust. hundreds of other residents were imprisoned and deported. as many as 1,134 people may have died there. what do the authors say about the jews. rightly they are critical of the authorities:some actions by the authorities were harder to defend. anti-semitic edicts, emanating from the german command in france, were registered by the royal courts both in jersey and guernsey. it was felt that the number ofjews was so small—less than ten in each island—that it was not worth asking for trouble by making an issue of the matter. in guernsey there was one dissentient vote.then they describe some of the nazi attacks on jews on the channel islands:coutanche successfully resisted a proposal for making jews wear yellow stars on their backs. in the end some jews were deported to the continent.*here the asterixed footnote reads: "we were surprised to be unable to obtain any reliable information as to their ultimate fate, even from present members of the jewish communities."this is an extraordinary inadequate comment. i wonder what the authors imagined happened to the jews deported to the continent? tragically this is the only reference to what took place.in recent years there have been serious attempts to understand what took place on the channel islands, both in terms of the collaboration, the resistance and the role of the islands in the death of hundreds of people as part of the nazi holocaust. sadly this book, even allowing for limited historical data available at the time, fails to do justice to these questions. instead the authors opt for a more entertaining tale of plucky brits trying to outwit the nasty germans. in his book empire of destruction, the historian alex j. kay asks why the experience of the occupation was different in the west of europe, to that of the east. the answer, is in part, due to the nazis' project of colonisation, and their belief that the eastern population were "sub human". the tragedy of this book is that ten years after the holocaust the authors of this account did not even consider to ask such questions.related reviewsvinen - the unfree french: life under the occupationgildea - marianne in chainsgluckstein - a people's history of the second world warcobb - the resistance: the french fight against the nazis

larry mcmurtry - dead man's walk





larry mcmurtry's lonesome dove is one of the best regarded western novels of the 20th century. it certainly sustained me on a trip through the american west. the two main characters of that epic story, woodrow f. call and augustus "gus" mccrae, are two texas rangers. legendary men of the frontier whose job was to enforce frontier justice and stop the native americans halting the white settlers. dead man's walk, published a decade later, is the woodrow and gus' origin story. the tale of their first travels with the texas rangers, and the story of how they develop their friendship and the knowledge that enables them to survive on the frontier.the book begins with their first expedition in which their party is hunted and nearly destroyed by the comanche chief buffalo hump. buffalo hump is a experienced and skillful hunter and killer. he doesn't simply kill off party members one by one, he traps and hunts them like animals. his plan is to terrorise the white people off. it's a frightening experience that scars the two rangers permanently. but not enough to prevent them joining a gung ho expedition into new mexico to capture santa fe. this expedition is a disaster too, failures of leadership, experience and equipment lead the 200 strong force to be decimated and reduced to a motley crew of forty who are captured and tortured by the mexican army. the dead man's walk of the title is the desert journey the remaining rangers and the mexican troops are forced to make. one that claims many lives.like lonesome dove this is a novel that doesn't pause for breath. there are a sequence of events that blend into each other. most of them violent and characters are often only introduced to be knocked off a few chapters later. at the heart is the growing story of love and respect between woodrow and gus, their growth into adulthood and the sharing of experiences that bonds them. the growing love between gus and clara, a young woman he meets near the beginning of his adventures and will feature throughout the series, is actually a backdrop between the love of the two men.it works well as a novel, but i was uncomfortable with the depiction of the native americans. they are always violent and bloodthirsty. while they are clearly fighting for the lives and society, they feel two dimensional, depicted as violent killers to give the white characters something to revolve around. i've seen online comment that suggests this is to do with how they are seen by the main characters. but it feels lazy and inadequate. mcmurtry could have rounded out buffalo hump and his contemporaries, but instead they're too simple - untrustworthy, violent and superstitous. it felt like the worst stereotypes of the previous century and detracted from an otherwise excellent novel.related reviewsmcmurtry - lonesome dove
