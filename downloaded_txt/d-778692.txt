janet lyu is a first-year doctoral student in violin performance at the university of wisconsin–madison with professor david perry of the pro arte quartet.
in this recital, she presents three unaccompanied violin works. the first piece on the program is bach’s final violin partita in e major from his collection of six works written for unaccompanied violin, followed by a theme and variations piece by an important korean composer, yun i-sang, based on the main theme in bach’s the musical offering, and the final work is eugene ysaÿe’s second sonata which directly quotes passages from the prelude of bach’s e major partita throughout the first movement.
the program aims to showcase the master himself and how two different generations of composers born after bach’s time incorporate his famous themes in their works.
