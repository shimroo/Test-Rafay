community through adversity.





 









we believe
our players are inherently social.
players will build meaningful relationships and a name for themselves among allies and rivals.
stronger bonds within the community are built when players cooperate to overcome adversity together.
 









our commitments
as a game service, our development must evolve through a dialogue and partnership with our players.
communities will include players from around the world, so our designs must reflect and represent diverse perspectives and considerations.  we will build our development team accordingly as we grow from our core players.
achievement and truly memorable experiences depend on the contrast between high highs and low lows in gameplay.
