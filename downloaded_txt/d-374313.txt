september 09, 2007

cat 5 felix aiming for honduras









september 02, 2007









via  the sun sentinel.     the national hurricane    center in miami said felix was packing maximum sustained winds of 165 mph as    it plowed westward toward central america, where it was expected to skirt    honduras' coastline tuesday before slamming into belize on wednesday as a    hurricane capable of massive destruction.  let's hope it  misses it, and that its damage is minimum. i'll be traveling to the southern  coast of honduras this coming october, and just visited la ceiba on the northern  coast a few months ago.
