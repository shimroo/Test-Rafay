car of the year award

presented to:performance years enterprises




news release:
performance years enterprises (pye) has purchased the remaining inventory from the original "backyard conversions".
the inventory consisted of completed byc conversions, some in stages of the conversion process & some were
                  original stock versions.
we will be adding these items periodically to our web site...check back often.
i was fortunate to have had a great business as well as a good friendship with clark story & his wife jean for nearly
                  20 years until his closing the business in 2017.
byc has produced literally thousands of special limited edition releases for us at pye. several were his well known
                  convertible conversions, some were sun roofs (sunshine special), color changes, vinyl tops, stripe options added or
                  deleted, wheel & tire changes and many more. clark's talents were well know & have been said to have been the best in
                  the business. clark passed away in 2018, his talents will be missed in the die cast community.






 new items always added...for in-stock & for pre-order.
