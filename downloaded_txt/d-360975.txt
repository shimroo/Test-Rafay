leslie's love story in songs, and ours too.



ian leslie's john & paul: a love story in songs is a terrific book. i say that as a major beatles fan, though not, as i've confessed before, a fanatic. i may have collected and listened to everything paul mccartney has ever officially released, but i haven't done the same with john lennon (much less george harrison or ringo starr), and that's a failure on my part. particularly when it comes to john, i need to correct that someday. why? because as i think leslie demonstrates very well in this book, constructing any history of the lennon & mccartney musical partnership--both before and after the beatles--which doesn't put their complicated, deeply loving, often deeply resentful, and always deeply confusing relationship at the center almost certainly misses something crucial. that's not to say leslie does something here that has never been done before; any remotely attentive take on the lives of these two individuals--or at least their lives between 1957 and 1980, and the art they made during those years, both together and apart and with others--can't help but notice how much john and paul, no matter what else is going on or who else is there, are looking at and to one another, seeking approval from the other, trying to one-up one another, listening to and trusting in each other. i took that away as perhaps the defining revelation of peter jackson's wonderful reconstruction of the let it be sessions, the beatles: get back, and i know i'm not alone in thinking that way.but leslie provides the supporting evidence of the abiding artistic importance of all of john and paul's looking, listening, seeking, competing, and trusting. some of the songs he builds chapters around are, admittedly, a bit of stretch; he tells the story of these two artists chronologically, and finding the right song from the particular stretch of their lives he is chronicling (sometimes just a few weeks, sometimes several months) to match what he wants to say about respective artistic and personal as well as their relationship's evolution(s) doesn't always work. but there were so many times when the product of the lennon & mccartney songwriting partnership reflected exactly what appears to have been going on in their hearts and heads that, more often than not, the songs leslie chooses for each chapter work very well, sometimes perfectly. (i'll never think about "if i fell" or "in my life" or lennon's "god" the same way again--and it's not a coincidence that these were all john songs: while leslie's admiration for paul is endless, he makes a strong case that the brilliant and damaged john was always the force that did more to captivate or infuriate or drive forward paul as an artist, and the beatles as a band, than was the case for any other single member.)anyway, this is a first-rate work of both popular biography and musical criticism; i have to set it alongside rob sheffield's dreaming the beatles as the best book i've ever read about that band, despite its limitations (he puts an official apology at the end of the book, expressing regret that, because of his thesis--as defensible and correct as i think it is--george harrison and ringo starr get pushed aside). check it out, if you're any kind of fan of the 1960s at all; you're learn something from it, and maybe be inspired by it too.

justice together: praying, planning, and partly (but not yet entirely) pushed aside in wichita




[cross-posted to wichita story]before christmas, i
had some complimentary things to say about wichita’s city council. here at
the end of the year, though, my thoughts are more critical—though this is
really a story about an organization of citizens here in wichita, one that has
pushed and challenged the city council, with some (but not total) success.

justice together, an association of
nearly 1500 volunteers from nearly 40 wichita-area congregations, synagogues,
and other religious bodies, made local history several months ago, when, at
a major public assembly, they pressed and received commitments from various
elected leaders that certain positive steps would be taken to assist the
homeless population of wichita. their well-researched calls for 1) more free
bus passes for those with mental health needs, for 2) more staffing for on-call
psychiatric assistance, for 3) a sustainable budget plan for completing and
operating the planned multi-agency center (mac) which aims to bring together
resources for homeless individuals, and for 4) a free municipal id program, all
remain on the table. but two weeks ago a proposed set of changes to how the
city deals with homelessness threatened to derail the compassionate efforts
that justice together, along with many other municipal organizations (wichita’s
coalition
to end homelessness deserves much credit here), had pushed for. 

fortunately, wichita’s city
council was convinced (or pressured) to bypass the worst feature of these
proposed changes, and the role jt played in that effort (in over two hours of public
comment before the city council on december 17, 21 of the 24 speakers
opposed the proposed changes, and more than a third of those were associated
with justice together) deserves praise. still, the fact that the
other changes which passed through the council on a 4 to 3 vote will increase
the ability of law enforcement to treat homeless individuals from a criminal
rather than a compassionate perspective is evidence of how much more, and perhaps
how much further, the kind of activism jt represents has to go. 

as was pointed out by multiple speakers (as well
as a couple of members of the council from the bench), the proposed changes in
wichita’s policies were less rooted in local changes (though wichita’s homeless
population has increased, as it has in cities both large and small across the
country, for dozens of often intertwined reasons) than they were in national
decisions. when the u.s. supreme court handed down its majority decision in city of
grants pass v. johnson last summer, making it clear that criminalizing
“public camping”—a euphemism that we all know is ridiculous (“camping” is a voluntary
recreational activity, while sleeping or residing outside without shelter in
public places is practically never either of those) but seem doomed to use
anyway—would not be considered an unconstitutional punishment someone for their
condition, but would instead be considered a nominally constitutional
punishment of an action, the
door to more aggressive enforcement of anti-homelessness policies was kicked
wide open. honestly, those of us wichitans who recognize both the increased
costs as well as the lack of compassion which the further criminalizing
homelessness entails should probably be grateful that the city’s proposals
didn’t go any further than they did.
as someone who has been
associated with justice together since its beginning in early 2023, i
received word of the prayer meeting being planned for the day of the city
council meeting. multiple faith leaders set the tone for the dozens who
gathered for the meeting by emphasizing that pushing back, in whatever peaceful
way we can, against adding burdens to the lives of those suffering from
whatever mix of causes—poverty, trauma, mental illness, drug or alcohol
addiction, or all of the above—which had left them living without permanent
shelter was a shared religious demand. as
i’ve written before, jt is not a radical organization; rather, it is a
serious, careful, realistic group of believers, who work in the tradition of
rev. martin luther king, jr., in 1) researching and proposing responsible plans
premised upon compassion and justice, and then 2) presenting their plans before
elected leaders in ways that create tension, thereby hopefully forcing action
and progress. that was the plan a few weeks ago, with a
summary of the changes wichita’s government was proposing and an action
plan laying out a bullet-pointed list of justice together’s primary
concerns handed out beforehand. (the individuals in the photo above, from the justice together prayer meeting before the city council chambers on the morning of december 17, are, from left to right: pastor chad langdon of christ lutheran church; deacon lory mills of st. bartholomew’s and st. andrew’s episcopal church; justice together co-president rabbi andrew pepperstone of ahavath achim congregation; and rev. dr. karen robu of plymouth congregational church.)

topping the list of those
concerns was that the city, in the wake of grants pass, intended to “remove
a requirement that a shelter bed be available for anyone displaced by an
encampment removal”—in other words, to no longer oblige law enforcement to
confirm that there are beds available at public shelters before enforcing
anti-“camping” rules and forcing a homeless person to move from whatever
location of rest they’d found for themselves. this central issue was
highlighted by rabbi andrew pepperstone, the co-president of justice together,
when he stood to speak before the city council (two other speakers, revs.
travis smith mckee of the disciples of christ and jacob l. poindexter of the
united church of christ, later underscored rabbi pepperstone’s demand): the
“removal of bed space verification” from those tasked with the often ugly task
of disrupting the attempt of the homeless to find a secure corner or underpass
somewhere in public space has, in his words, “no compassionate rationale that i
can conceive of.” he challenged the city council to strip that policy change
from the proposal, which resulted in some city leaders playing hot potato,
suggesting that this odious proposal was really just a matter of police protocol.
but thankfully, whomever ultimately owns this obligation, the result was a
positive one. the policy changes voted on ended up preserving this restriction,
thus making it at least still slightly difficult for those experiencing
homelessness to be forced to move and to abandon many of their possessions like
herd animals and not human beings.
justice together also opposed,
along with other groups, expanding the number of city workers who could wield
that kind of police power against the homeless, another proposed change which
the city council was convinced to drop. unfortunately, though, the other
priority of jt—opposing “a change to shorten the notice to vacate period before
an encampment is removed, from 72 hours to 48 hours, and in some cases, allow
removal without notice”—went through. perhaps that’s unsurprising; the city
staff made it clear in their presentation to the council that there was,
functionally speaking, only two elements of the proposed changes which they
considered truly substantive: getting rid of the bed requirement, and allowing
for the more immediate removal of homeless persons and the clean-up of their
sleeping locations. despite complaints that went far beyond the religiously
motivated—there were speakers who challenged the proposed ordinances from
libertarian perspectives on human rights, and conservative speakers who pointed
out all the additional costs which ramping up enforcement requires—wichita
will, beginning probably in mid-january, join the
host of american cities that are responding to the increase of the homeless
population with even more criminalization, even if conjoining that with some
additional compassion.

that additional compassion is
obviously vital. justice together’s slogan for their (in retrospect, only
partly successful) action was “invest in a fully funded mac, not
criminalization of homelessness,” and there was much discussion of how to move
forward with finding the funds necessary to keeping the plans for the mac on
track, and many supportive words from city council members for doing so. (there
was an update on plans for the free municipal id as well, which still seems to
me likely the most important single non-structural action wichita could take to
assist the city’s homeless.) ultimately, though, those who have dedicated so
much time and effort to justice together must now consider their next steps. 

do they accept this defeat and
continue to focus on pushing our elected leaders on the social justice issues which
they have not foreclosed? that seems most likely; what jt’s volunteers are best
at is speaking practically about policy options and researching how other
cities have funded programs or dealt with changes in the legal landscape is the
kind of action that appeals to their skill set best. but there is also the
possibility of reconsidering what kind of, and how much, tension they can
productively generate—perhaps while looking towards this year’s municipal elections,
with the aim of changing one of those 4 yes votes. becoming an interest group
which actively promotes or opposes candidates would give justice together a
very different and much more contentious vibe, yet political challenges are
part of the toolkit of any successful advocacy organization, whether they’re
used or not. (sometimes, simply the knowledge that an organization could
organize their forces—in this case, many hundreds of mostly middle or
upper-middle class wichitans in dozens of well-established religious
congregations, the great majority of which are likely voters—can be persuasive
enough.) 

justice together has worked with and through the
religious faith of thousands of wichitans over the past 2 years to advance the
conversation about social justice in our city. as a supporter, i am curious to
see how its leadership will continue to try to advance our shared ideals, even
as the opposition to some of what has been labored over pushes back. as in so
many other ways, 2025 will be a very telling year.

the 10 best books i read in 2024





ian angus, the war against the commons: dispossession and
resistance in the making of capitalism (2023) and wendell berry, the
need to be whole: patriotism and the history of prejudice (2022). 
i put these two books together in my head not because they
are similar, because they are not—the former is a succinct, straightforward,
deeply earnest but also very dry marxist history of the enclosure movement in
great britain, the latter is a rambling, profoundly personal and discursive and
sometime repetitive set of reflections by the author on the legacy of slavery,
the devastation of the farming economy, and how american exceptionalism and predatory
capitalism ties them both together. i put them together because, as i
elaborated here,
the excellent analysis of the former helped me find the best, most profound
insights of the latter. 
fred dallmayr, truth and politics: toward a post-secular
community (2022)
fred dallmayr, a long-time professor of politics and
philosophy at the university of notre dame who passed away this year, was never
one of my teachers—directly, that is. indirectly, he was an inspiration and, in
a very small way, a friend, and on the occasion of his passing i went back and
read deeper from his massive corpus. what
i found, among many other wise and challenging observations, was a
different way to talk about the post-liberal moment, a way that america will
almost certainly not be able to make use of, to our great loss. 
grant hardy, ed., the annotated book of mormon (2023) 
grant hardy’s decades of work on the book of mormon—the central
holy scripture of my religious tradition—has resulted in multiple previous
works of devotion and scholarship that i’ve learned much from. last year, he
finally was able to achieve something of a magnum opus: a complete critical edition
of the text of the book of mormon itself. my
appreciation of it, as both a believer and a doubter (and how much do those
two go together!), is massive, to say the least. 
stanley hauerwas and william h. willimon, resident aliens
(1989)
in
2023, one of the best books i read was by stanley hauerwas, a radical
christian thinker whose essays and ideas i’d long thought about, but whom i’d
never really studied before. this year i continued with that new direction by
giving hauerwas’s probably most famous book a read, and i wasn’t disappointed.
co-written with william willimon, when both of them were young scholars and
pastors, this book lays down the fundamentals of hauerwas’s radically barthian,
church-over-culture, christianity-over-society, perspective, the one which
later came to be called “neo-anabaptist.” reading this book at the same time as
the 2024 elections, its constant reminders of the uselessness of trying to make
christianity “relevant” to a world of violence, competition, and exploitation, was
a deeply persuasive experience, to say the least. 
charles marohn, escaping the housing trap: the strong
towns response to the housing crisis (2024)
chuck marohn hasn’t yet written a book that i haven’t found
bursting with concepts and conclusions worth wrestling with, and his latest is
probably the bursting-est yet. this is the first time marohn has written with a
co-author, and perhaps that was necessary; the strong towns approach to america’s
housing crisis obliges him to weigh in on a huge number of historical, financial,
political, and sociological issues, far beyond his earlier works which focused
on the comparatively more straight-forward questions of community
sustainability and transportation
management. i’ve found myself in multiple arguments over this book, and it’s
advice is definitely not the final word on figuring out how to both build
ourselves out of, and better arrange our financing of, america’s housing problems.
but his words are worth
listening to all the same. 
eva piirimäe, herder and enlightenment politics
(2023)
when i was in graduate school in the 1990s, i discovered the
communitarian-liberalism debates of the 1980s, which in turn led me to charles
taylor, which in turn led me to german romanticism, and in particular the
philosophy and criticism of johann gottfried herder, a late 18th-century
german educator, translator, and lutheran pastor, one of the truly great—and often
frustratingly changeable—intellects of the enlightenment era. i wrote my
dissertation on him, but the days when i thought i would be a true herder
scholar and intellectual historian are long past. still, every once in a while
the blessings of academia allow me to dive once
more back
into this area of scholarship—and for the first time in a decade, 2024
allowed me that, with the opportunity to review
new book that is, in some ways, genuinely path-breaking, at least insofar
as english-language scholarship on herder is concerned. it reminded me of, and
perhaps opened up, some old paths for me, and for that i’m grateful for.
george scialabba, what are intellectuals good for?
(2009) and only a voice: essays (2023)
scialabba is a near-legendary critic and pundit, at least
among that small group of writers, publishers, and thinkers that make up america’s
tiny-but-not-quite-extinct-yet population of “public intellectuals.” a man who
made his name writing sharp, both open-minded but also deeply opinionated essays
on important intellectual figures of both the past and present, i’d read
several of the pieces in this first collection years ago. fortunately, the
opportunity to write
an essay on scialabba gave me a chance to both re-read them, and peruse
this latest collection. everything in them is brilliant, even if you find his
consistently contrary (and, i would argue, in important ways “conservative”)
leftism not to your taste.
paul b. thompson, the agrarian vision: sustainability and
environmental ethics (2010)
returning
once again to last year, one of the best books i read in 2023 was the wonderfully
dense yet still student-friendly introduction to “sustainability” as a general
topic, sustainability: what everyone needs to know, which thompson wrote
with a co-author, patricia norris. this year i finally worked through a book of
his published articles and essays--published over a period of 20 years from the
late 1980s to the late 2000s--that i’ve had on my shelf for years, and i wasn’t
disappointed. while much of what is included here has long since become
familiar within the field, he still often surprised me with creative insights (his
essay focusing on a reading of the grapes of wrath and the john ford
film adaptation of it particularly stands out). overall, this book is an excellent,
thoughtful review of the difficulties and opportunities which thinking
seriously about agrarianism, environmentalism, and the differences between them
presents.

quotes

"every one of the standards according to which action is condemned demands action. although the dignity of persons is inevitably violated in action, this dignity would be far less recognized in the world than it is had it not been supported by actions such as the establishment of constitutions and the fighting of wars in defense of human rights. action must be untruthful, yet religion, science, philosophy, and the arts, the main forms of absolute fidelity to the truth, could not survive were they unsupported by action. action cannot but be anticommunal in some measure, yet communal relationships would be almost nonexistent without areas of peace and order, which are created by action. we must act hesitantly and regretfully, then, but still we must act."(glenn tinder, the political meaning of christianity: the prophetic stance [harpersanfrancisco, 1991], 215)"[t]he press was still the last resource of the educated poor who could not be artists and would not be tutors. any man who was fit for nothing else could write an editorial or a criticism....the press was an inferior pulpit; an anonymous schoolmaster; a cheap boarding-school; but it was still the nearest approach to a career for the literary survivor of a wrecked education."(henry adams, the education of henry adams [mariner books, 2000], 211)"mailer was a left conservative. so he had his own point of view. to himself he would suggest that he tried to think in the style of [karl] marx in order to attain certain values suggested by edmund burke."(norman mailer, the armies of the night [the new american library, 1968], 185)"all those rely on their hands, and each is skillful at his own craft. / without them a city would have no inhabitants; no settlers or travellers would come to it. / yet they are not in demand at public discussions, nor do they attain to high office in the assembly. they do not sit on the judge's bench or understand the decisions of the courts. they cannot expound moral or legal principles and are not ready with maxims. / but they maintain the fabric of this world, and the practice of their craft is their prayer."(ecclesiasticus (sirach) 38:31-34, in the revised english bible with the apocrypha [oxford university press, 1989])"the tendency, which is too common in these days, for young men to get a smattering of education and then think themselves unsuited for mechanical or other laborious pursuits is one that should not be allowed to grow up among us...every one should make it a matter of pride to be a producer, and not a consumer alone."(wilford woodruff, millennial star [november 14, 1887], 773)"we are parts of the world; no one of us is an isolated world-whole. we are human beings, conceived in the body of a mother, and as we stepped into the larger world, we found ourselves immediately knotted to a universe with the thousand bands of our senses, our needs and our drives, from which no speculative reason can separate itself."(j.g. herder, metacritique of the critique of pure reason in werke in zehn bänden [deutsche klassiker verlag, 1985-2000], 8:508, translated by sonia sikka)"'business!' cried the ghost, wringing its hands again. 'mankind was my business. the common welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence, were all my business. the dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business!'"(charles dickens, a christmas carol [candlewick press, 2006], 35)"the master said, 'at fifteen, i set my mind upon learning; at thirty, i took my place in society; at forty, i became free of doubts; at fifty, i understood heaven's mandate; at sixty, my ear was attuned; and at seventy, i could follow my heart's desires without overstepping the bounds of propriety.'"(confucius, analects [translated by edward slingerland, hackett, 2003], 2.4)"that drunken poet from whom you would not take a dreary tragedy, he believed in himself. that elderly minister with an epic from whom you are hiding in the back room, he believed in himself. if you consulted your business experience instead of your ugly individualistic philosophy, you would know that believing in himself is one of the commonest signs of a rotter. actors who can't act believe in themselves; and debtors who won't pay. it would be much truer to say that a man will certainly fail because he believes in himself. complete self-confidence is not merely a sin; complete self-confidence is a weakness." (gilbert k. chesterton, orthodoxy [bradford and dickens, 1957], 10)"lack of experience diminishes our power of taking a comprehensive view of the admitted facts. hence those who dwell in intimate association with nature and its phenomena grow more and more able to formulate, as the foundations of their theories, principles which admit a wide and coherent development: while those whom devotion to abstract discussions has rendered unobservant of the facts are too ready to dogmatize on the basis of a few observations."(aristotle, on generation and corruption [translated by h.h. joachim, oxford, 1922], lines 316a5-9)"the man who has gone through college or university easily becomes psychically unemployable in manual occupations without necessarily acquiring employability in, say, professional work."(joseph schumpeter, capitalism, socialism, and democracy [harper perennial, 1975], 152)"[god] does not want men to give the future their hearts, to place their treasure in it. . . . his ideal is a man who, having worked all day for the good of posterity (if that is his vocation), washes his mind of the whole subject, commits the issue to heaven, and returns at once to the patience or gratitude demanded by the moment that is passing over him."(c.s. lewis, the screwtape letters, revised paperback edition [macmillan, 1982], 69)"money is simply a tool. we use money as a proxy for our time and labor--our life energy--to acquire things that we cannot (or care not to) procure or produce with our own hands. beyond that, it has limited actual utility: you can't eat it; if you bury it in the ground, it will not produce a crop to sustain a family; it would make a lousy roof and a poor blanket. to base our understanding of economy simply on money overlooks all other methods of exchange that can empower communities. equating an economy only with money assumes there are no other means by which we can provide food for our bellies, a roof over our heads and clothing on our backs."(shannon hayes, radical homemakers, [left to write, 2010], 57)"was du ererbt von deinen vätern hast, / erwirb es, um es zu besitzen. / was man nicht nützt, ist eine schwere last; / nur was der augenblick erschafft, das kann er nützen.""what from your fathers you received as heir, / acquire [anew] if you would possess it. / what is not used is but a load to bear; / but if today creates it, we can use and bless it."(johann wolfgang goethe, faust [translated by walter kaufmann, anchor books, 1963], lines 682-685)"a scholar's business is to add to what is known. that is all. but it is  capable of giving the very greatest satisfaction, because knowledge is  good. it does not have to look good or even sound good or even do good.  it is good just by being knowledge. and the only thing that makes it  knowledge is that it is true. you can't have too much of it and there is  no little too little to be worth having. there is truth and falsehood  in a comma."(tom stoppard [spoken by a.e. houseman], the invention of love [grove press, 1997], 37)"i believe in democracy. i accept it. i will faithfully serve and defend it. i believe in it because it appears to me the inevitable consequence of what has gone before it. democracy asserts the fact the masses are now raised to a higher intelligence than formerly. all our civilization aims at this mark. we want to do what we can to help it. i myself want to see the result. i grant that it is an experiment, but it is the only direction society can take that is worth its taking; the only conception of its duty large enough to satisfy its instincts; the only result that is worth an effort or a risk. every other possible step is backward, and i do not care to repeat the past. i am glad to see society grapple with issues in which no one can afford to be neutral."(henry adams, democracy: an american novel [farrar, straus, and young, inc., 1952], 53)"old men ought to be explorers / here or there does not matter / we must be still and still moving / into another intensity / for a further union, a deeper communion / through the dark cold and the empty desolation, / the wave cry, the wind cry, the vast waters / of the petrel and the porpoise. in my end is my beginning." (t.s. eliot, "east coker," four quarters [harcourt, 1943])
