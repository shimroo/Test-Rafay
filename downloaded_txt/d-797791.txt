						“as paladin’s network of volunteer opportunities grows, it’s important to us to continually find ways to make it even easier for lawyers to connect with low-income individuals in need. justiceserver has an intuitive and well-designed platform to support legal services organizations’ pro bono clients, and the integration was a natural next step in amplifying their important work.”					


kristen sondayceo, paladin
