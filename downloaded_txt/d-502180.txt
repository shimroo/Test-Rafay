add your voice
community voices in research (cvr) is a community-powered registry that gathers information through surveys offering researchers a 360-degree view of what it is like to live with a bleeding disorder. open to all persons affected by an inherited bleeding disorder as well as their non-affected family members (parents, spouses, grandparents, and siblings), it provides all the opportunity to participate in patient-reported outcomes research.
