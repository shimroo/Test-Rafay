â¢ csa archival work many documents were created for csa's digital archiving efforts. those archival efforts have all been discontinued, but the documents concerning archival needs and procedures remain valuable. they may be found via the archives page.
 
projects:
â¢ the csa propylaea project.
	this was a cooperative project to create a single digital resource of information about the propylaea. the project has been terminated, as has the website at propylaea.org. all materials produced may now be accessed through the archaeology data service in york, england.

â¢ lantern slides of classical antiquity 
	this project was a joint csa/bryn mawr college project. lantern slides from the college collection were digitized and made available on the web, and high-resolution images were archived for future use. this project is now maintained by bryn mawr college.
â¢ pompeii forum project csa participates in this on-going project, directed by prof. john j. dobbins (university of virginia), to study the forum of ancient pompeii. a computer-aided design model is being constructed of the forum.
â¢ bryn mawr electronic resources review (bmerr).
bmerr was an online journal for reviews of electronic resources concerning
the ancient world. bryn mawr classical review (bmcr) is now publishing reviews
of electronic resources, and bmerr has discontinued its separate existence.
reviews published 1998-2000 are now available through the bmcr web site (http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/) and they are available via the bmerr page there. 
â¢ the csa guide to archaeological projects was a database of current archaeological projects maintained by csa. interest in participation was inadequate to justify continuing this project, and the information slowly grew out of date as well. as a result, the web pages have been removed.

about this document.
 




 
the center for the study of architecture, csa, is devoted to advancing the use of digital information technologies in the service of architectural history, archaeology, and related disciplines.
welcome to the csa web site. csa's aim is to encourage appropriate
uses of computers and information technology by those involved in research
in archaeology and architectural history - and those who will need the fruits
of that research. the key word is appropriate. in these still relatively early stages of the digital era it is not easy to know how best to use the new computing power that has become available to us. nor is it obvious which technologies will turn out to be the best and most appropriate for a given use. perhaps most important, it is very difficult to find sources of information about these technologies, especially the ways they can be applied to scholarly work. it is csa's mission to help guide users and potential users of information technologies so that, at the least, they can make well-considered choices of computers and software and find resources to guide them in the effective use of the technology. 
if you encounter any problems with our site, please let us know through the email 
address listed for the director on our email contacts page.

comments concerning any csa resources are encouraged and appreciated. suggestions for improvement, criticisms, and disagreements should, to the extent possible, be made known to anyone who may wish to use those resources. therefore, we will follow the following formal procedure to encourage additions, corrections, and enhancements to csa resources:
any reader may comment on any item by sending the comments to csa director, harrison (nick) eiteljorg, ii, at the email address  on our email contacts page. the commenting reader must identify himself or herself by full name (and position if desired) and provide an email address for contact. the comment will be put into html form in
consultation with its author and posted. a link to the comment will be placed on the resource. (links will always be placed in the title areas in the form of an icon with the phrase "csa reader commentary" or "csa newsletter commentary," as appropriate) the name of the reader (and position when supplied) and the date of the comment will be included on the secondary page, as will subsequent comments about the same resource (making only one linked page per resource as the maximum, no matter how many comments). illustrations are welcome. the email address of the reader(s) will be available either on the web page or from csa, at the reader's discretion.
the linked page with comments will present the comments in standard chronological order, not in the reverse order made popular by blogs. the author of the resource will be asked to respond to the reader's comments, but the reader's comments will be posted when received and will not have to await the author's response unless the author and reader wish to work together on the comment.
mr. eiteljorg reserves the right to reject profane, commercial, or unrelated comments.
an example of this new procedure may be found for the article "high dynamic range photography," by harrison eiteljorg, ii; xix, 2; fall, 2006. (http://www.csanet.org/newsletter/fall06/nlf0603.html)
