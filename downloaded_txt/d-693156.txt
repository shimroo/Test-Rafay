mpiwsc has been amazing with all the free webinars they have given, all the training, and the classes that planners can take...all things i can easily implement into my job. these tools are education that i can use. people who have been in the industry longer than me are sharing their knowledge with me, so i don't have to reinvent the wheel. i can learn from those who came before me.
