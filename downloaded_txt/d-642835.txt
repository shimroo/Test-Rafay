fish fights!!





last time i updated this blog, i mentioned that i added three new red minor tetras to the 6 gal. tank. soon, i noticed these new guys were not so friendly with their neon cousins. a couple of days later, i started noticing my neon tetras were having partially nibbled tails and fins. i had read on several websites on red minors being semi-aggressive, territorial and fin nippers. but the same sites advised keeping them with other tetras... well i guess they were wrong!!i moved wukum back to the 6gal and moved the red minors to the larger tank. in their earlier days in the new tank, they tried to get a bite on the zebra's long fins. but the danios retaliated very well. now the minors seem to be more behaved and peaceful with their other tank mates. however, i am not surprised when i see one of the smaller rasboras with a bite mark on their tail. i am still debating whether to move the rasboras back into the 6gal or add 3 more neons.will post some photos over the weekend.
