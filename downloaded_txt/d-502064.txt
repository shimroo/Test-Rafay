    a place to grow spiritually

at community baptist church, we seek to bring glory to god by proclaiming the good news of jesus christ, baptizing new believers and making disciples. we emphasize clear scriptural truths through sound biblical preaching and teaching
"for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of christ: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the son of god, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ" (ephesians 4:12-13)
