why we do itwe believe that if we provide youth with relevant services and programs, meaningful engagement with caring adults, and opportunities to practice leadership they will become change agents and contributors to a healthy thriving community. this formula for change maintains that healthy involved people can influence policy and ultimately create healthier, safer, and economically robust communities. it recognizes that youth are inherently resilient and that risk can be reduced with the right set of supports, services, and opportunities.















where we do ityouth uprising’s systems change work moves the institutions and policies that impact youth including public safety, healthcare, economic development and jobs, housing, and education. youth staff, interns, and volunteers are actively involved in leading these efforts—from resident engagement and legislative advocacy to creating public awareness campaigns and working on oversight boards and commissions.
