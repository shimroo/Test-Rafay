black boy’s don’t talk



a film by marc stallion



lynn, a rookie journalist, gets assigned on her first week to do an exclusive with duffman brown, a failed college football star. the narrative that her boss gives her to follow quickly falls apart as duffman sees right through her attempts to make him look like a bad guy. lynn learns who duffman really is and changes the narrative of his article, her boss isn’t happy about this or lynn’s new attachment to duffamn. after duffman attempts to use lynn as a suicide note, the two of them build a friendship while he’s in recovery. they agree to embark on a journey together to ensure that this will not happen to any other black boys like duffman, suffering from mental health challenges.
