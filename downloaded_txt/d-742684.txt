bienvenido ainternational institute of modern butlersteaching the right mindset, interpersonal skills, and superior service experiencewelcome to the international institute of modern butlers, now in its second decade of operation and already referred to as “an ivy league institution of butlers.” we were originally established at the request of others in the profession to help set and raise standards, which we did through articles, books, consulting and training in private residences and later hotels and resorts around the world.

testimonials“in my experience, the best training i have ever attended. i can apply the knowledge both at work and in real life. before i had gaps in my butler position that are already covered with this training. the instructors are amazing; they gave us the best training.”




“top quality training, with theoretical and practical knowledge. i now understand the butler's way of thinking, as well as the high expectations that customers expect of me. the instructors are very good and professional and the teaching style is very good.”
