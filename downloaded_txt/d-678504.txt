 welcome to "thechestnut.com"
the home of little gems    this site is dedicated to 
the little gems of children's television programs that have long faded into memory 
such as moondial, into the labyrinth, the herbs, cockleshell bay, alias the jester, 
belle and sebastien, murun buchstansangur, the singing ringing tree, simon in 
the land of chalk drawings (as shown on captain kangaroo) and portland bill. it 
also includes recently discovered gems such as the big knights. these and other 
classics may no longer be seen on our television screens but we hope that this 
site will bring back vivid memories of those lazy days of the summer school holidays. 
if you have any thoughts, suggestions, additions etc. then please email me.as with all these childrens' programs, into the distance and into memory, we will not see their like again.
