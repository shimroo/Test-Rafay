jack's wine is small family owned business having a go at selling online
we are a small family owned business who is having a crack at selling wine online. we do not claim to be the biggest and cheapest in australia, there are enough of these claims from online everywhere in australia. what we do is have a good selection of wines that we think represent exceptional value for money.
some wines you have have never heard of. some you probably have, but the main thing is you get on the phone or email me and ask me a question about any of the wines and i will give you an honest answer. my rule is that i would never sell you anything that i would not drink myself.
we are based in beautiful ballarat victoria and all our deliveries come from ballarat. so what have you got to loose, give us a go and support a small business in australia.
my best buy at the moment is the " secret label bendigo shiraz" it is just an outstanding wine and once you taste it you will see why it is the number one selling wine in our store.
my name is jack simic and i am the proud owner of this business and you can call me on 0353321176 and have a chat about anything, including wine.
