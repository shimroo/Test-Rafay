what makes an effective heat pipe cpu heatsink?


thu: 05/30/2024
topic: cooling / heatsinks     permalink by: max page
	
   heat pipes are incredibly efficient thermal management devices used in the construction of most of the cpu coolers frostytech has reviewed. though simple in appearance, these thin copper tubes bent into gentle curves literally determine the fate of your computer hardware!
the performance of any heatsink is significantly influenced by the type of wick structure inside the heat pipe used in its manufacture. a wick is essentially a microscopic structure on the inside of the heat pipe whose sole function is to return working fluid by capillary action.
so what goes into an effective heat pipe based cpu cooler?

cooling specialists expanding capacity for 5g handset


fri: 03/06/2020
topic: business / industry     permalink by: max page
	
   "taiwan-based thermal solutions providers are keenly proceeding with capacity expansions for heat pipes and vapor chambers seeking to meet robust demand for 5g handset applications though the coronavirus outbreak may temporarily weaken sales of the new-generation phones, according to industry sources.
chaun-choung technology is reportedly to expand its production capacity for both kinds of heat dissipation modules at its china plants in kunshan and chongqing in the first half of 2020 to better tap 5g-driven business opportunities. its peers auras technology and taisol electronics are also moving to carry out similar capacity expansion plants, the sources said.

except for apple, which may continue adopting graphite sheets for 5g iphones' cooling, other major handset vendors are expected to incorporate either heat pipes or vapor chambers into their sub-6ghz or mmwave 5g models.

vapor chambers are 3-4 times better than heat pipes in terms of heat dissipation capability and are more expensive, and therefore may be adopted by vendors in their high-end and flagship 5g smartphones while heat pipes may be mostly applied to lower-end 5g models, the sources said....
