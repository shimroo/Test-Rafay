welcome
canavan research illinois (cri) is a nonprofit corporation and 501(c)(3) public charity based in illinois. we were established in april 
			2000 to meet a critical need to support medical research to treat, cure, and improve the quality of lives of all children 
			   battling canavan disease, a rare fatal genetic neurological disorder. 
canvavan research illinois is also known as canavan disease reasearch. canavan disease research is the international division of canavan research illinois. cri is leading the fight to cure canavan disease through private 
			   fundraising efforts, networking affected families and launching the first international 
			patient registry.
canavan disease is a rare inherited genetic disorder that damages the ability of nerve cells (neurons) in the brain to send and receive 
			messages. this disease is one of a group of genetic disorders called leukodystrophies. leukodystrophies disrupt the growth or maintenance 
			of the myelin sheath, which is the covering that protects nerves and promotes the efficient transmission of nerve impulses.
