    one parish. one school.

one faith community.
 
rooted in our sacramental celebrations of the eucharist, we seek to shape our future in a positive way through our parish school, religious education, youth ministry programs and numerous christian services. while maintaining a strong sense of catholic tradition, we look for ways to revitalize our christian values through more openness to god's word and our gospel call to love god and neighbor. trusting in the holy spirit, we seek new ways of being a church for members, active or not, as well as reaching out to the wider community.

  and jesus came and said to them, "all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe all that i have commanded you; and lo, i am with you always, to the close of the age."
