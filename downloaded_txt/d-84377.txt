welcome to madison, wisconsin
you might know us as the capital city. or maybe you know us as the place where farm-to-table started or as a platinum-level biking city. our native american founders knew us as teejop, in reference to madison's many lakes. sports fans know us as badgers. locals know us as the best place to live in america. if you don't know us yet, welcome. if you've been here before, we're so happy to have you back. no matter who you are, we give you an always-on invitation.
