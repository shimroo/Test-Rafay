											i don´t want to be alone during a hurricane, what can i do?
									 	

living alone in hurricane country
if you are an older adult, living alone, you don't have to ride out the storm alone. form a hurricane club" with other older persons who live alone as well. listed below are things your "club" can do to prepare for a hurricane. 
meet at least twice a month to discuss what must be done for hurricane preparedness.
decide in who's home your "safe room" should be. this should be a central location that can be reached in a matter of moments with little to no difficulty. 
assign persons to help those who will need assistance in reaching the safe room.
form a "phone tree" to pass on information should a hurricane threaten. 
make a list of hurricane supplies and assign each person several items to contribute to the stash. each person should also have a hurricane emergency kit suited to their own needs, (see the category on this website dealing with 72-hour emergency kits). have a meeting to discuss assembling these kits and see if anyone will need help in acquiring the contents. sometimes deals can be had if purchasing cases of items that can be divided up for individual kits, thus saving you money and time. if this is the case, assign each person items to purchase for the individual kits. i am always running across bargains to share with my friends. these kits should be stored either in the home of the safe room or in a highly accessible place in each members homes so as not to be overlooked in times of evacuation to the safe room.
make a list of things to do, such as making window panels, tapping windows, making the safe room safe.
make a chart showing who will help do what to ensure that each member's homes are prepared for the hurricane. (several of the men could be responsible for putting up shutters or plywood window panels, women could be responsible for filling water jugs, making sure that everyone turns up refrigerators and freezers, etc.)
assign one person to keep updated on the weather and what watches and warnings are issued. this person would then call the head of the phone tree to start the process of notification of other members. if a warning is issued, the phone tree would then advise all members to meet at the safe room and remind them to bring any emergency supplies they are in charge of. 
a club of this nature keeps you from having the added stress and fear of weathering a storm alone. a lot of seniors are not living close to family members and are anxious when faced with the possibility of being alone during a disaster such as a hurricane. this way, you are not alone and it is a great way to make friends and be totally prepared. as it is often said, there is safety in numbers!

											what things can i do to prepare for a hurricane?
									 	

advice for older adults (part two)
if you are living alone or with a partner unassisted, there are things you should do to prepare in case of a hurricane. older adults have special concerns and these should be addressed before a hurricane happens.
if a hurricane has been forecast, keep a battery-operated radio handy for weather updates. while the electricity is still on, keep a radio or televison set on to keep up on the storm. follow all instructions as to evacuation, watches or warnings. 
make an emergency kit for yourself and your spouse or partner. include copies of identification, list of medications you are on, any special health problems, insurance cards, and important papers such as insurance policies for your home, car and other property. (see my tips on emergency kits under 72-hour kits on this website.) keep this kit in a place that is accessable at all times.
have a list of important names, addresses and phone numbers wher they can be easily accessed. include family, friends, doctors, hospitals, etc.
in the event of a warning, notify someone of your whereabouts and your intentions should you need to evacuate.
if you are going to drive, notify someone of your intended route, alternate routes and your final destination. telephone them when you are leaving and give them a rough estimate of your arrival time. gas up your car well in advance and keep it in good repair.
make sure you have on hand enough medications for at least four weeks. keep a spare pair of glasses on hand in case of one pair is damaged or broken. 
if you live in a mobile home be aware that evacuation in most counties is mandatory.

											if i am an older adult living in a hurricane prone area what do i do?
									 	

advice for older adults (part one)
in florida, there are a great number of retired adults and elderly, frail or disabled people. the normally mild and warm weather agrees with them and offers a wonderful living environment. but, when a hurricane strikes, there are those who will definitely need assistance.
elderly persons are especially susceptible to the effects of a hurricane. those who live alone or are without the support of family or friends must take special precautions in the event of an emergency situation. people who are frail or disabled either physically or mentally may need special assistance from family members, friends or social service agencies. older adults who are also caregivers may require outside assistance. excessive stress and anxiety can contribute to increased episodes of illness, particularly for persons with heart disease and other illnesses. if an older adult lives in a nursing home, assisted living faciltiy (alf) or boarding home, the administrator should be contacted to learn about the disaster plan for that facility.

											a warning has been issued, what should i do?
									 	

a warning has been issued
the leading edge of the storm is just hours away. complete all preparations as soon as possible.
move all your supplies and survival kits into your safe room. this includes the family pets in their carriers.
close all interior doors. secure and brace all external doors, particularly double inward-opening doors and garage doors. 
stay inside!
tune into local radio stations for further updates.

											a wwatch has been issued, what should i do?
									 	

when a hurricane watch is issued
when a hurricane watch is issued in your area, you have 36 hours to prepare. now is the time to:
frequently monitor our favorite tv or radio station for weather updates.
check our hurricane supplies and survival kits.
contact family members to coordinate whereabouts and efforts.
turn refrigerator/freezer settings to the coldest.
round up family pets and confine to carriers or a safe room. turn out livestock or relocate to emergency animal shelters.
begin installing shutters or pre-cut plywood panels.
pool owners: don't drain your pool completely, drop water level by one to two feet. place outdoor furniture and pool equipment into the pool. turn off electricity to pool pump. add extra chlorine to compensate for heavy rains. 
fill your fuel tanks early: automobiles, propane, etc.
place valuables into waterproof containers or plastic bags. (computers, tv, stereo, should all be covered with plastic for protection.) place appliances and or furniture on blocks to raise above water seepage from rain, wind or storm surge.
get extra cash
since your water service could be disrupted or your water supply contaminated, fill plastic jugs with water and freeze. fill emergency water containers now!
sterilze bathtub, jugs, bottles, cooking utensils and other containers that will be used for water storage. to do this, scrub thoroughly with a solution of water and liquid chlorine bleach and rinse. let the tub and containers dry, then fill with water.
your sewer services are suseptable to disruption also. keep 5-gallon buckets, with tight fitting lids, for use as emergency toilets. line each bucket with a heavy-duty plastic trash bag.

											when do i go into my safe room and how long should i remain there?
									 	

when to go and how long to stay  
go into your safe room when outside conditions worsen. go immediately if you hear a hurricane warning issued. do not leave the safe room until the all clear is issued on the radio. don't be fooled by the calm "eye of the storm".
