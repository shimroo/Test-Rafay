audition monologues 


audition  monologues are a collection of books for actors of all ages. these one-minute  monologues are expressively written in a way to enable the actor to project  emotional range effectively and to experience the situation of the character  firsthand.  these pieces are  entertaining, contain surprising twists and are very useful for auditions and  practice material.  acting  coaches and actors across the us,  in the uk and canada, along with la casting directors and college  professors in new york,  all seem to agree, audition monologues has it all. 
what's inside 
            all of the books in the audition monologues collection  include a user friendly table of contents, which clearly lists the age range  and if the monologue is comedic or dramatic.   in addition, under each monologue title, there is a brief description of  what the piece is about.
