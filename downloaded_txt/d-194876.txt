* the specified values were determined in accordance with the wltp (worldwide harmonised light vehicles test procedure) measurement method. the ranges given refer to ece markets. the energy consumption and coâ emissions of a car depend not only on the efficient utilisation of the fuel or energy source by the car, but also on the driving style and other non-technical factors.
** electric energy consumption and range have been determined on the basis of regulation (ec) no. 692/2008 according to nedc. electric energy consumption and range depend on the vehicle configuration.
*** data on electrical consumption and range are provisional and were determined internally in accordance with the âwltp test procedureâ certification method. so far there are no confirmed figures from an officially approved testing organisation, nor any ec type approval or certificate of conformity with official figures. differences between the stated figures and the official figures are possible.
the figures are provided in accordance with the german regulation 'pkw-envkv' and apply to the german market only. further information on official fuel consumption figures, energy consumption and the official specific coâ emissions of new passenger cars can be found in the eu guide 'information on the fuel consumption, coâ emissions and energy consumption of new cars', which is available free of charge at all sales dealerships, from dat deutsche automobil treuhand gmbh and at www.dat.de .
