test page for the apache http server & interworx-cp









welcome!

            this page is used to test the proper operation of the 
            apache web server after it has been installed on this server, with the
            interworx web hosting control panel. if you can read this page, it means 
            that the apache web server installed on this server and is
            working properly.            
          




if you are the server administrator

            login to interworx-cp by navigating to the 
            nodeworx login page.  if that does not work, try https and port 2443.
          
            you'll want to bookmark that login page so you can easily
            find it again.  you can also reach nodeworx by appending
            /nodeworx to the end of any domain hosted on the server or
            any ip mapped to the server.
          

            once you are logged into nodeworx you will be able to 
            manage all aspects of your server.
            your login information should have been provided to you 
            by the 
            interworx reseller 
            partner you purchased your license from or

            from the interworx website.
