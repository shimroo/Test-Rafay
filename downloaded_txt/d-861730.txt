cate farm grows certified organic plants and produce in central vermont. we began growing organic vegetables, herbs, and flowers in 1981. we started small and have grown slowly to our present size of eight 96′ long greenhouses under cultivation and 22 acres that are used for a mix of field crops and forage. cate farm is family owned and operated and everything we sell is certified organic.richard and sally retired in 2023 and handed the reins over to their son flint. flint has been working on the farm since he was knee high to a grasshopper, and in a full time position since 2017.
