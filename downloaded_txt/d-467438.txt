site home & capitol info index
hobbies are an interesting sort of animal. they grow when they are given attention, and they teach the enthusiast much that few others ever care about - unless they share the same hobby. what have i decided to do with what i've learned from my state capitol hobby? share. what should you do here? enjoy. thanks for stopping by.
