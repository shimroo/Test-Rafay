high performance data loggers.race-proven customer support.














data aquisition, simplified.










data loggers

rpm performance high-speed data logger systems will provide a wealth of information that will unlock your ability to get the most from your performance vehicle, drag car, drag boat, motorcycle, or tractor puller. the information provided by our loggers takes the guesswork out of tuning and setup, and therefore the time it takes to identify and correct difficult problems is drastically reduced. often, problems can be identified and corrected after the first pass.
