creative generalist?

what other title is there that doesn't sound too silly and yet says i have experience with just about every aspect of business design, marketing, promotions, illustration and much more.
      â¢ established august 1975
      â¢ 16 national design awards
      â¢ earned theâ naa safety award
      â¢ never missed a deadline
    click through to view some of my designâ samples from successfully completed projects. 

    check out theâ linknifeâ¢ tow release used by hang glider pilots worldwide as well as nasa, and my book onâ astronomy, objects in the heavens, now in its 6th edition. while i'm no longer hang gliding, i'm still closely tied to the sport and the great friends i made while participating.
    

    from design through fulfillment, birren design has shepherded projects through all their life-stages most efficiently. we (teamed with other professionals) worked from the very start to develop the budget, create the strategy, then supervise photography and printing â all the elements â to make the project or program a tactical reality.
    

    it was a lot of fun, those 45 years of being a one-man operation. there were times when handling the 18 clients of a suburban ad agency, plus 15 of my own, that i never thought it'd all get done, but it did. the occasional all-nighter was very productive though there's no way i can do that now.
    

    retirement is grand! i encourage everyone to try it.
