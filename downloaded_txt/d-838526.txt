using christianity to defend nativism is bs





jd vance said that it's a christian concept called ordo amoris (rightly ordered love) that taught him to care about his family first, then neighbors, then community, and after all of that one can focus on the rest of the world—it's his rational for being mean to refugees from other countries and he accuses the "far left" of inverting the ordo amoris by "hating citizens of their own country and caring more about people outside their own borders."using christianity to defend nativism is bs. there are practical reasons you might take care of those close to you before taking care of people in other countries, but it's not christian doctrine. pope francis thinks so too. he sees the u.s.'s mass deportations as a major crisis and replied to vance, "christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups. . . the true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the good samaritan, that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all without exception."christianity is not an argument for putting family and america first. you're supposed to love everyone without exception. it's easy to love the people you like best. howard thurman offers a more expansive view of christianity in jesus and the disinherited. endure the terrible pressures of the dominating world without losing your humanityi first read jesus and the disinherited in 2022. it fuelled my feelings for being part of the "resistance" post-trump. vincent harding wrote the forward and mentioned that this book could be mistaken for "liberation theology," which is doctrine that justifies action against oppression. that is exactly how i read it in 2022 when biden was in office and i thought we were on an upswing after trump's horrible low—but hopefully singular—point in american history. i just read it again after the inauguration in january. i felt so different reading it recently, like a downhearted loser. i understood better that thurman sees christianity as "liberating spirituality," which is a survival strategy for the oppressed. thurman said he wrote for the poor, the dispossessed, the disinherited. he is examining what the teachings of jesus might offer to help the oppressed to "endure the terrible pressures of the dominating world without losing their humanity." the teachings of jesus offer a survival plan to the oppressed. he encourages us to refuse to give in to fear, hypocrisy, and hatred, because they are ultimately bad for us. he says to be humble, not for the sake of subservience, but because the balm for humiliation is humility. when your life is horrible (as jesus's was; as enslaved peoples' were; as immigrants' fearing deportation are; as the lgbtq community's under trump will be, you have to establish another basis for well being. this basis is that you are god's child. he loves you. there is an afterlife. the kingdom of god is within. jesus says, don't see yourselves as your oppressor sees you.a minority with majority privilegesthis is all such good advice, and helpful. but paul's words, "slaves, be obedient to your masters," have always given me pause. how is this helpful advice to the disinherited and marginalized? paul gives the sanction of religion to slavery. it's clearly problematic (as is a lot of the bible, honestly). but thurman explains something constructive about this. paul was the most privileged apostle. he was jewish, but he was a roman citizen. he was a minority with majority privileges. he has no idea what it's really like to be jesus and this bit of scripture shows it. thurman says, unless one actually lives day by day without a sense of security he cannot understand what worlds separated jesus from paul. i need to make sure i don't make this mistake. yes, i'm a woman and things are bad for women under this administration, but i am safe. i live day by day with a sense of security and i need to remember that. i'm barely different from the oppressors. i should differentiate myself as much as i can from them and be clear eyed about my position in all of this. i need to make sure i'm helping people instead of being a brooding, sanctimonious grump, which i am inclined to be. :)i know many of you feel alone or crazy because so many people in power lack your values and see the world so differently from you. they're doing abhorrent things and no one is stopping them. carl jung explained that loneliness does not come from "having no people about one, but from being unable to communicate the things that seem important to oneself, or from holding certain views which others find inadmissible." so i hope you will write or sing or paint or post or tell me what you're thinking because it might help you feel less alone.

this is probably too personal 





after not blogging for many years it was funny and reassuring to return here and see that amongst my most read posts of all time, bad dreams about clogged toilets is still on top. at one point i had added a widget to my blog to keep track of my most read posts. geeze. i really become a computer programmer in order to blog. i also figured out how to see what common search terms were being used to find my blog. imagine my surprise to see that "pantyhose all day stink" was a search term someone used who ended up at my blog.i used to have a recurring dream about being in front of a crowd (usually a high school assembly) and having to go to the bathroom and having the only toilet available be just totally overflowing to the top and beyond with number two.this dream has shifted. it's still the same idea, but now i'm usually (thank goodness) in a private place and the only available toilet is filled to the top and totally overflowing with number one. i don't know if the change is significant in terms of my psyche or whatever but it has definitely changed over time. i feel bad that so many people have come to my blog probably to find an interpretation of this dream and i don't really have much to offer. however, it's beautiful in its way that so many of us—at least 27,000 people—want to know. when i initially wrote the post 20 years ago (!) i looked it up online.  according to dreammoods.com, seeing a clogged toilet in your dream signifies that you are holding in and keeping your feelings to yourself. your emotions have been pent up too long. to see an overflowing toilet in your dream denotes your desires to fully express your emotions.this sounds right to me. each time i have blogged about it the dream has precipitated a renewed interest in blogging. perhaps a desire to express my emotions? here they are: i hate trump. the things he does make me sad. people who allow it and think it's ok disgust me. i am disappointed in this country and many of the people i know—like, for example, john curtis. i know him and would say that we are friends. i truly believed he would do what's right and not just do things to hold on to power.  he isn't.  and while i encourage you to make calls and be activists in any way you can think of, currently i feel like that stuff won't make a difference. i am sorry to say that and i hope i get over it (i bet i will). until then, my contribution will just have to be that the search terms "clogged toilets," and "pantyhose all day stink" will be forever linked on the internet to "john curtis political legacy."

first step? fashion a whip 





i keep talking to friends about what to do. i don't know, but i'm piecing together some general ideas. here they are:break unjust laws/protect the vulnerablein 2019 i went to the national with ben. he sat with a friend and i, a woman over a certain age, accidentally wandered right past a security guard into vip seating. i realized where i was later. i also realized that there is great power in being an unseen old lady. my gals, unless they want to sexually assault you or stop you from having an abortion, the powers that be don't notice anything you do. you are literally invisible. use this power for good. use this power with discretion and also abandon to break unjust laws and to protect the vulnerable. it shouldn't be that hard. there are zero profiles in courage among republicans—they're not that tough. i don't know how much we can get away with. let's find out. here's our rallying cry: when you're [an older woman]they let you do ityou can do anythingmake art/pay for arti look forward to the art people will create during these troubled times. i am especially moved by music, but i like to read, look at, and listen to all kinds of art. i think it must feel so wonderful to write a cathartic yet comforting song or paint something thought provoking. if you can do that, you should. and if you are not gifted artistically, maybe do it anyway. i think it is a collective good to make and create, whatever the quality. at the very least, it's a nice way to pass the time. like many of you, i'm thinking about ways to spend my money that will make a point or improve the world or just not damage and demoralize others. i don't have a lot of discretionary income, but i do have some. i want to use it to support the arts. i also have some resources (my home, my feedback, my attention, my backyard—which is a great place to shoot horror films) that i can give of freely to some and price gouge to others depending on how much harm they have personally caused me and the people i love. (it will be a sliding scale.)comfort in/dump outhaving trump as a president hurts everyone, even people who are too dumb to notice. sad. however, there are definitely people who are more and less vulnerable. maybe it even varies from day to day depending on what sick hate speech trump is using to stoke grievance among his morally bankrupt supporters. silk's ring theory is a model of caring for people in crisis. if (and when) you are targeted and aggrieved, you're in the middle. take care. do what you need to do. don't worry about shoulds/boycotts/speaking out/or anything. just exist and try to feel ok. when you are on an outer ring, dump out and focus your efforts and resources to comfort in. i'm so furious and disgusted all the time. it helps a little to prioritize when i complain and when i help. i also think it can be really painful for and actually re-injure the person in the middle when you dump to them. don't do that. fashion a whip/flip tablesregardless of where you are in the ring, things are tough all over and it feels terrible (unless you're too dumb to notice). during the first trump presidency i felt a strong sense of purpose to promote literacy and compassion. it's different now. i am floundering. i feel a sense of urgency and anxiety to help, but i keep coming up against despair and hopelessness. i am so mad about everything that is happening. i feel maybe like jesus felt when he saw corruption and exploitation at the temple. he got really mad and flipped some tables. but remember that first he took the time to fashion a whip. take some time to fashion your whip.

i was a mommy blogger not a trad wife, bozo





<------look at her. that was me 12 years ago. i want her to know that i take a nap almost every day now. and that i have a hot tub. don't tell her anything else though. do not tell her who just started their second term as president. or how i got the hot tub. i used to hate the term mommy blogger. it seemed dismissive. now i don't care. ever since i was little i wanted to be a mom and, truly, i have felt that it is my calling in life and every big decision i made from who i married to the work i prepared to do was in the service of my future children and the lives i wanted them to have. my children have turned out to be thoughtful, likeable people. that's what i wanted. i did it. even though i have basically followed a path of stereotypical gender roles, my path was still singular and specific to me. everyone's is.  us mommy bloggers spent so much time talking about being stay-at-home moms and working or defending what we were and weren't doing as mothers and parents and writers and people who needed money and these conversations still happen on whatever platforms we pick. where it is helpful to people, i'm glad. where it is demoralizing to people, i'm sad. in retrospect i see now that it didn't matter if we were feminists of post-feminists or third wave or happy homemakers. never in a million years would i have thought in 2012 when i took this picture with my laptop that we wouldn't be able to get hillary clinton or kamala harris into office against donald trump. what a joke. old joe biden was the only one who managed to get never-trumpers out to vote.the lgbtq+ community, brown immigrants, people who are disabled, and people who are poor are on the front lines as targets for this "presidency." i am privileged and relatively safe, but the trump win was a hard slap in the face to all women. my friends all talked about feeling a visceral and painful loss the day after the election. was hillary clinton too bossy for you, progressive people? was kamala harris too shrill for you, leftists? couldn't get excited about the democratic choices, bernie bros? shame on you. shame on anyone who stayed home and didn't vote for kamala harris in november. it was the choice we were presented with and not enough people did the right thing, selling out the mommy bloggers and the trad wives alike. sexual assault is now sanctioned by the state (look at our president; look at our supreme court justices; look at the cabinet nominees people like john curtis confirmed) and reproductive rights have been limited in dangerous ways. the people in charge of us becoming mommies never cared about our mommy blogs or any mommish things. they (men? i guess?) don't care about our (my?) well being. since the election i have felt much more animosity towards most people unless i know for sure they are cool. cool means that they don't vote against my interests. or their moms' interests. and so i no longer give people the benefit of the doubt and i am withdrawing attention and mental effort, refraining from small talk and nodding when they talk to me, and no longer feel bad when they flip me off or honk at me. as ever, they don't notice or care. but at least it helps me conserve energy to spend on the people i care about. i can save my attention, patience, and common courtesy for my students, friends, and family. it's a kind of self-care i am currently practicing to ease the despair i feel about how things are going. you can join me of you like.
