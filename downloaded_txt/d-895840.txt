update on mbi international (dec 2020)the michigan biotechnology institute (“mbi”), a michigan not-for-profit corporation, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the msu foundation.  for over 25 years, mbi has helped organizations quickly and cost-effectively weed out flawed technologies and accelerate viable ones to commercialization. the organization had a long history of applying a derisking process to the development of biofuels, chemicals, food, and feed from renewable, rather than fossil, as well as raw materials. additionally, mbi undertook microbiological corporate services for a variety of clients in support of national, regional, and state economic development and scientific advance in the area of biotechnology research and development.  in november 2019, the board of directors of mbi international approved a an organizational restructuring which involved: separating the services group and integrating the team, projects and other resources into the msu bioeconomy institute.  continuing to hold intellectual property and licenses within the mbi entity.  however, the on-going development and de-risking of several key technologies, such as the afex platform, are now dormant.
























services the services group at mbi were folded into the michigan state university bioeconomy institute.  msu bi helps organizations quickly and cost-effectively accelerate new specialty and biobased chemicals to commercialization. our teams in holland and lansing, michigan, combine a full spectrum of science, engineering, operational, and business expertise with an integrated and flexible infrastructure, taking your technology from the lab bench to the pilot plant in preparation for successful manufacturing.mbi intellectual propertythe mbi organization still holds intellectual property that is available for commercial partners.  the technology fits into three separate areas:fumaric acidfumaric acid has been widely used as a food additive and is recognized as a versatile intermediate for the production of bio-based polymers. fumaric acid can potentially replace maleic anhydride in various applications.  mbi has developed a patented fermentation and recovery process for biobased fumaric acid.succinic acidsuccinic acid has been widely recognized as a versatile intermediate for the production of solvents, chemicals, and materials that can displace current petrochemical feedstocks.mbi is a technology leader in fermentation-based succinic acid and has systematically derisked the production process by making improvements to the microbial strain, fermentation, and recovery steps. mbi isolated and patented a novel bacterium, actinobacillus succinogenes, and has re-engineered its metabolism to increase productivity, improve yield, and reduce by-products. a. succinogenes is a particularly effective choice for clients seeking to use cellulosic sugars for the production of succinic acid as it simultaneously utilizes both 5 and 6 carbon sugars.afexfor every ton of corn, wheat and rice harvested today, an equal amount of crop residue is left behind. nature locks away sugar sources in these residues, making them inaccessible. after decades of research, a world-renowned scientist at michigan state university (msu) discovered an ingenious way to liberate these sugars, transforming ordinary crop residues into sustainable renewable fuels and feed for beef and dairy cattle.  the technology is called afex. for additional information on mbi and its technologies, please contact david washburn, president of mbi international, a wholly owned subsidiary of the michigan state university foundation.
