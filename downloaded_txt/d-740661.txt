"if you are a fan of the macabre, smart and daring original works, then you’ll find raw feed perfect october fare." - theatre is easy
"the eight plays presented in this edition are all real stories so outre and bizarre they seem fictional (and so tragic you’ll wish they were). i am now officially obsessed." - trav s.d.
and get $12 tickets for this wednesday by using the code feed when buying online.

	 original to the core: the texas chain saw massacre



over at gotta/enk films' blog, i wax pretentiously on why i think the texas chain saw massacre is (as the teen girl squad would say), soooo good!

this is part of gotta/enk films' campaign to raise funds for its follow-up feature to the big bad, meta-stasis.


contribute to this awesome project, if you can.

	 contribute to the blood brothers' indiegogo page
	 
    


hey, folks. as you know, this october, the blood brothers are back at the brick in williamsburg, brooklyn with a new batch of original horror plays designed to make you feel all gross and bad inside. 
and we can't bring our horrific latest, the blood brothers present... raw feed, to the stage without you. 
to keep up with the high cost of buckets of blood, and screaming naked performers of both sexes, we need your help to once again build an event of epic proportions.
we're aiming to raise $3,000 to cover much of our production budget—everything from props, costumes and set-building materials, to dulling down blades, building effects rigs, simulating grievous bodily injuries, and making sure our outstanding and courageous performers can afford to eat. (we never dig too deep into what they might be feeding upon, but we know it costs money.)
and while we put more onstage than most do with a budget twice this size, with the ever-increasing costs of living we need your help to make it happen. 
so if you can, head on over to our indiegogo page and kick over a few shekels (as marc maron would say) to help fund our particular dark and depraved brand of entertainment. 
http://www.indiegogo.com/thebloodbrothers
so thanks again for your on-going support, and see you at the show.

a gay porn star's insatiable hunger for fame leads to unspeakable acts of violence. a pretty, young contestant will make the mistake of her life if she chooses bachelor #1. a ventriloquist on christian television takes communion to a whole new level. when you're always connected, there's nowhere to hide...
these tales and others will make up this year's the blood brothers present… horror anthology series.
since 2006, nosedive productions has brought you new, original horror stories live on stage, showcasing a roster of some of indie theatre's most celebrated and beloved authors and artists.
this year, following in the tradition of the original grand guignol theatre, danny bowes (booze, sports and romance), nat cassidy (songs of love: a theatrical mixtape), james comtois (infectious opportunity), stephanie cox-williams (the zombie project: the story of icarus phoenix), jessi gotta (the big bad) and mac rogers (the honeycomb trilogy) have written new stage plays based on stories ripped from the headlines.
performances: october 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13 @ 8pm
tickets on sale soon.
the blood brothers present…raw feed features nudity and graphic violence and is recommended for adults only.

	 mac rogers' fundamental contradiction
	 
    


over at larry pontius' blog, mac rogers writes about  feeling contradictorily ambitious yet lazy, and shares how he manages to get anything done when the urge to watch an arrested development marathon via netflix becomes nearly insurmountable. considering i spent last night eating indian food while watching arrested development, i know what mac is talking about. read the entry here.i’d also tell you to go see blast radius, the second amazing installment in mac’s astounding honeycomb trilogy, but that shit’s sold way the hell out.  maybe you can get in by showing up early and making sad puppy dog eyes at whomever’s working box office.  i’m seeing it a second time this saturday. yes, it's that goddamn good.  have a good weekend, folks. i may catch you in the meat space. ambitious about his tv-watching,james "relentless channel-surfer" comtoisphoto by ben vandenboomlabels: fucking awesome, gideon productions, theatre
