contact ustestimonialsi knew nothing about the real estate market in walnut creek or rossmoor. i did know that i wanted a highly ethical person with whom to work, one i could totally trust and was what i would call a real person. catherine myers was that and more. i felt that my research on the internet paid off in spades because catherine proved to be everything i was looking for and perhaps even more because i enjoyed her as well. all in all, this was a very pleasant exchange and adventure.
catherine is amazing to work with! i do not reside where the property i was selling was located so i was worried, but catherine always kept me in the loop about what was going on. her knowledge of real estate was very impressive. the entire process went smoothly and so much faster than i thought it would. i highly recommend catherine. you will not be disappointed. thanks, catherine!
catherine is amazing, she make you feel like you are her only client. she is knowledgeable, professional and gives you all the time you need to decide on what is right for you. once you have made your decision just sit back, she handles all the rest. i found her from a friend, who found her from a friend, which is the best review of all.read more reviewsnew this week
