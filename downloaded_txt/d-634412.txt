  ross l.★★★★★chris was really a great plumber and person.  i am not a fan of having strangers working in my house …that being said he was very professional and kept us at ease. quickly found where the leak was and pricing was fair.  if you’re in putnam or westchester county it’s a no brainer to call this company

  





 
  robert s.★★★★★russell bleakley has been our go-to person (and company) for all of our plumbing and related electrical work. his prices are reasonable; and, he and his staff respond very promptly. they're definitely one of the most well-skilled, competent--and perhaps the most competent--service providers with whom we've ever had the pleasure of working in our entire time (30 years) living in northern westchester!!!

  





 
  odelle d★★★★★i have had the pleasure of using russell and john for permitted gas work and plumbing work i needed done in my home while i worked in another state. it started off with just running a simple water line for my fridge, then i needed a permit for gas work for my stove, then i used them to convert and install my dryer, and the washer drain pipe. these have all been separate jobs/calls. russell and john are experts in their respective crafts. they know the business, they know the best options, and the office staff, niqcole and rachelle are simply amazing. russell and his team have been extremely courteous, reliable, priced competitively, and are more like family at this point.

  





 
  melanie l.★★★★★professional, friendly, timely repair of a ceiling pipe leak in the basement.  we have called on russell bleakley plumbing for years; they never disappoint.
