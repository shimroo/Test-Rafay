important safety information

lyrica is not for everyone. lyrica may cause serious, even life-threatening, allergic reactions. stop taking lyrica and call your doctor right away if you have any signs of a serious allergic reaction. some signs are swelling of your face, mouth, lips, gums, tongue, throat or neck, if you have any trouble breathing, or have a rash, hives, or blisters.
drugs used to treat seizures increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. lyrica may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500. patients, family members, or caregivers should call the doctor right away if they notice suicidal thoughts or actions, thoughts of self-harm, or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. these changes may include new or worsening depression, anxiety, restlessness, trouble sleeping, panic attacks, anger, irritability, agitation, aggression, dangerous impulses or violence, or extreme increases in activity or talking. if you have suicidal thoughts or actions, do not stop lyrica without first talking to your doctor.
serious breathing problems can occur when lyrica is taken with other medicines that can cause severe sleepiness or decreased awareness, or when it is taken by someone who already has breathing problems. watch for increased sleepiness or decreased breathing when starting lyrica or when the dose is increased. get help right away if breathing problems occur.
lyrica may cause swelling of your hands, legs, and feet, which can be serious for people with heart problems. lyrica may cause dizziness and sleepiness. you should not drive or work with machines until you know how lyrica affects you. also, tell your doctor right away about muscle pain or problems along with feeling sick and feverish, or any changes in your eyesight, including blurry vision or if you have any kidney problems or get dialysis.
tell your doctor immediately if you are taking opioid painkillers (such as oxycodone), or medicines for anxiety (such as lorazepam) or insomnia (such as zolpidem). you may have a higher chance for dizziness, sleepiness or serious breathing problems if these medicines are taken with lyrica. taking lyrica with opioid pain medicines may lead to death.
some of the most common side effects of lyrica are dizziness, blurry vision, weight gain, sleepiness, trouble concentrating, swelling of your hands and feet, dry mouth, and feeling “high.” if you have diabetes, tell your doctor about any skin sores.
you may have a higher chance for swelling and hives if you are also taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors, so tell your doctor if you are taking these medications. you may have a higher chance of swelling of your hands or feet or gaining weight if you are also taking certain diabetes medicines. do not drink alcohol while on lyrica. you may have a higher chance for dizziness and sleepiness if you take lyrica with alcohol, narcotic pain medicines, or medicines for anxiety.
