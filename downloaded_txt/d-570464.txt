come join our group rides













we have regular rides nearly every day of the week.  groups vary as does the pace but all rides regroup at various points.  some even include a regular coffee stop.  all rides explore the many great roads of the east bay including mt. diablo, morgan territory and norris canyon.more information can be found on our ride page.non-members are welcome to join up to three official berkeley bike club rides, but must agree to our waiver before each ride. after three rides, we ask that you join the club to continue attending rides (hopefully it’s an easy decision!).
