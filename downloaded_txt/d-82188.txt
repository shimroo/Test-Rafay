			got the randy grossman trivia question right. they were ken woodring, 
			notre dame harvey, tom meakim, bob romeo, and dan solis-cohen with ken 
			woodring being 
			the first to post. worth noting, that several readers gave the incorrect answer 
			of northeast high graduate herb 
			adderley. 
			herb won three super bowls, but he did win three nfl championships 
			before the super bowl existed. if the question was: what area player 
			has won the most nfl championships?---the answer would be adderley 
			because he won six with three nfl championships and three super 
			bowls, which are now the nfl championship game. adderley is second 
			all-time only to tom 
			brady who 
			has won seven nfl

pub tedbit
			  in the 76 seasons from 1940 through 2015, how many times -- in any 
			playoff game -- did five players score
			in double figures for the evenrual champion? the answer is seventeen and that hit me as kinda 
			low. one
 reason: playoff formsts differed widely. another reason: 
			teams did not fly up and down as often as they did
 in the regular 
			season. the feat was accomplished five times in finals, zero imes in 
			semis, four times in
 quarters and eight times in the  round-of-16. 
			so. did six guys ever reach double figures. yes, just once -- 
			
			southern vs. west philly in the '87 final. and twice two subs were 
			part of the fivesomes. in that '82
			mastbaum-franklin final, the 
			latter had four double-digit scorers. franklin led in other points 
			scored
			by subs, 6-4..

			(and thanks to 
			matt for publishing jon's kind words.)

pub tedbit
			  the regular season has just ended and your top assistant pulls 
			yo aside with a worried look on hix face.
			somehow he doubts that the 
			team's best player will surpass his average even once in the 
			upcoming playoffs.
			uh oh? not really. the list below shows a scoring 
			breakdown for 41 pub champs, 1975 through 2015. the
			leading regular 
			season scorer topped his average only 44 percent of the time, but 
			every guy won a championship.
			kinda surprising, right? two players 
			achieved perfection -- bo kimble in 1985 and fatts russell in '15. 
			of those who whiffed, three advanced o the nba -- lionel simmons, 
			aaron mckie and marcus morris-- and carlin warley's
			dad, ben, played 
			in the show. thankfully, they all had supportive teammates.

			  so, your high school is known for 
			having very good basketball teams and maybe once a decade somebody
			advances to the nba. pretty exciting, right? but let's go back to 
			the late 1950s at ovenrook. the 1957-58
			panthers/hilltoppers won the 
			public league and city championships and finished with a 22-0 
			record. the
			starting lineup included three future nba players, 
			center wayne hightower and guards walt hazzard
			and soph wali jones. 
			jones became a starter in the middle of the season when  howie 
			horenstein
			graduated. that's how it was back then. all pub schools 
			had two senior classes. hightower won the
			markward club award as the 
			city's top senior, but there were folks who strongly believed the 
			best
			prospect on 'brook was junior ralph heyward, who made first 
			team all-public. in 59, overbrook again
			won double championships 
			and, like hightower before him, heyward was baned to the parade 
			all-america
			team. he played three seasons of college ball, one 
			at kansas in '61 and two at seattle in '64 and '65. he
			was limited 
			to nine games, with only nine in '64. he totaled 238 points and 150 
			rebounds. below are pro
			stats for hightower, hazzard and jones. one 
			more thing: in the late '50s overbrook had a sub named
			leonard borisoff. in time he became len barry and enjoyed a terrific singing 
			career with the dovells
			(bristol stomp) and as a solo artist 
			(1-2-3).

			first team all-public honorees,
			1941-2015. the cutoff was four years 
			and even wih that a surprising number of schools fell short of
			making the list. gratz is first at 13 and most of those years 
			leonard poole. not bill ellerbee, was the
			coach. bartarm and 
			strawberry mansion are tied for second at 11, franklin learning 
			center
			toughed out two streaks of eight. in its old days at 8th & 
			lehigh, northeast's streak featured
			two future hofers, guy rodgers 
			(basketball) and herb adderley (football).

  you should have known this one: my first public league tedbit would be 
			focused on wilt chamberlain. some of you might have learned through 
			the years that his three biggest outbursts were 90, 74 and 71 points 
			and that all three took place versus roxborough. as you'll see 
			below, thanks to numbers nailed down long ago by tom taylor, wilt 
			also posted 59 vs. dobbins and hit every number from 49 on down to 
			24 except for 27. pretty amazing. overall, in three varsity seasons 
			(ninth grade was part of junior high back then), he scored 46.9 
			percent of the hilltoppers' points.

**note from ted: at some point next

			please tell your friends. (the first one will feature some tall guy 
			from overbrook -- smile).**

  b-p's baseball team beat la salle to

  congrats to lansdale catholic softball coach paul suder, who now owns 300 
			vistories!

			  if you checked the boxscores each day in the 1967-68 basketball 
			season, you had to figure o'hara's joe hazinsky was miserable. he'd 
			averaged 21.9 points in the previous campaign while earning first 
			team all-catholic honors, but now his numbers were falling and darn 
			near plummeting. what was the deal? fighting an injury and/or 
			sickness? saddled with some knuckleheaded teammates? nope, the team 
			was better, much better, and hazinsky did not have to pump away. his 
			final average was 13.6 and he again made first team all-catholic. 
			oh, and there was this: o'hara won the cl championship in just its 
			fourth season of participation! future nba player tom ingelsby, a 
			junior. was one of the starters. the list below shows average dips 
			of at least three points for cl first-teamers from junior to senior 
			season. hazinsky played college ball at st. francis (pa) and owns a 
			spot in the schoolâs athletics hof. congrats!

			  oh, what happened to the good, ol' days, especially with regard to 
			the mcdonald's all-ameriacn game? no game was played in 1977, but an 
			all-star team was selected and west philly's gene banks was on it. 
			the game made its debut in '78 and was played at philly's old 
			spectrum and two "our guys" were participants -- west philly's 
			clarence "eggy" tillman and roman's reggie jackson. the good vibes 
			continued through five of the next eight tussles and then . . . ugh. 
			"our guys" have appeared in just five more games and just one has 
			done so since 2009. here are performance breakdowns.
			    1978 -- reggie jackson, roman catholic, and clarence "eggy" 
			tillman, west philadelphia. jackson shot 4-for-14 for nine points 
			and had five assists. tillman shot 3-for-9 for seven points and had 
			three rebounds.
			    1979 -- horace "pappy" owens, murrell dobbins tech. owens shot 
			9-for-17 for 18 points and had three assists.
			    1980 -- lonnie mcfarlan, roman catholic. mcfarlan shot 6-for-13 
			for 13 points.
			    1983 -- dallas comegys, roman catholic. comegys had six points, 
			16 rebounds and six blocks.
			    1985 -- jerome "pooh" richardson, ben franklin, and mark 
			stevenson, roman catholic. richardson shot 4-for-9 for 10 points and 
			had six assists. stevenson shot 7-for-16 for 16 points.
			    1986 -- barry bekkedam, archbishop carroll. bekkedam was held 
			scoreless in 8-plus minutes, shooting 0-for-3 from the floor and 
			0-for-4 at the line. (he contracted mono after scoring 37, 38 and 41 
			points in the final three regular season games. he missed the 
			playoffs and lost 15 pounds.)  
			    1993 -- rasheed wallace, simon gratz. wallace shot 4-for-7 for 
			nine points and grabbed 10 rebounds.
			    2000 -- eddie griffin, roman catholic. griffin shot 7-for-16 for 
			19 points (two treys) while adding four rebounds and two blocks.
			    2006 -- gerald henderson and wayne ellington, both of episcopal. 
			henderson shot 6-for-10 (one trey) and 3-for-4 for 16 points. 
			ellington shot 3-for-10 total and 2-for-8 on treys for eight points.
			    2009 -- maalik wayns, roman catholic. shot 2-for-6 and 1-for-1 
			for five points. also notched seven assists to just one turnover. 
			(he underwent right-knee meniscus surgery and missed nine 
			late-season games before returning for the finale, a first-round, 
			state-playoff loss. this game was played 3 1/2 weeks later.)
			   2017 -- quade green, neumann-goretti. played 16 minutes off the

  did you know? 2010 caroll grad vince mostardi, who played there

			the district 1 playoffs.
			best of luck, vince!

			  back in the day, as oldheads like to say, carroll's barry bekkedam 
			finished his season with quite the bang. in the 1985-86 season, he 
			broke the school record for points in three consecutive games with 
			37, 38 and 41 -- all in the cl southern division -- and finalized 
			his league average at 23.6 (14-330). the patriots finished 10-4 for 
			second place and lost to o'hara, 54-49, in the first round of the 
			playoffs. how'd barry do? can't score if you can't play. the 
			canadian import was unavailable due to the flu, a strep throat and a 
			touch of mono. alas, touch became full-blown and by the time barry 
			suited up for the mcdonald's all-american gane, he was a shell of 
			his former self, having lost 15 pounds. in eight-plus minutes, he 
			failed to score while shooting 0-for-3 from the floor and 0-for-4 at 
			the line. so rough. and things were difficult at villanova also. in 
			three injury-riddled seasons he totaled 142 points and 116 rebounds, 
			then declined to play as a senior by "mutual agreement." in cl 
			history, just five players have scored at least 35 points in as many 
			as three league games. west's michael brooks (rip) averaged 39.3 ppg 
			over those three performances in 1976. averages for the others: 
			bekkedam (38.7), west's monroe blakes (38.3 over four in â88). 
			roman's eddie griffin (38.0 in â99) and st. thomas more's billy hoy 
			(36.6 in â59). barry was the only one to notch his outbursts in 
			succession to finish league play. eddie (rip) did all of his damage 
			as a junior. he and michael played in the nba.

			  in a league with only six teams, the size of the inter-ac since 
			1969, it's not that hard for a school to produce first team honorees 
			year after year after . . . malvern did so for 21 through 1969 and

			through '17. but check out penn charter's 16-year accomplishment. it 
			goes waaaay back from '41 through '56 and the quakers won 11

			  wonder how many schools across the country can make one specific 
			claim? well, we know one can do so and it's right here in philly. 
			for 50 consecutive -- yes, fifty! -- seasons, at least one roman 
			player has earned first team coaches' all-catholic honors. jim 
			"chico" singleton and donald kelly started the dominance in 1973 by 
			grabbing two of the five spots on the southern division first team. 
			chico and frank sykes had been second teamers in â72, nos. 6 and 7 
			respectively. divisions -- north/south, then red/blue -- existed 
			through 2010 and the schools have competed in one overall group ever 
			since. speaking of 2011, the streak almost ended then. roman came 
			close to whiffing on the 10-player first team. coming in ninth was 
			frontcourter fortunat "junior" kangudi, an import from montreal. his 
			11.0 scoring average has been the second lowest of any first team 
			cahillite during the streak; tony carr averaged 10.9 in 2015. as 
			you'll see on the list below, neumann-goretti also owns a long 
			streak at 27 seasons. a couple more nuggets: romanâs feat has 
			involved 50 players â yes, fifty again! â and theyâve combined for 
			76 honors. in 1.027 games, theyâve racked up 18,058 points for a 
			17.6 average.

			  the inter-ac league got started one year late with the 
			three-point shot, as opposed to the catholic league anyway, and it took a 
			while for the effect to be felt. the lists below show the i-a's top 
			10 season scorers through 1987 and from '88 on up. only four guys 
			from the '90s are on part two and two are from the final two

			24.7 average. the after guys racked up 2,435 points in 99 games for 
			24.6. almost a dead heat.

  another day, another 
			screwup. my apologies to the people at penn. the  quakers have 
			produced four nba coaches and the details are below. thanks to ted 
			rauch for mentioning dick harter. a correct version of how to search 
			led to the others.
  before the research for this nugget commenced, i kinda knew which 
			college would emerge victorious. the level of dominance? surprising. 
			the big 5 was formed for the 1955-56 season, but the schools go back 
			much further. maybe at some point you've wondered, how many products 
			of big 5 schools have coached in the nba? the answer is 10 and seven 
			have called saint joseph's home. penn is last at zero while la 
			salle, temple and villanova are tied for second at one. the 
			breakdown for records is below, and a big thanks goes to basketball-reference.com.  
			temple's eddie gottlieb guided the philadelphia warriors to the 
			nba's first championship in 1947 (though, at the time, the league 
			was known as the basketball association of america). the warriors 
			seized their second crown in 1956 and that team's coach was ex-hawk 
			george senesky. more titles? wait, two more, thanks to hawk hill 
			guys! jack ramsay took the portland trail blazers to the 1977 summit 
			and paul westhead did likewise with the 1980 los angeles lakers. 
			alas, both teams beat the sixers in the finals. that 1980 season 
			began wih jack mckinney -- like ramsay, he also coached high school 
			ball at the ol' st. james, in chester -- running the lakers. 
			however, he suffered serious injuries in a bicycle accident and 
			westhead replaced him 13 games in. last night, i texted long-time 
			friend and former daily news sports editor pat mcloone to see if he 
			could guess st. joe's number of nba coaches. bang, he got it. "i was 
			going to go with six, but i went with one over." niiiiiiiice.
