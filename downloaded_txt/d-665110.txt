about salem haunted happenings
in 1982, the salem chamber of commerce and the salem witch museum planned the first salem haunted happenings festival during halloween weekend.
the festival was an effort to provide family-friendly events for guests who were interested in visiting the “witch city.” with about 50,000 guests in attendance in its first year, the annual event continued to grow each season, drawing everyone from families, couples, history buffs, and halloween enthusiasts worldwide.
