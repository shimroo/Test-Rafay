  pncb credentials stand out




nurses & employers value pncb certification



pncb certification demonstrates to patients and families, employers, and the public that a nursing professional has a deep commitment to the highest standards of care for children, adolescents, and young adults. the evidence is in our renewal rate: 96% of pncb-certified nurses recertified their credentials for 2021.
in a 2020 pncb survey, 83% of health care leaders stated that they prefer to hire a certified pediatric nurse (cpn) over a pediatric nurse without the cpn credential. 
in that same survey, 85% of leaders said they prefer to hire a pnp over an fnp or pa for provision of health care to children. 
more aprns than ever are seeking validation of their developmental, behavioral, and mental health knowledge through our pediatric primary care mental health specialist (pmhs) certification. these providers actively address gaps in this much needed care. 
whether you want certification for personal or career-related reasons, we're glad you're here to join the 50,000+ nursing professionals who proudly hold a pncb credential.
