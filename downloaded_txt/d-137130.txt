a mission to advance va research since 1992the national association of veterans’ research and education foundations (navref) has been the nation’s preeminent association dedicated to advancing research and education partnerships between the u.s. department of veterans affairs (va) and stakeholders interested in advancing health research and innovation.
our network of over 75 congressionally authorized nonprofit foundations was created as a flexible va research infrastructure, bridging the gap between the academic affiliate and the local va healthcare system. these foundations are uniquely focused on advancing veteran clinical trials, innovative health research, and education initiatives designed to meet the evolving health needs of those who served.
navref has collaborated with va to streamline clinical trial opportunities for veterans, deliver cutting-edge care, and enhance education for va health care staff, veterans, and their families. by prioritizing health innovation, navref ensures that veterans benefit from groundbreaking research and accessible clinical trials across the nation.
