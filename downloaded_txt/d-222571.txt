maryjanei love love love dr sciortino  at edmonds eye assoc. i was dealing for 3 mths with an eye issue, after seeing 2 opthalmologist, ent. dr. and oculoplastic specialist, in 5 minutes dr sciortino diagnosed what the issue was & what to do about it. he listens to you intently, doesn’t rush you, and explains in detail what is going on. i had been so frustrated dealing with this issue and he relieved my concerns and anxiety. i was lucky to get an appointment when i called  thanks to janet the same day. best of all he is so pleasant to talk to. i felt very safe with him and i know he will take good care of my eyes.i highly recommend him and the staff.
 

katya i.edmonds eye associates has been a great doctor to see for a couple of years now. they have great options for discounted contacts, especially with my in-network insurance. dr. edmonds is very helpful and informative! he explained everything he was checking for in easy to understand terms. others i’ve seen here have also been good to work with. reception is always quite helpful and easy to schedule with when i call, and i like the text option for scheduling. overall, i’ve had a great experience here and will continue coming back!
 

pam g.dr. connell is the absolute best! i highly recommend him for anyone looking for an eye doctor!
 

nicholas b.absolutely lovely team.  from the front desk to the exam room to the opticians' workspace, pleasantness and enthusiasm abound.  i love my visits here.
 

dean b.best dr who helped me 100%. helped me with my vision and headaches!! i would totally recommend him.
