    what does a personal injury lawyer do?

a personal injury lawyer is a hired representative on your behalf to help you obtain financial recovery following an accident due to the negligence of another person or entity. contrary to popular belief, hiring an injury lawyer does not always mean you will have to go to court. although each case is unique, most personal injury cases settle outside of court, saving you the stresses and costs of a trial. in fact, it is in your lawyer’s best interest to obtain the highest possible settlement in the least amount of time; however, your injury attorney should never accept a settlement offer without first obtaining your approval.

 how much does a las vegas personal injury lawyer charge?

all lawyers charge a fee for their work; however, most personal injury attorneys work off a contingency fee. this means that your attorneys fee is contingent on the outcome of your case. if you win a settlement, then your attorney will collect a percentage of the settlement. typically, a contingency fee ranges from 33 percent up to 40 percent. at craig p. kenny & associates, we never make more than the client, and we fight hard to ensure you receive the maximum settlement offer possible.

 what are the most common types of las vegas personal injury cases?

in las vegas, the most common types of personal injury cases are:
 car accidents: car accidents happen every day, and in las vegas, they happen multiple times a day. for that reason, they are the most common type of personal injury case. for the most part, these types of accidents occur due to the negligence of another person or entity on the roadway. they can result in minor injuries, such as lacerations and broken bones, to severe injuries, such as brain damage and death.slip and fall: las vegas is one of the busiest tourist destinations in the world, thus making premise liability personal injury cases a second-most popular case type. from unsafe hotels, casinos, public pools, and sidewalks (to name a few), injury by property owner negligence is a serious issue in las vegas, and you shouldn’t be left footing the bill for their negligence!work comp: the third most common personal injury case in las vegas is centered around work injury accidents. workers’ compensation claims arise when an employee is wrongfully injured due to the negligence of their employer.

if you’ve been injured in an accident due to the negligence of another individual or entity, it is important to speak with a personal injury lawyer as soon as possible. each state has its limitations, and if you attempt to file a claim after your statute of limitations has passed, your claim will likely be denied.even if the insurance company has offered you a settlement for your injury, you should have an injury lawyer review the settlement offer to ensure you are receiving fair compensation for your injuries. often, the insurance companies will offer a low settlement in hopes that you will accept without an attorney’s review. do not fall victim to this tactic! contact a personal injury lawyer for a free case review–before you sign on the dotted line!

 filing a las vegas personal injury claim

to file a successful personal injury claim, it’s simply not enough to prove that a third party acted negligently and recklessly with your health; you must ultimately prove that the negligence resulted in substantial injury to your being. if you’ve been involved in an accident in las vegas, nv, it is imperative that you document your medical injuries. it is also important that you document any physical injuries that resulted from the accident. contact the personal injury lawyers at craig p. kenny & associates if you have questions regarding your accident injury.

    what to do and what not to do when in a car accident


 by jimmy howard, esq.
•
july 1, 2024

every car accident happens fast and unexpectedly. the immediate moments after a car accident are adrenaline-fueled chaos. you may be in significant pain. because of this, it is best to have a plan for what to do if a car accident happens before it happens.                                                                                                            1. call the police immediately. many times the at-fault driver will tell you, 'let's not involve the police'. the at-fault driver might even offer you some cash right on the spot or offer to get your car fixed themselves if you do not call the police. do not listen to the other person. the police will document what happened, and they will gather and exchange the necessary information among the drivers. but even if you have called the police...                                                                                                            2. get information, especially regarding the other driver and their insurance. even if you have called the police, collect all the information at the scene you can, especially regarding the other driver. ask to take a picture of their driver's license and proof of insurance. the insurance information is critical to making a claim to get repairs or pay for medical expenses. take pictures of their car, both the damage to it and the license plate. take photos of your car, particularly the damage to it. ask for the driver's address and/or phone number. ask for witnesses' names and phone numbers or a business card. if you have called the police, you might think, well the police will get all that information, and that is true. but, what if the other driver just decides to flee before the police arrive? it happens.                                                                                                            3. get medical treatment for your injuries as soon as possible. commonly people feel pain after an accident but think it will heal on its own if they don't have an obvious serious injury, like a broken bone. then after a few weeks of the pain not going away, they decide to seek care. the other driver's insurance company will call this a gap in treatment and argue you must not have been that injured if you waited so long to get treatment. or, they may say you hurt yourself doing something else but want to blame it on the accident. these can be strong arguments against your case, particularly the longer you go between the accident and getting treatment. get checked out as soon as possible after an accident if you are feeling any pain.                                                                                                            4. call craig p. kenny & associates and speak with an attorney as soon as possible. our law firm has been helping nevada car accident victims for almost 30 years. our attorneys and staff have traveled the road of a car accident's aftermath every day for those 30 years. we are aware of laws, pitfalls, and windfalls that most people would not know. just a few examples: did you know there can be several layers of insurance available to pay for your medical treatment and pain and suffering after a car accident? does it make a difference if the other driver was arrested for driving under the influence? what if you are working when you are in a car accident? do you have a workers' compensation claim, a car accident claim, or both? what if the other driver's insurance company refuses your claim and you have to file a lawsuit? at craig p. kenny & associates, we have dealt with all of these situations many times over many years.                                                                                                            5. do not talk to or give statements to the other driver's insurance company. the other driver's insurance company has a legal obligation to protect their insured. when they take statements from you, they are trying to protect their insured and the insurance company's money. they are not acting as your friend. if you hire craig p. kenny & associates, we will talk to the other driver's insurance company for you. we know what to ask, what to say, and what not to say.                                                                                                            6. do not attempt to negotiate a quick settlement with the insurance company. this is what the other driver's insurance company wants you to do. sign away all your future rights for a pittance. if it turns out that you have a hidden injury like a herniated disc in your spine that will cause you pain for the rest of your life and might require surgery, it is too late if you take their money and sign their paperwork. you released all claims, even if you did not know about the injuries at the time. the law does allow you to back out of such a deal for a short period of time. but, you have to revoke the deal in writing and send back the money quickly.                                                                                                            please have a plan of what to do if you are in a car accident before you are in a car accident. make part of that plan to call craig p. kenny & associates, where clients are treated with honesty and sincerity.




   

    who will bail you out?


 by senator melanie scheible, esq.
•
june 3, 2024

understanding what bail is and how it works can be incredibly difficult and stressful when someone gets arrested. the concept of posting bail to get out of jail dates back centuries and has changed over time in the united states and nevada. in its simplest form, bail is a refundable deposit that a person pays to get out of jail and gets back when they come to court. have you ever test-driven a car without a salesperson? you may have been asked to leave your driver’s license or credit card with the salesperson before they handed you the keys to the car. the idea is that the dealership expects that your license or credit card is so valuable to you that you will come back for it, rather than abscond with their vehicle. the same is true of bail. the idea is that once someone pays the bail amount to the jail, they will want it back enough to come to their next court date.                                                                                     the purpose of bail -- to ensure a person’s return to court – has expanded to also include adding conditions of release that ensure the safety of the community. in nevada, judges are legally required to impose the “least restrictive means” necessary to ensure 1) the person will return to court and 2) the safety of the community. posting a monetary bail is just one of many possible conditions of release.                                                                                     when someone is arrested in nevada, they are entitled to a hearing on their custody status within 48 hours. that hearing is an opportunity for the person arrested, their attorney, the prosecutor, and the judge to review the facts of the case known at the time as well as the person’s criminal history. at this hearing, the attorneys may agree on release conditions, or they may each argue their position and the judge will decide. for example, one or both attorneys might suggest that the person be released on house arrest, or be released with a requirement for drug testing.                                                                                     many people who are arrested on misdemeanor charges, like driving under the influence, are released without a hearing and in less than 48 hours. someone can also be released from jail in less than 48 hours by posting bail before the hearing. if your loved one has been arrested, you may be trying to decide whether to post bail or wait. every case is different and the right decision varies for different families. what is important to remember is that if it has been less than 48 hours since your loved one’s arrest, the bail amount or release conditions may still change. an attorney cannot make any promises or guarantees about what will happen in your loved one’s case, but a good, local attorney can tell you what their experience has been in similar cases. knowing what an experienced attorney has seen happen in similar cases, may help you make the right decision in your situation.                                                                                     increasingly, courts across the country are moving away from monetary bail. some courts are implementing robust reminder systems that automatically send emails or text messages reminding people about their court dates. other courts have extensive monitoring programs that utilize technology like house arrest ankle bracelets, phone gps, and fingerprint scanning to keep routine contact with people facing criminal charges. some courts are offering people the choice between submitting to monitoring and posting a monetary bail. all of these policy choices are a crucial part of our justice system, which entitles everyone to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.                                                                                                  if you, a friend, or a loved one has been arrested, please call me at                                              702-380-2800                                               for a free consultation.
