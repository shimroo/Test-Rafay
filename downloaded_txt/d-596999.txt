enterprise feature
delivered only by dale


because you should know who's training your employees before you sign the check

let's be honest, in 2024 mortgage and real estate "coaches" are a dime a dozen. that's why all of our training is delivered exclusively by the name you trust, not the one you're assigned.

enterprise feature
live and on-demand


so your team can learn when, where, and how they want
corporate learning has separated into two camps:

coordinating groups to train together
leaving employees to their own devices

frankly, both have their pros and cons. which is why we've blended the two approaches to streamline your training dollars while ensuring each team member gets the engaging learning experience they deserve.

week over week, we are seeing 25-40% increase in production, but i don’t think we have scratched the surface yet.
this is why i cant appreciate you and the team enough, allows me to put all my trust into your team.

i have been through countless seminars and trainings from everyone you could think of.. but as it stands for a direct message, influence and guidance on what we are experiencing in the live moment, this crushed it.
i have no less than 100 pages of notes from the 8 hours and a lot to work on, internalize and make my own.
dale was great when i first met him 20 years ago, he’s on a new level that is unmatched.

being a call center and preferring not to be away from our desks for significant portions of the day, this couldn’t be a better format to deliver the message.
ps: the website is phenomenal. your tech in general appears to be the best in market. the videos are crisp, clear and look impressive on this side.

40%

applying the strategies dale teaches can gain more production from high achievers than you think. we were always focused on listening and coaching low performers, and this experience completely changed our perspective.
