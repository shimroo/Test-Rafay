                                    our beginnings                                    



                                    f.f. screw products started in 1973 as a job shop in a 1000 square foot building that was run as a part time operation with 1 employee. within 4 years, it changed to a full time operation with 10 employees. in 1982 after years of doing job shop components for many large companies we decided to start making our own product and f-k bearings was started. at that time we were operating both f.f. screw products and f.k. bearing in two separate buildings that were approximately 36,000 square feet combined.

                                    hose ends may look like simple devices, but at fps we take them very seriously. we have spent several years researching, testing and retesting to perfect the production of what we feel is the finest hose end available. period! we hope that you will agree.
