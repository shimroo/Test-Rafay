	 the swell season and the movie once
	 


amazon.com: the swell season: music: glen hansard & marketa irglovaquickly, the movie "once" has become one of my favorite rock movies.  actually, i picked it up because the review on the cover said it was one of the "best rock movies ever," which i can agree with.  it's a beautiful film with beautiful music and one of those saddest, yet hopeful endings i've ever seen.  it feels like an honest portrayal of life.the music itself was what really got to me in many of the same ways damien rice's first album 'o' spoke to me.  there's real soul in this irishman's voice.   i did some digging, considered getting the soundtrack and stumbled upon this instead.  this is the source album where much of the music originated from the film's two stars.really, see this movie, listen to this album (or the soundtrack).  you will feel better for doing it, like you've experienced . . . something.  nothing life changing, but perhaps gotten a peak at someone else's epiphany so that you might learn from it.

	 amy winehouse
	 


amy winehouse denied visa, won't be at grammys - cnn.comi've been meaning to post about amy winehouse for some time now.  there's been something ruminating the in back of my head for months after i first heard "back to black" and it's basically this. . . where's the talent?i've heard it all before.  it's always phil spector-esque production going back to the old campy, girl groups, or even the power of the surpremes.  granted, winehouse has some pipes, and she's got some lyrics, but it always seems to fall short.  also, i hear a lot that harks back to shirley brown and the blunt honesty in her music, but still, it just comes up short.i don't mean to crap on someone while she's down, but what's the big deal about amy winehouse?  is it because her songs seem to relate to the various scandals surrounding our american stars?  does "rehab" bring soul to the troubles of britney spears?  really, it all just makes me yawn.and besides lily allen is hotter.

	 nasa to broadcast beatles tune
	 


canoe -- jam! music: nasa to broadcast beatles tunewow!  really, i can't think of many better songs for this except for maybe "calling occupants of interstellar craft" by klaatu, but i think that might be one for seti to use.  it's also a nice way to cross promote the movie's dvd release which i anxious to see.  (del doesn't know it's a part of her valentine's day gift.)"jai guru deva oooommmmmmmmmmm!"

	 reunions.
	 
    

i have had that stupid new spice girls song "headlines" stuck in my head for the past two days.  now, i'm perfectly fine with reunions.  the led zeppelin reunion got my hopes up, and the pink floyd one is still one of those indelible moments that might only be equaled by child birth or marriage.  truly, it was something i thought would never happen.  (and i still hope for more.)but the spice girls?  a group responsible for some of the worst ear worms imaginable?  gah!  i'll admit melanie c. is a fine songwriter, but . . . gah!  this has got to go.of course, i write all this with the new kids on the block reunion looming like a great shadow that will result in the funniest mooning ever known.  after all, watching a group of guys in their late thirties prance around on stage like they're in their teens will be worth it alone.  it does make me wonder: what's next?  mili vanili?girl, you know it's true. . .  the whole talk causes me to shiver.  how about a temple of the dog reunion?  a new album, something that truly doesn't suck from popsters from the early nineties.  it would be better than a lot of what chris cornell has been up to lately.  brad manages to get back together every now and again.oh! speaking of good reunion stuff, the cowboy junkies have a stellar new release out called "trinity revisited" which is their entire "trinity sessions" album rerecorded live with a few of their friends (including my old musical love, natalie merchant.)here's the latest mix including a bit from that old cowboy junkies album.  hopefully, it will answer one of the modern world's greatest mysteries "who's gene autry?"loving at night1. jesse harris & the ferdinandos - you, the queen2. tom waits - gun street girl3. hank williams sr. - hey good lookin'4. gordon lightfoot - summertime dream5. al green - i'm glad you're mine6. willie nelson - gravedigger7. johnny cash & john carter cash - who's gene autry?8. hem - rainy night in georgia9. cowboy junkies - misguided angel10. leonard cohen - night comes on11. the irish rovers - the first love of life12. commander cody & his lost plan - back to tennessee13. shooter jennings - slow train (feat. the oak ridge boys)14. ade peever - night on earth15. john prine - angel from montgomery16. waylon jennings - the wurlitzer prize (i don't want to get over you)

	 syd barrett, plastic people hit broadway : rolling stone
	 


syd barrett, plastic people hit broadway : rolling stonethis actually sounds pretty cool.  if it's historically accurate, i've no idea, but it's something i wouldn't mind seeing.  i know the idea of rock as a means of awakening is nothing new in media, (i've even tried writing about it in fiction myself) but i don't hear about it being documented in real life much.i also think i can relate to the idea of the piper at the gates of dawn influencing my life.  (he certainly influenced my imagination.)
