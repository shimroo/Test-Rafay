diversity, equity, inclusion

the
 psychotherapy profession is based on the premise of trust and 
acceptance of all. in this spirit, scv-camft embraces and celebrates the
 dynamic diversity of our region. the santa clara valley provides us 
with the incredible privilege of being part of a global community. we 
experience working alongside colleagues from different parts of the 
world and clients who bring new learning opportunities and scope for 
professional growth.  we
 acknowledge the richness of identities and expressions at the 
intersection of ethnicity, race, gender, sexual orientation, physical 
and mental abilities, socioeconomic status, religion, and immigration 
status. scv-camft stands in solidarity with our bipoc (black, 
indigenous, and people of color) community members whose lives are 
impacted by systemic and historical racism and discrimination. our 
organization is committed to fostering an environment of inclusivity by 
providing ongoing professional learning opportunities and 
intra-community programs that help us promote cultural humility, social 
advocacy, and justice as we walk hand in hand towards a more accepting 
community.
