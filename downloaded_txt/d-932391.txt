lots of nice machines for sale on the

the bryans penny arcade
by melvyn wright

this web site is a tribute to w.e.bryan, the inventive genius of the british
slot machine industry.  it contains a complete listing of his machines,
along with photographs and information about each machine.  there is
also a collectors' corner, where bryans enthusiasts can buy, sell, and swap
machines with other collectors. 

i am always interested in hearing from fellow bryans collectors, particularly
if you can supply any additional information for these pages, especially
photographs.

w.e.bryan and his slot
      machines
      william edward bryan was born in 1894, and opened up his slot machine factory
      at kegworth, derbyshire (england) in 1920.  he had served his apprenticeship
      with rolls royce and worked as a motor mechanic in his own garage.  the
      local showmen would bring their slot machines to his garage for him to repair.
       he became fascinated by these slot machines, and was convinced that
      he could design better and more reliable examples.  how right he was!
       he soon left the garage trade, and began producing slot machines full-time.
      
      bryan was a mechanical genius, who invented 48 different amusement machine
      designs, and patented many improvements to their mechanisms.  whereas
      other slot machine manufacturers would simply copy existing ideas, perhaps
      with different artwork, bryan would devise totally new and original
      games.  even games which outwardly appeared to be similar to standard
      machines had additional features like replays, multiple-payouts, jackpots
      and operator customisation.  it seems that no mechanical problem would
      be too complex for bryan's inventive mind to solve, and his solutions were
      often deceptively simple.  some of his machines were full of a bewildering
      array of levers, wheels and linkages; but they were always very reliable.
       they had to be, otherwise he would have been out of business very quickly.


william edward bryan


bryan officially retired in 1966, but his inventive skills
      proved impossible to replace, and he continued design work for the factory
      until 1973.  he died in 1984.  the bryans automatic works still
      continued to trade in kegworth up until the year 2000, run by william's son,
      jim bryan.  as well as supplying new machines, they also supplied spare
      parts and undertook repairs for machine operators and collectors.  the
      value of bryans machines, and the interest in them, has risen significantly
      in the last few years, as slot machine enthusiasts have come to appreciate
      his fascinating games, and the clever mechanisms behind them.

thanks to
david
lavender, and others,
who have given me valuable information in connection with this site.  i
am also grateful to those who have submitted photographs, the names of whom
are to be found alongside the photographs in question.
special thanks must also go to
jim hacking and john cottrell
  for providing copies
of many of the original bryans instruction sheets and advertising
flyers.
a note about values: these were included
on the site because 80% of emails received by me are of the type "i have
xyz machine - how much is it worth?". the values are based on the best
information available at the time, but they are subject to large
fluctuations due to the condition of the machine, the case style, and the
demand for it at the time of sale.  there is no guarantee that your
particular machine is worth the amount shown on this site.  nothing
is worth more than you can get for it on the day.  as these are british
machines and most collectors are based in britain, all values are given in
british pounds (£).
