the importance of having a water filter
water is part of life; we need it not just for drinking, but also for many other areas of our daily lives. it may be ubiquitous, but the water in the oceans is not ready for us to drink. this is why there are companies that work on harboring and cleaning water, for use in our homes, and it is this treated water that comes out of our household taps. we take water for granted; think of the number of times you turn on a tap every day â or drink it out of a bottle â without even considering where it came from.
the quality of our water also differs not just from country to country, but from area to area; even very small distances can see large differences in water quality. many people, to overcome this problem and for other reasons, use water filters in the home and in the workplace. do you need one? you might find it to be surprisingly beneficial, so letâs look at what a water filter can do.
what is a water filter?
most home water filters are surprisingly simple devices that are designed to remove impurities in the water you get from the tap. they work by way of one of several types of filter system â some are simple paper versions, others use fine metal screens â and you simply pass the water through the filter and it emerges with a greater level of purity than before.
the standard of filtering you need depends on what your water is like to begin with; if you have a particularly dirty water output â one that you can see discoloration in â it does not necessarily mean your water is undrinkable, but there are clearly impurities in there. a strong water filter will render your water clear and pure, and will do so quickly and with little effort.
pure water â that which has been filtered â will undoubtedly taste better than that which still contains impurities, and will be healthier for you, too. bear in mind that much of the water we drink and use in other ways has come from the ground, so no matter how thoroughly it has been cleaned, it will still contain dirt and perhaps minute bits of grit. a filter will help with this, and you will soon see the difference. brands like berkey (berkey review here) and brita are perfect examples of filters that can make more pure water.
removing pathogens
there is every chance that minute bacteria can be found in your water supply, and this can lead to illness without you knowing. there may even be traces of old pesticides in the water, which stem from many years ago. each of these needs to be removed, and a good water filter will certainly do the job. also, many water companies add chlorine to water as a routine, and this can affect the taste and smell of water so needs to be removed.
old water systems may involve lead pipes, and this can also add to discoloration of water. a filter will remove the lead content, making the water safer and more palatable. the same applies to other older systems that may have corroded metal pipes; this can be removed using a good water filter.
even if you donât necessarily see impurities in your drinking and household water, you can rest assured they are there. they may be harmless in most cases, but whatâs the harm in being extra sure you have clean and usable water? water filters are not expensive and make a sensible addition to your kitchen appliances, so why not check them out now and see how you can have clean, usable water that is a pure as possible?
