we  have closed our doors permanently!






 
it is with great reluctance and sadness that we must announce that after forty-eight years of business, we have ceased operations entirely effective september 8, 2019. this is obviously not a decision that we make lightly, but, given the tremendous drop-off in the wine & (especially) beer making business over the past five years, we can no longer continue. it gives us little consolation that this trend is a national one, resulting in hundreds of shop closures all across the country. the irony, of course, is that we have reached this impasse so soon after we peaked in mid-2014. thank you to everyone that has supported us over the past forty-eight years! we do sincerely appreciate your patronage! hopefully, the market will pick back up and you will be able to choose from a vast myriad of wine & beer making supplies in the near future!
