how is physical therapy helpful? 


therapeutic exercises will help strengthen muscles/tendons/ligaments surrounding joints to provide support to the joint. physical therapy will also focus on pain relief modalities, proper posture, body mechanics, and gait training.


how does the cortisone injection work? 


cortisone is a steroid that will help reduce inflammation in the area that it is injected. as a result, the swelling and pain is reduced improving pain and function in your joint or tendon.
