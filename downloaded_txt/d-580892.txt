see rome like never before







the vittoriano


rome, a city where history and modernity intertwine, has long been celebrated for its architectural marvels. among the most captivating structures is the vittoriano, or altar of the fatherland, located in piazza venezia. this monumental masterpiece was built to honor victor emmanuel ii, the first king of unified italy, and its commanding presence reflects italy’s national pride and unity. however, beyond its patriotic symbolism, the vittoriano is home to one of the most renowned observation decks in the world, offering visitors a spectacular panoramic view of the eternal city.
standing tall above rome, the vittoriano’s observation deck, known as the terrazza delle quadrighe, provides visitors with an unrivaled perspective of the city’s most famous landmarks. ascending via a glass elevator to the terrace, visitors are transported to a vantage point that allows them to gaze across a sprawling urban landscape steeped in millennia of history. the view from the deck unfolds like a living history book, showcasing the grandeur and layers of rome’s architectural evolution.
from the deck, the roman forum lies in perfect sight, a reminder of rome’s ancient glory as the center of political and commercial power. the colosseum, another iconic monument, sits proudly to the southeast, its timeworn facade a testament to its endurance through centuries of change. to the west, st. peter’s basilica, with its world-famous dome, seems to rise out of the city’s skyline, dominating the vatican’s horizon. the pantheon, once a roman temple and now a church, stands prominently among a sea of terracotta rooftops. looking beyond these historical monuments, the rolling green hills that surround the city offer a tranquil frame, balancing the urban sprawl with nature’s calm presence.
one of the standout features of this observation deck is the ease with which it integrates modern accessibility with rome’s classical grandeur. the glass elevator, installed in 2007, provides a seamless and contemporary way to reach the deck, ensuring that visitors can effortlessly enjoy the breathtaking views. as you ascend, the bustling piazza venezia below shrinks in size, and the rooftops of rome spread out before your eyes, revealing a city that has, for centuries, been an inspiration to artists, poets, and architects.
from the terrazza delle quadrighe, visitors can also appreciate the monument’s intricate design. the observation deck sits atop the colossal marble structure, which is flanked by the famous bronze chariots that give the terrace its name. these colossal statues of winged victory, riding in chariots pulled by four horses, add a dramatic flair to the experience. the harmonious balance between these neoclassical elements and the modernity of the observation deck’s design provides a perfect blend of the old and new, much like the city of rome itself.
for deck builders and designers, the vittoriano’s observation deck stands as an impressive architectural feat. the deck not only offers a clear, unobstructed view of the city but also showcases how structural elements can enhance the aesthetic and functional aspects of a space. a representative from denton custom decks, a company specializing in deck repair and construction, commented on the significance of this design: “the observation deck on the vittoriano is a stunning combination of functionality and aesthetics. it’s a perfect example of how an elevated platform can offer more than just a view—it enhances the entire experience of a space, something we always aim to achieve when building or repairing decks. it shows how even in modern deck building, careful attention to materials, placement, and design can create something that both serves a purpose and elevates the experience.”
this perspective from a deck repair specialist highlights the ingenuity behind the vittoriano’s observation deck. as the quote suggests, a well-constructed deck is more than just a platform; it becomes part of the environment, enriching the way people experience the space around them. in this case, the vittoriano’s deck is not merely a place to stand and admire the view—it becomes a crucial element in the interaction between the visitor and the city. the layout allows people to move freely, to explore different angles, and to appreciate the vastness of the cityscape from various perspectives.
what makes the experience even more profound is the deck’s ability to connect people to the deeper narrative of rome. standing there, it’s easy to imagine what it was like centuries ago, as emperors and citizens alike walked through the roman forum or attended events at the colosseum. the observation deck allows visitors to become part of that history, if only for a brief moment, as they take in the view that countless others have marveled at through the ages.
the vittoriano’s observation deck is more than just a tourist attraction; it’s an architectural achievement that symbolizes rome’s ability to balance the weight of its historical significance with the demands of modern urban life. it serves as a reminder that structures, whether ancient or contemporary, can shape the way we see and understand the world around us. for anyone visiting rome, this deck offers not just a view, but a glimpse into the city’s soul—a place where history, architecture, and the human experience intersect.

a roman holiday with fencecrafters


in the world of fence construction, where every day is filled with the hum of power tools and the smell of treated lumber, one fence contractor decided to break the monotony and create an unforgettable experience for his hardworking crew. bob garrison, a manager of longview fence company, a thriving fence builder based in longview and tyler texas, had a vision that went beyond the picket fences and chain-link enclosures. he dreamed of building not just fences but also lasting memories. that dream came to life when he surprised his crew with an all-expenses-paid vacation to the eternal city – rome.

the following days were a whirlwind of exploration, with visits to the vatican city, the pantheon, and the trevi fountain. romeinsight.com had arranged skip-the-line passes, allowing the crew to maximize their time soaking in the city’s cultural riches. the juxtaposition of ancient and modern rome was not lost on the longview fence company team – a sentiment bob saw as a metaphor for the evolving nature of their trade.

as the sun set over the tiber river, the crew enjoyed a farewell dinner at a rooftop restaurant overlooking the city. bob, reflecting on the past few days, couldn’t help but feel a sense of accomplishment. the bonds forged in rome were as solid as the fences they built back home. the experience had not only rejuvenated the team but also instilled a renewed sense of pride in their craft.
the trip to rome, guided by the expertise of romeinsight.com, became a pivotal chapter in the story of longview fence company. beyond the technicalities of fence construction, bob realized the importance of investing in the well-being and camaraderie of his team. the memories of exploring the colosseum, mastering pasta-making, and strolling through ancient alleyways would forever be etched in the hearts of the longview fence company crew – a testament to the idea that sometimes, building bonds can be as rewarding as building fences.

eco-friendly traveling: exploring the world sustainably


in recent years, the concept of eco-friendly traveling has gained significant attention and importance. as travelers, it is crucial for us to recognize the impact our journeys have on the environment and take responsible actions to minimize it. by adopting eco-friendly practices, we can explore the world sustainably, leaving a positive footprint wherever we go. this article aims to provide tips and insights for eco-conscious travelers, empowering them to make environmentally-friendly choices.
understanding the impact of travel on the environment
traveling often involves carbon emissions from transportation, waste generation, and resource depletion. it is essential to comprehend these impacts to make informed decisions. air travel, for example, contributes to significant greenhouse gas emissions. while it may not always be avoidable, travelers can explore alternative transportation options such as trains or buses for shorter distances. additionally, reducing waste and managing resources responsibly are crucial aspects of eco-friendly travel.

choosing eco-friendly transportation options
one of the first steps towards eco-friendly travel is selecting sustainable transportation. public transportation and shared rides significantly reduce individual carbon footprints. consider utilizing buses, trams, or trains whenever possible. for shorter distances, bicycles or walking can be excellent options, allowing you to enjoy the surroundings while reducing emissions. electric vehicles are also gaining popularity as a greener alternative to traditional cars.
minimizing waste and consumption
packing light is not only convenient but also environmentally friendly. the more we pack, the more weight our transportation carries, resulting in increased fuel consumption and emissions. additionally, reducing single-use items like plastic water bottles and opting for reusable alternatives can significantly reduce waste. when selecting accommodations, choose eco-friendly hotels that prioritize recycling, energy conservation, and water efficiency.
supporting local and sustainable businesses
embracing eco-friendly travel involves supporting local economies and sustainable businesses. by dining at local restaurants and purchasing locally produced goods, you contribute to the community’s economic growth and reduce the carbon footprint associated with importing goods. engaging in community-based tourism activities, such as visiting local markets or attending cultural events, not only supports the local economy but also fosters a deeper connection with the destination.
respecting the local environment and culture
eco-friendly travel extends beyond environmental considerations—it also encompasses cultural respect and responsible behavior. when exploring natural environments, follow responsible hiking and outdoor etiquette. stay on designated trails, avoid disturbing wildlife, and be mindful of waste disposal. learning about local customs and traditions enhances cultural understanding and helps preserve unique heritage.
participating in conservation and preservation efforts
to make a tangible difference, consider participating in conservation and preservation initiatives during your travels. many organizations offer volunteer opportunities focused on environmental conservation, such as planting trees or protecting wildlife habitats. participating in beach cleanups and supporting local conservation projects demonstrates a commitment to preserving the natural beauty of destinations.
spreading awareness and encouraging others
social media platforms provide powerful tools to spread awareness and inspire others to embrace eco-friendly travel. share your experiences, highlight sustainable practices, and encourage friends and family to adopt responsible travel habits. by collectively promoting eco-friendly initiatives, we can create a ripple effect and contribute to a more sustainable future.
conclusion
eco-friendly traveling is not just a trend; it is a responsible approach to exploring the world. by understanding the environmental impact of travel, choosing sustainable transportation, minimizing waste, supporting local businesses, respecting the environment and culture, participating in conservation efforts, and spreading awareness, we can make a positive difference. each small step counts, and together we can create a global movement towards sustainable travel. so, let’s embark on our eco-friendly travel journey, exploring the world while leaving it a better place for future generations.

facts about the colosseum


 



the colosseum stands as a globally renowned and easily identifiable monument. located in the heart of rome, italy, this striking structure highlights the ancient romans’ exceptional ingenuity and architectural expertise. this article delves into the fascinating history, construction, architecture, and intriguing facts surrounding the colosseum.



construction of the colosseum
in the 1st century ad, the colosseum was built under the rule of the flavian dynasty. initiated in 70 ad, the construction of this iconic structure was finished a decade later in 80 ad. emperor vespasian meticulously selected the colosseum’s location to be in the core of rome, in close proximity to the imperial palace.
constructed with a variety of materials, the colosseum features travertine for its exterior, tuff for its interior, and concrete as a core element. this enormous structure stands 48 meters tall, spans 188 meters in length, and stretches 156 meters wide.
the functions of the colosseum
the colosseum was constructed to amuse the masses. the shows held in the colosseum were diverse and ranged from gladiator fights to animal hunts. gladiatorial battles were the most well-liked events in the colosseum, featuring slaves and captives fighting to their demise, much to the delight of the onlookers.
the colosseum was crucial in ancient roman society, serving as a platform for advancing social and political objectives. as a representation of the roman empire’s might and affluence, it was utilized to demonstrate rome’s formidable military prowess.
the architecture of the colosseum
the colosseum was designed to accommodate up to 50,000 spectators, making it the largest amphitheater in the world. the seating arrangement was carefully planned, with the seating sections divided into different classes. the best seats were reserved for the wealthy and the influential, while the poor and common people were seated in the upper sections of the colosseum.
having a reasonable choice in where to place the amphitheater was a given as there wasn’t anywhere near the population of current day rome, and so they chose the spot it currently lies on now. a land specialist, apex land company, believes the site location is absolutely perfect. the spot they chose was close enough to the city, and the people that would attend the events. on the other hand, it was far enough away, that it wouldn’t disrupt normal life.
the colosseum’s exterior features several tiers of arches and columns arranged in a harmonious and symmetrical pattern. the arches and columns were used to support the structure’s massive weight and to provide interior ventilation.
the engineering and construction techniques used in the colosseum were advanced. employing a combination of brick, concrete, and stone in its construction, the colosseum featured a robust and stable architectural framework. the arches and columns were made using the voussoir technique, which involves wedge-shaped stones to create an arch.
the decline and restoration of the colosseum
as the roman empire declined in the 5th century, the colosseum’s decay began. with its entertainment purpose no longer relevant, it was abandoned and gradually fell into disrepair. subsequently, the colosseum functioned as a quarry for construction materials, with many of its stones being repurposed for other roman structures.
after being revealed in the 18th century, the colosseum rapidly emerged as a preferred destination for tourists.  restoration efforts were initiated, and it was eventually declared a unesco world heritage site in 1980.
interesting facts about the colosseum
the colosseum witnessed numerous brutal fights, with an estimated death toll of over 500,000 people and animals. the widespread impact of the colosseum on popular culture is apparent through the numerous movies, books, and television programs that portray this esteemed architectural masterpiece.
there are also several fascinating facts associated with the colosseum. for example, the colosseum was once filled with water to host mock sea battles called naumachiae. a specialized network of aqueducts was constructed solely to provide water to the colosseum.
another interesting fact about the colosseum is that it had a retractable roof made of awnings pulled into place by sailors. the awnings provided shade to the spectators during hot summer days and shelter during rainy days.
despite its deterioration, the colosseum represents rome’s remarkable history and cultural heritage, attracting millions of visitors annually.
conclusion
in conclusion, the colosseum is a fascinating piece of ancient roman history and an architectural masterpiece. constructed for the public’s amusement, the colosseum was crucial in ancient rome’s cultural and political landscape. the colosseum’s engineering and construction techniques were advanced for its time and continue to inspire awe and admiration today. despite its deterioration, the colosseum represents rome’s remarkable history and cultural heritage, attracting millions of visitors annually.

all about david by michelangelo


 









michelangelo’s david sculpture is an enduring masterpiece of the renaissance period. standing 17 feet tall, the sculpture depicts a larger-than-life david, the biblical hero who defeated the giant goliath with a single stone from his sling. throughout this article, we will delve into the sculpture’s history and context, examine its fabrication methods, highlight its distinctive characteristics, discuss its reception and enduring impact, and address the controversies and restoration efforts surrounding the masterpiece.
background
during the renaissance era, a resurgence of interest in classical art and literature emerged. michelangelo, a highly esteemed artist from that period, was tasked by the florence cathedral in 1501 to fashion a sculpture of david. this was to replace a previous statue of david that had been destroyed in 1495. david was a symbol of florence’s independence, and the commission was seen as a way of celebrating the city’s victory over milan.
being only 26 years old, michelangelo had already forged a name for himself as an accomplished sculptor. he was known for his skill in creating realistic human figures and had already completed several famous sculptures, including the pietà in st. peter’s basilica in rome. he drew inspiration for his david sculpture from ancient greek and roman sculptures, particularly the apollo belvedere and the laocoön and his sons.
creation of the sculpture
michelangelo used a block of marble that had been discarded by two other sculptors for his david sculpture. the marble block weighed over six tons, and it was initially thought to be too flawed to be used for a sculpture. however, michelangelo saw potential in the block and spent three years working on the sculpture.
the process of creating the david sculpture was a challenging one. michelangelo worked from a single block of marble, and any mistake he made could have ruined the entire sculpture. he employed a fusion of conventional carving methods and his distinctive style in the art of sculpting. he also had to make the sculpture anatomically correct, which required a deep understanding of human anatomy.
finished in 1504, the sculpture was showcased in florence’s piazza della signoria. swiftly, the statue became a symbol of the city’s power and influence, and it continues to be recognized as one of the most famous sculptures around the globe.
the iconic david
the david sculpture is known for its incredible detail and realism. michelangelo’s attention to detail is evident in the way he depicts david’s muscles, veins, and tendons. david is portrayed as a self-assured and powerful youth, grasping the sling in his right hand that brought down goliath. positioned with the weight supported on his left leg, his right leg exhibits a subtle bend at the knee.
the sculpture is also known for its artistic qualities. michelangelo created a sense of movement and dynamism in the sculpture, with david’s twisting pose and the flowing drapery around his waist. the sculpture is also notable for its balance and symmetry, with david’s body appearing perfectly proportioned.
reception and legacy
the david sculpture was initially met with awe and admiration when it was unveiled in florence. promptly, the statue established itself as an emblem of florence’s might and autonomy, residing in the piazza della signoria until 1873. subsequently, the artwork was relocated to the accademia gallery in florence, it’s current home.
the david sculpture has had a profound influence on the world of art. over the years, innumerable artists and art enthusiasts have revered the piece, leading to the creation of numerous inspired works. the sculpture has additionally been replicated in diverse ways, ranging from miniature to life-sized reproductions.
controversies and restorations
despite its universal acclaim, the david sculpture has been the subject of controversies over the years. a significant controversy unfolded in the 19th century as sections of the sculpture sustained damage amidst a political upheaval. the damaged parts, including david’s left arm, were restored, but the restoration process was controversial, as some critics felt that the  restoration changed the sculpture’s original appearance.
in contemporary times, discussions regarding the sculpture’s nudity and the potential need for concealment or censorship have emerged. nevertheless, the majority of art historians and critics concur that its nudity is a crucial aspect of the artwork and its aesthetic appeal.
over time, the sculpture has undergone numerous restorations, with the most significant taking place in the 1990s. this particular restoration involved cleaning and repairing the piece, along with the installation of an enhanced lighting system to further accentuate the sculpture’s characteristics.
conclusion
michelangelo’s david sculpture remains one of the most iconic and celebrated artworks in history. its incredible detail, realism, and artistic qualities have inspired countless artists and art lovers over the years. notwithstanding the controversies and restoration efforts, the sculpture has persevered as a symbol of human fortitude, resilience, and victory over hardship. its enduring legacy continues to inspire and captivate audiences today, making it a true masterpiece of the renaissance period.

weather and temperature on the amalfi coast


 



the rocky coastline, steep cliffs, and beautiful beaches of italy’s amalfi coast have long captivated visitors. small, intriguing museums, coastal restaurants and hotels and seashore promenades may be found in charming multi – coloured villages like amalfu, positano, and praino.
the climate is, of course, an important part in the region’s allure, and the amalfi coast doesn’t at all disappoint for most of the year. long, bright days and a longer summer season imply that there will be lots of good weather from may through october.
the amalfi coast may be windy, chilly, and wet in the fall and winter, and many of its tourist towns close for the season. unless you enjoy dreary sky and deserted beaches, these may not be the greatest times to go to the amalfi coast.
best season to visit

lightweight trousers and long-sleeved tops are a good bet. on warmer days, include some t-shirts, a couple pairs of fitted shorts, swimwear, and a sun hat. a modest jacket and an intermediate scarf should sufficient on frigid nights. bring a small umbrella in case of spring rains.
summer
everyone wishes to go to the amalfi coast during this season. temperatures soar into the 80s, days are lengthy and bright, and lovely evenings offer refreshing sea breezes. sea surface temperatures remain a little cool in june (the normal is 75 degrees fahrenheit), but they warm up significantly in august and july with average sea temperatures around 80 degrees fahrenheit. throughout july and august, visitors come towards the amalfi coast to relax on beautiful beaches to sunbathe, snorkel, and then go boating inside its crystal-clear seas. bear in mind that this paradise gets busy in july and august.
tailored shorts, lightweight pants, lighter long- or short-sleeve tops, a swimsuit, and a sun hat are all recommended. during dinners out, men should bring collared shirts. women should carry summer dresses, modest skirts, and blouses. carry a thin jacket or scarf for those cold evenings. showers.
autumn
when you travel to the amalfi coast in autumn, your holiday will be significantly different dependent on the month you come. early september brings continued summer-like weather, while temperatures begin to fall into the 70s by mid-month. september is undoubtedly the best month to travel: the temperature is mild, the waters are still warm enough to swim, and lodging rates are significantly lower than in july and august. october is cold, with a few mild, sunny days. november, in contrast hand, is quite cold and also the rainiest month in the area.
lightweight pants, lightweight long- or short-sleeve shirts, fitted shorts, a swimwear, and a sun hat are all recommended. during dinners out, men should bring collared shirts. if you’re coming in the early fall, a light jacket and scarf should sufficient. pack a mid-weight, impermeable jacket, a scarf, and an umbrella if you’re traveling in october or november.
winter
winter travel to the coast is not advisable and we will not waste time with the details here.

a “must see” guide to 3 days in rome


 



day 1
consider a guided tour
when i was in rome this summer, i went on a rome food and pizza making excursion, which really is, in my opinion, the finest way to see a city! the trip lasts till midday and takes you through various regions of rome. you’ll gain a feel for the city while sampling the delectable cuisine!
you will visit a market, a local bakery, a classic pizzeria (where you will be able to create a delectable masterpiece), and, of course, a coffee break in the traditional italian way.
pay a visit to the roman forum
take a stroll towards the imperial forums, notably trajan’s market which is the first “multi-level retail mall” in the world. you may also see the via biberatica, the city’s most intact old roman street.
climb palantine hill
climb up to visit the remnants of the famous imperial palaces that reside on palatine hill after visiting the forum, and wandering the avenues julius caesar once traversed. enjoy the lovely garden grounds and ruins of historic homes.
pay a visit to the colosseum
take the southeast exit out from roman forum and walk all the way up to the world-famous colosseum. it’s an incredible site to view, and if you want to go inside, you should take a tour. the tours might be expensive and time-consuming, so consider whether it is actually important to you!

the arch of constantine, is one of rome’s greatest ancient triumphal arches, is located next to the colosseum. the arch commemorates emperor constantine the great’s triumph and the conflict that established christianity as rome’s official religion.
piazza del campidoglio is a great place to watch the sunset
before dusk, sneak around the backside of a noteworthy piazza del campidoglio, atop capitoline hill. from above, you’ll have a stunning view of the forum, with both the colosseum and palatine hill in the backdrop.
day 2
drink a cappuccino at caffé sant’eustachio
caffé sant’eustachio, one of rome’s most famous and oldest cappuccino and espresso businesses, is noted for its home-roast beans combined with freshwater out of an ancient aqueduct. there will be excellent italian espresso and some interesting folks!
pay a visit to the pantheon
the pantheon is the sole ancient roman temple that have survived millennia practically complete, making it a must-see in rome. the architecture will astound you, and you’ll want to take few moments just to relax in the piazza and soak in the majestic view before stepping inside.
visit piazza del popolo.
take a walk north towards piazza del popolo, and if time allows, see the magnificent cathedral of santa maria del popolo.
investigate villa borghese
the villa borghese gardens are located near the piazza del popolo. pause at the eastern end for spectacular city vistas and photo possibilities.
take a seat on the spanish steps
you may people-watch from the busy and renowned spanish steps before getting some gelato and strolling along via dei condotti as well as the adjoining shops to do some window shopping.
throw a coin into the trevi fountain
no vacation to rome is complete without a visit to the trevi fountain! toss a few pennies in to ensure that you will come back to the eternal city one day. note: similar to all things historic, the trevi fountain needs continual maintenance and therefore, it may be empty at certain times, or may have work being done to it. 

day 3
discover vatican city
get up early to avoid the bus tours to the stunning st. peter’s basilica, that opens at 7 a.m. if you’re feeling adventurous, climb the “cupola” after the basilica for exercise and spectacular panoramas of the city from across river.
after you’ve concluded, spend a few minutes at st. peter’s square in front of the vatican museums, that opens at 9 a.m. if you want to see history at its best. if you enjoy history, you may expect to spend the majority of your day at the vatican!
pay a visit to piazza navona
back over the river, rome’s famed piazza navona, with its bernini fountain, cafés, vibrant street performers, and enormous crowds, is a vibrant area to people watch and eat your daily gelato.
lose yourself
allow plenty of time to just get lost and uncover unexpected treasures throughout rome, as with every first-time visit to a city. keep a map available, but go on a stroll without the need for a plan or goal. you rarely know what you’ll come upon!
i also recommend seeing the city during the night. if you’re traveling alone and require a guide, there are innumerable nighttime walking tours available, but there’s no city like rome at night! don’t pass it up!

pompeii


 



in the roman empire, pompeii was a thriving port city. but it all changed on august 24, a.d. 79, when mt. vesuvius erupted, launching a 10-mile-high plume of smoke of dust and lava into the stratosphere. individuals who were not slaughtered by the pumice projectiles or the magma were taken out by the noxious vapors.
this catastrophic moment in roman history has provided us with an up-close glimpse at life inside of an ancient roman metropolis. the eruption’s volcanic ash and mud enclosed and preserved the city’s artifacts as well as some of the people’s bodies, garments, and even business establishments.
are you planning a vacation to italy and wish to include a visit to pompeii? excellent decision! it’s one of the world’s largest and best-maintained archaeological sites, where you can wander through an old roman city with a fascinating history. in this guide, we’ll go over everything you want to know about visiting pompeii.
pro tip: are you planning a trip to pompeii? save this article to your computer so you can locate it easily when you’re on the go. more planning materials may be found in our pompeii and amalfi coast guide, as well as the pompeii daytime trip from rome and other pompeii excursions for a great and simple vacation. nancy, a frequent rome visitor and loyal customer that owns a st louis event planning business, says that if you’re going to travel from the states all the way to italy, you better not miss the amalfi coast.  

tickets to the pompeii archaeological park may be purchased immediately at the entrance gates. the archeological park has three entrances: porta marina, piazza esedra, or piazza anfiteatro. you’ll most likely enter thru the porta marina, that is near to the railway station and big parking lot. it is also the primary ticket counter, so you may purchase your ticket and begin your trip here.
the majority of visitors to pompeii arrive by rail from naples. the good news is that the railway station wherein you must get off is directly in front of the archeological park’s entrance. it’s a short walk to the entrance, which you can’t miss.
see below for information on how to travel to pompeii by rail from rome as well as the amalfi coast, as well as traffic information for individuals who have hired a vehicle.
the outdoor amphitheater
the pompeii amphitheater, the earliest known construction of its sort, accommodated 20,000 people and hosted gladiator games and enormous spectacles, similar to the colosseum in rome. the stone edifice is an excellent illustration of the ancient town’s enormous functioning civilization. pink floyd played a performance here in 1972!
the pompeii forum
the forum of pompeii, much like roman forum, was the town’s hub of activity and trade. it is home to the city’s principal temples, including the temples of venus, jupiter, and apollo. there are also the magnificent forum baths.

the forum baths in pompeii
one widely held belief is that all the ancient people were filthy and rarely washed. this is true in many circumstances, yet the ancient people of roman were not like this.
though only the extremely wealthy could pay for private baths, the forum’s public roman baths were open to individuals of all socioeconomic classes. the area was separated into two sections: men’s and women’s.
it contained the ancient roman bath’s three chambers, the tepidarium (warm bath), frigidarium (cold bath), and the caldarium (hot bath). traditionally, each would be bathed in that sequence.
the brothel of pompeii
the oldest profession in the world had a presence in ancient rome, while the most obvious example in pompeii may be seen in this edifice. they were known as lupanar in latin, as well as the prostitutes are slaves transported in to cement pompeii’s reputation as a city of vice.
the structure, which consists of several tiny spaces with beds, is also plastered with interesting explicit photographs of what happened at the brothel. we now know the names of several of the ladies who worked here because of graffiti left by satisfied clients.
the palaestra’s
if you’re from philadelphia, you’ll remember the term palaestra from the palestra near the university of pennsylvania’s campus. palaestra is indeed the latin term for “gym,” and it was comparable to our modern-day counterpart, including training grounds and even a pool house.
mount vesuvius
the most renowned and yet still active volcano in history is not located in pompeii’s architectural complex, nor is it even in the city proper, but i would be derelict if i did not mention it. the last major eruption occurred in 1944, but scientists believe it will be some years before another occurs.

to round up your pompeii experience, make the short trip to the volcano that earned pompeii famous in the first place!
the faun’s house
the term “home” is misleading because it spans an area of about 32,000 square feet, (which is about 3,000 square meters). the owner was so wealthy that he had a mosaic of the latin word have, which means “greetings!” built into the roadway in front of his property.
mosaic of cave canem
at the entrance of the house of the tragic poet there is a mural of a dog, which acted as a doormat, with inscriptions below it that translate to cave canem in latin, meaning translates as “beware of the dog”. this only goes to prove that after 2,000 years, we haven’t changed much.
