youtube“the yes side can only win if it can persuade scotland’s working-class majority they will be economically, socially, and politically better off” 
colin fox, ssp national co-spokespersonlatest newsthe party of scotland’s working-class fightersend fuel poverty
no one should have to choose between a warm meal and a warm home. cut bills and private profiteering, end the imposition of prepayment meters, and bring energy into public ownership.an independent socialist scotland
we support self-determination and independence. but independence needs a vision that delivers transformative change for the working-class majority in scotland.socialist change, not climate crisis
“humanity” didn’t cause the climate crisis – capitalism did. to put people and planet first, we need socialist solutions that fight poverty and pollution together.a fighting socialist party
the ssp is a socialist party rooted in the working class. we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with fellow workers fighting for economic justice and taking strike action.
