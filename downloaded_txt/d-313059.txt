educational toys and child development






children cannot seem to live without toys. for them, toys are synonymous to good times and to having fun. toys have the ability to engage children's senses and stimulate their imagination. they also help children discover different types of emotions. some toys are designed specifically to promote interaction with other kids. toys stimulate physical, mental and social development. they boost self-confidence and self-esteem as well.toyseven the simplest toys help very young children to learn about the world. when they bounce a ball or manipulate a set of colorful rings, they learn not only about the object that they are playing with but about the world as well. children experience the world directly while they are playing with their toys-moving about, manipulating them with their hands, and figuring out how they work. toys also help them grow physically, using their muscles and developing them when they build a tower of blocks, ride a bicycle, or climb up the jungle gym.toys help children use their imaginations, create, and build new things. for instance, a plain cardboard box becomes a toy train or a little house. pretend play helps them develop different brain functions and enriches their language and comprehension as well.benefits of educational toyswhile many toys have incidental educational value, educations toys are special kinds of playthings that do not merely offer happy times, but plenty of opportunities to learn as well. parents should consider offering their children a few "educational" options when they are growing up. with these toys, children are given the stimulation that their brain and body needs for intellectual, emotional, and physical development. there are toys that teach a specific skill set, while other toys help children learn about a subject. what sets these toys apart from regular toys is that playing with them is associated with development and learning.it is fortunate for modern parents that there are so many toys to choose from. toy designers and manufacturers are seeking the advice of specialists in child development in developing toys for all ages and skill levels. not only are they supplying the demand for age-appropriate educational toys, but they are also making sure that the toys are of such a variety that will keep children entertained. the toys are also made with high-grade materials that are safe, durable and last for a long time.babies and young children are eager to learn, especially when they are of the age when they can move about and manipulate objects with their hands. if they are given toys that stimulate his senses and teach him new things, then they learn about foundation skills such as hand-eye coordination, motor skills, balance and body coordination, which improves his capability to explore the world. at the pre-school age, when children start learning about words, letters, and numbers, the concepts can be introduced to them in fun interesting ways using educational toys such as alphabet puzzles. a child that has fun knowing about things that he will later explore in depth in school will nurture a love for learning early on.

education and the complete individual






education is something that many have said much about. most of these are complex or vague. consider the greek philosopher aristotle's saying that education is 'an ornament in prosperity' and 'a refuge in adversity'. there have been a great many attempts to explain this description, but none have quite succeeded in satisfying my curiosity. alternatively, this is what the english essayist joseph addison has to say on education: what sculpture is to a block of marble, education is to a human soul. this too, has a great many explanations and elaborations. but does it really tell us what education is? does it tell us why we need education? not really, since the concept of the soul is, till date, a shadowy area. so how can we begin to comprehend what everyone claims is essential to life nowadays? to put it simply, education is a process of training our mind so that we can apply it in a field of our choice: which is why we have education not as a single seamless entity, but as a whole made up of various divisions: music education, scientific and technological education, art education, even teacher education!education can be considered similar to picking and eating a fruit. picking a particular fruit on the tree is akin to choosing a field to get an education of. when we bite into it, we get our first taste of the subject. as we chew on the bitten portion, we begin to understand its various aspects - the tastes, textures, intricacies and complexities of it - and when we are ready to move on to the next portion, we swallow what we have assimilated so far so that it can be used for further application. the tree we get the fruit from is the entire body of past thinkers' teachings and the voice that tells us which fruit to pick is the interpreter of that knowledge: the teacher.throughout the lifelong course of education (no, it's not like school or college which ends after a fixed period of time), we get to know about things that always were, still are and always will be around us, waiting to be recognized and acknowledged. light plays a central role in education - both literally and metaphorically - for visual inputs are the best learnt and without light - of the sun or electrical - we would be missing out on a whole world of knowledge. in fact, this is where phrases like 'light of knowledge', 'throw light on the matter', 'kept in the dark' and so on came from.you might be thinking, how can we narrow the infinite field of knowledge to select what we will need or want to know? this is where the part on 'training the mind' comes in. the mind, as psychology tells us, is the centre of cognitive faculties which enables consciousness, thinking, perception and judgement. it is the kitchen for the information we acquire, where we can season and prepare the bits and pieces of data into comprehensive knowledge. like any good kitchen, the mind has infinite capabilities (which is often the reason for confusion among us youth when it comes to deciding on a particular field to 'specialize in' for higher education) and therefore needs to be trained in order to make this choice clearer as every good chef needs to know what to or not to use for a dish. unfortunately, the world we live in does not allow us to experiment with our capabilities without being ostracized or reduced to penury. thus the need for specialization. and thus the need for education.another obvious question would be: how can we get education? it's easier to use metaphors and analogies when describing something like this, but a parallel in the real world is sometimes hard to provide. one answer could be a school, college or university. there are also other means to formally get education. such as home-schooling, distance learning etc. all of these provide us with a forum to exchange knowledge - where we can gain as well as give. this is a guided and restricted form of education, especially in the indian scenario. it is difficult to find a good school where we can tailor our education according to our needs and interests. often, we fail to avail of the opportunity even if it is within our reach. peer pressure, our parents' and elders' wants, whims and wishes and societal trends all play a role in influencing us. and this very often has an adverse effect with the student being unable to cope with the contradictory inputs and buckling under the combined pressure. an educational system where students can fulfil their desires and not bow to transient trends is necessary for proper development and realization of one's full potential. an example of how this can help could be the famous english poet john keats. trained to become a doctor, keats renounced his apothecary's license to follow his desire, eventually creating a path for himself that no one else has quite been able to match.education is not just a pathway to money, as is often considered nowadays. the fact that it provides a doorway to affluence is secondary. education is first and foremost, i believe, a source of joy and pleasure that is also a means of enhancing our capabilities. it is a landing that provides us with infinite doorways to choose to continue into, each leading to a different yet interconnected walk of life (after all, how can we forget that science and philosophy, despite being 'at odds with one another' go back beyond human comprehension?).the needs of the human in order to lead a productive and satisfactory life have long been debated. yet one point stands clear in this debate: along with the basic necessities of food, clothing and shelter, education is extremely necessary, especially in today's material world. after all, without education, one cannot gain employment and without employment, one cannot fulfil his/her basic needs and is considered a failure by modern society.the knowledge we gain through our guided education is definitely useful for life in the sense that they will be required to succeed in gaining and maintaining employment, a must to be accepted in society. not having a job is enough to have you labelled lazy, a failure, even weird or odd. and any employer will require you to have a thorough knowledge of your field, which is easily available for the taking through education.education provides us with an endless canvas. how much of it we put into use is up to us. new fields seem to emerge everyday - parapsychology, particle physics, noetics, to name a few. although relatively 'unknown' or 'obscure', these have as much importance as the others we know of. the flood of engineers and accountants that india is facing seems to know no end. easy money is apparently all people seems to think of. they are becoming flat characters in the play of life: although given names like 'security of future', lust for a fat wallet seems to be the only motivation.on the other hand, there are billions of people around the world who want to get an education but are unable to due to poverty, geographical isolation, familial conditions or ignorance. like the lady law, education is blind to the faults or favours of those who take a sip from its pool. the people who are not able to get to its banks because they are dragged back by the brambles of shortcomings - economic, social or cultural - have to endure a life full of superstition, fear, hopelessness, helplessness, poverty and exclusion. the literate but uneducated are considered equal to the illiterate as their life pretty much goes to waste (not everyone is the old english poet cædmon, after all). we must, however, keep in mind that this 'education' is totally career-oriented - a trait that has emerged in the past decades.let us now consider another angle. so far we talked of the relevance of education in the tangible corporeal world. but, being human beings, the intangible yet equally expansive world of our feelings is equally important. education plays a major role in helping us find our niche here as well. we humans are inherently social. even 'loners' have at least one person in their confidence. in fact, the more solitary one is, the stronger the bond is with those that person does interact with regularly. even those who have large friend circles have an inner circle of those who they trust. so, where do these friends come from? most of our friends and acquaintances come from school, college and our workplace and education is the line connecting these dots to one another. we go to school and college to get an education, as do those who become our friends. we talk about things that we have learnt somewhere down the line: academically, through music, film, news bulletins, books, etc. these, too, are an important part of our education. academia alone is not enough to make us a complete person. it is definitely important, but our character and personality depends on our education as well. as we grow up, we learn new things and experience various feelings and emotions. events and situations, too, play a part in education. growing up, we have quarrelled with our parents. these sometimes go downhill over time and ruin the parent-child relationship. alternatively, it can also teach us to give people space and motivate us into trying to understand before blindly contradicting. regardless of that outcome, it teaches us what not to do when we take up the mantle of parenthood. whether we put it to use is, of course, a completely different question altogether.besides academic information, schools also impart social education. they teach us, sometimes by pointing out our mistakes, what we should or shouldn't do in a particular situation. for instance, we learn to stand up and greet a teacher when he/she enters our classroom. we also learn to respect our higher-ups and when to follow instructions without question. this gives us an idea of the norms of society.education teaches us control. it tells us what is acceptable behaviour in a certain environment and what isn't. experience, which is yet another form of education, often also teaches us when to exercise caution and when to be spontaneous. for example, at an informal gathering like a house party, it is acceptable - even expected - to wear casual clothes. also, we can be freer in expressing ourselves: we can talk over one another, raise our voices etc. in an office party or a similar formal gathering, on the other hand, a certain code of conduct is expected to be followed. a professional front - in both mannerism and appearance - has to be maintained. formal attire is required and an unruly or unkempt appearance must be avoided. we also learn these things through books, entertainment, word of mouth etc. education and its imparting is therefore an intimate and implicit part of our social life as well.education is a major source of mental contentment. there is a simple, innocent pleasure in gaining knowledge. as sentient living beings, we humans are inherently curious. and fulfilling that curiosity paves the way for further questions to be answered, for the thirst for knowledge to become a quest for more. also, considering the level of competition nowadays, any and every little snippet of information in addition to what our peers know gives us an edge in the rat race of modern life. and success because of that little edge gives us a great deal of satisfaction, joy and pride: the boost to our self-esteem that is essential to our well-being, mental and, thereby, physical.a complete individual is one who leads a wholesome life. he/she has both contentment with his/her material possessions and mental satisfaction in his/her current place in life. the complete individual, hence, is one who has found a balance between the material and immaterial worlds: one who has both access to resources and the means to enjoy them; someone who has both adequate material possessions and happiness in life. and what makes all this possible but education?

psychology of education










education and psychology are related in more than just one way and the psychology of education could be related to educational principles in psychology or how education as a discipline is taught within psychology as a subject and how these two disciplines merge. this is primarily the focus of educational psychology which studies how human learning occurs, what ways of teaching are most effective, what different methods should be used to teach gifted or disabled children and how principles of psychology could help in the study of schools as social systems.psychological education would be completely focused on learning methods as structured or imparted according to psychological and individual needs of the students. education would differ according to culture, values, attitudes, social systems, mindset and all these factors are important in the study of education in psychology.educational psychology is the application of psychological objectives within educational systems and psychological education as i distinguish here is application of educational objectives in psychological processes. the first focus of using psychology in education is more general and the second approach of using education in psychology is more individualistic. however as far as present study of educational approach to psychology is concerned, there is no difference between individualistic educational psychology and general educational psychology and all interrelationships between psychology and education are considered within the broad discipline of educational psychology.






however a distinction between the more general educational psychology and more specific psychological or individualistic education could help in understanding the nuances of individualistic study and give a subjective dimension to the study of psychology in education. this could also help in making learning systems more student based and according to the needs of culture, society, individual or personal factors. this sort of study with a focus on personal/psychological aspects of learning is not just about social objectives and objectives within educational systems but also about personal goals and objectives and the psychological processes involved in learning. there has to be a clearer demarcation between education in psychology as a general study and individualistic education in psychology as a more specific and subjective discipline.






as of now educational psychology encompasses a wide range of issues and topics including the use of technology and its relation to psychology, learning techniques and instructional design. it also considers the social, cognitive, behavioural dimensions of learning but it would be necessary to make education more personal and individualistic through a special branch with a psychological focus on education so that individual needs are considered. there could be two ways in which this branch of knowledge could evolve - either by strengthening psychological education or individualistic approach to the psychology of education or by having two distinct branches of general educational psychology and individualistic educational psychology.






 as in client centered approach to psychology, a psychology of education should also include further research that would highlight the need for individualistic dimensions in learning. learning psychology is the use of psychological theories for example that of jean piaget and kohler in the study of learning techniques, especially among children. i have already discussed piaget but briefly piaget's theory higlights different stages of learning in children and kohler suggested that learning occurs by sudden comprehension or understanding, however i will not go further into learning theories here. whereas the focus of educational psychology is on learning techniques per se and the role of the learner is considered only secondary, a branch of individualistic psychology in education could help in emphasizing the role of the learner considering not just their disabilities or giftedness but also their personality patterns. this focus on personality patterns brings out the central role of understanding psychology in educational systems.

stress education and reservation










stress at individual and social levels; distorts our cognition, affect and conation (perception, feelings and actions); and leads to amongst many other evils; deterioration of international, national and local education policy and its implementation. the present day non-holistic (sectarian, prejudiced, vindictive, malicious, mercenary, exploitative and malevolent) education (formal, curricular, co curricular, extracurricular and informal) is a major stressor that though aids in petty pursuits; opposes our blossoming and further perpetuates stress and ill effects in the individual and social life. let us review; the present perspective, policy and practice of education; as seen around. even though education is defined in various ways; and often inadequately or incompletely; there has been a general agreement on the fact that education is basically a process of blossoming of an individual and the society. hence it included three domains, which are as follows.the first domain is called affective domain. this means the state of mind. in simple words affective domain relates to how we feel. thus when our mind is full of alertness, attention, enthusiasm, buoyancy, affection, concern, joy, tolerance, self esteem, mutual respect, mutual trust, commitment, dedication, love, romance, confidence, positive and victorious spirit, we would call it healthy affective domain. in addition; the zeal and concentration needed; in the pursuit of excellence in intellectual field, tenacity and endurance required; in skillful activities and patience and commitment essential; for internally satisfying and socially beneficial (conscientious) actions constitute affective domain. the purpose of education is to nurture this domain by designing suitable curricula and syllabi.the second domain of education is called psychomotor domain. this implies ability to appreciate skills and ability to perform physical and mental skills, with speed, accuracy, elegance, ease of performance etc. this may involve appreciation and performance of skills such as surgery, playing a musical instrument, playing basket ball or doing carpentry! the purpose of education is to nurture this domain through not only designing suitable curricula, syllabi but also by providing sufficient practical and demonstration classes; with all the necessary equipments.



the third domain is called cognitive domain. cognitive domain incorporates accurate perspective, contemplation, correct perception understanding, conceptualization, analysis and recall of fact and problems, ability to evaluate, synthesize, correlate and make decisions, appropriate policies, plans and expertise in the management, administration, etc.it is clear that all these domains have three components each viz. cognition [perception], affect [feelings] and conation [response].thus cognitive domain would have intellectual perception, clarity and intellectual expression, affective domain would include feeling, motivation and response in emotional sphere such as poetry; and psychomotor domain would include grasp and internalization of a particular skill, confidence to perform it and actually performing it.let us now see, how in spite of these goals; how it has come to be conceived as a process of achieving political, economic, scientific and technological supremacy and thus deteriorated to the present stage; where all the three domains are defective; apart from lacking in the spiritual and productive domains. in short; let us see how it has become a major stressor.for this; a brief consideration of the traditional education system in india would prove useful.traditional education system in india in general; ensured that:a] careers were not selected on the basis of monetary gains,b] careers were not selected arbitrarily on the basis of idiosyncrasies and whims,c] some lucrative careers could not be sought after; in preference to the others,d] all careers ensured income and production from early age,e] all careers ensured that the society was benefited,f] all careers ensured security to all the social groups,g] all the careers ensured intimacy and closeness between young and old in the families.h] all careers ensured ethical education and passage of experience and wisdom; from generation to generation.these were merits. but it is also true that, the traditional system was apparently marked by deprivation of scholastic education on mass scale, apparently unjustifiable availability of education of jobs based on caste, deficient infrastructure for collective scientific and technological efforts, and an element of arbitrary imposition of hierarchy.the traditional education system has attained the present status of being a major stressor as a result of several stressful factors including the onslaught of the tempting and impressive individualistic doctrines. thus the transition from traditional system to the present one (whether due to british, american or any other influence, but basically due to individualistic pursuits); has become a major stressor tearing apart the cohesive social fabric of india by failing to preserve and nurture the merits and discard and dispose off the demerits.as the education shifted from homes, home industries and farms to; nurseries, k.g. schools, schools, colleges, universities, corporate industries, research institutions etc. the transition became viciously poisonous.cognition suffered because of:a] huge number of students, in a single class making following three things almost impossible. these things are i] individual attention ii] dialogue iii] discussions,b] lack of adequate salary, accountability, incentive and economic security to the teachers taking away the initiative of nurturing cognitive domainc] increase in alienation with respect to student's background and aptituded] lack of adequate incentive to the students in the form of creativity, production and earning, service to the family and service to the nation, takes away the motivation required for building up cognitive domaine] lack of conviction essential in the growth of cognitive domain in the teachers and students because of outdated practical and demonstration classes, lack of interdisciplinary dialogue and in general the irrelevance of education to the realities of day to day life in as much as almost predictable consecutive unemployment at the end! the lack of conviction could be partly due to lack of participation by teachers in decision-making, policy making, development of curricula, syllabi etc.f] emphasis on recall and hence rote learning thereby denying free inquiry, reading, questioning etc. thereby directly thwarting the cognitive domaing]] too many examinations; with irrelevant parameters or criteria of evaluation [besides being unfair in many instances] leading to misguided and in most cases counterproductive efforts thus adversely affecting the cognitive domainh] competitions where the manipulative skills, callousness, selfishness are given more respect, destroy the enthusiasm of growing in cognitive domaini] information explosion affecting cognitive domain by either causing enormous and unnecessary burden on memory or inferiority complexj] pressure of interviews causing constant tension and sense of inadequacy, right from the tender age,k] protracted hours of homework in schools denying the students their legitimate right to enjoy their childhood and make them physically, mentally and intellectually unfit to grow in cognitive domainl] irrelevant and unnecessary information loading in lectures in the form of monologue, leading to suppression of the spontaneity, originality, interest and enthusiasm so much required in cognitive development amongst the students,affective domain suffered due to,a] isolation of the children from their parents and their domestic environment at an early age [making the parents also equally sad]b] lack of warm bonds due to huge number,c] cut throat individualistic and petty competition,d] inadequate facilities of sports, trekking, educational tours, recreation and physical development etce] alienation from one's social environment and culturepsychomotor domain suffered due toa] almost total lack of opportunities to actually participate in skillful activities such as drawing, painting, sewing, sculpturing, carpentry, knitting, weaving, music, agriculture, horticulture, other handicrafts, various sports, performing arts etc.it is important to realize that promotion of psychomotor domain is evident but in its caricature form. it has no concrete economic realistic basis. the activities have no economic incentive and no productive element.apart from the defects in the three domains; the other two domains viz. spiritual and productive; have not totally absent in the education.the spiritual domain that imparts universal perspective and globally beneficial outlook; incorporates inner blossoming of an individual through introspection, heart to heart communication (not merely discussion and arguments), mutual understanding and blossoming of the teachers and students together; through one of the most universal practices; viz. namasmaran. thus the spiritual domain is a key to conquer lust, whims, fancies, pride, arrogance, callousness, contempt, ungratefulness, prejudices, jealousy, hatred, meanness, meekness, beggary, cheating, stealing, treachery and so on; is never made available to the teachers, students and the others; associated with education.the present education system in india lacks the other important domain viz. the productive domain that empowers the people concerned with education. this prevents a huge section of society such as teachers, students, clerks, servants, sweepers and many others such as education inspectors, from being creative and productive. in addition it causes colossal loss of space, electricity, construction cost and so on. in addition because of the typical emphasis on rote learning it leads to phenomenal waste of "educational material" such as paper, bags, pencils, ball pens etc.it has to be appreciated that billions of rupees are spent on unproductive or rather counterproductive exercise of construction, decoration and maintenance of schools and colleges, electricity, and so called educational material, payment of millions of teachers and other staff members engaged, and exams conducted to test the "capacity and merit of rote learning". this way we weaken the national economy, jeopardize the developmental activities.it also causes economic loss to everyone involved in education; while suppressing and starving their all three domains nurtured in productive activity. this is a single most important cause of1] reduction in the dignity of labor amongst those who continue to learn, as well as reduction in the income of the concerned families and the nation2] lack of education, lack of employment and starvation or criminalization amongst those who are forced to drop out because the poor villagers' children normally contribute to the earning of the family.3] inhuman suffering of those millions of students dropouts, who somehow manage to get into the hell of cheap child labor for subsistence; due to economic reasons.in short, present day education system harnesses arrogance and diffidence; amongst those who continue to learn. but their spiritual, cognitive, psychomotor, affective and productive domains are defective. their spiritual blossoming, self empowerment, creative wisdom, intellectual competence, productive skills, self sufficiency and even physical health are deficient. thus we have increasing number of unproductive criminals and mental wrecks or highly competitive efficient maniacs pursuing petty goals at the cost of others!for those who are unable to continue the education; the abyss of being child labor, stealing, delinquency, criminals, perverts, beggars is wide open!the piecemeal approach or facilitation of petty pursuits (under the guise of development and progress) is not only useless but are in fact counterproductive! it leads to cancerous spread of industries with uncontrolled production of unnecessary utilities and their maddening marketing. these industries consume energy, fuel and add to undisposable waste and pollution. this sickening and stressful atmosphere nurtured by the present education; promotes the growth of terrorism on the one hand; and pretends to act against it (in a counterproductive way) on the other!mainstream education system and the courses and careers in it; revolve around and serve the grossly petty and superficial considerations, motivations and interests and this state of affairs; is strongly protected and strengthened by the elements with similar interests! hence the present laws, rules and regulations also promote present education and its ill effects.some institutions and individuals, for whom we have great respect, are involved in the holistic approach to education (mainstream, formal, informal, curricular, co curricular, extracurricular as well as education of physically and mentally challenged children). but these efforts are too feeble to make a difference to our life.while piecemeal approaches are failing; there is no adequate awareness and promotion of holistic education, which leaves the vicious cycle of stress distorting education and distorted education creating, aggravating and spreading the stress; to continue unabashedly and unabated.hence; the ill effects of stress on present education and vice versa; can be eradicated if we understand and propagate the defects in present education and promote holistic education as an international solution. it has to be appreciated that no statesman, no political leader, no policy maker and no administrator can bring about change in an existing system (in democratic set up); unless, we evolve a consensus about the changes in the majority of people; whose cooperation is very vital.in short; the policy of holistic education; demands that every school, college, university etc must become the center of production and service, self sufficient and must aid in self sufficiency and blossoming of everyone involved in education and also of the nation.the students, teachers and others associated with education; must blossom as independent and empowered individuals; spiritually, intellectually, mentally, instinctually, physically and economically.in practice; everyday; approximately20 % of the time must be spent in production, service etc.20 % of the time must be spent in physical activities20 % of the time must be spent in personality (conceptual and spiritual) development and20 % of the time must be spent in entertainment20 % of the time must be spent on cognitive domain20 % of the time must be spent in production, service etc.1. the productive domain should be an essential ingredient of education system, but no particular job should be enforced. the teachers and others should participate in the productive domain. production and service can involve community projects such plantation of medicinal herbs, rearing of cows, home flower gardening, production of chalk sticks, carpentry, pottery, cleanliness, crafts, skills, arts and their sale according to the situations.. working physically in different ways and earning is not a burden. it is an opportunity to grow from within. it is an opportunity to develop our self esteem. it is an opportunity to become self sufficient.2. this leads to self sufficiency in schools. they do not have to depend on heavy fees or federal grants or donations and this way they become accessible to all; rendering the reservations redundant!3. through productive domain the hypokinetic stress, emotional stress of being dependent and intellectual stress of excessive memorizing is averted.4. due to productive domain, the dropping out due to lack of earning (as is common in case of millions of students in many parts of world) and then turning into helpless, vulnerable and cheap child labor would come down.5. being empowered, the students would not go through the stress of unemployment and turn into helpless, frustrated mental wrecks or criminals.6. the emphasis on productive domain (and hence psychomotor and practical aspects) would bring down the necessity and also the capability and possibility to "copy" and associated crimes and corruption in procedures of examinations, certification, providing grants and so on!the caste based or any other kind of reservation for education, jobs and promotions; responsible for social divide and strife; in many parts of the world; (especially india) can be rendered redundant and thus; peacefully and advantageously done away with, by consensus!most importantly; we have to introduce and incorporate examinations, which examine the actual skill, capacity or performance of the student, rather than his/her ability of repeating or reproducing things and/or copying.20 % of the time must be spent in physical activitiesphysical activities can include pranayama, sports, exercise, trekking, hiking, a variety of physical fitness training programs and methods to avoid monotony and improve efficacy. a variety of sports prevalent in every other parts of the world can make the programs more interesting, entertaining thereby promoting global unity.20 % of the time must be spent in personality (conceptual and spiritual) development andpersonality development includes affective domain, spiritual domain and embodies broadening of perspective through various means such as; namasmaran, by hearting and chanting prayers, poems and songs from different languages and countries thereby promoting global unity, invited guest lectures, seminars, discussions on holistic health, educational tours and visits to places where the student gets exposed to rapid developments in the society such as laboratories, airports, government offices, share market, farms etc.20 % of the time must be spent in entertainmententertainment that enriches the soul; not only should include playing musical instruments, dance, painting, mimicry, singing, story telling, drama, movie etc. but everything that nurtures the affective domain and spiritual domain as well.20 % of the time must be spent on cognitive domaindevelopment of cognitive domain can include teaching of languages, history, geography, mathematics etc with utmost emphasis on interpretation and relevance in day to day life. thus typical irrelevant questions in the examination of history, languages, mathematics; should be totally done away with. the subject such as economics, psychology, civics, philosophy, logic, sociology etc must include field work and made relevant to the present society.we must encourage maximum and daily person to person interaction and dialogue amongst the teachers and students; so that analytical, synthetic, contemplative, decision making, trouble shooting and problem solving capacities are developed optimally.let us realize the fact that the vicious cycle of stress distorting education and distorted education causing and multiplying stress e.g. in the form of reservation policy and its ill effects; in individual and social life; can not be managed effectively unless and until; a situation where millions are "imprisoned" in unproductive work and millions are forced into unemployment and inhuman cheap child labor; is eradicated through holistic education policy and its implementation; at international, national and local levels; through the laws, government rules and public awareness, consensus and participation.



the details of practical steps can be developed by interactions amongst the people active in the field of education all over the world. but we all need;1, perspective and conviction of global unity and global welfare2. readiness to accept and introduce physiological insights and principles in the holistic education3. readiness and openness to have dialogue with experts in other fields4. participation from the society and governments and the media including internet websites, so that holistic education activists all over the world can have a meaningful dialogue and share views, work and experiences and may be, inspire others!5. administrative proficiency and due care and concern for the physical capacities of the children (normal as well as the physically and mentally challenged) and should not be painful and troublesome.7. the opportunities for psychomotor activities and productive activities; without impositions.8. every kind of open mindedness and tolerance amongst teachers and students; so that better international relations can be realized.the physical, instinctual, emotional, intellectual, spiritual and economic empowerment and blossoming; of all those involved in holistic education is integral to total stress management (the core of which is namasmaran); i.e. individual and global blossoming; culminating into global unity, harmony and justice.can namasmaran be useful in this? to find out that; we must find out what is namasmaran!namasmaran usually embodies; remembering the name of god, guru, great souls; such as prophets and whatever is considered as holy e.g. planets and stars. it is remembered silently, loudly, along with music, dance, along with breathing, in group or alone. further, namasmaran is either counted by some means such as fingers, rosary (called smarani or japamala), or electronic counter; or practiced without counting. the traditions vary from region to region and from religion to religion.however the universal principle underlyingnamasmaran is to reorient our physiological and social being; with our true self and establish and strengthen the bond between; our physiological and social being; with our true self; and finally reunification or merger with our true self!since individual consciousness is the culmination of every activity in life; and namasmaran the pinnacle of or culmination of individual consciousness; namasmaran is actually opening the final common pathway to objective or cosmic consciousness; so that individual consciousness in every possible activity gets funneled into or unified with him!thus namasmaran is in fact the yoga of yoga in the sense that it is the culmination of consciousness associated with every possible procedure and technique in the yoga that we are familiar with. it is theyoga of yoga because it is the culmination of consciousness associated with all the activities in the universe, which it encompasses as well! it is yoga of yoga because everybody in the world irrespective of his/her tradition and the beliefs; would eventually, ultimately and naturally reach it; in the process of liberation. even so called non believers also would not "miss" the "benefit of namasmaran as they may remember true self through one symbol or another"!just as namasmaran is yoga of yoga it is meditation of meditation also! this is because the natural and ultimate climax of every form of meditation; is remembering true self or merging with cosmic consciousness effortlessly!these facts however have to be realized with persistent practice of namsmaran and not blindly believed or blindly disbelieved with casual approach!in short namsmaran is super-bounty of cosmic consciousness for every individual to realize it (cosmic consciousness)! this is truly a super-bounty because a person, who experiences it, rises above mercenary, commercial and even professional and charity planes and manifest super- transactions in his or her life!these are just few observations to give rough idea about what is namasmaran. namasmaran is an ocean of bliss. its true meaning is beyond description in words and has to b experienced, not by one or few person sporadically; but most preferably, by billions!
