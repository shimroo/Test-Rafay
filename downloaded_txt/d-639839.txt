new! starting with the summer 2024 issue, there is an index at the very end of the digital issue. page numbers in the index are clickable links to the subject. check it out and let our editor, wendy, know if you like it at editor@humboldthistory.org.

 

a resource for researchersfor over half a century the humboldt county historical society has been a repository for local historic materials. collections that are unique to our archive include hundreds of maps, over 65,000 photographs, historic business records and criminal ledgers. original documents and research materials are available to the public through our research center.built by the publicwe are entirely supported by memberships and financial donations. originally founded by 117 community members who were motivated to preserve historical materials for future generations, our membership is now over two thousand. sustaining support from our members ensures that valuable local resources remain accessible to the public and protected for future generations. community members may also support our organization and get involved by joining our board of directors.missionour purpose is to further an understanding and appreciation of all peoples, places, events, and activities of humboldt county and related areas. toward this end, we focus on acquiring, preserving, interpreting, creating, and sharing historical information, and by educating and assisting others to do the same. to further these goals, the humboldt county historical society publishes an outstanding quarterly magazine, the humboldt historian; maintains a thorough reference library; prints historical books; records and transcribes oral histories of knowledgeable residents; archives valuable collections, and makes the information in those collections available to researchers.racial/inclusive equity statementthe humboldt county historical society is committed to intersectional equity (e.g. race, gender, sexuality, age, and accessibility) both internally through our work environment, and externally through our programming. the society is committed to ensuring that every policy enacted reflects democratic principles of equity and justice. we understand that enacting policy in a just and equitable manner considers critical issues of implicit bias and discrimination that requires concerted and purposeful action. therefore, policies, programs, and activities will be administered to identify and avoid discrimination and barriers to access, and to avoid disproportionately high and adverse effects on historically underrepresented groups. we believe that bringing together board members, staff, volunteers, and other partners with differing backgrounds and life experiences will enhance our ability to increase opportunities for the whole community.

this is your history in the 1940s, a group of men and women formed the humboldt county historical society. their aim was to preserve the past for the future. nearly a century had passed since the county’s formation, and this group realized that unless an organized effort was made to collect and preserve evidence of the area’s past, much would be lost and forgotten.since then, the structure, activities and location of the hchs have changed, but the aim remains the same.  only now we are the future they were working for and we have inherited a similar task – to preserve the past for the future that stretches beyond us.today the society has a permanent home in the barnum house at 703 8th street in eureka.  its archives of documents and photographs number in multiple thousands.  and we continue to build the collection – because history continues to move on.every one of us who lives in humboldt county or who has any ties to this area has a role here.  the size and scope of the collection preserved at the hchs is entirely dependent on what is donated to it.  donations come in many forms. some might be individual pictures, albums or documents.  others might be multiple boxes of material including photographs of individuals and community activities, diaries, business records, newspapers, school and organization reports, and letters.for years such donations have been carefully studied and organized to be easily accessible to the interested public. upstairs at the society, there is an entire room dedicated to the records of the many businesses that have flourished here. another room has shelves of alphabetically organized material about families and organizations.  a third room has information about schools, the military and significant events.downstairs, one room is dedicated to material useful to genealogical research.  in the library across the hall, is an extensive collection of books on local history and also several cabinets of files on numerous subjects including maritime and timber history, arts activities, businesses, churches, historic buildings, government, ethnic and indigenous groups and our many individual communities.  yet another space is dedicated to maps.  and an additional room houses the massive photograph collection organized by topics such as communities, timber, maritime, individuals, groups, events etc.and the society’s collection continues to grow as individuals and families donate items that they feel are worth preserving.  we continue to encourage this.  and those of us who have worked in this field have several pieces of advice for potential donors. maybe you are uncertain about what might be of interest when clearing out an estate, or a drawer, or a trunk in the attic.  best to bring it all in and let those who are familiar with the current collection choose what to add.  you can then decide if you want some things returned or given elsewhere.  after all, the donor might not know that the collection already has multiple copies of a certain item but has a gap that needs to be filled with something that might have seemed less interesting. and here is a plea to all donors.  if you have photographs to donate (and please do!), it helps if an identification of the person or event is written on the back.  you might know that a certain woman is aunt sally jones, but unless that is written on the back, future generations will not.  of course, local photographs are always of interest and can show changes in fashion or architecture, but their historical value is much enhanced with identification.  still – no id but local?  donate it anyway, and we’ll do what we can.what it all comes down to is this: preserving the past for the future is the responsibility of all of us in the present.  the humboldt county historical society is doing its part.  and you can help by doing yours.
