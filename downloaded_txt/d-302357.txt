ucl homedementia research centre





dementia research centre 

      the ucl dementia research centre is a hub for patient-centred research into dementias. as well as clinical studies and trials in alzheimer’s disease and other common causes of dementia, we have particular expertise in young-onset, inherited and unusual dementias. our work focuses on identifying and understanding the disease processes that cause dementia, the factors that influence these disease processes, ways to improve diagnosis and treatments, and how best to support people with dementia and their families. our research is closely integrated with the nhs cognitive disorders service we run at the national hospital for neurology and neurosurgery.
