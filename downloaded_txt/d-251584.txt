preparing servants
preparation for ministry doesn't just happen in the classroom; it happens as we live our daily lives. our students take the gospel from the boulevard to the bayou by serving our communities.

devotion
who walk with christ
president dew often says that the most important thing we will do every day is seek the lord. through chapel, prayer groups, and other outlets, we lead our students to walk with christ each day.

proclaim his truth
one of the most tangible ways we proclaim the gospel is through our caskey center. our caskey center not only provides resources for smaller membership churches, but also offers scholarships for students serving in those contexts.
