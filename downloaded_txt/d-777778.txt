it's been a looooooong winter...
...but the weather is finally more welcoming, and we're hopefully nearing the end of pandemic
restrictions. fortunately, most trails are still open.
we start this new growing season with 2,100 photos of of nearly 470 species in our collections.  these have been
collected in 250 rides and hikes over the past 18 years.  here's to continuing the journey!
