dance cruise faq’s





can i book on my own and still join your dance group activities?
unfortunately not. the only way we get dance space on a cruise is to book as a large group. so to be part of our dance group, you must book the cruise through dancefun. no exceptions. any dancer onboard who does not book through dancefun will be denied access to our nightly dances, workshops, parties, shore excursions, and dining together. – it just the way we have to do it to create a great dance cruise for you!

is the entire ship made up of dancers?
no, the entire ship will not be dancers. dancefun hosts a number of dance groups each year to a variety of destinations around the world. each group varies in destination and dance theme – ballroom, country, swing, salsa, lindy hop or a combination. the cruise line treats our group’s activities as private parties, open only to those sailing with our group

what makes a dance cruise different from a regular cruise?
on dancefun cruises you will find lots of activities geared for the active dancer. dancefun cruises offer:

dances most nights hosted by our instructors
our own dj for the best dance music
a good number of dance workshops on the days at sea with our top instructors
private parties for just us, as well as some shore excursions together
nightly dining together
and more !




is a dance cruise suitable if we have kids?
children are not only welcome, but on most ships there are programs geared to each age group form 3 through teens. cruise ships have state-of-art kids-only facilities, counselors, daytime activities and nighttime baby-sitting. children of all ages are welcome on most ships.

what is the average age on your dance cruises?
typically we have a wide spread on ages within our groups. although we have guests older and younger, we do find larger numbers from 30’s to 60’s as a general trend.

are there any age restrictions?
babies under 6 months of age and women in their last trimester of pregnancy are not permitted to sail. this is in consideration the safety and comfort of the infant as well as the other guests. additionally the ships are not equipped to handle the potential specialized emergency needs.
older children and young adults: if you are bringing older children (under 21 they must be in a cabin with someone over 25, or in some cases can be in a cabin adjoining or adjacent to yours. please book this in advance. the closer to final payment we get, the more difficult it is to find adjacent cabins.





what is included in the price?
included: welcome aboard party, workshops with top instructors, private dances hosted by our instructors, stateroom accommodations, meals and beverages, all the ship’s entertainment & activities, exotic ports of call ! there are also other possible items included that vary each sailing: like games, parties, special excursions, gifts, etc.
items not included: meals at “reservations only” dining, bar beverages (alcohol and soft drinks), shore excursions gratuities, transportation to and from the ship.
