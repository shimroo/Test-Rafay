the compassionate friends of atlanta - grief support after child's death



 


atlanta area chapters


grief support after the death of a child.
the mission of the compassionate friends is
to assist families toward the positive resolution of grief 
following the death of a child of any age
and to provide information to help others be supportive.
the compassionate friends is a national nonprofit,
self-help support organization that offers friendship, 
understanding, and hope to bereaved parents,
grandparents and siblings. 
there is no religious affiliation and there
are no membership dues or fees.
the secret of tcf's success is simple: as seasoned
grievers reach out to the newly bereaved, 
energy that has been directed inward begins
to flow outward and both are helped to heal. 
the vision of the compassionate friends is
that everyone who needs us will find us and everyone who finds us will
be helped.
this web site is dedicated to those who have experienced
the death of a child or sibling.
if you are in that situation, we want to help.
