what is chiropractic practice?posted on may 23, 2016 

chiropractic began in the united states in 1895.  d.d. palmer adjusted harvey lillard’s spine and the rest is history. 
 although the profession is over one hundred years old, it has existed in primitive forms for many years.  the german “bone setters” were similar to modern day chiropractors.  the chinese walked on each other’s backs and practiced tuina, a form of manual therapy.  the ancient egyptians also manipulated the spine, according to papyrus documentation.
today, chiropractic is the largest drug and surgery free healing profession.  it is natural, safe, effective and affordable.  millions of people are helped each year by the healing hands of chiropractors. 
 the truth is the spine is a very important structure.  it protects your spinal cord or lifeline.  there is no such thing as a spinal transplant, so you might as well take good care of your spine.  you must maintain correct posture on this gravitational planet, or joint and disc tissue will degenerate.  what happens when a car tire is out of alignment?  the tread wears out.  same thing happens to the weight bearing joints and discs in the spine if they are abnormally stressed.

why chiropractic adjustments can be good for your healthposted on may 22, 2016 

many people are plagued by chronic neck or back pain. sadly, a number of people don’t know that these pain issues could be resolved with chiropractic adjustments. studies have found that seeing a chiropractor can provide pain relief and improve overall wellness.
of course, there are a number of other benefits to seeing chiropractors as well. below, you’ll find a few of the benefits chiropractic adjustments can have on your health.
1. they can relieve stress
chronic pain and muscle tension can make it impossible for people to relax. issues with the nervous system can also make it hard for people to calm down after a long day at work.
a chiropractor can help patients to relieve stress, improving their overall health on the process. people will feel renewed every time they leave their chiropractor’s office.
2. they can help you get better sleep
if you have back or neck pain, getting a good night’s sleep is all but impossible. chiropractors will work to get your body functioning the way it should be. you’ll be able to get a full night’s sleep each night; aches and pains will never keep you up.

3. it can help you stay healthy
if you’re immune system isn’t functioning the way it should be, you’ll probably get sick a lot. colds, coughs, and other bugs can put a real strain on your body, and may even cause you to miss work.
researchers have found that chiropractic treatments can strengthen the immune system. if you see a chiropractor on a regular basis, you’ll be able to stay healthy all year long.
4. it can improve your posture
a lot of people don’t have very good posture. they may have a natural slump, or might have a hard time standing up straight.
when you see a chiropractor, your posture should instantly be improved. you’ll look more attractive and confident to other people. in addition, it’ll be able for you to sit comfortably at work. posture is something that most people don’t give a lot of thought to, but it can have a big impact on your quality of life.
as you can see, chiropractic adjustments can be very good for your health. if you’re struggling with chronic pain, or simply want to become a healthier person, schedule a visit with a chiropractor as soon as you possibly can.
if you want to read further, you can see the top 10 researched benefits of chiropractic adjustments.

what kind of symptoms can a chiropractor help you with?posted on may 20, 2016 

a lot of people assume that a chiropractor can only help them with back pain. while it’s true that chiropractors specialize in treating the back, they can help with a number of other symptoms as well.
here are a few of the many symptoms that chiropractors offer treatment for.
neck pain
neck pain is very common, and it can be every bit as debilitating as back pain can. a good chiropractor will be able to relieve neck pain and provide a patient with long term solutions.
headaches
while there are a number of different causes for headaches, most chiropractors should be able to provide people with relief from common headaches. anyone plagued by migraines or nasty tension headaches should give a chiropractor a call.
injury
if you were injured playing sports, or if you were hurt in an auto accident, you may not feel like yourself any longer. chiropractors can provide people with natural pain relief, and can also help people with the recovery process.

pregnancy pain
pregnant women often experience a great deal of pain. however, because the things they do have an impact on the baby, they may be reluctant to seek out any sort of standard pain treatment.
chiropractors can give pregnant women a way to cope with their pain without using medication. they can help women deal with their pain in every state of the pregnancy. in some cases, a chiropractor may even be able to help women with morning sickness.
insomnia
insomnia is a problem that plagues many people. sometimes, people have a hard time sleeping because they simply can’t get comfortable in bed. they may not be experiencing pain, but may still feel some nighttime discomfort.
a chiropractor can find the source of this problem and work to get it resolved. many people report that they are able to sleep better after a chiropractor visit.
posture problems
if you’re struggling to sit up straight, you may want to see a problem. they can help you to figure out why you can’t sit or stand tall. you’ll see a big difference after just one session.
as you can see, chiropractors can treat all kinds of symptoms. while you should definitely see them if you have back trouble, you should try to see them for other conditions as well. a chiropractor can really do a lot for a person.

learn what you should look for in a good chiropractorposted on may 18, 2016 

if you want to go to a chiropractor, you want to make sure you are seeing a good one. not all chiropractors have a good reputation and not all of their clients are satisfied. some will even go as far to say that the chiropractor they hired caused them more issues. there are a few things you should look for before you visit any chiropractor. here you will learn what to look for in order to get a good chiropractor.
look at their reviews
there are many places online that offer reviews of medical professionals, even chiropractors. these reviews can be found in lots of places like vital.com. before you call to make an appointment with anyone, you should look for reviews online, on doctor specific websites and also on facebook. look around on facebook to see if they have a page dedicated to their business. if they do have a page, likely there are reviews from previous customers. check these reviews and the discussions on their page before you make a final decision on whether you want to make an appointment with them or not.

ask around
ask family and friends, even co-workers. it is likely that someone in your circle has went to a chiropractor or knows someone else that has been to one. these people may be able to tell you which chiropractors are good and which ones to steer clear of. word of mouth is a great way to find out about which chiropractor is the best. you can even ask on facebook by making a status asking a question about chiropractors. you will get lots of recommendations this way. you can also post to a local group if you are a member asking for chiropractors in the area. you will not only get feedback from your friends, but from others that want to help you find a good chiropractor. this is the best and easiest way to find out which one you should see.
if you are looking to see a chiropractor for whatever issues you are having, you want to make sure you are seeing a good one. finding one is easy, you just have to ask around and make sure they are good at what they do. use the advice above to find a chiropractor that can help you and not cause you more problems.
if you are in the streamwood, illinois area, we would recommend seeing the most sought after chiropractor dr. karl forgeron at his freedom wellness center.  dr. karl has been helping others get back to their normal life for several years now and has lived in the streamwood, ill area almost his entire life. i can say from personal experience as i right this blog, dr. karl has changed my life and allowed me to live pain free for many years now. after my car accident, my body was a wreck and he worked with me for years to get things back to normal. you can contact dr. karl using this information –
freedom wellness center by dr. karl forgeron, d.c
 404 freeman avenue
 streamwood, il 60107
 (630) 289-2225
 
before my car accident, i lived in anchorage, ak and saw dr. mark stewart. mark isn’t technically a chiropractor, but more of a pain management expert and assisted with numerous complications i’ve had over the years. dr. mark owns the healing therapeutics health and wellness clinic in anchorage and does everything from applied kinesiology, reflexology, pain management techniques, and even massages.  so if you need an anchorage pain clinic, i would highly recommend seeing dr. mark whenever you get a chance. you can use this contact info –
