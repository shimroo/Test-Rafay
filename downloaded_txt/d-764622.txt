site down for a few/ update struggle.





hello good people that you are,

i just wanted to first and foremost apologize for the lack of post's and updates in the last two weeks, especially during our early arctic episode. even though i saw this event out for almost two weeks, i had begun taking on other endeavors, such as working for a seasonal job to help out with school, transportation..etc. it got real hard to find any time to post while working, but will use weekends and early morning post's in the future to help with that. 

i have a few updates i need to add to the site, but the server has been down and need to figure it out soon. i’m assuming by this weekend, everything will be up and updated with recent content.

i'll post another blog later this afternoon that’s related to our recent weather and broken records. thank you for all your support and patience through these busy times.

coldest air of the season right around the corner!






that's right! looks like we will start digging into some of the coldest weather of the season this weekend, with snow levels lowering near 1500ft starting thursday night. the picture i have attached is for next week, this shows a perfect "arctic" air setup, which would keep us well well below normal for the remainder of next week as well.

though, this is very interesting, we still ahve to accept the fact that the models will continue to sort out all the fine details before then..so a lot will change from now till then. and for as early as it is, im not complaining one bit about the interesting weather model runs this month. beats 8 months of no excitement anyday! tomorrow i will have more details and more specific blog post, so stay tuned!

weather tidbits





today i'll be trying something new, i'll be posting weather tidbits that catch my eye during the day that relates to weather, and our weather in general. it's been quite "inactive" weather wise, just cool wet weather. latest model runs have been showing an interesting blocking pattern set up in the pacific, which would open the door for colder weather on our doorsteps. but for now, thats still quite a ways out and a lot will change from now and then. 


can an indonesian volcano effect our weather?

yesterday was the coolest day of the fall season so far, some places around hood river at 1,600ft + saw their first snows of the season.


so your not good at interpreting weather models and data, turn to pig spleens to forecast weather!

rain records and mt. snow!






wow, talk about a little of everything...heavy rain/wind/lightning/snow. places around the metro area are getting close to breaking some rainfall records, here are some totals as of 6 am this morning:

troutdale 1.66"  
tillamook 1.42"  
vancouver 1.32" 
eugene    1.17"  
portland  1.14"  
hillsboro 1.13"  
aurora    1.08" 


 as for mt. hood, i don't really need to explain too much if your the ones who like starring at pictures. timberline is reporting a little over 8 " of fresh new snow and snow covered roads, so if anyone plans on heading up there, come prepared for winter weather conditions.

here's steve pierces morning recap via oregon ams:


weekend rainfall nears record

 

portland, oregon (october 25th 2010) –  "the pacific northwest was pounded with heavy rain, thunder, lightning and blustery winds as the first strong storm of the fall season rolled across the region over the weekend. winds gusted to as high as 60 mph along the coast. the portland international airport received 1.14" of rainfall sunday alone, barely missing the old record of 1.31" set back in 1943. when combining saturday's rainfall with sunday's, the portland airport picked up more than 1.62" of rain for the weekend, which brings the total for the month to just over 3 inches. on average, portland receives about 2.88" of rainfall for the month of october. the wettest october ever at the portland airport (1940-2010) was set back in 1994 when 8.41" of rain fell. some areas in the coast range and cascades picked up nearly 3" of rainfall over the same period." 

 note: rain table above is regarded to this article.

last day: wwa wrap- up!





i want to take the time to thank a few buddies of mine for helping spread the word this week on our participation of winter weather awareness week with the national weather service of portland. this has been a very successful winter weather awareness week and we belive we reached out to as many folks as we can regarding the issue. today, is obviously the last day so lets go ahead and recap this past week and finish off!

...enjoy the great outdoors in the pacific northwest this winter season, but keep and eye or ear on the changeable weather...

the national weather service issues a variety of winter weather watches, advisories and warnings (tuesday's topic). safety tips were also discussed. always check the latest weather forecast before heading out and take the warnings issued by the national weather service seriously. 

before winter weather threatens this season, you should prepare a winter safety kit for you vehicle. such kits are also available at many retail and auto supply stores. remember, if you become stranded on the roads during a storm, run the motor about 10 minutes each hour for heat, but keep the window open a bit for ventilation. also, keep the exhaust pipe clear of obstruction to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. finally, make yourself visible to rescuers by turning on the dome light at night while running the motor.

avoid overexertion when outdoors. heart attacks can kill during and after storms, because shoveling snow or freeing stuck vehicles can be quite stressful.

a valuable companion when heading out this cold season is a battery-powered noaa weather radio, the voice of the national weather service. it provides you with the latest weather conditions and forecasts. you can purchase such radios at many local electronics or department stores, and over the internet. 

use the 511 phone and internet traveler information services provided by state transportation departments to info on road conditions, road work, vehicle restrictions, and road closures, before you travel.

finally, if you need more information on winter weather safety, winter weather brochures, or noaa weather radio, please contact your nearest national weather service office by phone, or by web.

thank you for your participation in this year's winter weather awareness week. we hope this information has been beneficial to you. 

for questions about local winter weather preparedness, contact your local noaa national weather service office!

wwa: day 5! is it just me or did it just get really windy?!






hope everyone’s having a wonderful friday morning. today, we will be discussing wind storms/events for the pacific northwest, for those of you who have lived here for over 5 years+ should already have this down by now. if not, great time to reeducate and prepare yourself for the next "big blow" (which we are "overdue" for).


the pacific northwest does not get hurricanes, but it does get hurricane force winds. 

across eastern washington, eastern oregon, idaho and montana: 
in january 2008 a powerful wind storm in walla walla, wa and milton freewater, or is a recent and striking example. wind gusts exceeding 70 mph caused widespread damage. hundreds of trees were downed, power lines were damaged, vehicles were blown off the road, and even houses were damaged during this event. 

across western washington and western oregon:
 the best example was the nation's strongest non-tropical windstorm ever---the columbus day storm of 1962. this storm produced hurricane force winds across western oregon and washington. winds of 150 mph (category 4 hurricane force) winds rocked the coastal areas, killing 46 persons, injuring hundreds more and knocking out power for several million people. damage was widespread, with buildings, schools and thousands of homes either destroyed or damage. other notable windsstorms of the past: the great olympic blowdown of 1921, the november 13th/15th 1981 twin wind storms, the inauguration day storm of 1993, and most recently the great coastal gale of december 2007. 


are you ready for the next windstorm? 
windstorms bring down trees and power lines, and produce much blowing debris. falling trees and blowing debris cause the most fatalities. 

be sure to have your 3-day emergency preparedness kit ready at home, school and/or at work. this kit should include water and non-perishable food for each person, and am/fm battery-powered radio, along with flashlights and extra batteries. be sure to include vital medications, sleeping bags, blankets and warm clothing.

in addition, inspect your home and grounds each year for nearby trees that may fall and damage your home. ensure the trees are healthy and trimmed, and you home, school or business is structurally sound. it is also a good idea to bring lightweight items in out of the weather, or tie them down. during strong gusty winds, such items can become dangerous missiles. these precautions will help ensure that you are ready for the next big blow.

remember, in times of hazardous winter weather, you can get all these vital noaa/national weather service messages via noaa weather radio, your favorite local media, or through noaa's national weather service websites.

tomorrow is our last day of winter weather awareness week, we will offer a recap on sunday following the last post on saturday. we appreciate everyone who has taken the time to go through and read up on potential future winter hazards, we hope this helps other folks who may not know too much about the weather here, find the knowledge needed to get through any given winter like a true oregonian. thank you again!

day 4: flooding, are you prepared?






good morning folks! so far in our winter weather segmant we talked about how to deal with the cold and how to read winter weather warnings/advisories. we also learned how to react and what to do in certain events. but one other thing that we are missing out on, is information regarding flooding/warnings-advisories regarding flooding and how to respond. do you know what to do?


during most winters, storms bring long periods of heavy rain and snow to the pacific northwest. in addition to extended rain, flooding can also occur due to ice jams, where large flows of ice pile up. this pile-up of ice can act like a dam, causing water to back up and flood. warm weather can also cause snow on the middle and higher mountains to melt, putting more water into already rain-swollen streams. 

flooding causes more deaths and prpoerty damage in the u.s. than any other severe weather related event. the majority of flood related deaths occur when people become trapped in automobiles while attempting to drive through flooded areas. flowing water can be deceptively strong, and pack a powerful punch. as little as six inches of water is enough to float a small car and carry it away. there have been many floods in the history of the northwest, which include the devastating floods of december 1964 and february 1996. most recently, in dec 2007 and jan 2009, significant flooding struck the pacific northwest, closing a twenty mile stretch of interstate 5 near chehalis washington under 10 feet of water. coastal flooding can also occur during the winter months, and poses a threat to life and property. winds generated from very strong pacific storms can drive ocean water inland, much like a storm surge, and can cause significant flooding along the immediate coastal areas and estuaries.

a flood refers to a gradual rise in the water along a stream, river, wash or over an extended period of time. floods result from heavy rainfall, river ice jams, snowmelt. they can erode an entire mountain side, roll boulders the size of trucks, tear out trees, destroy buildings, wash out roads and bridges, and cause the loss of lives. rain weakened soils can also result in mudslides capable of closing major highways. 

flood watch...
this means that flooding is possible with the watch area. you should remain alert and be ready to evacuate on a moment's notice. 

flood warning...
this means that flooding has been reported, or is imminent. when a flood warning is issued for your area, act quickly to save yourself. if advised to evacuate, do so immediately. go to higher ground, or climb to safetly. move to a safe area before access is cut off by rising flood waters. 

nearly half of all flood fatalities are auto-related. water that is two feet deep will carry away most automobiles. never attempt to drive through a flooded roadway. the road bed may be washed out beneath the water, and you could be stranded or trapped. if the vehicle stalls, leave it immediately and seek higher ground. 

the best advice if you are in a vehicle: turn around…don't drown. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

from the past...
record floods of december 1964 [some historical photos]
the december 1964 rainstorm was undoubtedly the most severe rainstorm to ever occur over central oregon, and among the most severe over western oregon since the late 1870s. several observing stations across central oregon recorded two-thirds of their normal annual rainfall in just 5 days. scores of stations set new records for both 24-hour totals and december monthly rainfall totals. widespread severe flooding occurred, with at least 30 major highway bridges receiving such damage as to make them unuseable! the new john day multi-million dollar bridge was destroyed as were scores of bridges on county and secondary roads. hundreds of miles of roads and highways were washed out or badly damaged. thousands of people had to be evacuated due to ensuing floods. 

the willamette river at downtown portland had a stage of 29.8 feet. this was a record high for the winter season, and was within inches of the peak stage during the columbia river spring flood of 1948. hundreds of homes and other buildings were destroyed and an even greater number were badly damaged. .heavy snow followed by persistent heavy rains lead to record flooding in oregon during the later half of december 1964 and january 1965. in all, 17 people died. virtually every river in the state was far above flood stage and mudslides, bridge failures, and inundation closed the state's roads, airports, and railways. reservoirs were overwhelmed early on in the storm and many proved unable to release water fast enough to prevent overtopping. dorena dam, south of eugene had water flowing over the top more than 8 feet deep. 
read more information on this and other historic storms in oregon.

day 5, we still have to discuss windstorms and how to prepare for those events, so stay tuned for more important information during winter weather awareness week. follow along yourself at the nws of portland.
