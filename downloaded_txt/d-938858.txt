what does ihs mean?dennis roberts founded ihs studios in the autumn of 1982 with the mission of magnifying and honoring god through art. since symbolism is an essential element in ecclesiastical art, dennis gave careful consideration to its name.ihs is an acronym that can be traced back to the 7th century in christian literature. it represents the first three letters of the greek name of jesus. contemporary christian churches frequently refer to "in his service" as "ihs," which is a crucial reminder of our mission statement. 1ihs is also a reference to “in hoc signo vinces,” a latin phrase that translates as “in this sign thou shalt conquer,” or “in this, conquer.” this usage dates back to lucius caecillious firianus lactantius, an early christian author and advisor to constantine i. 2like the symbolism in our ecclesiastical art, ihs was selected to remind us always of our central mission, to devote our talents to the glory of god and create art that serves as a testament to our faith in the power that art can wield.










































































the design philosophy of dennis roberts: artist, ihs studios, inc.in a discussion with other artist at a conference of the stained glass association of america the term signature art was mentioned. i find the term “signature art” quite interesting and very descriptive, in two words, of what a stained glass piece or other ecclesiatical art should accomplish. since leaving the corporate world in 1982 and following path that my lord had laid before me, i have sought to do that very thing with the skills and talent he has so graciously given me. in the past 42 years “signature art” has taken on an even deeper meaning and purpose in this vocation.i start each design session with a small devotion, which includes the following prayer. “heavenly father” thanks and praise be to you for this opportunity you have provided to contemplate a design for this congregation. as i sit before this blank paper, i ask lord, you grant the inspiration, and enable the mind and eye that you have created to bring forth a design that would serve the needs of those who would look upon it. that those who stop to ponder the meaning of it would be drawn to a closer walk with you, and that it would glorify and honor your name as my lord and savior”.in my mind, several things must be accomplished to gain the status of “signature art” for a congregation.1. the complexion of the congregation needs to be established. are they drawn to contemporary or traditional styles in art, what ministries does the church embrace, etc?2. what is the primary purpose of the “work”? is the focus on outreach to the community or for those participating in worship?3. is there a central message or scripture that is to be illustrated?4. the architectural style of the building and setting is important; therefore, art should enhance the space and not be a distraction.5. light is a key component, is there a need to control the light as in an eastern exposure?once these needs are identified then design becomes an issue of using line (as in the lead lines), value, color and texture to develop a design. it has been my philosophy that the key symbolism should be readily identifiable. a person new to the faith may not know why there is a dove in the window but they shouldn’t have to have a written description to tell them it is a dove, presenting an opportunity to give witness as to why the dove is there. in most cases the window will need to be broken into smaller pieces and this gives an excellent opportunity to present subtle secondary symbolism to reinforce the overall concept. as people ponder the meaning they can find deeper insights, giving additional meaning and excitement to the experience.in considering art for the worship space i like exploring the space and letting it lead you to what medium might work best in accomplishing the finished piece of art. architectural art in a church exist within a web of connections, physical, architectural, historical, theological and social that transcends the art itself. it is these connections that give the art meaning, context and a place within a congregation of god’s people.

dennis roberts



since 1982 dennis roberts has worked primarily with on-site specific ecclesiasticalcommissions. he works closely with the architect and church representatives interpretingthe needs of the client. he uses a creative mix of traditional symbolism andcontemporary design elements that harmonize with the architecture in which they exist.he often combines contrasting media within his designs, not only designing with thecolor of transmitted light, but also with reflected light and textures. in the fall of 1982dennis organized ihs studios to begin fabricating his own designs in house, in order togain greater control of the finished product. his goal was to create a studio that wouldexecute god given talents in the creation of works that would glorify and honor god. inthe past 38 years he has gathered several artist and craftsmen who together under hissupervision have completed over 1280 commissions throughout the united states,mexico, accounting for more than 6800 windows.
