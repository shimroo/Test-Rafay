there is a difference between dental indemnity
                          insurance plans and a hmo, ppo, or dhmo. the important
                          benefit is the option to choose your own dentist
                          without having to use a network facility. thus, the
                          personal or true dental insurance plan pays the dental office
                          on a traditional fee-for-service basis. a monthly
                          premium is paid by the client or the employer to an
                          insurance company, which then reimburses the dental
                          service provider for the dental procedures rendered.
                          


a dental insurance company usually pays between 50% -
                          80% of the dental benefits, services, or fees for
                          covered procedures; the remaining 20% - 50% is paid by
                          you - the client. in addition these dental plans often
                          have a pre-determined or set deductible amount which
                          varies from plan to plan. these are very affordable
                          monthly dental indemnity plans which also can limit
                          the amount of services covered within a given year and
                          pay the dentist based on a variety of fee schedules.
