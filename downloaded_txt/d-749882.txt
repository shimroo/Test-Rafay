since 1981, rolsafe has been an essential part of our local communities. today, we face an unprecedented set of challenges as the coronavirus (covid-19) continues to impact our way of life. at this time, our focus is on the health and safety of our employees, customers, and communities.
taking the guidance of local, state, and federal government officials, we remain open. in addition to local government guidance, we are also adhering to recommendations provided by the world health organization (who) and the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc). in accordance with this expert guidance, weâ€™ve taken action to protect the health and well-being of our employees and customers to control the spread of covid-19:

our technicians are wearing facemasks and carry and use sanitizer and are wiping down what they touch before they leave.
currently there are no additional delays in permiting, scheduling, or manufacturing.
currently our hours are unchanged.

we will continue to work closely with government officials and local authorities on a case-by-case basis to ensure our business practices serve the community in the best way possible and will evaluate our options throughout this time.

i called rolsafe and they responded by coming out that day to inspect my needs. their knowledge and manner convinced me to sign up that day and present a check for the full price. on the date of the new replacement shutter installation, virgil and robert worked with coordination, care, and concern for the area and cleaned up everything.
