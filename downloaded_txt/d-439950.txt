we are so grateful to the wonderful people at ward realty for helping us find places to stay in surf city during our 2 month displacement from our home in hampstead. they really helped relieve the stress of finding housing during a difficult time. they went above and beyond for us and they didn't have to be so accommodating.  thank you so much!

one of the first rental companies i have ever had a full pleasant experience with. everyone at ward realty was top notch! no issues! house was perfectly situated for views of the beach. sounds of the waves crashing on the beach put me to sleep at night. and nap time.. short walk right onto the beach from across the road. we will stay again.

you guys were the best!! 
the island was so quiet and laid back and we loved the house. next time we are going to try and attempt to find a house right on the beach. we will only deal with you guys and gals in the future and also spread the word amongst my first responder and law enforcement family and community. we are always looking for some r&r when we can get it.

customer service is outstanding. they answer the phone with a real live human being, email promptly, respond within hours...i just can't say enough positive things about them. i don't know why any owners of properties would use anyone else to manage their rentals. so very happy to have found ward realty
