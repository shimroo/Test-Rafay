reviews i ordered a pair of ‘winterized’ neoshell pants from you oct. 4, 2013  and with the winter we’ve had this year in ontario, ny they’ve worked great.
twelve days of sub-zero temperatures so far with more in the forecast for this coming week.
combined with a neoshell jacket and some long sleeved breathable shirts, i’ve stayed warm and dry while exercising outdoors.
