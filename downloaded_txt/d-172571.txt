 project work examples 








this section contains examples of the ux design work from a number of projects i have worked on over the course of my career. each page includes some information about the project and images showing mockups, ui design and screen shots (when available).
please note that there are currently no examples of modern website ui design in my portfolio because the professional projects i have worked on most recently have been data-intensive web applications rather than customer facing websites. i am, however, fully conversant in html5, css3, css compilers such as sass and less, and javascript for the front-end. although i have a personal preference for a more traditional website information architecture and layout (as this site shows), i am familiar with the current trends (and fads) of modern website design, most importantly the need for responsive, mobile first development (and, in fact, this website is responsive).

jenni provided the ux designs and documentation for the new look ui [of viewlinc 5, vaisala's continuous monitoring system product].
    the job came with high pressure to get the product out on time, and to get a user-friendly appearance to a technical product. 
    she was very focused, very competent and imaginative.

jenni exemplified a solid commitment to the [syscon justice system] uxd team and project with a clear desire and 
    willingness to deliver a highly usable product, often working late to meet tight deadlines. jenni's engineering 
    background was key in the assessment of the architectural framework and determining possible solutions for identified
    ux issues resulting from framework constraints.
