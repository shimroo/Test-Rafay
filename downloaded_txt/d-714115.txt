                                                we have been returning to the biscayne family resort for almost 32 years because of how great this place is. the site is owned and run by the davenport family since the mid-70's. patrick davenport has taken on the daily operations from his father bob. the place is family orientated, close to the beach, clean, and staffed with efficient super friendly employees. patrick has assembled a great front office staff, whether it be diane, kathleen, sharon, or valerie. no question fazes them. you may even find patrick, bob, or the always pretty judy standing on the other side of the front desk ready to help you.

                                                we just got back from a 4 day mini vacation at the biscayne and it was great, as usual. we have stayed there about 4 years now and it is the best place in wildwood crest. the place is spotless, the location is perfect and the owners and people that run the place are the best. the whole place is very well taken care of. everything is attended to immediately. it has two pools and both are very clean. it is a great family place within steps to the beach. great neighborhood and the ice cream truck comes every night, what more could you ask for??
