freedom to read and challenged books
at orca book publishers, we believe that every child deserves access to books that inspire curiosity, critical thinking and a deeper understanding of the world around them. we stand firmly against book bans that limit young readers’ exposure to diverse voices and perspectives.
our goal is to provide reading material that represents the diversity of human experience to readers of all ages. orca aims to help young readers see themselves and others reflected in the books they read. we strive to produce books that illuminate the experiences of people of all ethnicities, people with disabilities and people who identify as lgbtq+. providing young people with exposure to diversity through reading creates a more compassionate world.
restricting access to books—especially those that reflect diverse experiences—silences voices and restricts knowledge, preventing children from developing empathy and independent thinking. even the threat of challenges and bans sows fear and distrust and can have a chilling effect on what books are selected for classrooms and libraries.
we stand with educators, librarians, authors and readers in defending the freedom to read. censorship has no place in a society that values intellectual growth and inclusivity. every child should have the right to explore stories that reflect their realities and also challenge their thinking and expand their world. 

orca book publishers will continue to publish and advocate for books that honor all experiences. we urge everyone to resist censorship and instead support children’s access to books that empower them to become informed, compassionate and engaged citizens.
about orca book publishers
orca acknowledges that the area in which we work is occupied by people, ourselves included, who are largely not indigenous to this area. we live and work within the traditional territories of the lkwungen (esquimalt and songhees), malahat, pacheedaht, scia’new, t’sou-ke and wsáneć (pauquachin, tsartlip, tsawout, tseycum) peoples. we are grateful for the natural beauty and resources we have access to and aim, through the books we publish, to play a part in raising readers and citizens who will have a great understanding of our history and this land. learn more about orca book publishers.
