“attracting top talent is a priority for michael. combined’s value-added supplemental benefits are a key way michael can attract new talent and retain his existing team – at little or no cost to him. at a time when 77% of employees would consider leaving their jobs due to poor benefits*, michael turned to combined for the right mix of benefits that employees want and need. and, it worked.”





individuals & families







“ravi watched his parents struggle financially after his father’s cancer diagnosis. financial insecurity is an unspoken impact of cancer, with medical care and drugs averaging more than $42,000 the first year after a cancer diagnosis alone**. ravi purchased a cancer policy from combined for himself, his wife, and his children, so that they have the best possible protection in the event of a cancer diagnosis.”
