mountain source sangha is a soto zen buddhist meditation group in marin county, in the san francisco bay area. together, we explore how buddhist teachings speak to our modern lives. our aims are to reduce suffering in the world and encourage the liberation of all beings. we meet weekly online and in san anselmo, ca for meditation, zen chanting and buddhist study and discussion, and hold a monthly half-day sitting that alternates location between bolinas and san anselmo.
zen meditation (zazen) is a practice that quiets and focuses the mind and body, enabling us to awaken fully to our life as it is. meditation practice can be the source of a deeply ethical and fulfilling life, and practicing with others gives us the invaluable support of friendship and community.
mt. source sangha is a branching streams member sangha, in the lineage of shunryu suzuki roshi and the san francisco zen center. the guiding priest is doshin dan gudgel.
