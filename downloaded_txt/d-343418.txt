cut shielding gas use in half; 
 by reducing "gas 
      blast"  waste at weld  starts
 
improve mig weld start "quality," reduce start spatter and wasteful excess start gas, using patented gas saver system (gsstm)  prices start at $80. over 15,000 in use!

 why  our patented gss is much better than foolish "low pressure" supposed gas savers that sell for >$250, cause flow variations and can waste gas!

a caterpillar tractor plant reported improved starts with less internal porosity with our gas saver systems (gss) installed on all their mig welders. savings in rework costs were as important than the substantial shielding gas waste reduction!

fabricators report ~40 to 50+%  gas savings: pdf 


industrial testimonial: fabricator cuts gas waste and total use over half!
a manufacturer of truck boxes welded 236 doors with one full cylinder of gas until it was empty to test gas savings.  just switching to a gas saver system (gss) with no other changes, i.e. same current, volts and gas flow rate, they welded 632 doors with 1 full cylinder.
that is a 63% gas savings. it would have required 2.7 cylinders to weld the 632 doors with their standard gas delivery hose. they purchased 25 systems for all their mig welders.
about a year later they added 10 more mig welding machines. called and asked for 10 more of the "magic hose!"


testimonial:  beau straley improves weld quality and saves over 60% of shielding gas. 
      beau purchased a 4 foot long gas saver system (gss)  and reported these gas use results:
"i received the  gss in the early part of a large project,  building a 12’ x 24’ steel building. before installing it on my miller 211c, i  had completed about 30% of the total welds, and had consumed approximately 400 psi  of my argon/25% co2 gas mixture.     after installing the gss the  remaining 70%  of the welds required only an additional 300 psi consumption of gas.   i more then doubled the number of welds, while reducing my gas consumption by  25%, i’d say the gss is a real winner!
      before i installed the gss i was being stingy with  the shielding gas flow, and the poor quality of my welds proved that.  with the gss installed i was  confident that i was not wasting gas, and increased the gas flow rate. the  result with that the appearance and quality of my welds improved dramatically.  it not only saved shielding gas, but it  increased my confidence. that’s a winning combination in my book! 
      thank you for a wonderful product that actually does what you  say it will."

      crunching the math for beau straley's gas usage: over twice the welds made/used 75%  of the gas or 50%/75% = 67% less gas used with gss! 


including 11 fabricating shops in the usa, chart industries has over 3000 gss's installed. they fabricate cryogenic tanks and natural gas liquefaction systems.
chart china added 150 more gsss in january 2020 for a total of 600. the chart plant in the czech republic purchased 245 systems. a jv in india purchased 35 gss's in 2019.  
bucyrus 
    in china repeated a gss order
a boom fabricator in china ordered  another 250 gss's in september 2019 after buying 250 systems prior.
zamil 
      steel in saudi arabia, uses co2 shielding gas 
        and after consumption tests, bought 40 foot long   gss.  
          after 6 months, they purchased another 80  gss.
aic steel structures in saudi arabia, after installing 170 gss's  ordered  ~100 more in 2018 and another ~50 in 2019!
in 2019 a shipyard in the philippines added to their previous purchase for a total of 140 gsss.


argon prices increased ~20+% about 2 years ago after increasing ~35% the year before. prices have more than doubled in past 5 years!customer
now that airgas and praxair have been purchased by a french and german company, another major producer owned by a japanese company; the only other significant us owned argon producer is air products (who have ~250 gsss in their fab shops!). they only have about 18% of the us industrial gas market. the three other foreign owner prodcuers have about 75%. the 2022 and 2023 price data (left) is from annuall reports that show very high growth rates. air products increased their dividend for the 41th striaight time in 2023..
 their ability to increase prices to cover costs+ is a key reason. all suppliers usually follow with similar increases.
stop wasting gas; prices will increase as supply will remain short. can't just import gas for several reasons but it's also in short supply elsewhere. we have supplied hundreds of our patented gas saver systems (gss) to china, india czech republic and saudi arabia as well as many us fabricators.

testimonial: received a second order from a  fellow in hawaii.  knowing things can be expensive, i asked about the cost of a cylinder fill!  he responded: 

“i’m  just a  weekend welder with a home shop. i have four 125 cubic foot tanks, two argon  and two 75 argon/25 co2.  they cost $260 and $275  per tank to fill! with the gas saver  system my weld starts look better and my gas saving's is 40%.  thanks for the fast  shipping,”


a customer recently said, "i can't understand why every mig welder doesn't use your great gas saver system (gss)? like the saying, build a better mouse trap and people will 
      beat a path to your door." 
      i told him that only fits if they 
      know they have mice!  
  bottom line:
if you are not using 
        our  low cost, patented  gss you have "mice!"  it saves about half the shielding gas used by eliminating waste while 
        improving start quality.   compared to other devices tried in the 
    past, welders like the improved starts!!   over 15,000   gss's are in use at industrial fabricators such as air products, boeing, caterpillar tractor etc. see partial user list.






"flow rate limiter" - a 
      perfect complement to our  


gss
save even more gas with our patented flow rate limiter (frl)
the frl is our latest shielding gas saving patent.  it simply 
    clamps on to and locks the flowmeter knob, preventing changes.  no alterations are made to the 
    flowmeter.

questions & answers:
we receive a number of questions about our 

"gas saver system" 
         and shielding gas control in general.  the following are some specific 
            questions:

how does the patented

gas saver system
work?



what is 
      the reason for 
gas surge at the weld 
      start? 






why is some 
extra gas needed at mig 
      weld starts?



how does 
automatic flow compensation 
      work and why is over 25 psi pressure needed to achieve it?

why has my gas supplier not told me 
      about excess gas flow problems?  


what 
      mig flow rate should be used?

what is 
      the  payback 
of the gas saver system?  


why is 
      my existing gas delivery hose a 
      wasteful 1/4 " id?



      why simple wire feeder mounted 
      orifices 
      , flowmeters, or flow control regulators - do not work to reduce gas waste?

also see video



what  
problems occur if low pressure devices  
are used to reduce surge?


what 
      about using orifices to control flow 
      at a pipeline gas supply?


for pipeline gas 
      supply what
corrections 
      in flowmeter readings are needed for pressure changes?



what is the 
ideal gas delivery system?  


the 
      gas surge exiting my mig nozzle at the weld start only lasts a short time-why 
      is that a quality problem?


is there a way to 
lock the flow settings?


can i use 
      the gas saver system 
      for tig?
