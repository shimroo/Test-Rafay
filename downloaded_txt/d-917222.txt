a guide to purchasing brandable ebooks you can resell online

4 things your should look for when purchasing plr book
the fastest and most efficient way to earn money on the web is by selling your own products. you can sell two types of products on the web, one is physical, and the other is digital. however, creating and selling physical products is a tedious task. digital products are comparatively less stubborn to deal with. but creating a high-quality digital product can mean a lot of time, money and know how.
most of the beginners internet marketers are not blessed with the latter two. if you have money to spend, you can hire experts to create a high-quality product for you to market. but, if money is not so easy to come by, then plr products like plr books, plr articles, and plr courses is the best solution to your problems. 
what are plr products?

plr products is the commonly abbreviated term on the web for “private label rights products.” plr products are re-brandable products that someone else creates for you. you can sell the products in your own name and branding. think of it like this: someone else writes the book for you, and you can sell it off with your authorship in the market and retain 100% of the profits.
what is the scope of plr products?
most products will also allow you to edit or even change portions of the original product, brand your authorship all over it and sell it in any marketplace at any price you choose. 
judging by the license that is always accompanied by the private label books from your trusted white label bookstore, you also have the ability to authorize others to resell the products without altering any parts of it. means, they can be your affiliates. 

if you purchase a private label rights book, the seller may provide you with cover graphics, editable contents, other selling materials, sales pages and squeeze pages, etc., that will help you sell it. from the moment you obtain the products, you can brand yourself as an author and start selling the products.
plr products are not limited to plr books and articles
this is not only limited to plr books (plr ebooks); there are other digital products like video courses, software, graphic image packs, plr low content, business in a box solutions, etc., with private label rights. 

if you ever decide to indulge in resell rights plr products, there are a few things that you should take into consideration before you invest any money in them. this will ensure that you only spend money on acquiring high-quality plr books and other plr products.
the product must be new – if the plr product is more than three months old, then there is a high chance that it already has a saturated market. too many people may have already oversold the product for it to make any sense to your ideal customers. invest on only fresh products. 
always opt for high price products – why i say this is because most of the low priced coaching plr content products will either be very low quality or be oversold by others since anyone can acquire them. by opting for only high-quality products, you are segregating yourself from the cheapskates.
the plr products should have selling aid – what’s the point of purchasing a product only to find that there are no marketing materials? if you are looking to build lists with the products, then go for plr products that come with a squeeze page. if you are looking to sell the product for profits, then you should select one that has a premade and high converting sales page. you can find plr products with reseller tools at the best plr stores online.
read the license agreement thoroughly – the product should have all the rights you require to edit and sell it to others. there should also be a condition that the product cannot be given away for free and that it must have a minimum selling price.  like if it’s plr content articles you’re buying, make sure you have the rights to post it on your blog.
