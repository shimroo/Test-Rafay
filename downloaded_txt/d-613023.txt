welcome to 'carol's place'. it's great to have you here. i hope you enjoy your
                    visit and find enough to interest you so that you will want to come back for another visit
                    sometime soon.
       
                    i have tried to make it easy for you to navigate this site by dividing the pages into
                    similar subject groups. the drop down menu* at the bottom of each page will take you to
                    the first page of the subject where you will find a listing of all the pages i have built
                    in that topic (with a brief description) plus any other info, such as coming attractions.
                    i hope you will enjoy your time here at carol's place.
           please excuse the occassional "broken link" while you are
                    browsing.  i keep finding them and fix them whenever i encounter one but they still
                    persist.  that will teach me to ignore my site for such a long time !

 i'm really glad you are here. my name is carol abbott. i've been
                owner of this site for over fifteen years! like all babies, this one has gone through
                many changes and sometimes takes off in a direction that i never expected. i appreciate
                the help that my grown daughters offered in guiding me in the building of these pages. i
                wouldn't have had the courage to try without them giving me a not so gentle push! 
           
                one of my main objectives for making a site has been to try and get some thoughts written
                down on various subjects that interest me.
. 



           
                wish me luck as i continue on this journey. and please come back
                sometime. 
                              you are
                always welcome at carol's place.
