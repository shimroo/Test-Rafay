say something anonymous reporting system
 
currituck county schools has adopted the “say something anonymous reporting system” (ss-ars).
 
this program, which fulfills the mandate requirement under 115c-105.51 of nc law, teaches students, teachers, and administrators how to recognize warning signs and signals, especially within social media, of individuals who may be a threat to themselves or others and say something to a trusted adult or use the anonymous reporting system.
 
students and school staff receive information and training on the say something anonymous reporting system.
