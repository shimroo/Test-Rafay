vermont’s favorite family campground

reservations










celebrating 45 years of family camping memories!
lone pine is currently closed for camping and looking forward to our opening day of may 1, 2025. we are presently taking reservations for the 2025 season and will start taking reservations for the 2026 season on february 1, 2025.

known across new england and beyond as "vermont’s favorite family campground", lone pine campsites offers the quintessential vermont camping experience in one of the most beautiful regions of the state, the lake champlain valley. located a mere stone's throw from mallets bay and 15 minutes from downtown burlington, our 265 spacious campsites are surrounded by native trees and wildlife. we provide several rv hook-up options, offer rv rentals, and are happy to welcome tent campers.
everything you’ll need is on site, from sports courts and a fully stocked camp store, to wifi access, two giant swimming pools, laundry facilities, and free weekly rides on a real 1952 fire truck!
a wide variety of outdoor and urban adventures are in our neighborhood, from tours at the legendary ben and jerry’s ice cream factory and sailing excursions on lake champlain, to shopping at the church street marketplace and day hikes in the breathtaking green mountains.
characterized by first-rate facilities, well-kept grounds, and a fun-filled activities calendar, it’s no wonder lone pine continues to win over the hearts of campers year after year. for 45 years we've done our best to make each stay at lone pine worthy of a scrapbook of memories. we hope your family will join the fun and become part of the lone pine community this season!
