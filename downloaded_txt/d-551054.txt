sugar bowl viva italia sl results

our first january races after the holiday break took us to sugar bowl
for 2 sl races on jan. 11-12, returning to a venue where we last raced back in 2012.
it was a sunny but chilly weekend on top of donner pass, with a cold ne wind
blowing, and the firm conditions were a challenging racing surface for our
field of masters competitors! the sugar bowl race crew made us welcome
and put on a good event, with everything running on schedule.


complete race results are posted on the web site on the race results page,
along with updated season standings rankings for 2025.

the sugar bowl sl races were also the site for 2025 viva italia event, with the trophy
awarded to the top man and woman racer in the combined standings using an age-handicap formula.
the viva italia has a legendary history from founder john gianotti and he would have
approved of the grit and determination of the competitors tackling the challenging race hill.
the viva italia winners were announced at the post-race awards, with the trophies
awarded to deb lewis (w10) and wences lada munoz (m08). and a well-deserved shout-out
to class 2 racer dave law, who dominated the field both days and nearly overcame
the daunting handicap of being "too young" in finishing a close runnerup to wences.

mammoth season opener results

our season opening training camp and gs races at mammoth mountain
the first week of december were blessed with spectacular conditions
throughout the training and race days.  best early season conditions
in many years - some said the best opening camp ever!

in a change from our usual race venues, we were on the main broadway run
all week and it turned out to be very fun.  warm, sunny, and grippy snow all week.
the mammoth race department crew was out in full strength for the weekend
races and put on a first-class competition event.


complete race results are posted on the web site on the race results page,
along with the first season standings rankings for 2025.

[25-dec-2024]


2025 open class and season scoring

far west masters races are conducted following the standard us masters age class rules. 
an additional option is used by far west masters in our division races, allowing competitors
to elect to be scored in an open class drawn from all age classes rather than their 
age class for race awards and season scoring. 

all competitors start within their age group in the race start order but may elect to be 
scored for race awards based on the overall ranking of open class participants rather 
than within their age class. the season leader bibs are awarded based on the rankings of the open class.

the 2025 open class elections list is started with all current season bib holders registered by default. 
everyone else (including "the usual folks") need to explicitly elect to participate in open class.
it's your choice - no one is obligated or expected to elect open class - go open if you'll have fun doing that,
stay in your age class for scoring and awards if you're happy with the standard age class system.




fwm 2025 open class competitors



fwm 2025 season scoring and open class rules


to elect open class, contact scoring director deb lewis at dlewis@farwestmasters.org. 
open class participants will be noted on start lists with "op" designation and when possible on the finish board so that 
all competitors know who is competing within their age class and who is being scored in the overall open class.
important reminder: 
to participate in the open class for any event, you must elect open 
no later than the noon the day prior to the race. 
day-of-race open class changes will not be accepted!
