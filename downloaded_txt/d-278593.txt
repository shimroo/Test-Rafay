the vatican says pope francis slept peacefully and ate breakfast after developing pneumonia in both his lungs. he got out of bed and his heart is said to be in good condition. an early update wednesday came from the vatican spokesman. while francis' weekly general audience was canceled, pilgrims were continuing to flock to the vatican, with some on holy year pilgrimages. the vatican said late tuesday that francis’ respiratory infection also involves asthmatic bronchitis, which required the use of cortisone antibiotic treatment. vatican spokesman matteo bruni said in a late update that the pope is in good spirits and is grateful for the prayers for his recovery.

president donald trump is going further than ever before to enforce his decisions. while orders were sometimes softened or even ignored during his first term, this time he's unwilling to let things slide. the white house summarizes trump’s approach with the mantra “promises made, promises kept.” administration officials also say trump is entitled to impose his vision on the government that he was elected to lead. others see something darker and more menacing for the country and accuse the republican president of hollowing out institutions that have defied him in the past.

            palestinian families flee west bank homes in droves as israel confronts militants

updated 
26 mins ago



tens of thousands of palestinians have fled home following recent israeli military operations across the northern west bank. they have traveled by car and on foot, through muddy olive groves and snipers’ sight lines, in the occupied territory's largest displacement since the 1967 mideast war. after announcing a widespread crackdown against west bank militants on jan. 21, israeli forces descended on the city of jenin, as they have dozens of times since hamas’ oct. 7, 2023, attack on israel. soldiers then pushed deeper and more forcefully into several other nearby towns, scattering families and stirring bitter memories of the 1948 war over israel’s creation. during that war, 700,000 palestinians fled or were forced from their homes in what palestinians call the nakba, or “catastrophe.”

            middle east latest: netanyahu appoints adviser with trump ties to lead ceasefire talks

updated 
26 mins ago



an israeli official said that prime minister benjamin netanyahu has appointed a close confidant to lead negotiations for the second stage of the ceasefire with hamas. the u.s.-born ron dermer is a cabinet minister who’s widely seen as netanyahu’s closest adviser. he previously served as israel’s ambassador to the u.s. and is a former republican activist with strong ties to the trump white house. israeli and hamas have yet to negotiate a second and more difficult phase of the ceasefire. palestinians and arab countries have universally rejected u.s. president donald trump’s proposal to remove the palestinian population from gaza and take over the territory.

            trump is living in a russian-made 'disinformation space,' says ukraine's zelenskyy


1 hr ago


ukraine president volodymyr zelenskyy says u.s. president donald trump is living in a russian-made “disinformation space” as a result of his administration’s discussions with kremlin officials. trump suggested tuesday that ukraine was to blame for the war on its territory, which enters its fourth year next week. zelenskyy spoke as trump's envoy, keith kellogg, arrived in kyiv for talks. talks between top american and russian diplomats in saudi arabia on tuesday sidelined ukraine and its european supporters. trump’s comments marked a major shift in u.s. policy after years of efforts to isolate russian president vladimir putin and are likely to vex ukrainian officials.


















        

        
            raducanu approaches the umpire in tears after a security incident at a tournament in dubai

updated 
1 hr ago



the women's tennis association says concern over a man who’d exhibited fixated behavior caused emma raducanu to approach the chair umpire in tears and take an unscheduled break in her second-round match at the dubai championships. there was no immediate explanation tuesday when the 2021 u.s. open champion stood behind the umpire's chair for a while after the second game. raducanu, who was a teenager when a man in britain was convicted of stalking her, resumed playing after a brief delay and eventually lost 7-6 (6), 6-4 to karolina muchova. the wta issued a statement wednesday saying raducanu was approached by a man monday and the “same individual was identified in the first few rows during emma’s match on tuesday.”
