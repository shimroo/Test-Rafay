award-winning myrtle beach buffeta family tradition since 1986 an original landmark on the grand strand. the original benjamin’s calabash seafood serves fresh local seafood daily. our myrtle beach buffet is also world-famous for introducing the myrtle beach area to cooking seafood calabash style. calabash style seafood is lightly battered and deep-fried. if great food, family fun, and a good time are what you’re craving, you’ve definitely found the place. so sail in today for the adventures of a true nautical dining experience. be sure to save room for an abundance of sensational food and memories. 

















































































building history everyday.jimmy frost, our very own master shipwright jimmy has either built or restored all the models at the original benjamin's. however, these aren't your little brother's model ship kits! unlike the models most of us are used to, jimmy handcrafts his models and prefers them to be on a large scale. for example, our 18 foot queen elizabeth ii. throughout the restaurant you’ll see jimmy’s work applied to a number of historical cruise liners, schooners, military ships, as well as airplanes.
