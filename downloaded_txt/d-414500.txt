made 
	  to stick: why some ideas survive and others die how to communicate and 
	  use ideas in ways that work.  i feel strongly enough about this book 
	  that i've given away a number of copies. i should note that i also get 
	  thank you letters back when i do that. buy a copy for yourself, you will 
	  thank yourself for the gift.
by chip heath. 
	    available
	    at amazon.com.

conflict
	    resolution
	    by daniel dana

	    this book covers everything from start to finish and it serves as an
	    excellent introduction to the field as well as being well suited to self-help.
	    extemely easy to use and refer to. 
	     order
	    this book from amazon.com -- about ten dollars.
	    
	     

























marketing without advertising: inspire customers to rave about your
	    business & create lasting success by
	    
	    michael phillips,
	    
	    salli rasberry,
	    
	    diana fitzpatrick (new edition
	    available
	    with a discount at amazon.com.) and  mediation
	    career guide by forest monsten
	    (available
	    discounted with free shippoing at amazon.com.).

if you want to succeed as a mediator and get paid, you
	    need either marketing without advertising or forest mosten's
	    mediation career guide.

as to mosten's book:  "a complete (how is
	    it that he misses nothing?) and practical guide filled with brilliant ideas,
	    useful tools, 'just go do it' insights, and invaluable advice for all." (daniel
	    bowling, executive director, association for conflict resolution).
	    
	    i have never had anyone who was not very happy with either book.  much
	    to my surprise, in a class i assigned marketing without advertising
	    to, all post-graduate students, mwa was the one book they found more
	    important than any other they had read in their post graduate program. 
	    i would note that importantly, mediation career guide applies everything
	    with specific details for a mediation career, missing nothing, warning you
	    of everything you need to be aware of.
	    
	    for anyone who wants to make mediation a career, i can recommend both books
	    very strongly.
