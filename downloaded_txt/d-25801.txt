martin lefevre - meditations: does cosmic intelligence care about humanity?no amount of activism or number of mass movements can meet the crisis of man. the undivided individual contains the whole of humanity. binoy kampmark: far from benign - the us aid industrial complexto provide aid suggests a benevolent undertaking delivered selflessly. it arises from charitable mission, an attempt to alleviate, or at least soften the blows of hardship arising from various impairments. but the provision of aid is rarely benign, almost always political, and, in its realisation, often self-defeating.richard s. ehrlich: chinese criminals' international scams & kidnappings“the united states and china [are] the two most strongly affected victims of the online scamming industry,” usip said in a 2024 report on chinese-dominated transnational crime based in southeast asia.


ian powell: is health new zealand becoming an audit office frequent flyer?ian powell discusses whether health new zealand is becoming a frequent flyer for the auditor-general and why that might not be such a bad thing given the circumstances. peter dunne: dunne's weekly - next election still national's to losethe national-led coalition is more precariously positioned at present than each of the last two labour-led governments were at similar stages in the previous two parliaments. gordon campbell: on the government’s epic fails in jobs and housingthe coalition government has engineered a rise in unemployment in order to reduce inflation while cracking down on the people thrown out of work by its own policies.
