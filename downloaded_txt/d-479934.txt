my z28 after restoration
    my '69 z28 was in great condition when i bought it in april of 2000. the paint was over 10 years old and still shined, as you can see, and the interior is original except for newer carpet. when the project is finished, it will have a completely rebuilt, balanced and blueprinted engine, with all numbers and date matching parts and accessories. i purchased parts from jerry macneish and other sources throughout the country. the original engine compartment of the z didn't look too bad, but was not correctly painted or detailed, and many of the original parts were gone. however, the original block, heads, radiator, intake manifold, fan and shroud, harmonic balancer, flywheel, bellhousing, voltage regulator, deep groove pulleys, smog system, m-21 trans, and 373 12 bolt posi were original. finding the rest of the parts was like going on an expensive scavenger hunt. but, i found what i needed. just bring lots of money!!! a special thanks goes out the chris cox at camaros only, la habra, ca., for his countless hours spent on the sub-frame restoration. and thanks to jerry macneish for providing me with some of the more rare original z28 parts.
