      we research experiences!


 as the world’s first research firm focused on experiential marketing and fan engagement, we believe the key to maximizing impact is to dig deep, go beyond a dashboard of big data and artificial intelligence, and "humanize" the connections you are making.
let us help you explore the deepest layers of audience passion points, pain points, and emotional triggers to build stronger, more meaningful, and lasting connections.

     these are our lanes-






 
      

  
brand partnerships


 performance research is a sponsorship research pioneer. we literally wrote the book on sponsorship impact and brand loyalty, moving the industry to prove its value with rigorous research and measurement. with four decades of experience, we help brands find the sweet spot where a partnership and activation align, making experiential marketing more meaningful and memorable. whether pre-testing partnerships or tracking success, our framework is holistic - we don't just measure roi, but roi and ror: return on relationship.



   

  
sports properties


 sports properties have two parallel goals: create the most compelling experience for fans and transfer that feeling into lasting relationships. we have worked with the world's leading properties to create actionable intelligence around those dual goals. our property work includes naming rights research, sponsorship retention insights, fan engagement and "lost fan" re-engagement intelligence, ticketing strategies and more. we help leading properties step up their audience and partnership strategies so they can exceed their goals.



   while the sports world and the arts & entertainment world have some marketing goals in common, the challenges can be steeper with entertainment and live events; entertainment options have never been more saturated, and winning consumer attention is no easy task. from film festivals to concert tours, theme parks to art museums, we research what makes or breaks the single day experiences from the human perspective, and help clients strategically build partnerships that will enhance attendee experiences in the future.

  
festivals & arts


 



    youth sports


 youth sports are significant life experiences, building camaraderie, confidence, and community. while kids are the centerpiece, parents steer the decisions, making marketing a complex task. from youth soccer to girls tackle football, our research has created roadmaps for our clients to optimize connections with their stakeholders: athletes, parents, partners and funders, coaches and the community. we have helped youth sports programs across the country maximize engagement and positive experiences in the future.

 







 
      

  
ngbs


 ngbs often have similar goals: to build their respective sport, drive competitive excellence, and set high ethical standards. but with diverse stakeholders, multiple programs, and finite resources, the hurdles can be high. solid research gives ngbs the data and insights they need to set priorities, enhance program effectiveness, optimize member engagement, boost revenue, and ultimately expand reach and impact.




   

  private clubs and associations


 shifting demographics, membership retention and growth, resolving conflicts and setting priorities-  clubs and associations are facing mounting challenges. we can design objective research programs that support strategic planning, stimulate program development, drive revenue, and bring our experience of working with some of the most storied clubs and  associations in the u.s.



   you know that "doing good" is your mission, but do you know how to harness and amplify that good? we work with leading non-profits, universities, health organizations, public broadcasting, and social advocacy groups to understand brand image, communication platforms, and action plans, all to maximize public support and mission impact.

  
npos / education


 



    
prosocial impact


 what is your return on purpose? our breakthrough measurement framework,
prosocial valuation®, 
uses rigorous research and economic algorithms to identify outcomes of social programs and the dollar value they return to society. visit our sister company psv and the our case study of the homeless world cup to learn about this leading edge approach for quantifying social impact.

     things we love to do- 








  

      ﻿partnership impact
& tracking

 we go far beyond the basic statistics, media metrics and mere social media impressions.  we dive deep into the human connections that matter, assessing not just the reach but the real return on relationship.


   fan
feedback

 properties work to build the best experience. but is it ideal for fans?  post-event feedback gives fans a voice that helps shape events for an optimal experience and added revenue.


  economicimpact analysis


 understanding the economic impact of events is vital for demonstrating value to stakeholders and securing funding. we provide transparent ei reports covering all forms of spending.


  re-engaging lost
and lapsed fans

 research can uncover reasons behind fan withdrawal, and find strategies to re-engage fans. reverse trends, and transform indifferent audiences into enthusiastic advocates, adding re-found life into your fan base.



   ﻿tailoring to
niche markets


 experiential marketing has the ability to reach unique markets in a common language on their own turf.  research helps find these audiences and tailor programs and communications to ensure  authenticity and lasting  bonds.


  fan
segmentation

 fan segmentation is key to unlocking the full potential of experiential marketing. dividing audiences by characteristics, preferences, and behavior, research can raise engagement, loyalty, and long-term success. 


  ﻿ticket price optimization

 setting the right ticket price is a delicate balance between maximizing attendance and achieving financial goals. our research analyzes demand patterns, price sensitivity, and the cost/value perspective of fans.


  venue naming rights 


 venue sponsorships provide tremendous visibility outside, but do they convey the brand's values and commitment to fans? research helps ensure fan appreciation, far beyond what title sponsorship  alone can achieve.
