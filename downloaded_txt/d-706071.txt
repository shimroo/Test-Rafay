help develop prison churches providing pastors, worship services, bible studies, pastoral counseling, christian education, christian literature, and special events. *in march of 2020, the onset of covid-19, vt prisons closed to outside groups until april, 2022. during shut-down, pastor josh riggs made weekly dvds with worship music, sermons and teaching messages that were sent to all vt prisons. we are slowly restoring our volunteer services.

annual prison/aftercare ministry conference



cap has sponsored annual state conferences since 1995. the 2020 conference was cancelled due to the pandemic. we held a zoom event on november 12, 2020 titled “first volunteer and aftercare ministry conference zoom event” with special speaker apostle dennis wiedrick from divine exchange. with the end of the pandemic and opening of prison doors to volunteers, we plan to hold annual conferences again soon. 



watch safe sanctuary, an excerpt from amazing grace below:



“our church gratefully commends the ministry of pete and joanne fiske. 



they have provided wise counsel to us in the form of a saturday workshop, pastor-to-pastor consultation, and counseling for a sex offender and his family. we appreciate their years of fruitful experience and a manner that is gracious but no nonsense. they have given of themselves unstintingly to help us work through thorny issues and to make our church a safe place for all. pete and joanne do not present superficial quick fixes, but deep principles and pathways of ministry for broken people. we would have been lost at sea without their insights. we look forward to a continuing ministry relationship with the fiskes, and we encourage other churches to make use of this ministry that comes as a timely and much needed gift from the lord to his body.” - pastor bernie powel

pastors pete & joanne fiske



president and vice-president, board of directors & administration



having trained the next generation to move forward with the ministry, pastor pete and pastor jo have stepped down from working inside the prisons and are concentrating their efforts on administrative necessities and aftercare. they are 79 and 75, and live in jericho where they have housed many released inmates, the last person having moved out in february of 2023. (see new life crew also.) pastor pete, with jo’s help and the professional editing of her son salvatore, is writing a book about god’s miracles and lessons learned over 31 years of prison ministry.

in september 1992 pete and agnes fiske took over the leadership of a sunday church service at northwest state correctional facility (nwscf) in st. albans vt. in july 1993 peter retired from ibm to answer god’s call into full-time prison ministry. in april 1997 the ministry was incorporated as “the church at prison.” in nov. of 2004 pastor agnes fiske passed from this life into the arms of her lord jesus. in april of 2006, having met joanne (jo) falise at the funeral of a prison pastor a month earlier, pete asked jo out on their first date - church, but this service was held behind the bars of the nwscf prison in st. albans, vt, pete’s church. january 28, 2007, pastor pete and joanne were married at the nwscf with inmate pastor fred little officiating and inmate elder andy wood giving jo away to pastor pete. jo retired from real estate and began working full-time in the church at prison ministry, including taking over patmos christian college which continued using curriculum from christian life educators network. in may of 2011 jo was licensed by maranatha ministerial fellowship international (mmfi). in march of 2015 pastors pete and jo were recognized for their work in prison ministry and commissioned as apostolic leaders by mmfi. in 2016 pete and jo began praying for the lord to bring forth those who they would disciple to become the next generation of prison ministers for the church at northwest. providentially, josh riggs contacted them just after easter and soon became a volunteer, laboring beside them in the prison. this allowed pastor pete time to establish new life crew, llc - an aftercare painting and construction work program which continues today. in september of 2019 jo was ordained by mmfi in recognition of the ministry she had been doing. providentially, over the last four years, rev. josh, marcus szczecinski and tim hurlbut all formed their own important positions in the ministry, allowing pastors pete & jo to provide oversight for the church at prison, while handing over much of the direct contact with inmates and ex-inmates to others. they have said that god is turning “their ceiling” into the floor of the new generation of prison ministers, which in turn is allowing this great love of and care for those behind bars and all affected by incarceration to continue to grow exponentially.

matt became involved with cap by volunteering for a kairos weekend at his former church in 2001. during the training session matt encountered a personal tragedy in which many church volunteers ministered to him. still hurting, matt went into the weekend with very little to give. as god would have it, matt received so much more than he could ever give. pastor fred little prayed over matt and a veil of darkness was lifted from his eyes. scripture began to make sense! god was speaking to matt through the word and he was comforted, strengthened and guided by it.   impressed by the men in prison who were set free on the inside and lived in “close community”, matt began to volunteer at church on sunday nights. the greatest thing matt learned while serving was the importance of forgiveness and the power it gives.  cap became a staple in matt's growth from 2001 until the change in population at nwscf in 2008. during those early years matt became involved with a home fellowship led by pastor roger patno and his wife joyce. it turns out that god was using these two ministries to prepare matt for continuing the ministry of nccf. matt and his wife ann were married in 2011 and have served together ever since. matt and ann continue to grow as they serve cap and nccf as the spirit leads. 

























tom millington



co-facilitator at breaking chains christian fellowship



tom millington comes from a generational christian background. born and raised in the protestant faith, tom received jesus at age 11, whereby “jesus is lord” (1 corinthians 12:3). a ten-year lapse of actively pursuing god after high school led to a life of despair. god, in his rich mercies, rejuvenated tom’s faith, which has flourished ever since, and firmly established love for all people in his heart: “jesus christ the same yesterday, and today, and forever” (hebrews 13:8). it’s no surprise that when tom met pastor pete he soon began going into prison at nwscf to share his heart for jesus. he is presently participating in breaking chains christian fellowship ministry in burlington, helping others to be grounded in their faith.

jim wilkinson & barbara manchester wilkinson



co-facilitators at breaking chains christian fellowship



in 2019 jim wilkinson and tom millington began meeting at jim’s house for a bible study. at that time jim was asked to by authorities to help with daily living assistance for bill who he knew from the streets and who also wanted to know more about faith in jesus. they met at various places and eventually the study moved to bill’s place. the study grew and flourished, and they soon saw the need to meet in a bigger place. in the summer of 2020 the lord worked on the hearts of several people to formalize the ministry under the name breaking chains christian fellowship (bccf). turning point of burlington invited bccf to hold their weekly fellowship meetings there. it grew into both a bible study and a breakfast with new moon catering at 150 cherry street began providing the food as an outreach under cap. bccf became an official affiliate of cap so they could have a 501c3 covering and a bookkeeper to help manage donations, etc. 







            read more
          










in 2021, jim was blessed with an incredible gift from god, his wife barbara, who was seeking a ministry and discovered bccf. barbara’s heart’s desire is to serve as a disciple of god. she is an excellent teacher of the god’s word and supports whoever god puts in her path. she serves at turning point tuesdays for bccf bible study, and both she and jim minister at their church, to uvm students—and at north beach and city hall park where they offer burgers and hot dogs and hand out tracts and pocket bibles. jim also helps transport ex-inmates for cap, including moving people. jim & barbara love walking the streets of burlington handing out bags filled with treats and tracts. it is a joy to give the gospel of jesus christ to all the lord puts in their path. jim moved to vermont in 2004 and surrendered his will to god. he began to serve the lord in a few churches and various endeavors. he met pastors pete and joanne in 2008 and developed a relationship with them while continuing to grow in his faith. he became a regular attendee of vibrant church (community bible church) and began to video church services while also helping with bible studies. jim also began to minister to the inmates at northwest state correctional facility alongside pastors pete, joanne and josh riggs.during the pandemic jim and barbara applied to become bible study volunteers to the women’s prison at chittenden regional correctional facility—which they pray will be approved in 2023. in addition to providing worship services, they also see a deep need for healthy christian couples to demonstrate the value of marriage and parents who live a biblical lifestyle in a home committed to jesus. most of the broken people behind the razor wires have never experienced that. following in the footsteps of pastors pete and joanne, they hope to continue to provide a living example of god’s divine marriage.






breaking chains christian fellowship mission statement



breaking chains christian fellowship, an affiliate ministry of the church at prison, is a frontline evangelical street ministry dedicated to sharing the good news of jesus christ with any and all we come into contact with, but most especially with ex-inmates, the homeless, and those with alcohol and drug and other addictions. our goal is to share jesus christ who is, “the way, the truth and the life” by coming alongside and walking with people “out of darkness and the shadow of death” and by so doing to “break away their chains” and lead them on the path to eternal life in christ jesus.  breaking chains christian fellowship fully proclaims the gospel of christ as the apostle paul did in romans 15:17-19 “by word and deed,” “by the power of signs and wonders” and “by the power of the spirit of god.” we come together as the believers did in acts 2:42-43 to devote ourselves to “the apostles’ teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer,” and in so doing we are in awe of how the lord works wonders and presents signs through the group. “he brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death and broke away their chains.”         psalm 107:14 “jesus answered, 'i am the way, the truth and the life.  no one comes to the father except through me.’” john 14:6
















“i am so in love with the lord jesus i can't begin to tell you the feeling i have inside! i still have a long way to go, but i'm not afraid anymore—i know he is with me! i miss you (jo) and pete, ... if not for your love and guidance i wouldn't have found my way home to the lord! you never gave up on me and i am eternally grateful. i love you both so much!” - norajean
