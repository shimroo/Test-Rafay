generasi covid, magical generation??








alhamdulillah, akhirnya odang lulus sma... meski rasanya kok kayak nggak lulus beneran karena tidak ada unbk dan lulus dalam kondisi di rumah saja, tak ada perayaan kelulusan macam pelepasan siswa yang biasanya paling berkesan dan ramai. tangis-tangisan perpisahan? yah, nangis di pojokan kamar aja, eh... jaman now mah tangis-tangisan dan berbagi rasa biasa ditumpahkan di sosmed ya😊 awalnya mau ada acara pelepasan siswa melalui webinar, tapi udah keburu bubar dan hilang mood juga, jadi ga jadi deh... sepi...lengang...

blognya harus dilanjutkan...dan pandemik covid19 di tahun 2020








sejak blog ini diserahkan ke anak-anak, ternyata sama juga cerita anak-anak tidak berlangsung. ummi sih cuma khawatir karena pasif nanti ditutup oleh blogger... barusan juga harus urus id dan password lagi, saking lama sekali nggak pernah log in jadinya lupa... alhamdulillah akhirnya bisa masuk juga ke blog ini. sekalian ganti lay out supaya agak fresh.

hmm... mudah2an bisa di update lagi cerita anak2 ya.

hannah dan thimun 2020












setelah 2x cuma nganter dan berfoto bareng
odang di depan gedung world forum, akhirnya giliran si ndek yang ikut thimun.
odang malah udah ga bisa ikut lagi, setelah komite sekolah nggak ngijinin siswa
kelas xii ikut acara itu. 



sama seperti odang, awalnya hannah kurang
pede, nggak bisa langsung click dengan siswa dari negara lain. tapi lama-lama
ya bisa juga meski nggak dekat. tahun ini pun ada cartoon exhibition, dan
hannah ikut juga. ummi lihat gambar2 ndek itu bagus-bagus, bahkan jauh lebih
bagus dari odangnya. tapi sayang ndek belum bisa manage waktu untuk memikirkan
tema gambarnya. entah kenapa kok sama temanya dengan khya... ya nggak apa-apa
nggak dapat juara apa-apa, meski kata ketua komite gambar hannah dipakai
sebagai contoh waktu direktur thimun pidato. 



update : sepertinya itu jadi satu-satunya
thimun si ndek karena 2 bulan setelah itu semua kegiatan dilockdown akibat
covid19. di websitenya ditulis, thimun baru dibuka lagi januari 2022 yang
artinya hannah sudah kelas 3 dan kalo kebijakan sekolah kelas xii tidak boleh
ikut ya rejeki hannah cuma sekali saja.

photography workshop






my first photography workshop




 i never asked for it. i never had wanted to join a photography workshop. but i did join. it was a great opportunity to join in and get some tips on photography. my friend at school likes photography, which made me curious of how it's like to hold a camera the right way. when i first learned how to do it right, i got even more curious. they taught me how to deal with the brightness, blurring, and how to get the right image. and afterwards we got to eat :d

my new pet fish 

 24/04/2015

by:hannah.l.h  










 from all these years i really wanted to have a pet. so my pet is a goldfish but the real colour is orange. last time i had a pet fish it died because it's been eaten by cats. this time the cats played one of our water plant and leave the water plant on the ground. we buyed the fish because, in the summer there are many bugs out side so if one of the bugs fell down to the aquarium the fish will eat them and their eggs. 

        
but because it's still spring the bugs don't usually go outside so i give them some fish food if they are hungry. everyday i count at them almost every evening. but having pets is not easy. these fish is an outdoor fish so the can not survive if it's too hot.  in this aquarium there are not so many pants and those are: water lily, a tiny water lily, and a water flower.

        the last time i had two chickens but one of them died because it ran away and the other one died because it was cold outside. some times the fish hides in the big water lily. but when i give them fish food they don't eat it when i'm around because they don't get used to me.
         one day one of the fish didn't move at all when i looked at it then i poked the water with a stick but it's not dead. a few weeks later the aquarium is almost filled with dirt. it was a dirty aquarium. that why                          * my fish and me*                                           having a pet is not easy.



                                

                                  the end

my last holiday










jasmijn s. haags-alimah

6 february 2015



it
was a fine sunny morning in the month of june, 2014. my grandmother from
indonesia stayed with us for 3 months. i jumped off my bed and ran downstairs,
it was packing day. i saw my little sister packing. we were going to istanbul, turkey.
so my grandma was having a double vacation, to the netherlands and turkey.











*a
few days later*

i
woke up and looked up to the clock. it was 08.30. i overslept! i ran down the
stairs and ate my breakfast. at 12.00 we arrived at the rotterdam-the hague
airport. in the waiting room i sat down next to my sister, grabbed my book and
read. i sighed, it was boring, i continued reading, but this time i took
another book. hannah was drawing in her sketch book. my mum and grandmother
were talking to each other while my dad was waiting patiently.









*a
few minutes later*

i
groaned, “when can we get in the plane?!” i was really bored and had nothing to
do. i read, drew in my sketch book, played around with my sister. this couldn’t
get any worse, could it? it got worse. the plane got delayed for another 3
hours! i was annoyed, but i cooled down and tried to take just a little nap (i
couldn’t sleep).


 
*a
few hours later*

an
announcement finally came out, “the plane to istanbul has just landed,
passengers please proceed to gate 6.” we then boarded in the plane and sat on
our seats. after a few minutes my dad ordered some tuna sandwiches and iced
tea.



*a
few hours later* (i was asleep, so didn’t remember anything)

the
plane landed at 21.00 in sabiha gökçen airport, but we got out of the plane at
21.20. we took a taxi and drove to the hotel. we arrived at about 00.00. we ate
supper and went to bed.






the
very next morning i asked my dad what time it was. “it’s almost 09.00,” he
answered. i heard the bathroom door open and saw my grandmother coming out. we
ate breakfast and planned to go to the blue mosque and the hagia sophia. we
went out of the hotel and started walking to the blue mosque. when we arrived,
we did our prayers in the gigantic mosque. after that we walked to the hagia
sophia. it had a beautiful garden and was flooded by visitors. unfortunately,
we couldn’t go to the museum. then we went to a turkish restaurant and sat on a
long bench at the park. we sat on the bench for a long time. we were very
thirsty and quite tired. my dad and grandmother slept on the bench, in public!
i won’t blame them for sleeping on the bench, it was a hot day and we were
sitting under the shade of trees anyway. people who walked by stared at us,
probably thinking we were homeless! after that we went back to the hotel and had
dinner.



the
next day we went to the grand bazaar where we bought some souvenirs. then we went
to the airport by taxi. on the way, i had a really bad stomach ache. i drank
coke and ice-cream not long after that. i wondered why my tummy hurt. when i asked
my mum, she answered “if you mix soda with milk, it will all turn into really
sour acid”. the coke i drank contained soda and the ice-cream i ate contained
milk. my stomach was probably not strong enough to let something so sour in my
tummy. i almost threw up when we arrived at the airport, and then we queued
before the custom officer’s counter. the queue was so long that we almost
missed our flight, but we made it and got on the plane on time. when we arrived
in the netherlands, it was midnight and two nights before ramadhan. it was
really nice and unforgettable. our holiday to turkey apparently turned to be a
special gift to welcome the coming of the fasting month. 







 the
city of istanbul is huge and breathtaking. the former capital of two great empires,
namely the eastern roman empire/byzantine and the islamic ottoman empire, does
worth to visit.
