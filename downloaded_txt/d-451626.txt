							i traded in my bobcat for a newer one recently. i called bobcat of buffalo and talked to nick. he was great to work with. he was prompt and did everything he said he would. i was worried about hydraulic fluid. he gave me enough of the correct fluid and told me not to worry about it! i definitely recommend nick and bobcat of buffalo. - robert osborn
