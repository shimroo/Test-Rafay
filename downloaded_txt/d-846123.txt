beautiful truro is the hub of nova
scotia, the center of every thing. truro nova scotia ca has been known
as the hub of the province because it is in the center of the province
for railway trains, highway and street traffic. truro is in colchester
county at the head of the bay of fundy where the tidal bore comes in
fast as the tide is funneled up the bay to the salmon and north rivers
at truro ns ca.

i grew up in the township of onslow where many of my relatives also
lived. from onslow mountain just outside of truro in the county of
colchester as in many places around truro, the view is of the head of
the bay of fundy. where you can just feel that people stood watching
for ships bringing supplies to the township of truro ns ca. where you
could see and honestly say, "my ship has come in" and be off to town to
meet your ship.

oh the days gone by, ships do not come to truro nova scotia canada
anymore. then again the ships of years gone by would be boats now and
the ships of today would tower far above those little boats.
