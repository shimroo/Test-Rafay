		welcome to classic engines website
	 




 to the little engine that really could — and still can! 
 this site is dedicated to the small engine, that modern mechanical marvel that so often is lost in the shadow of its high-powered relatives. here we will celebrate briggs & stratton, chrysler, clinton, continental, cox, craftsman, deco-grand, evinrude, homelite, honda, jacobsen, kohler, lawn boy, maytag, mcculloch, ohlsson and rice, onan, pincor, power product, reo, tecumseh, tiny tim chargers and all the other little fellas that have made our clothes so much cleaner, our lawns so much neater, and our lives so much easier. 
due to popular demand, we will be updating our site within in the next few weeks. keep checking back for new info and pictures.
