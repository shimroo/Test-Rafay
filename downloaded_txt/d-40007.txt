scope, addressing the broad range and diversity of human experience understood in its archaeological, biological, and sociocultural contexts.  as such, it encompasses different conceptual, methodological, and epistemological frameworks that link the discipline to work in the arts, humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences.  anthropology department vision/mission statementdiversity, equity, and inclusion statementat emory, our department is deeply committed to pursuing diversity in our scholarship, faculty, and student communities.  we seek to create an environment that encourages students to address intellectual questions with curiosity and passion, drawing on knowledge from peoples and cultures across time and space.  the breadth of anthropology’s vision of what it means to be human, and the commitment to holistically, empirically, and ethically grounded approaches to understanding human experience are at the core of our mission in the university. anthropology department commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusionland acknowledgementemory university acknowledges the muscogee (creek) people who lived, worked, produced knowledge on, and nurtured the land where emory’s oxford and atlanta campuses are now located. in 1821, fifteen years before emory’s founding, the muscogee were forced to relinquish this land. we recognize the sustained oppression, land dispossession, and involuntary removals of the muscogee and cherokee peoples from georgia and the southeast. emory seeks to honor the muscogee nation and other indigenous caretakers of this land by humbly seeking knowledge of their histories and committing to respectful stewardship of the land.land acknowledgement statementslide 1: ${_escapetool.xml( $slidetitle

anthropology -- archaeology, biological anthropology, and sociocultural anthropology. these are not conceptualized as semi-autonomous units, but they serve as the basis for generating intellectual synergies that cut across the three subdisciplines. our research concentrations are an expression of these synergies, bringing together faculty research interests from the subdisciplines and catalyzing exciting collaborations within the department -- and beyond.declare a major!anthropology minorsseveral programs and departments offer majors and minors in fields which complement the anthropology major. for example, anthropology majors often choose to double major or minor in african studies, women's studies, human health, biology, psychology, linguistics, religion, etc. current faculty research concentrations:• race, inequality, and social justice • evolution, environment, and cognition • health, development, and sustainability • technologies, ethics, and worldmakingdelcare a minor!graduate programanthropology, by its very nature, is an interdisciplinary enterprise and is sought out by many other disciplines for cross-fertilization of ideas. the anthropology graduate program at emory encompasses three subdisciplines: archaeology, biological anthropology, and cultural anthropology, placing special emphasis on cultivating dialogues and combinations of people, interests, and ideas. the program balances rigorous courses with a tutorial approach to advanced subjects and is designed to be intense and demanding for both students and faculty.learn how to
