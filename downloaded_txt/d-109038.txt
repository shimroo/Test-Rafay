linda cuff, presidentwoodruff medical training & testing 


they've done many websites before and know all the little tricks to deliver a better product.
creating an e-commerce website is a huge undertaking. the personal connection, attention to detail and the final product that was given to me by art wave was fabulous. i do not think it would be possible to get a better product from anyone else.
