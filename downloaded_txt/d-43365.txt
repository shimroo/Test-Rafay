in and effort to reduce the spam on the site, several years ago i had went to a program where i manually approve each and every new registration. this approval gives you full access to the site, to pictures, and to post, among other things.  

 to be able to enjoy the full potential of the board for you, you need to be fully registered.. and that's easy.. 

  just send an email to me at jim@trishieldperformance.com and i will verify your registration.

 this policy will remain in effect indefinitely, as it has completely eliminated the bad actors from our site, who would spam and hack it, once they gained access.

 thanks
