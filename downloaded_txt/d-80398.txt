we are your specialists in real liquid metal coatings
makeitmetal uses liquid metal coatings on a variety of surfaces to create the look, texture, and feel, of real metal. metal coatings not only allow for unlimited design capabilities, it is much more cost effective and environmentally responsible than using traditional sheet metal, metal laminates, plating, or casting. you can use our metal coating on both interior and exterior surfaces to give you a luxurious metal finish.
we distribute our product to manufacturing and finishing companies to apply in-house. training and education is provided in our fully equipped manufacturing and training facility. makeitmetal loves working with the imagination of its customers to create a wide array of metal finishes.
