new online tool aids literacy programs.





this post comes from eschoolnews. schools, libraries, and other organizations that aim to improve students' reading skills have a new online tool to help them evaluate how well their literacy programs work: the verizon literacy program self-assessment tool (vlp-sat).  developed by the national center for family literacy (ncfl) with funding from the verizon foundation, vlp-sat is available free of charge to all literacy programs from one location, the verizon foundation's thinkfinity.org.  "thousands of people give their time and effort daily to advance the cause of literacy, but unfortunately, despite those great efforts, literacy rates in our country are still not where they need to be," said sharon darling, president and founder of ncfl.  "we believe this self-assessment tool can play a tremendous role in improving literacy rates," darling said. "it provides a roadmap with more scope and depth than any other tool currently available."  this "roadmap" incorporates the latest scientific research on the effectiveness of literacy programs that serve populations from birth through childhood, its makers say. the online tool provides a detailed questionnaire that asks about a literacy program's methods, the education level of its students, parental involvement, and current methods used to assess the program's success.  based on answers to the questionnaire, the literacy provider is given a grade of 1 to 5 in each of several areas. these grades describe whether the organization is using proven, research-based methods and achieving the best possible results.  for schools and other organizations that receive a score of "3" or lower in any particular area, the tool provides a list of recommended resources created by literacy and education experts. all of these resources are available free of charge at tghinkfinity.org as part of the thinkfinity literacy network.  thinkfinity.org is the verizon foundation's free online portal, where visitors can access more than 55,000 standards- and research-based educational resources. these include free online courses, k-12 lesson plans, best practices, program assessment tools, teaching and learning tools, model programs that demystify technology for parents, and abundant research highlighting the importance of literacy development.  ideally, program staff will use the vlp-sat as a benchmark to evaluate current literacy practices, seek out resources to improve key areas, and return to the vlp-sat to assess program improvement, its creators say.  the tool was unveiled last month as part of the verizon foundation's national literacy summit.3, held at georgetown university.  "we asked ourselves at the last summit where our philanthropy dollars should go, and we answered: to help leverage each other's assets and skills and to start some sort of measurement ... here are some measurements!" said kathy brown, senior vice president of public policy and corporate responsibility for verizon. click here to read the rest of this post.

fail-proof tips for adults back at school.





this article is from jobs.aol.com.full-time job, family, and friends -- these commitments are challenging enough to juggle without the added education factor. how can you make the school reentry process as seamless as possible? check out these study tips, college support services, and insider strategies to get you started on your own personal back-to-school transition.the art of time management stephen gatlin, president and ceo of gatlin education services, which provides online workforce development programs to colleges, considers time management the biggest factor in back-to-school success. he recommends that students determine when they focus best, such as in the morning or at night, before caffeine or after. then, gatlin says, "reserve time to dedicate to your course. stay committed and treat [that time] like an appointment that can't be budged."frank hilty, a mining engineer, has experienced the back-to-school adjustment twice. he returned to college to complete his bachelor's degree 12 years after starting, and now, eight years after earning that degree, he's pursuing an mba at waynesburg college. hilty, who blocks out two to three hours of study time for every hour of in-class time, advises, "if you are working, you must treat class work as a part-time job with specific responsibilities. do not procrastinate. even if you only take one course at a time, you will find yourself quickly overwhelmed if you let the work pile up. our regular jobs and families have a way, and they should, of commanding our attention."jason yaple, a geologist who has been taking courses at penn state and west chester university of pennsylvania to earn a professional geology certification, echoes these sentiments. "figure out the amount of time you will need to study and perform the coursework. then be prepared to invest even more time." click here to read the rest of this article.

for the health-care work force, a critical prognosis.





 this article comes from the chronicle of higher education.this the united states faces a looming shortage of many types of health-care        professionals, including nurses, physicians, dentists, pharmacists, and        allied-health and public-health workers. the results will be felt acutely        within the next 10 years. colleges and health-science programs will all be        affected by the demographic, technological, and bureaucratic trends        driving the pending crisis. but they can also be part of the solution. the growth of the american population and the aging of the baby-boomer        generation will continue to increase the demand for health-care services        and providers. more than 100 million people in america already have        chronic illnesses or suffer from degenerative conditions such as cancer,        cardiovascular disease, and arthritis, which require long-term management        by different kinds of health-care providers — and that number will        only get larger with time. it is estimated that over the next decade we        will need at least 20,000 more physicians specifically trained to care for        elderly patients. fewer than 8,000 geriatricians are in practice today.        the federal bureau of labor statistics also projects that, during that        same time period, we will need 3.5 million more workers to meet the        increasing demand, in addition to replacements for the two million        health-care workers who will leave their positions. on top of that, advances in fields like genetics and information        technology will create additional work-force requirements that we can't        even begin to estimate. we will need more and different kinds of        practitioners and technicians, be they robotic-surgery operators or new        types of radiology technologists. but given the current number of people        entering the health-care work force, it will be virtually impossible to        meet those projections. after september 11, 2001, there was a slight uptick in applications and        enrollments at many health-professions schools, following a period of        decline during the 1990s. this fall the nation's medical schools        experienced a 2.3-percent increase in enrollment and an 8.2-percent        increase in applications, the association of american medical colleges        reports. that is heartening news, but there have not been changes of the        magnitude needed to make a difference in our health work force. different expectations and lifestyle preferences on the part of today's        health-care workers are partly to blame. thirty years ago, in what was        more of a manufacturing economy, young people saw health care as high        tech. in today's information age, it is now viewed as more low tech. the        messiness and stress of caring for people with complex illnesses may not        be attractive to young people who have many career options. the hurdles to        degrees in the health professions — including extensive math and        science course work, expensive education, daunting debts, and lengthy        training — are also likely deterrents. other potential problems are related to generational change. the future        health-care work force will come largely from generations x and y, both        smaller demographic groups than the baby boomers. compared with the        boomers, who placed a high priority on careers and had a greater tendency        to stay with one career for a lifetime, xers and yers appear more        interested in work that can accommodate their families and personal lives.        they often seek flexibility, telecommuting, family leave, and part-time        options — almost none of which can be met by the demands of a career        in the health-care professions. even if the same proportion of individuals        was recruited into health-care careers from the two younger generations as        from the boomers, however, we would still not have enough people to        replace those who will soon retire, let alone expand our capacity. more bad news: our country faces worsening shortages of faculty members        in the health sciences. in july the association of academic health centers        released a report that said 94 percent of ceos at academic-health centers        deemed faculty shortages a problem in at least one health-professions        school; 69 percent thought those shortages were a problem for their entire        institutions. several factors account for the widespread faculty shortages, including        a low level of interest in academic careers among those entering the        health-care professions, heavy faculty workloads, disparities in salaries        between academe and private practice or industry, and retirements among        baby boomers. in colleges of nursing, for example, where master's or doctoral degrees        are required, the mean age of faculty members with master's degrees in        nursing is 48.5. retirement projections for nursing-faculty members show        that from 2004 to 2012, 200 to 300 ph.d.'s will be eligible for retirement        each year. we do not have enough nursing educators in the pipeline to stem        such losses. the situation is similar in pharmacy programs. of the nation's 82        schools of pharmacy, 67 reported in a survey that they had an average of        6.2 vacant faculty positions last year. thirty percent of the open        academic positions had been vacant for at least a year. most important, 92        percent of those vacancies represented teaching positions that directly        affect the number of pharmacy students a school can enroll. in radiology, a specialty that suffers one of the worst shortages in        the health field, the average age of full-time professors is 54. it is        anticipated that within the next couple of years, 27 percent of full-time        and 80 percent of part-time positions will be vacant, in large part        because of retirements — a trend not dissimilar to those in other        health-care professions. the shortages in radiology are compounded,        however, by an escalating reliance on (and consumer demand for)        medical-imaging procedures and a decreasing number of programs for        training those health professionals. the final crucial factor precipitating the health-care-work-force        crisis is a lack of comprehensive work-force planning on the parts of        academe, government, and the health-care professions. we need strategic        direction instead of the current piecemeal approach at the national and        state levels; both federal and state policy making has tended to respond        to immediate crises or issues related to one particular profession or        constituency. commissions and task forces abound, yet many reports gather        dust on shelves; the infrastructure for putting good ideas or new policies        into effect is at best uneven. shortages in the health-care work force are not local or isolated        issues. they require attention at the highest levels of the federal and        state governments. college leaders should work together with government        officials to make that a top priority on the domestic-policy agenda. some states — with the help of their university systems —        have looked across the professions to confront health-care-worker        shortages. in 2005 the university system of georgia appointed a task force        on health-professions education to analyze future needs and inform        decision making in response to the needs of the state. in its final        report, the task force on health professions education cited projected        faculty retirements, smaller pools of potential faculty members,        inadequate facilities to support expanded enrollments, and a limited        number of clinical sites to support the clinical-education needs of        students enrolled in the state's health-professions programs as barriers        to an effective and coordinated response to market demand. programmatic        integration also was identified as a confounding issue: the report        identified a crucial need for the university system to work closely with        the state's technical-college system, the primary educator of health-care        technicians and paraprofessionals, to ensure transparency and clarity in        educational requirements so that students are able to move successfully        between the educational systems. such collaborations between colleges and states are a good beginning.        but higher education and the government must become partners on the        federal level as well. the institutions that educate the nation's future        health-care professionals must work together to devise innovative        solutions to the myriad challenges we face — and must finance them,        too. the federal government should enlist the leaders of academic health        centers nationwide as key advisers to tackle the challenges confronting        the health-care work force, thus reinvigorating a longstand-ing        partnership to support education in the health professions and ensure        quality care to the public for the future. the creation of a national commission on the health-care work force        would also be a boon. such a commission, renewable every 10 years, would        serve as the chief advising body to congress and the president on the        subject. while it would have no regulatory power, it would be the        independent expert panel to identify issues, analyze policy affecting the        health-care work force, examine the benefits and risks of health-care        legislation, evaluate the education and research functions of academic        health centers and other educational institutions, and recommend ways to        resolve problems as well as to plan proactively. the commission would        provide a forum for interaction at the national level for groups        representing health educators, biomedical scientists, and health-care        providers. colleges and health-sciences centers must also deal with the work-force        shortage issue at their own institutions. they should address the growing        shortages of health-professions faculty members by supporting        faculty-development programs and expanding accelerated training programs.        continuing education is a key strategy in retaining health-professions        faculty members, as are mentorship programs — particularly for        retaining junior members of the professoriate and those groups that have        been historically underrepresented in the health-care professions. offering loan-repayment and loan-forgiveness programs would also be a        draw. the high incidence of debt among graduates often drives health-care        professionals to the most lucrative employment settings. forgiving debt or        offering generous loan-repayment plans creates more flexibility for        colleges and universities in efforts to attract professionals to academic        careers. and to augment their core faculty members with nonsalaried,        community-based clinicians who can provide valuable field-based clinical        experiences, as health-professions programs must do, institutions can        offer enticements like discounted or free registration in the        continuing-education programs, tuition discounts or waivers, and access to        other institutional resources (recreational facilities, for instance). colleges and health-science centers must also focus on increasing and        improving the applicant pool, not simply in terms of sheer numbers and mix        of health professions, but also with regard to diversity. alarming disparities in health status continue to plague our nation. a        health-care work force that mirrors the population it serves is widely        believed to increase access to care and improve quality of care;        therefore, increasing the recruitment of individuals from diverse        backgrounds to the health professions is crucial in light of the        increasing diversity of the american population. colleges and        health-science centers must focus on untapped populations, such as        underrepresented minorities and health professionals trained abroad.        accelerated training programs could be offered to ensure that the clinical        and language skills of such health-care providers are at acceptable        levels. in areas with rapidly growing hispanic populations, bilingual        students could be targeted as medical interpreters, providing invaluable        exposure to the health-care system — and increasing the likelihood        that they will pursue careers in the health professions. the health-care shortage we face in the united states is serious. some        experts may argue that there is no cause for alarm, because work-force        shortages are cyclical, market-driven, and easily ameliorated. but that        perspective is not valid today. the work-force shortfall in health care        cannot be resolved in the marketplace alone. it is time for organized        action, not only within colleges, but also at our nation's highest        levels. daniel w. rahn is president of the medical college of georgia and        senior vice chancellor for health and medical programs at the university        system of georgia. steven a. wartman is president and ceo of the        association of academic health centers.

classroom of the future is virtually anywhere.





this article comes from the new york times. the university classroom of the future is in janet duck’s dining room on east chocolate avenue here. there is no blackboard and no lectern, and, most glaringly, no students. dr. duck teaches her classes in pennsylvania state university’s master’s program in business administration by sitting for several hours each day in jeans and shag-lined slippers at her dining table, which in soccer mom fashion is cluttered with crayon sketches by her 6-year-old elijah and shoulder pads for her 9-year-old olivia’s halloween costume. in this homespun setting, the spirited dr. duck pecks at a toshiba laptop and posts lesson content, readings and questions for her two courses on “managing human resources” that touch on topics like performance evaluations and recruitment. the instructional software allows her 54 students to log on from almost anywhere at any time and post remarkably extended responses, the equivalent of a blog about the course. recently, the class exchanged hard-earned experiences about how managers deal with lackluster workers. those students, mostly 30-ish middle managers and professionals trying to enhance their skills, cannot be with her in a penn state classroom at a set time. one woman is an air force pilot flying missions over afghanistan; other global travelers filed comments last week from tokyo, athens, são paulo and copenhagen. dr. duck cannot regularly be at penn state, largely because of her three children. yet she and other instructors will help the students acquire standard m.b.a.’s next august at a total cost of $52,000, with each side having barely stepped into a traditional classroom. to read the rest of this article click here.

libraries shun deals to place books on web.





this post is from the new york times. several major research libraries have rebuffed offers from google and microsoft to scan their books into computer databases, saying they are put off by restrictions these companies want to place on the new digital collections.the research libraries, including a large consortium in the boston area, are instead signing on with the open content alliance, a nonprofit effort aimed at making their materials broadly available.libraries that agree to work with google must agree to a set of terms, which include making the material unavailable to other commercial search services. microsoft places a similar restriction on the books it converts to electronic form. the open content alliance, by contrast, is making the material available to any search service. click here to read the rest of this article.
