faith in our lifeit is with deep sorrow that we share the unexpected passing of faith chalula mufaya on november 20, 2022, at 14 years old. born on september 27, 2008, faith brought joy and love as a cherished daughter and sister.faith’s infectious smile and passion for teaching defined her early years. despite facing challenges, including vitiligo, she remained resilient, finding solace in singing and helping her mother sell fritters. faith’s maturity beyond her years endeared her to adults, yet she valued the friendships she cultivated.faith’s passing leaves an irreplaceable void. her sweet nature, boundless love, and infectious joy will be deeply missed. our thoughts are with her family as they navigate this profound loss.may faith chalula mufaya’s soul rest in eternal peace.

stories of vitiligo 










						gabby's vitiligo story					
i know i am awesome.  vitiligo changed the color of my skin but it has not changed the person that i am.  i have not and will not allow vitiligo to stop me from doing anything...       


 








						michaela’s story					
i was born in sierra leone, west africa at the height of a decade-long civil war there. in addition to loosing both of my parents in that war, i had vitiligo. among the villagers of my country, vitiligo is considered a curse of the devil. i was considered to be the devil’s child, and people either ridiculed me, shunned me or beat me...
