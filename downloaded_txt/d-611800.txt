product spotlight






 

radeaglet-r rugged, lightweight, handheld radioisotope identification device
ortec’s radeaglet-r™ lightweight, handheld radiation detector provides the speed and reliability to identify potentially hazardous radiation sources quickly  and accurately.



 
tetrad n-type high purity germanium (hpge) detector for nuclear physics applications
            the ortec tetrad detector design delivers maximum absolute efficiency in a limited geometrical space for a wide range of energies (20 kev up to 10 mev). 


 
angle version 5 advanced gamma spectroscopy efficiency calibration
            angle is an advanced efficiency calculation application for high purity germanium and sodium iodide detectors based on the concept of efficiency transfer. 


 
grace gamma ray analysis of chemical elements
            grace is a man-portable system that analyzes and provides on-site identification information about the chemical contents inside munitions or other unopened containers without the need to penetrate the container to take a physical sample.



detective-x-ts high resolution gamma spectrometer for in-situ measurements
            can be used as a stand-alone instrument to collect spectra in the field or controlled by a computer connected via usb, ethernet, or wi-fi using applications such as maestro-pro (included), gammavision, isotopic, and others.
            

trans-spec app for detective-x provides the mca emulation functions necessary to use the instrument as a standard spectrometer system.
