i highly recommend cruzin hawaii. my wife and i rented mopeds earlier this week. everything went well. nice, friendly, and helpful employees (especially ty) and nice mopeds. the throttle on my moped was adjusted so that the start was very gradual so i didn’t need to worry about the moped jumping out from under me. we will rent here again, maybe e-bikes next time.








alex hope
loved our experience. the staff were super knowledgeable, as walk ins we had quite a few questions and we wanted to sit on some bikes. booked a couple motorcycles for the next morning. they were super flexible, and we even extended during our ride, from the beautiful sandy beach. conner, and kaitlin helped us have one of the best days ever. suited us up with some gear and provided us routes and everything. thank you guys!








matt zeitz
i’ve rented motorcycles from these guys 4 or 5 times, always a great selection of rentals, from motorcycles and scooters, down to beach gear. pricing is reasonable and the staff has always been super friendly. another great experience, look forward to the next one!
