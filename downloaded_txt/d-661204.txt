identifying your needs

 

swimtime® filters

 

proper selection of a filter is dependent upon several varying factors such as pool size, attendance, and state and local health codes governing turnover and maximum design flow rate. the type of filter selected can vary from the older, slower (3 gpm/ft2) filters up to the modern high rate systems (15-20 gpm/ft2). high-rate systems can be fully automated for unattended operation. tanks can be constructed for mild carbon steel or stainless steel.

 

swimtime® pumps

 

pumps are quoted separately and are tailored for each job requirement based on the following specifications:gpm at total head dynamic (tdh), voltage, phase, and cycle.whether it is close-coupled or base mounted with flexible coupling.if the pump is self-priming or in flooded suction.if the pump is equipped with a hair and lint strainer or not.
