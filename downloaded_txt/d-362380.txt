what’s the difference between a silver colloid and ionic silver? what’s a mild silver protein, and what does it have to do with colloidal silver? you might even have wondered if it was a myth that ionic silver or mild silver protein products could turn you blue. products  the effectiveness of a colloid is predicated on particle surface area, therefore particle surface area is the single most important metric for comparing colloidal products.      view colloidal silver reports   mesosilver®mesosilver is an all natural mineral supplement in the form of nanoparticle colloidal silver. it is a true colloidal silver, which means the majority of mesosilver consists of silver particles, not silver ions. learn more. in fact, it has the highest nanoparticle concentration: 80% particles (typical). others are only 10%.    view product   utopia silveradvanced colloidal silver is a mineral supplement used to boost and augment the body’s immune system. it is a silver mineral suspension produced at about 30 ppm using .9999 pure silver in de-ionized water sourced from deep water wells in the edwards and trinity aquifer recharge zones..   view product  need help?frequently asked questions  colloidal silver faqs     why is “particle surface area” important?particle surface area is what determines a colloids ability to react with its environment. reactivity increases with increasing surface area. particle surface area can be determined by measuring the physical properties of a colloid. because it is comprised of two important physical properties, namely, particle size and particle concentration, it serves as good metric for comparing colloids.since it can be expressed as a single number, particle surface area can be considered a figure of merit for the effectiveness of a colloid. in this context, effectiveness is defined as the ability of the colloid to react with its environment. the higher the surface area, the more reactive the colloid, hence the more effective it is in reacting with its environment. for a comparison of commercial products based on particle surface area see the comparison table.     are machines available that can make ‘true colloids’ at home?no. all silver colloids generators on the market produce ionic silver. there is no equipment for sale by any manufacturer that will produce ‘true colloidal silver’ consisting of mostly silver nanoparticles.if you buy a colloidal silver product, how will you know it’s the right one?
