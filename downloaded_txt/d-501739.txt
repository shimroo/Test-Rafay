so i love off the wall unique spots. i seek them out all over the world. this is above average for them. i was expecting a small ode to saying goodbye and was pleasantly surprised not only with the size but the quality or presentation and the detailed explanations of each display. i bet i took 200 photos. gift shop in tow but lacked stickers for my personal remembrance. got a patch instead! also found a couple local dark art pieces so a win! highly recommend a visit.

while not knowing what to expect, we were thoroughly amazed. thinking to spend 1/2 to 1 hour before lunch, we spent 2+ hours here. thinking it would be a dark and solemn, it was anything but. there is a history on embalming and cremation exhibit. an excellent display of vehicles used for funerals. items from presidential and famous people. i'm not going to say anymore, don't want to spoil it. at $10 fee, the best money i spent in texas!

this was the most interesting and informative place i have been in the last few months!  staff are super friendly, tons of amazing exhibits and classic cars to look at and a really cool gift shop with so many terrific items! my 8 yr old loved it too!  will definitely go back!

by far one of the best museums ever visited. there was no stone left unturned. great information. it would have been nice if there were some self guided audio to go along with the the different exhibits. it would have been nice to see some exhibits organize by time-line of where funerals started to where they are today. overall an excellent museum that everyone should see.

awesome museum near houston, one of the more unique and content-rich ones around here. not a large place but has a lot of artifacts, weird facts and interesting history around the culture of funeral. nicely organized and separated into various sections. i'd recommend spending about three hours here, i went for a bit less than two hours and definitely did not have enough time to browse through everything this place had to offer.

one of the most amazing date i've been on with my partner! we spent 4 hours in there and still missed just a little bit. they have everything from presley to popes, coffins to carriages, day of the dead to ancient egyptians. if you decide to take this wonderful adventure, plan to spend some time! everything here is beyond interesting and very educational in a fun way.

innovator , business man and the king of chocolate


				by bob boetticher sr. chairman, national museum of funeral history			




requested a simple funeral.










have you ever had a craving for chocolate? to satisfy your sweet tooth, did you buy a candy bar, with or without almonds, wrapped in brown paper with silver print? if so, you owe that spectacular sugar rush to confectioner and brilliant businessman milton s, hershey.
milton snavely hershey was born sept. 13, 1857, in a mennonite community. his limited formal education came to an end in 1871 when he left the fourth grade to work for a printer. he eventually lost his job but became an apprentice to a confectioner and developed an interest in candy making. before long, he was selling caramel candies from a cart for 5 cents each.
hershey‚Äôs lancaster caramel company, launched in 1883, was the first to manufacture caramel using fresh milk. he later sold the company for $1 million, bought back his family homestead land and built an experimental chocolate factory that became the hershey chocolate company and created thousands of jobs. the first hershey‚Äôs candy bar was produced in 1900, followed by hershey‚Äôs kisses in 1907.
