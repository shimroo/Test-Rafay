we are a matthew 25 church

we are committed to three focuses:

dismantling structural racism by advocating and acting to break down the systems, practices and thinking that underlie discrimination, bias, prejudice and oppression of people of color.
eradicating systemic poverty by working to change laws, policies, plans and structures in our society that perpetuate economic exploitation of people who are poor.

from the stated clerk: a prayer for fire-ravaged southern california

january 10, 2025
god, our refuge and our strength, you are an ever-present help in trouble.
 you see the devastation caused by the california wildfires. you hear the cries of those suffering loss. you know the fear and anxiety and exhaustion of those waiting, hoping, helping as they watch the fires burn.
for those forced to abandon their homes and shelters in search of safety, we pray for your guidance to find places of rest. for those called to fight the fires, we pray for your strength to persevere. for those ministering to the injured, we pray for your wisdom and guidance to heal. for those mourning loss, we pray for your comfort. for those accompanying others, near or far, we pray for your upholding. for those still in dangerâs path, we pray for your protection.
now and in the days and weeks to come, we trust that you are present. you have promised that even in the darkest of valleys, you will never leave nor forsake your children.
god, our refuge and our strength, you are an ever-present help in trouble.
as your incarnate presence brought hope to those in need, may the church, your body, be the presence of help and hope in los angeles county and beyond; in the name of christ jesus. amen.
