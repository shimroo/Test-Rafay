types of antiques sought & 
			sold
we primarily buy, 
			sell, and deal in patented, mechanical, and vintage technology 
			related
		
			
antiques and collectibles spanning the era from the mid-to early 1800's and the 
			beginnings of the industrial revolution to just after the 
			turn-of-the 20th century. we specialize in antique tools and many specific sub categories. general or country store related antiques as 
			well as related advertising are sought as well.
			
we actively 
			seek antique sewing machines,  (pre-1870) american 
			patent models, and vintage salesman samples 
			as well. antique surveying instruments, antique woodworking tools, 
			office related antiques and many other types of patented and / or mechanical antiques, related 
			advertising, country / general store antiques, and more from this era, are of special 
			interest, and what we specialize in.
			 


our interests include 
			antique pressing irons & sadirons, early patented eggbeaters, 
			churns, and other kitchen related gadgets and antiques, 
			mechanical and patented apple parers, cast iron coffee mills / 
			grinders, and other kitchen related antiques.
			
			
			
			we are also interested in, and 
			buy and sell antique office equipment, antique medical instruments, 
			and related antique scientific equipment, including early electric 
			fans and antique electric bi-polar or open frame motors, antique typewriters, mechanical pencil 
			sharpeners, early telephones and telegraphy devices etc. antique toys, 
			vintage sporting goods are sought as well. many other 
			occupational and technological antiques from the home, workshop, 
			store, farm,
			
			or office are sought as well.
			
		
			we also deal in and seek antique figural cast iron pieces like 
			antique lawn sprinklers, early corkscrews, unusual calculating 
			devices, slide rules, plus related ephemera, catalogs and advertising related to 
			all of the above mentioned categories. 
			
			
			
			
			unlike what is offered at the current crop of 
			most antique shows and in most "antique" malls or shops these days, where the new definition of 
			20 years old is now deemed to be an antique, we still hold to the definition of an antique 
			as being something close to 100 years old or more. newer 
			things might be collectible, or popular and saleable, but pieces from 1990 or even the 70's 
			and 80's typically do not fit into our sales categories or realm of interest.
			
			for a good overview and specific information on the different 
			categories of antiques, vintage technology, scientific related 
			antiques, antique advertising and collectibles we are interested in 
			click any of the headings in the left column. to see many past 
			sales results click the links in the right 
			column.
