               and the 78th blessing of the fleet in provincetown. you can expect all the music, dancing, and 
               incredible food that make the festival legendaryâplus some exciting new surprises.
              
as always, weâll honor our proud portuguese heritage and fishing traditions, culminating in the 
               fishermenâs mass and blessing of the fleet. itâs a weekend rich in culture, community and 
               celebration with a full schedule of activities that has something for everyone. weâll post the full 
               schedule here when the details are set!

               painting featured on this years commemorative shirts. his internationally recognized work has 
               been featured in major art magazines, showcased in solo exhibitions, and celebrated by 
               organizations like the oil painters of america. the festival is honored to have him.
