  learn more about
seminole electric in 1935, president franklin d. roosevelt created the rural electrification administration (rea) by executive order to bring electricity to rural communities through the formation of electric cooperatives. in 1937, the rea drafted the electric cooperative corporation act, a law permitting states to create and operate not-for-profit, member-owned distribution electric cooperatives. the same year, florida’s first distribution electric cooperatives were formed.
