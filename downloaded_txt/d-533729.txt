let's do everything for the first time forever...
adventures with ann, jeff, pigeon, and 8 two year-olds.





(no subject)lepetitpigeonjanuary 8th, 2009because it's been a few years and i'm just now realizing i never said it...my entries are all locked.  you have to be careful when your journal is mostly telling stories about other people's kids.  mind you, i am mostly gushing over how unbelievably cute they are, but hey, i'd rather play it safe.drop me a comment if you'd like to obtain a pass into toddlerland.

(no subject)lepetitpigeonmarch 30th, 2008a few hours early, but i don't give a damn...jumping for joy one year ago.and it only got better and better from there.  happy anniversary, hunbun.  nothing i can say here could ever do this past year justice.  so i will leave it at this:  thank you, i love you, and please start rinsing the milk out of the bottom of your cereal bowl.
