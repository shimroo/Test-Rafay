about the dead sea

one of the natural wonders of the world is the dead sea in israel, which is 1200 feet below sea level. over millions of years, the hot dry air and high evaporation rate have contributed to the high salt concentration present in the dead sea, making it one of the saltiest lakes in the world. compared to the 3% sea salt content of ordinary sea water, researchers claim that the dead sea water contains 32% sea salts with relatively high concentration of 21 minerals such as magnesium, calcium, bromide and potassium. twelve of these dead sea minerals are found in no other sea or ocean, making the dead sea, and products made with minerals from the dead sea not only extroaordinary, but wonderful for your beautiful skin and healthy skin care treatments. dead sea spa care skincare products not only feel great and smell great, but are wonderful for your skin. treat yourself or a loved one with a gift for a home spa treatment. our facial products will cleans and moisturize your skin, our salt scrubs will exfoliate and soften your skin, our lotions and shea body butters will leave your skin feeling silky smooth and moisturized. our top selling item, our patented, professional nail buffer will help bring out the natural shine in the nails looking as if you just stepped out from getting a manicure and pedicure in just seconds.


why have people been drawn to the minerals of this region, minerals from the dead sea for hundreds of years? minerals are essential for the metabolism of the skin. with age, the level of minerals in the body is depleted. researchers have found that the body no longer produces minerals on its own, and must draw from an external source of supply. minerals provide protection and strengthen cell membranes against dehydration and environmental hazards. medical studies have shown that dead sea minerals are effective in treating psoriasis, acne, rheumatism and eczema. dead sea minerals are known to cure skin disorders through strengthening the skin tissues, maintaining the chemical balance of the skin, stimulating blood circulation and eliminating toxins from the skin. for example, the concentration of magnesium found in the dead sea is reported to be about fifteen times higher than salts in any other sea. as we mentioned above, magnesium is essential for cell metabolism. a significant deficit of magnesium has been discovered in serum and skin scales of patients with psoriasis. millions of people have traveled to the dead sea to relax and enjoy its beauty, but more importantly to experience the healing, beautifying and rejuvenating powers of its waters. due to the high concentration of salt and mineral content in the dead sea, no plant or animal life can survive. there is no outlet for the water except for evaporation, so the salt and minerals left behind collect on the shores and the bottom of the dead sea. these mineral-rich salts and other sediments left behind are extremely beneficial to the body. with the dead sea spa care products, you can have the benefits of most amazing natural spa, the dead sea, from the comfort of your own home. minerals such as magnesium, bromine, potassium, calcium, sodium, zinc,   sulfur, iodine, strontium, boron, and iron have been scientifically   proven to contribute measurably to feeling and looking your best. minerals are essential for the metabolism of the skin. with age, the level of minerals in the body is depleted. researchers have found that the body no longer produces minerals on its own, and must draw from an external source of supply. minerals provide protection and strengthen cell membranes against dehydration and environmental hazards. you will benefit from these amazing minerals from the comfort of your own home with the dead sea spa care product line.
