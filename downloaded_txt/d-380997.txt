“i have had the fortunate opportunity to be a trustee of the atheneum for the last 9 years, how lucky am i? when i drive into town every morning, i always marvel at how majestic our beautiful building is in the center of town, watching over the comings and goings of so many residents and visitors.
i love the atheneum because it represents all the good nantucket has to offer. it doesn’t matter who you are, where you come from, or how you arrived, the atheneum is a place for all to either access the world through the internet, take a load off your feet and read a periodical or come expand your mind with the numerous creative programs taking place. basically, it’s my favorite place to be!”
