people talking about one day cruise 

								i would like to start out by telling you why i gave it a three star rating.
1. some days the seas are very rocking and that does not feel good.
2. some days they don't have enough vip sandwiches on the ship and when i pay for the vip i don't want muffins instead of sandwiches. 

ok, got that off my chest. now the things i like are many starting with the staff on the ship. they always try to help you as much as they can to make you feel comfortable. great prices in the duty free shop for liquor and smokes. also the ride to freeport grand bahamas is quick, which lets me spend more time on that great island.  - brain storm
