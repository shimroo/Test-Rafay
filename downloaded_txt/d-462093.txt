the safety, well-being and educational success of every student enrolled in the muscogee county school district remains our top priority. in light of recent changes in federal immigration policy, the district wants to reiterate its stance surrounding access to students during the school day and records and the rights of students to attend school.  
the muscogee county school district, in keeping with current law and its board policies, does not inquire about the immigration status of its students or their family members.  the district supports the legal right of all children, regardless of immigration status, to access a public education, and is focused on the provision of educational services. 
the family educational rights and privacy act (ferpa) protects the privacy of student records, and the district will limit access to student records in keeping with that law.  the district controls access to the non-public areas of its buildings,  and will continue to follow school safety protocols as well as relevant laws that limit access to students while at school. the district will follow relevant laws as well as its internal protocols related to communication with outside agencies.  the district will also consult with counsel and continue to monitor changes and adhere to federal policies, while remaining focused on its educational mission to inspire and equip all students to achieve unlimited potential.
