portland, oregon artist bonnie meltzer expresses complex and timely social issues through crocheted, fabric & found object sculptures with both humor and beauty. until the 2016 her work mostly reflected environmental subjects, but with the current fraying of our social fabric she felt compelled to add social justice themes.
