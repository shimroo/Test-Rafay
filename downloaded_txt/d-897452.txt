blackcat europe, holland
 4 1/2 stars out of 5
jungle records, finland
  "one of the best, if not the best, rockabilly band of today."  anchormans stray cat site, holland "a must for all rockabilly fans" rockin' fifties magazine, germany"today's best neo rockabilly band."  
      with 12 page full color booklet! tons of pictures, info and 
      the story behind behind the music! 
sillybilly website, germany
"vince pulls out some leads that would even make old setzer himself a little green with envy."
planet rockabilly, usa 
"sweeping aside the trend of primitive recording techniques within rockin' music, the jime perform well crafted, well produced neo-rockabilly inspired by the likes of the early stray cats output and the later recordings by the bluecats. maintaining all of rockabilly's most appealing aspects (catchy guitar riffs, pumping slap bass), the jime present their excellent third album!"
raucous records, uk 
"high class musiciansship, music for all lovers of modern rockabilly, great production, rocks a lot." guido 'bronx' buchter bronx'n'roll, switzerland 
"the jime are the new kings on the block!"
rockabilly revue, usa

rockabilly music cd: "mean side of town"

"modern rockabilly with a production you'd normally only expect from the stray cats."  the blackcat website, holland
"the music sounds so good, that you will not change the cd for weeks." 
rollin' danny, rockachicka.com. germany 
"a masterpiece of good modern neobilly, get that cd now!" guido 'bronx' buchter bronx'n'roll, switzerland 
    with 8 page full color booklet! with pictures, info and 
    the story behind the music! 
"the opening track of this cd 'gotto be' blew me right away. it has a great sound and is such a catchy song. the last time a song hit me like that was probably the first time i heard 'runaway boys' by the stray cats. this band appear to be danish and they're fantastic."   alan wilson, deathrow magazine, uk
"....with idioticly good guitar playing. how some rockabilly bands can keep on cloning the music, is incomprehensible when you hear the jime with their own characteristic ideas and sounds."
frans van dongen, boppin' around magazine, holland
  (5 stars out of 5) "the jime picks up where the stray cats left off."
w.j. o'reilly, usa

"'state of the art' neo-rockabilly. this is how production should be! imagine how it was when you heard the first stray cats stuff - that great rockabilly sound with today's 'big' production."
roy williams, managing director of nervous records, uk
