other bits that may be of interest
garfnet has been around for a while – since august 1995, in fact. despite pruning quite a lot of old content, there is still plenty to see here. in addition to the top menu bar, here are a few short-links for most of the older stuff from our joomla days that some people might still like to see. i thought it might make your visit a little easier if i clustered the main ones together here on the home page. so you can bookmark anything you might find interesting…
