latest release
christmas in clover creek
book 3 – the clover creek series
where christmas magic is as timeless as its traditions and second chances are always in season.
after years of chasing success and purpose, cedric clark returns to clover creek feeling lost and uncertain. his once-bright future as an army corps of engineers officer and a rising star in the corporate world has crumbled, leaving him searching for something more. the last place he ever thought he’d find it was the small town he couldn’t wait to leave behind. but with the holiday season in full swing, clover creek’s charm—and one captivating event planner—start to work their magic.
arielle booker always poured her heart into clover creek’s celebrations, but cedric’s return stirs feelings she thought she’d buried. tasked with organizing the town’s holiday festival together, they uncover more than just cherished traditions; they find a spark that never truly faded.
as the town’s festivities bring them closer, cedric must decide if home is a place or a person. and arielle must open her heart to the possibility of love and the risk that he might leave again.
will they find the courage to embrace the love that’s been waiting all along?

yours to keep
a love connection novel
some love is worth waiting for.
for the last three years, gia martinez has kept her heart carefully guarded. living with lupus has taught her that vulnerability can come at a price, and the last thing she wants is to be anyone’s burden. her closest friends, sara and spyder, have always been her support system, and through them, she’s met brian collins—a man who challenges everything she’s tried to protect herself from.
brian, a private investigator with a sharp mind for cyber security, isn’t just another guy in her life. he’s patient, steady, and he’s been there when she needed him most. the problem? brian wants more than friendship, and gia knows it. but letting him in means risking her heart—and her fears of being too much for him to handle.
as valentine’s day draws near and their circle of friends gathers to celebrate sara and spyder’s soon-to-arrive baby, gia finds herself spending more time with brian than ever before. every stolen glance and lingering touch brings them closer to crossing the line between friendship and something much deeper. but as the walls around her heart begin to crack, gia must decide whether she’s brave enough to let love in—or if she’ll keep pushing brian away, even as she yearns for him more than ever.
yours to keep is a heartfelt journey of love, patience, and discovering that sometimes the greatest risk is not taking one at all.
will they find the courage to embrace the love that’s been waiting all along?
