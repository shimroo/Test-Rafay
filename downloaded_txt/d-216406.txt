donate & save a life


















welcome to save the horses











​save the horses is a no-kill shelter!    thank you for your support.​~cheryl flanagan, founder
 
we are the save the horses (horse rescue relief and retirement fund, inc.), a  501(c)(3) non profit that was established in 1998.  our mission is to rescue abused, abandoned, and neglected horses and other animals.save the horses was created to address the urgent need for rescue services and equine public education. ​we have had hundreds of neglect cases over the years. as we don't receive government funds, we rely heavily on the generosity of the public for funds to care for our 100 horses and 30 other animals.  as an all-volunteer organization, we rely these donations and fundraising to care and keep our animals safe and healthy.  your help in the form of donations and volunteering will always be needed.

sponsor poncho
sweet poncho arrived october 12th with a gaping wound from a wire that cut him across the rear.we immediately cleaned the wound and did all we could to make him comfortable. we still have to check to see if there are any further tissue infection.we have not been billed for the 2 vet visits yet. the uga bill is estimated at $1800. after care, and once he is healed from this problem, he needs a dentist and castration.can you help.  even a little as $5 can help towards his care.thank you so very much for your love.
 






what we do: rescue, rehabilitate, love,  & re-home














 
we could not provide our vital services without you. we are dedicated to providing rehabilitation and adoption services for abused, neglected, abandoned and unwanted horses.  caring for these precious souls (we have 100 horses and 30 other animals)  is financially taxing and we are always in need of funding for feed, medical, farrier care, suppliers, services and facility improvements.  save the horses is funded by private donations and fundraisers.  we could not exist nor function without the support of amazing donors and volunteers.monetary donations are always appreciated as well as in-kind gifts of feed and equipment.  tax deductible donations can be made to the horse rescue relief and retirement fund, inc.  for more information, contact us.
 


















how you can help: ​donate, volunteer, adopt, fundraise

help us to help them



​save the horses does not receive any government funding to operate our 110 acre farm that is home to 130 horses and other animals.  we rely on raising money via fundraising events, grants and donations from generous people to pay for feed, hay and much needed medical expenses for our rescued animals.  we have no employees so revenue from donations goes straight to the care of the animals and activities to keep them safe.
