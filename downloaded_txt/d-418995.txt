welcome!  you are at the home front of an important battle!
the american family is under assault.  eternal truths and understandings about family and marriage have given way to modern efforts to deconstruct traditional family values. common sense is discounted as old-fashioned, obsolete, and irrelevant.
from the home front is a syndicated media project focusing on issues impacting families, parents, and children…from the home front.  news, research, and opinion…spiced with attitude…are a part of each column and broadcast that seeks to examine the clash of cultural values that has undermined sexual values and traditional families.

radio:  you can help us promote families!!
