the survivor manual



in the face of trauma like child sexual abuse, rape, domestic violence, sexual assault, and neglect there are many how-to questions - how to heal -  how to fight - how to trust - how to get justice - how to escape - how to end the cycle - how to be a better parent - how to find joy here is a manual on surviving.






the survivor manual goal

the survivor manual idea came to me after personally meeting thousands of survivors and hearing similar questions and concerns.  the goal is to provide answers to the myriad of questions that survivors face as well as ideas, inspiration, information, resources, healing techniques, and recommended reading, watching and doing as well as ways to get involved, news to know, and ways to change the world. contributions are from myself, fellow activists, non-profits organizations, lawyers, professionals, healers, teachers, therapists, and survivor contributors that i know.  my hope is that survivors find the answers they need for whatever part of the path they are on.   take what works for you. love,   angela shelton

book on sex crimes against children



http://littlehostages.blogspot.comrhode island taxpayers have contributed an enormous sum to wage a war that most of us know nothing about. the systems our state established to protect children have instead subjected many to danger and trauma that will profoundly shape the rest of their lives. who will help to build public awareness and political consensus to protect children from those who prey on them or who profit from their abuse? how should government respond in ways that are transparent and accountable?2009 books on sex crimes against children

finding butch



http://findingbutch.com/this is about survival and it is not about revenge. telling my story allows me to vent and it is very therapeutic. i needed to step up to the plate and tell my story so i can protect others from the same experience. i don’t want sympathy; however, i just want to tell my story to a large audience and maybe (just maybe), i can protect one child from the sexual abuse that i suffered.ron tebo

trauma stewardship



http://www.traumastewardship.com/anyone who works with traumatized people can be caught in the grip of anxiety, irritability, or overwhelming sadness. by shutting out those feelings, you may sink into emotional numbness. you wish for wise words and a fresh perspective. you long for an understanding heart. you can find all that and more in laura van dernoot lipsky’s terrific book. what could be more useful to a beleaguered trauma worker than this kit bag of straight talk, wisdom, practical ideas and delightful doses of humor? trauma stewardship can be read straight through or picked up as needed for 15 minutes a day. either way, it will get you through the hard times. it will help you feel better and work smarter. no trauma worker should be without it.  ginny nicarthy            counselor, educator, and author of getting free: you can              end abuse and take back your life.            seattle, washington, usa

my body belongs to me



http://www.mybodybelongstome.com/my body belongs to me is the critically acclaimed book by new york city child abuse and sex crimes prosecutor jill starishevsky. using her decade of experience, ms. starishevsky has crafted a book that speaks to children - it makes them aware that when it comes to their bodies, there are boundaries. it assures them that it’s ok to tell a parent or teacher if someone touches their “private parts.” geared toward children ages 3-10, it tells the story of a child who is touched by an uncle's friend and tells a parent. children will respond to the rhyming text and bright illustrations. parents and educators will find it a vital tool to initiate a lifesaving dialogue.

special



left alone, wet diaper staining the floorboardsi cried and cried and crieduntil i stopped.without love, without hugs, so coldi turned inward to seek something else:to make myself special.pain shattered my baby mindinto a thousand bits'we'll make you special,' said the bits.they took me to the underworldfed me pomegranate seeds and meadand danced around me in the dark.'we're here to keep bad people bad,' said the bitsand they put me on a pedestaland crowned me queen of hell.i was their flashlight in the gloomwith batteries that never died,though i wanted to.i stood on my pedestalshackled by the throatmy crown bejeweled, so special.singing my soft song: 'i bravely gowhere only darkness grows,'song of the bird in the gilded cage.the bits became magnetsto draw  in fear and rapethey split and grew many, grew into an army.my bird soul batteredagainst its cage of gold,its special cage.  so special.'be free or die,' sang the bird soul'die,' said the bits'be free,' said i.be free. and with those wordsthe child's spell was broken,the queen of hell threw off her shackle.her image fell to pieces, jeweled crown shatteredher light went into my heartthe army of bits stood down.the little bird flew.the little bird sang.just an ordinary bird.a bird like all others.nothing special.
