vsn: the volunteer search network:                                          a worldwide group of search angels

 

who we are



the volunteer search network is a worldwide group of volunteer search angels who have come together to provide free research assistance to adoptees, birthparents, and others touched by adoption. we are a diverse group made up mostly of triad members who want to help. we make no profit on services and do not request contributions. we do not locate infants to be adopted. there is no charge for any time spent in research. our volunteer search angels may request reimbursement for what it costs them to help you, such as obtaining copies of records, so ask in advance if there will be charges.  when more than one search angel responds to your request to help, the choice of researcher is your personal decision. please stay with the volunteer of your choice so efforts are not duplicated. you may decide to change volunteers. if you do, please notify the former volunteer.see the child welfare information gateway regarding your ability to access adoption records in your state.
