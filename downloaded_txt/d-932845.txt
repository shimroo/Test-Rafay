mte’s electric vehicle initiative
electric vehicles (evs) have come a long way since the first-generation models. many evs are capable of driving hundreds of miles while recharging in 30 minutes or less. drivers looking for a fun or fast car to drive around town are finding evs to meet their needs, even for vacations. evs offer the same reliability, safety, and features found in traditional vehicles — at a much lower total ownership cost.
as evs and their batteries continue to improve, mte is encouraging our members to consider buying an electric vehicle. as a local, innovative electric cooperative, we’re developing programs and educational materials to answer questions and help our members embrace evs into their daily lives.
 















mte's plugged in podcast
this podcast focuses on the world of electric vehicles. it is for ev enthusiasts, owners, and the generally curious. from early adopters and first-time buyers, people on the fence, and those who've jumped into the deep end, plugged in is here to help give you the ev information you need to make the best choices to fit your lifestyle. plugged in combines expert interviews and personal stories to educate and inform listeners about electric vehicles. it's hosted by middle tennessee electric — a local, member-owned, not-for-profit electric cooperative based in murfreesboro, tennessee.























join the club
a car club where ownership isn’t required
mte is building the program, but we need your help to get it on the road. ev owners, enthusiasts, and anyone interested to learn more about electric vehicles are encouraged to sign up for the ev car club. you’ll get updates as we develop activities and educational opportunities to promote electric vehicle adoption among our members.

with so many options to choose from, how do you know which vehicle will suit your needs and your budget?

electric vehicles frequently asked questions









                                what are the main benefits of electric vehicles?
              





there are many benefits to electric vehicles.
evs are designed for optimal efficiency because they run off power from the electric grid.
evs can be safer in head-on collisions because they don't have a heavy engine under the hood.
evs use battery-powered motors which create a smoother and stronger acceleration.
evs are way more environmentally friendly because they create no tailpipe emissions
evs costs 1/3 of the overall cost of driving a gas-powered vehicle due to reduced maintenance and fuel costs
