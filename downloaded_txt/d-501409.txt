powerhouse records announces the nov. 
                      3, 2023 release of
"a 
                      guitar for christmas" 
on 
                      cd & lp

this album is a gift to 
                      my wife virginie who loves christmas and christmas music 
                      as much as i do. the idea was to do something different 
                      and fresh, with a bluesy twist, instead of just a traditional 
                      approach to some of the christmas classics. it was the christmas 
                      with chet atkins album that inspired me to want to play 
                      guitar, and i have always wanted to make an album of christmas 
                      electric guitar instrumentals. thanks to her encouragement, 
                      that wish has finally come true. all of the songs are complete 
                      performances without any fixes, punching in, or editing. 
                      -- tom principato

powerhouse records announces a special 2022 
                      release of this new tribute recording 
"it's tele time" 
                      pow-140
 i have never thought of myself in the 
                      same category as roy buchanan and danny gatton--these guys 
                      were my heroes, and through them i heard the playing of 
                      some of my other heroes like les paul, chet atkins, roy 
                      nichols, charlie christian and james burton. and although 
                      i have played different models of fender and gibson guitars 
                      over the years, (roy and danny didn't always play a telecaster 
                      either), i have always thought of myself in my own way, 
                      as being part of the "washington d.c. telecaster tradition". 
                      i always brought more than one guitar on a tour or to a 
                      concert, and one of them was usually a telecaster. there 
                      would be a part of the show where i would strap on a telecaster, 
                      joke about "it's tele time!" and "unleashing the chickens", 
                      and for a part of the night everything that i learned or 
                      absorbed from roy and danny would come pouring out. that 
                      is reflected in this collection of live recordings... tom

tpb just won the 
                      "gary allen's best song in the world" contest 
                      for "don't wanna do it"! this excellent song features 
                      sonny landreth & chuck leavell. here's 
                      what gary allen (the charlie daniels band/jj 
                      cale/stonewall jackson) had to say:

"i couldn't agree 
                        more that if eric clapton packed it in and turned over 
                        the pick to a successor, that could easily be tom 
                        principato. i love the clever, bluesy cover of jj cale's 
                        "lies". i wouldn't be surprised if next month 
                        i was writing tom up as my sonicbids contest winner. i 
                        told him the competition was as stiff as al gore 
                        but it didn't scare him any. the performances are dynamic 
                        and bombastic and tom's voice has that fullness and body 
                        that his friend stevie ray vaughan and clapton possess. 
                        if i had the cash to buy one new blues artist cd this 
                        year, i would proudly hand it over for the tom prinicipato 
                        band."

the

                      principato sat with vintage guitar to discuss his history

"i 
                      really got interested in guitar from listening to my parents 
                      records," he recalled. "chet atkins, les paul, 
                      charlie christian. my parents were in their 30s when i was 
                      born and there was a lot of swing music in the house when 
                      i was growing up. i started playing the guitar when i was 
                      11 and struggled with it on into high school..."

                      quotes

                      "music reminds us of the best that we are about"
--wynton marsalis on emeril live 8/21/06

                      "while i acknowledge that my primary function on earth 
                      is to be a musician, i also see that music is nothing more 
                      than the essential component of humanity-it is all the same 
                      material. my feeling is that the more i can learn about 
                      music, the more i learn about other things. so far, it has 
                      worked for me.
