welcome
principal:  eileen rygus
king edward is a community school located in the heart of old strathcona. it draws a diverse student population, primarily from the university, arts, media, and whyte avenue business communities. our students live in the immediate community and the school serves as an important centre of community life. king edward school offers programming for students from kindergarten to grade 6 and interactions grades 1 to 6.  we provide space for the king edward child care centre, as well as providing a fringe venue during the summer.
