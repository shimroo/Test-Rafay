a great place to call home
gladden farms is a diverse and welcoming community located just north of tucson in marana, arizona. marana is one of the safest towns in arizona, known for its thoughtful approach to growth, award-winning schools, an eye toward innovation and its desirable live-work-play lifestyle. southern arizona, of course, is known for its year-round outdoor recreation, scarlet sunsets, towering saguaros, uarizona, and tucson’s designation as the first unesco city of gastronomy in the united states for its amazing southwestern food culture.











the best part about living in gladden farms is the community. everybody takes care of each other — we keep an eye out for each other!

 gladden farms is welcoming. we’ll walk around the neighborhoods, and people will be working outside in their yard and say hello. it was the kind of thing we were hoping to find — we were happy to find that here! 
							—  michael s. 
gladden farms resident 
							 



gladden farms is the place we love to call home. it’s a place where our family can grow and enjoy the parks, playgrounds, paths, and many other amenities. a great community for all of life’s biggest moments, and all the little ones in between.

our homebuying process was really easy. we didn’t know anyone when we moved here but we’ve built a home, a family and a life for ourselves in gladden farms that we didn’t have where we lived before. it’s been phenomenal.

gladden farms is a family place, a great community with lots of parks to walk around in and ride bikes. it's great for the kids. the public pool and splash pad are wonderful things you can do to spend a little time out of your day with them.

we settled into gladden farms seven years ago and we absolutely love it. our son is growing up playing with the neighborhood kids and has tons to keep him busy with all the marana parks & rec activities. we love the community, we love our neighborhood, and it just keeps getting better! 
							— jamie r.

the best thing about living in marana is that it’s a simple on and off the freeway to my work. it’s clean and there’s a lot of fun things to do. plus, many of my neighbors are police and have vehicles parked in front of the house, which makes us feel safe. 
							— brandon k.

i like that marana has a smaller town feel. we’re close enough to tucson that we can go to the things we want to but we’re not trapped in the bigness of tucson. 
							—  cassie h. 
gladden farms resident 
							 



the best thing about living here is that it’s nice and it’s quiet. there’s not the traffic and the craziness of the city. it’s safe for my kids to walk to school and go to the parks and play. all around, it’s very safe. 
							—  karen h.

marana’s not like the big city where you have all kinds of traffic, but you still have all the things you need and it’s still growing. to someone considering buying at gladden farms: come be our neighbors! come be part of the community and enjoy life.
