chiropractic care benefits all aspects of your body's ability to be healthy. this is accomplished by working with the nervous system--the communication system between your brain and body. doctors of chiropractic work to correct spinal, pelvic and cranial misalignments (subluxations). when misaligned, these structures create an imbalance in surrounding muscles and ligaments. additionally, the resulting nerve system stress may affect the body's ability to function optimally.
