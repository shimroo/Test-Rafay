durante 




represents an evolution in the concept of comfort and functionality within contemporary living spaces. its distinctive feature is the swivel end element, which adds a level of versatility and practicality to the sofa‚Äôs already flexible modular design. 














 















arbor√© 




				conceived and built through the interlocking of tubular-section wooden parts in the metal joints. it gives life to a refined and characterful aesthetic, thanks above all to the various possibilities for combining the finishes.					














 










 



































terraferma 




the terraferma project, designed by silvana angeletti and daniele ruzza, stands out for its perfect blend of formal simplicity and the expressive power of its materials.its cone-shaped form, tapering upward, evokes a symbolic language rich in profound meanings: ascension, transformation, and change. 














 















italian excellence 



































the alivar project division is made up of highly specialized professionals, supported by a wide corporate network.
