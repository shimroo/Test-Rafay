                11/10/2024 - new mufasa trailer



                a full-length trailer for mufasa has dropped, revealing a lot more about the plot:we get a lot more about the backstory of sarabi, zazu, and a rival pride of white lions. interestingly, a duel appears to be fought in an arena of sorts on top of an isolated pillar of rock, which was a discarded idea from early drafts of the original movie (see the scripts section of this site).via charlie quigg.
