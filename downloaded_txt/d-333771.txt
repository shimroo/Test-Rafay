we greatly enjoyed the courses
you arranged a golf trip for our group the beginning of april, our first time in hhi. i am late in sending you a note to say “thanks”. we greatly enjoyed the courses, we especially liked hilton head national. all of us were very pleasantly surprised with the relaxed atmosphere, steady play, neither pushed or held up. the accommodations were fantastic, thanks to whoever the owner was, it was beautiful condo. all in all, a great trip, now that golf weather has returned to upstate ny, maybe we can get out here, if we can avoid the raindrops! thanks again.
— steve






we’ll touch base next time
the villa, the courses and the weather were all first rate. only thing lacking was a good golf swing. we’ll touch base next time our group gets ready to come to hh.
— greg






i won't hesitate to recommend your service
the four of us had a great time golfing last week in hilton head. thanks so much for your assistance in setting our tee times up at the six courses we played. everything went very smoothly. i won’t hesitate to recommend your service to others who enjoy golf.
— dom






very many thanks & warm regards
just wanted to send a short note to let you know how pleased we were with our trip & the courses you recommended. hhi is certainly a beautiful area & we enjoyed it & the weather, which cooperated for the four days. the villa was also excellent. i would not hesitate to recommend your services or the villa to anyone interested & will call on you again if we are able to get down to hhi in the future.
—john g.






thanks again for setting us up with an ideal package!
i just wanted to let you know how pleased we were with our arrangements of the golf vacation we had last week. the condo was great and fantastic location. too bad our quality of golf was so bad we could not take advantage of the excellent conditions of the courses. we will play better next time we come down. thanks again for setting us up with an ideal package!
—steve k.

—dave b.






thank you for helping us set up our trip
thank you for helping us set up our trip. it was a lot of fun and we will definitely be heading back to hilton head next year. actually, talk has already started about what courses we should play. i know everyone wants to go back to harbour town, but we would like to try two other courses besides old south and cc of hh. which two would you suggest leaning towards nicer courses? thanks, todd u.
—todd u.






everyone thoroughly enjoyed it
once again we had a great trip this year. the courses were in fine shape – even though palmetto dunes decided to punch the jones & hills course greens (small holes) just before we got there. they putted ok however. the weather was great with only a 10 minute passing shower on wednesday. in summary, many thanks again for everything you did to help develop this very fine trip. it’s always a pleasure working with you. everyone thoroughly enjoyed it. i’ll be back in touch again in the fall to begin talking about the 2013 trip. best regards, jerry b.
—jerry b.






had a great time and we really enjoyed
i wanted to thank you again for putting our golf trip together for us, everyone had a great time and we really enjoyed haig point and savannah harbor. i will call you in about a year for our trip in 2014. thanks
—jeff j.






thanks for making my relaxing vacation just that relaxing
gary and i would like to thank you for a wonderful week of golf – you did a great job and we were very pleased with you and your coarse selection. thanks for making my relaxing vacation just that relaxing. i will not hesitate to let my friends and family know about you and your services. kevin from wv.
—kevin






hh is always a great golf destination
i wanted to thank you for all the work you did in setting up the golf trip for my wife and her friends. other than a little rain on one day last week for a few holes, everyone loved the accommodations and the courses. my wife knew everyone would like the courses because we’ve played them many times before (albeit the hills and fazio layouts were a little tough for some of the women). but the real compliment is the accommodations. the water oak villas met my wife’s expectations and there were no major complaints from any of the women. quite an accomplishment! men would have had no issues but as my wife said some of these women tend to be princesses so the accommodations were the key to making this past week’s trip a success. i’ve got your email on file now and i’ll be sure to use you next time we set something up for a group. my wife said she’d do it again but probably with couples or a smaller ladies group. i may do something for the guys next year because hh is always a great golf destination. thanks again. denny – ps – if you need me to rate this experience or your company somewhere, just let me know and i’ll do it.
—denny






keep up the great work and we hope to see you some day
just a note to say “thank you”. mike and i had a great time in south carolina and we definitely will be back. everything was wonderful – really! september is the time to be there obviously. i enjoyed walking on the beach every morning and then being there at night as well. of course the golf courses were fabulous. your efforts made the celebration of our 25th anniversary one of the most memorable occasions ever. keep up the great work and we hope to see you some day.
—mike and diane






thank you very much
just wanted to drop you a quick note to thank you. our group of 8 visiting from australia for a pre masters trip thoroughly enjoyed our golf and time at hilton head before going on to witness history – adam scott winning the us masters! great golf a great place in hilton head and incredible people complimented by your no fuss made it a visit to remember. have recommended hilton head and your services to anyone that will listen. thank you very much. i am attaching pictures of or group on the first tee at eagles pointe and dinner at our favorite restuarant in hh – captain woodys for you to use if you see fit.
—neil






i will gladly recommend your services to anyone
thank you. i will gladly recommend your services to anyone planning a golf vacation to hhi. where should i drop off the keys? seashore vacations? we’ll be clearing out by 8:15. thanks again.
—bill






your organisation and flexibility helped us
thanks for all your help last week. we played harbour town again on saturday and loved it even more: 11 rounds in a week, so back to work for a rest! harbour town and haig point were generally agreed to be very, very good courses, right up there with the best we’ve played in 24 tours in europe and the us. trent jones and arthur hills at palmetto dunes were also highly regarded. personally i thought hampton hall was the weakest design – not enough definition to the course – and hilton head national the easiest, but in great condition and a lot of fun to play anyway.your organisation and flexibility helped us make the most of the week, and i particularly appreciated that you got us on to haig point. also, the hire clubs you provided were very helpful and reasonably priced. if you ever want to direct a potential client from the uk to me for advice/comments i’d be very happy to provide you with a testimonial. kind regards
—steve






great trip
great trip, all went well including the weather. we enjoyed all the courses we played hope to be back next year. thanks
—nick






impressed with this method of swing adjustment
just wanted to let you know we had a wonderful time on our hilton head trip. the only down side was a 5 ½ hour+ round at palmetto dunes but on the upside, just as you said, haig point was just about the most beautiful golf course any of us have ever played and we have played all over the world. we all mostly played like crap but we still had a great time. my claim to fame was a 39 on the back nine of harbour town into a stiff wind. we won’t talk about the front 9. let’s just say a cigar and a few jacks at the turn did wonders. the forecaddie was sufficiently impressed with this method of swing adjustment. thanks again.
—robin






thanks again
hey chris – thanks for planning our trip. we had a great time. talk to you next year as i plan the next one. thanks again.
—alan






thanks once again
chris, just wanted to say thanks for organizing another great trip. it all went like clockwork and we had an outstanding time. thanks once again.
—niall






wow chris thank you so much
wow chris thank you so much. i didn’t think that would happen! you have been great to work with and i will definitely recommend you and look you up next time we come down to hilton head.
—marco
