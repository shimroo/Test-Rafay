don’t forget bring in your parking ticket!
parking in the amli parking garage for our patrons has always been complimentary and it will continue to be for our productions. however, starting later this year, the gates will no longer be automatically raised when the shows are over. our patrons will need to validate their parking tickets at the theater on their way out. as we are one of several businesses in our thriving uptown area, this is another example of t3’s need to adapt with the changing times. this should not affect your experience with us, just don’t forget that parking ticket!
