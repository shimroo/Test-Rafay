what people are saying…










“this is very compassionate congregations. i, as an asian, visited in their worship service. they not only greet my family but also accepted us as if we were their family in christ. true love of christ is present in this church. i think that where christ is, there is love, and where genuine love is, there christ must be present. i am very impressed and touched by the love of christ that they are showing with many acts, not with much words.”-paul lee






“my husband and i are so blessed to have found this warm and welcoming community. this is a special church full of wonderful people who love god and each other well. i appreciate being part of a church that cares so deeply about helping a hurting world through action.”-bettie peterson






“eca is a special and welcoming community. everyone is approachable and caring. they are progressive and looking towards the future. they are musically inclined with a broad range of talents. they are family friendly, generous and supportive. a special place.”-joyce wing






“eca is my happy place. welcoming, friendly and spiritual. blessed to be part of this community.”-nancy romer
