our story‚Ä¶
aldo‚Äôs ristorante began in 1988 with a dream of creating a family friendly italian restaurant. it started with a wood-burning stove imported from italy, a clean dining concept with simple pizzas, pastas and salads. one week after hosting a menu tasting, we opened to the public with a line out the door. since then, we‚Äôve developed into a fine-dining establishment that welcomes all ages. at aldo‚Äôs ristorante, you will find classic italian dishes with a modern twist. to complement our menu, aldo‚Äôs has an award-winning wine list. our in-house sommeliers have curated our wine selection to fit your needs. we offer seasonally inspired and locally sourced italian food, superb service, and excellent value!

food & drinktestimonials & reviews

we‚Äôve been going to aldo‚Äôs for nearly 10 years and the consistently top-notch food and service keep us coming back for more. and when my father-in-law, curt, was hit hard by his cancer that became very aggressive this year, the only place he wanted to go out to eat was aldo‚Äôs. so when he passed away recently, it was an easy and appropriate decision to hold curt‚Äôs celebration of life at aldo‚Äôs. thank you so much, chris, terry, rob, jim and the rest of the amazing staff and owners, for helping us celebrate a life well-lived. curt would‚Äôve been proud.

could not say enough positive things about aldo‚Äôs. the staff is super warm and welcoming, making you feel like you are part of the crowd. the food is very good and the bar is well stocked. get to know the waiters and bartenders, and your experience will be delightful. we held a celebration of life for my father in the private room after he died, and trusted the staff and their superior service to wow our 65 guests. it was memorable and we had no complaints. try it out!
