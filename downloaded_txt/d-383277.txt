about us


































we have been stitching for as long as we can remember. and count ourselves very lucky to have a mother who passed on her love for needlepoint to us- taking time to teach us how to stitch, and sharing in the excitement of our finished pieces. bags and bags of our needlepoint projects could be found throughout our house. that has not changed! over the years we’ve turned a favorite hobby into pillows, ornaments, stockings, belts, framed art and more. it’s a wonderful feeling to be able to create something special-especially when you do it for someone else.now, we want to share our love for needlepoint with others. whether you are an avid needle pointer or want to learn how, you can turn a painted canvas into a beautiful work of art with basic thread stitches or elaborate beaded and ribboned ones. there’s always a project waiting to be embellished. our new brick and mortar store will be opening soon so classes and shows will be posted when they launch. in the meantime, we invite you to shop for canvases (and threads coming soon) at our online store, sisterstitches.com.
