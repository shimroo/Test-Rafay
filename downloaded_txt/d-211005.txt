(patented* ). we play croquet by day, but gloquet 
        by night. 
you’ve been there before. the competition is stiff and the party 
        is loose. you’re having too much fun to stop the game, but it’s 
        really getting too dark to see those wickets. 
enter the wonder wicket light. the product extends your 
        playing time indefinitely with a brilliant red spot light for each wicket. 
        we extend an invitation 
        to play night croquet.

great gift idea for your croquet playing friends!!!
