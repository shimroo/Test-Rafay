intel keeps their 'ba-ba-ba-bing' 










intel has become one of the worldâ€™s most recognizable computer brands following its long-runningÂ intel insideÂ®Â Â campaign. the five-note jingle was introduced in 1992 and by its tenth anniversary was being heard in 130 countries around the world.since itâ€™s introduction, intelâ€™s sonic logo has played in radio, tv and internet advertising as well on start-up of any intel based pc, but not until the launch of intelâ€™s nuc computer in q4 of 2012 did it play from intel packaging.the project, a collaboration between intel and voice-express, was a resounding success, gaining notice and recognition by product reviewers and influencers throughout the technology industry. 






watch now















connectâ„¢ after sale will have your customers talking about you after they buy 










a buyerâ€™s first exposure, the first interaction, the first experience of a product is, in most cases, either when the package is viewed on a shelf before purchase or when the package is opened. that first experience is an opportunity to communicate directly with a customer at an instant where he or she is most impressionable.
