jane 
							daffron and linda delaney welcome you to their 
							version of irwin allens premier tv series, voyage 
							to the bottom of the seatm.  
							what began
								as a highly successful feature film in 1961, 
							became the staple of irwin allen's tv empire. 
							starring basehart, hedison and dowdell, 
								the series premiered on september 14, 1964, and 
								went onto a four year run, the longest of all of 
								irwin's series. when the series ended in 1968, 
								110 episodes made it the longest running sci-fi 
								show on network tv at that time, and it remained 
								that way until recent years. 


							with the advent of the internet and cable tv, older 
							series have gained new audiences, and the genre of 
							fan fiction, long the stronghold of the hardcopy 
							fanzines, came to the internet with a vengeance.  
							young and old have tried their hand at writing 
							stories about the series, spawning new websites with 
							a wealth of stories about the seaview and her 
							crew.



so 
							now, where does all of this leave us, you ask?

it 
							leads to our version of 
							voyage to the bottom of the sea.  it is, for all 
							intents and purposes, a more recent, more realistic, 
							grittier, and yes, at times, a much more romantic 
							and titillating voyage than the original ever 
							was or could be.  is it better?  thats for you, as 
							the reader, to decide.  we acknowledge that there 
							are those who prefer 

							stories 
							written true to the original.  to that end, there 
							are stories presented here that are in that genre.



							however, be prepared.  to paraphrase a tv and radio 
							advertisement...











								this is
								not your 1960s voyage
								this is a 21st 
								century voyage. 



socome 
								join us.

chip morton found!



											mr. robert dowdell, long 
											remembered and loved as lt. cdr. 
											chip morton, has rejoined the crew 
											after a long absence



 




on 
								friday, april 23, 2004, david hedison, terry 
								becker, del monroe, & allan hunt came together 
								for the first time in nearly 40 years at the 
								chiller con in secaucus, nj.


								 click here for pictures of the
 
								 1st voyage reunion.


during 
								the first years of voyage, david hedison 
								wrote a character sketch (biography) of 
								commander lee crane.  however, mr. allen 
								destroyed it and advised him not to interfere 
								with his writers.  our
							bio of crane, however, has met with david's
								approval.

oldies but 
								goodies!

past 
								articles, too good to forget, now reside in



the 
								archives
 


 
 
 






 




 
 
 






								when doing research at the ucla library, we came 
								across what we think is a bit of a gem.  in the 
								folder for eleven days to zero, we 
								happened upon what is commonly referred to as a 
								'writer's 
								guide,' the 
								outline that explains what the show is supposed 
								to be about and contains all sorts of 
								information (bios, locales, style, themes, do's 
								and do not's, etc.) for any/all writers 
								involved.


in addition, ia put together a 


story synopsis
booklet that 
								he used to help sell the first season to abc.   
								together, they give a good picture of where 
								voyage was going when it was originally 
								conceived.  if you click on the links, it will 
								take you to them and we hope that you find them 
								enlightening and fun!
 


essays

two published authors,
								carol bugge and
								roger thompson, 
								are both voyage fans.  they have written 
								essays on different aspects of the show. 
								professor thompson gives his thoughts on 
								admiral harriman nelson in comparison to real us 
								navy admirals, while ms. bugge, a writer of 
								mysteries, shares her views on voyage and 
								the characters she enjoys.




what voyage 
								means to me by carol bugge




nelson:  a 
								character sketch, by roger thompson



please take 
								time to read both of their wonderful exposes.
