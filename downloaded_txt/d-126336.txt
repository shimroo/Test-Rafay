malinois information








please pardon our dust as we are updating the website.




welcome to the website of mystique belgian malinois.
 
i have been involved with malinois since the early 1990s when i was given my first malinois, asia (akc ch.asia von adrian,cd,cgc,tt,hics,rom). asia came to me with ten points toward her championship and i was able to finish her quickly once we began showing. asia was the epitome of the ideal malinois bitch for me. we trained in obedience, agility, and a bit of ring sport. asia had only one litter, the "a" litter which produced ares and aphrodite (dite for short).
