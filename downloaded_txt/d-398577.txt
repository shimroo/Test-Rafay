earth population (est.): 















															the creative process is the 'mattering' of dynamic, imagining, spirit 'in-forming' the eternal universe with patterns, meanings, and the phenomenon of humanity.


every act is an act of creation, an expression of a desire âto knowâ and âto be knownâ, and to transcend the very same embodied createdness with more possibility.


humanity, as image and an image-maker, has an awesome âresponse-abilityâ, far beyond manipulation of ideas, to participate with spirit as conscious, creative beings.
what 'matters' to you? ~ once you love your destiny, your destiny changes.
