the history of villabate
for generations the alaimo family has been creating the finest in sicilian pastries, cakes, cookies and breads. it all started in the small town of villabate in the northern region of the island of sicily where angelo alaimo and his son emanuele started their legacy by baking bread for the locals. after years of working hard in the country they call home, angelo and emanuele followed their dreams of bringing the best in italian baking to the people and brought their talents to america.
in 1979, after years of hard work as simple breadmakers in bakeries all over brooklyn., angelo and emanuele finally reached their goal and opened a place of their own, villabate of 18th ave.

our satisfied customers











"the canoli's here are beyond the quality of anything i've had at eataly or anything in boston. this place is the real deal, and that becomes apparent from the very cool, italian cafe aesthetic they've worked on.

i came here with a friend and had canoli's, coffee, and we were stuffed. everything was incredibly filling (for pretty cheap!) and the staff was beyond nice. would definitely come back if i still lived in the area!" 



calvin l.

"my only advice is to get the sicilian ice cream sandwich (brioche con gelato). the gelato is squished between a delicious sweet bun and it seriously beats ice cream on a cone or anything else. the ladies serving the gelato were very nice and let us try different samples. we ended up getting popular hazelnut flavor and it was out of this world! definitely one of my top favorite desserts. can't wait to come back and try their other yummy pastries." 



 susan h.

"nice window displays. i got some pastries not to expensive but not to cheap. but for the quality of these desserts it's worth it for sure.

i'll be back again this coming week to get my sons bday cake their. rainbow cake 25$ cants beat that . i'm sure it will be good.

and i love the fact that the girls behind the counter spoke italian. so real, and such an authentic feeling. love it.

they should expand and have tables inside so people can dine in. i would!!
;)" 



 dmitry d.

"always come here to see yummy desserts. all so colorful. some are very sweet but certainly will not disappoint you. i always get their cannolis and they have regular and minis!
definitely will try their gelato and expresso next time!" 



wendee h.

"best gelato hands down in brooklyn. creamy and sweet. baci gelato had a crunch of hazelnut in mostly every bite/lick. my family has been coming here for a long time." 



francesca c.

"cannot say enough about this place. there is not one pastry in there that is not good. from the gelato to the cookies, and our favorite the cannolis! authentic italian pastries made with quality ingredients. it is hard to find such a good place, nothing compares. we drive hours just get a taste. highly recommend and you can't go wrong with whatever you choose to buy!"
