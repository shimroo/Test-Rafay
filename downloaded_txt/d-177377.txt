our daily menu
the nationally acclaimed cuisine at mamma maria balances authenticity with a commitment to the guiding principle of italian cuisine, a reliance on local markets. we focus exclusively on the bounty of foods grown and raised here in new england; showcasing them through seasonally appropriate regional italian dishes. in the fall and winter, our menu — reflecting the harvest and cooler weather — focuses on northern italian and mountain dishes. in the summer, our menu veers to the south – allowing us to highlight the abundance of local produce and the diverse summer seafood market.

history
one of the most memorable features of mamma maria is the wonderful striking view of downtown boston. our restaurant sits on a small hill overlooking the city. floor-to-ceiling windows reveal a dramatic panorama contrasting the boston skyline with cobblestones of north square—the oldest public square in america—and home to many pivotal figures in american history: cotton mather in the 17th century, paul revere in the 18th century, charles dickens and honey fitz in the 19th century and rose kennedy in the 20th century.
