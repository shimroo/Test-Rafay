 new swedish rock sensation donna cannone premiere video for "nothing to do"
what happens when two former members of thundermother, the mainman in both soilwork and night flight orchestra and their bass playing friend get together to form a band??  a melodic rock / power pop sensation called donna cannone, thatâs what.
formed when ex thundermother guitarist, giorgia cateri and fellow italian, bassist luca dâandria found themselves heading to a stockholm rehearsal room to go over some music and, in their own words, âhave some funâ when they invited carteriâs former thundermother bandmate, drummer tilda nilke nordlund down to help put together some songs.  the next thing they knew there was a knock on the rehearsal room door and none other than bjorn âspeedâ strid (soilwork, the night flight orchestra) was standing there with guitar in hand.  he had overheard what the gals and luca were doing and decided he wanted to be a part of what was going on. 
before they knew it, the newly christened quartet donna cannone were cutting demos, one of which fell into the hands of despotz records, who loved what they heard.  a deal in place, the band headed back into the studio to work on their first single, âcross the lineâ and now theyâve released the second track, ânothing to do.â
according to the band, ânothing to do,â is about the âdivision, isolation and negativity created by the frenetic usage of social media. an inspiration to look at the real world and to explore friendship that might be right there, next to you.â
