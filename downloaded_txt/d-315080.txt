timeless elegance. in the heart of portland. 


the iconic benson hotel is the city’s only luxury hotel that blends the charm and civility of the old world with the elegance of contemporary european design and mindful service.
built by legendary innovator and philanthropist simon benson in 1912, the hotel features original italian marble floors, austrian crystal chandeliers, and the largest collection of circassian walnut within one building. the benson is truly the last of its kind, with a multi-million dollar renovation completed in 2023. curated b&b italia furniture now welcomes guests throughout the lobby. our palm court restaurant & bar — beckons guests to imbibe, gather and connect. we’ve refreshed our 12 meeting rooms and two dramatic grand ballrooms with new technology, lighting and design features with a modern simplicity, that in contrast, highlights the existing architecture of each space. our 1,500 square foot fitness center has been expanded to include all new, state-of-the-art equipment and yoga studio.
join us. treat yourself.
and discover the timeless elegance of our landmark hotel.
