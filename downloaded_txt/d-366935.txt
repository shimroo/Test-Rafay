finished objects


summer is coming to an end. i had a great time hanging out with my kids, and got some good knitting done as well. 


first off, i did the westknits mystery shawl. thank goodness i chose fantastic yarn, because the pattern could have been designed by a 2 year old. not sure why i finished it at all, but the yarn and colors make it. 





see my girl hanging out in the background?





also finally finished these socks, the pattern is cusp by cookie a. i vow never to knit a cookie pattern again, waaaay too much work for socks. they look fantastic in the end, but my energy could have been better used on a sweater. 








happy labor day weekend. now for some fall knitting!

finally finished


this project was sleeping on ravelry for the past three years! yes, i began this one nearly four years ago. its the first large lace shawl that i have ever completed. the yarn is fabulous, camelspin from handmaiden, and its super soft. i was a little concerned about how the color would turn out, if the lace pattern would be hard to see with all of the tone variations, but its fantastic. 





and close up





its icarus, by miriam felton, a well written pattern. highly recommended. it feels so good to get that one on my finished list.

decisions, decisions


while perusing ravelry yesterday, i came across this pattern and immediately fell in love. since i just finished my icarus shawl (its blocking, photos to come), its time for a new project. my only problem is which color to make. i went shopping in my stash and came up with these combinations.


first the pattern


now the choices:


the blue version



on the left is a knitwitches yarn in purple, and on the right is also knitwitches in blue.




the pinky red version



on the left is dream in color starry in punky fuscia, it has sparkle in it. not sure if that will be distracting. on the right is malabrigo in rayon vert. it is not exactly a solid, but has many of the same colors as the noro in the center.


the pinky green version



on the left is wollemeise, which i have been dying to use, but think it might be a bit too bright. on the right is dream in color smooshy in happy forest (i used this color to make the february lady sweater)


the red one



this was my original choice. it is one of the spirit trail club colors. i love it, but think it might be too red.


i am leaning toward the blue version with the blue, or the pinky red with the malabrigo. would love to do the red.


help!!!!!!!!

little bundle


estella gave me the idea to make this for my friend alexcia at make and mingle. its from the fantastic book one skein, by leigh radford.  





the yarn is spud and chloe sweater, a favorite of alexcia. i embellished with a little flower made of some moda precuts that i cut into circles, and hot glued down.





isn't it cute! can't wait to see that little one wearing it.

projects abound


its been pretty quiet here lately, but that doesn't mean that i've been completely idle. the crochet club project has gone by the wayside. i think that jane is a fantastic teacher, and a technical expert. as for the design aspect of this project, it seems to be an afterthought. i think that there are a few others out there that agree. i've decided not to finish the project as per the pattern, but to make cushions out of what i made the first couple of months, and use the rest of the yarn to finish them. 
the weather is warming up, and other crafts have taken the forefront in my crafty world. i've done some sewing. excuse the photo quality on this one, but it was not taken in the best lighting.





its the amy butler barcelona a-line skirt. i got the fabric last year at make and mingle, and finally finished it. i love it so much that i just did another one, which is waiting to be hemmed.
next was a little cosmetic bag for me





and one for my sister





then this weekend, i had the honor of taking a class in dying with trish from tanglewood fiber creations at westport yarns. i've taken some dying classes before, but i am in love with the colors that trish uses, and was hoping to get some tips from her. i even brought along some fiber to try. 





i think the thing i was most happy about was that it didn't felt! i can't wait to spin it and see what happens. 
last but not least is the yarn





so as you can see, crafty things have been happening over here. i've just been a little lax about writing about them!

what i've been up to


not much actually. i feel like nothing is getting accomplished around here. i got fed up with the crochet club blanket this month, and was going to skip it altogether. i was given a bit of encouragement by my knitting group, and have at least finished part of it.
i did the corner squares, and this center piece. each one is beautiful on its own, but doesn't seem to match up at all. i decided to go for it, since it is a mystery blanket. i am hoping that in the end, it will all make sense. 





still not sure, but next months pattern is almost upon us. just a week to go. 
this one was super boring, but looks nice finished. i still have to make one more. i am praying for something other than single crochet next month. (double crochet to the uk people)





so many ends to weave in! 
i needed a break from this project, and decided to do a little sewing yesterday. i'm really pleased with how it turned out.





with a little surprise inside





i'm definitely taking this to florida next week!
