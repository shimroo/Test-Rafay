finbraze®


                            finbraze® finned tubing

the brazed finned tubing from fin tube products, inc. is the most suitable for higher-temperature applications. the finbraze® process creates a metallurgical bond between the tube and fin, which results in a stress-free, uniform, and non-porous contact, allowing for thinner tube walls compared to a welded fin-to-tube joint.

the finbraze® process is done in-house with our controlled atmospheric brazing furnace. advantages to the finbraze® production of finned tubing include increased heat transfer, improved strength and durability, and a more cost-effec...

cladfin®


                            cladfin® is a process that applies a nickel chrome coating to the surface of a tube and fin. this coating diffuses into the surface of the tube and fin, creating a high heat and corrosion-resistant bond.

cladfin® is an alternative to all stainless steel construction, with the added benefit of an increased heat transfer rate. it is suitable for use in high-temperature, high-pressure environments.

mini-fin


                            mini-fin tubes

fin tube products, inc. is a leading miniature custom manufacturing company in developing mini fin tubing. they are available in sizes descending from 1/4″ to a diameter as small as .015″. the fin micro tubes are used in various applications in different industries. with our in-house capabilities, we can meet our customers’ specific requirements and preferences.

the mini fin tube is helically coiled and attached to the tube by a soldered or finbraze® fin. additionally, we collaborate with engineers to create a prototype design that will go through pilot t...

edge tension


                            edge tension fin tubes

edge tension tubes are available in similar or dissimilar metals. they are recommended for low-temperature (up to 250°f) air-cooled heat exchangers and moderate duty in normal ambient air applications.

these edge tension tubes offer numerous advantages: this type of fin-to-tube attachment can be used with common carbon steel black pipe and aluminum tubing and various other metals.

stamped/plate fin


                            a stamped fin is a type of fin that can be manufactured in almost any shape or size. despite the ability to create stamped fins in various shapes, square and round stamped fins are the most common.

fin tube products, inc. offers stamped/plate fins manufactured in almost any shape or size, but square and round are the most common. the fin is attached to the tube in our controlled atmospheric brazing furnace (cabf) with our finbraze® process. this style of a fin is commonly referred to as a plate fin.

“l” foot


                            “l” footed finned tubing

l-footed fin tubing is designed to provide uniform fin spacing and prevent separation and movement under cycling conditions within the 450°f range.

the l foot provides a greater surface area for the fin to attach to the tubing, and the shoulder edge helps to interlock the fins. this design helps to improve the heat transfer performance of the tubing and prevent potential damage from cycling.
