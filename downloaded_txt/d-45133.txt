note: officetips is 
		moving to a new domain - 

http://www.skphub.comwelcome to officetips, where i provide some 
		examples of the enhanced functionality available through the vba & win32 
		api when applied to ms word, ms powerpoint & ms excel. while the main 
		focus of this site is application of vba to extend available 
		functionality or introduce functionality, where lacking; in the coming 
		months you will see a lot more examples using c# too. you can 
		now search this website for the relevant articles and downloads.
		
		
 



note: users of office 2010 
		64-bit edition please note that 32-bit add-ins do not work on the 64-bit 
		version of 2010. i am in the process of migrating some of them to 
		support office 2010 64-bit versions. at present 
		handout wizard, liveweb,
		motion path tools,
		internal hyperlink fixer, 
		video tools and
		color swatch are office 2010/2013/2016 
		32/64-bit edition compatible.
