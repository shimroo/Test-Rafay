spanish immersion in mexico since 1984

"by participating in our spanish immersion program, you will not just learn or improve your spanishâ¦ you will live the spanish language and its culture daily."













the spanish institute is a highly regarded spanish language school specialized in teaching the spanish language and its culture through 8 levels (3 weeks each) of intensive immersion program in mexico. we follow the european framework of reference for language learning and the actfl guidelines. students may attend from 1 level to all 8 levels.
our students learn from the outset to think and express themselves in spanish as they participate in our exceptional international award winning academic educational program and a wide variety of extra curriculum activities.
our spanish language school has provided an intensive immersion program for over 35 years, to learn or study spanish, in mexico for students, professionals (from all fields) and retirees; from over 72 countries.
our functional approach to language acquisition emphasizes using spanish in authentic and diverse circumstances. we have a âcommunicativeâ focus, concentrating on verbal interaction in spanish. our formal classes are dedicated to making our students know about spanish, keeping the structure of the language (comprehension, linguistics, reading and writing) and the conversation portion of the program to using the spanish language in mind. this is the key to really mastering it!
by participating in our spanish immersion program, you will not just learn about the spanish language... you will live the spanish language as you attend the school.
our students are ambassadors, diplomats, judges, teachers, clergy, school administrators, doctors, accountants, engineers, journalists, business owners, lawyers, nurses, firefighters, police officers, social workers, pilots, salespeople, politicians, retirees, business administrators, flight attendants, scientists, people from the entertainment industry, customer service representatives, students, etc. from all over the world that are looking to learn or improve their spanish for their profession or personal interests.
the spanish institute is located in an ex-capuchin convent from the 17th century that is almost 400 years old and is only 4 blocks from the zocalo (main plaza) in the historic center of puebla. the facade of the institute was restored to its original look following the inah (instituto national de antropologã­a e historia) guidelines of mexico. the inside was remodeled with optimal classroom sizes and soundproof walls to obtain the best spanish language learning experience. from the upper terrace, you will have a view of the popocatepetl volcano and many church steeples.
the language school is located in puebla, which is the most important colonial city in mexico. due to its history and architectural styles ranging from renaissance to mexican baroque, the city was named by the unesco world heritage site in 1987. it is a great city to learn and study spanish in mexico due to the fact that you are living the culture as you walk through the city. the city is famous for the battle of cinco de mayo, mole poblano, chiles en nogada, architectural styles, talavera and much more. the city of puebla has everything; and when compare in size to other cities around the world, it is one of the safest.
