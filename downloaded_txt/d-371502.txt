how to pick the right pet boarding

posted on  by bdpadmin uncategorized 


requiring the center to have the advice and supervision of a veterinarian is the best way to avoid problems
the supply of temporary shelters for pets whose services and facilities satisfy customers is scarce in the us. although most pet owners want to travel with their favorite animal, there are times when travel conditions make it inadvisable. in that case, the most suitable option is to leave the pets in a reputable pet boarding center. some call it a pet hotel.

things to consider when choosing a pet boarding
consider the condition of the hotel
the offer of services in the care of animals is very wide, but not all of them are of quality. and pet owners demand basic conditions, among which it is worth highlighting the cleanliness of the facilities, the care and professional attention to the animal, veterinary supervision, accommodation in individual cages, quality food, and home delivery and collection service.
in addition to the basics, many owners want their animal to be “at home”, so they look for covered accommodation, and event facilities with air conditioning in the summer period and heating during the winter months; the level of demand of some goes so far as to claim web cameras that allow the owner to view the animal from the screen of a computer terminal from any destination.
veterinary support
the selected place must have the advice and supervision of a veterinarian. a priori, this condition is obvious, since these so-called “zoological nuclei” (facilities for the temporary maintenance of domestic animals of non-productive species, establishments for the sale of animals, and establishments for the practice of horse riding) legally start their activity must have the pertinent legal authorization. the license is mandatory when the owner of the business intends to welcome several dogs greater than five. to obtain it, two requirements are required:

adequate facilities to house animals.
compulsory veterinary support is responsible for the animal treatment program, as well as the center’s hygiene and prophylaxis.

the centers must have the advice and supervision of a veterinarian
the appearance of gastrointestinal problems can also be caused by the pet’s stay in a residence that does not comply with all the laws. the cause lies, in most cases, in an inadequate diet or changes in diet. faced with this risk, many residents choose to ask the owners for the corresponding diet and feed for the days of stay. regardless of whether owners want to bring specific food for their pets, a center of this type must offer quality feed and respect the diets of each animal housed in its facilities.

begin learning ttouch method for obedience training

posted on  by bdpadmin uncategorized 


the tellington (ttouch) method owes its name to linda telling-jones, an animal expert who developed this tool to improve a dog’s behavior and willingness to learn.
the t-touch is not a training method or a manipulation technique, but a different way of living the relationship with your dog. it is based on a circular movement (small massage), caressing the entire body of the animal, to stimulate the functionality and viability of the cells.
advantages of the massage technique:
promotes learning
it has been scientifically proven that circular movements made in the animal’s body simultaneously activate four types of brain waves and allow the release of hormones that reduce stress, promoting learning (relaxation of the animal reduces the anxiety that normally interferes with its ability to learn).

strengthens the bond with the owner
among other positive effects of this method is also to improve and strengthen the understanding between the owner and the dog. this results in an improvement in the state of well-being, both physical and mental animals.
types of massage.
some may seem like ttouch massage therapy, but its purpose is not to relax muscles but to produce lasting changes in behavior. this method is currently used by owners, educators, veterinarians. the various types of ttouch are named after the animals they are inspired by, and upon which the tellingtons worked.
each is used for a specific purpose: for example, the clouded leopard is used to relax the dog, ttouch python to stimulate circulation, shell for fearful dogs, a razor for dogs that don’t like to be touched, bear of areas, raccoon itchy wounds, or swellings, etc.
to work with the ttouch on a dog it is necessary to know well in order to be able to assess sudden and unexpected reactions (eg fearful or aggressive dog).
the ttouch is also accompanied by some exercises, which are used to teach dogs to obey when they are free, and the obstacle course helps develop self-awareness and confidence in their own abilities. the dog learns to think and work together to overcome an obstacle since he has to focus on the work that is required. from a physical point of view, this type of exercise makes the dog more agile and improves its balance.

what to do if your dog suffers from gas

posted on  by bdpadmin uncategorized 



there are several factors that can influence the digestive process that can lead to your dog or puppy having flatulence (gas), but among the main factors are changes in the intestine.
 digestion in pets and gas formation
most of this flatulence are gases formed by methane, hydrogen sulfide, or carbon dioxide.
the digestive system includes everything related to the admission of food, that is, the organs involved in the journey that food makes are lips, gums, teeth, tongue; with its transport: pharynx and esophagus; with its digestion: stomach, intestine, pancreas, liver: and finally, with its expulsion to the outside: anal region.
digestion starts from the pet’s mouth when the canines consume the food. structural changes as in brachycephalic breeds such as pugs, boston terriers, bulldogs, or shih-tzus that, due to their conformation, carry an accumulation in the gastrointestinal tract due to increased swallowing of air during food intake.
other causes that can lead to flatulence are

a digestive disorder, due to a poor diet can lead to intolerance of some foods.
food residue in the colon.
poor absorption of carbohydrates, which can upset the balance of helpful bacteria in the digestive system.
constipation, since the longer food residues remain in the colon, the more time they have to ferment.
a sedentary lifestyle can also lead to increased flatulence in canines.
a change in the bacteria in the small and large intestines.

the importance of the health and preservation of the gut microbiome in pets
within the digestive system of our pets there is a world which, over the years and the great advances in technology, we have been discovering and understanding how it works and how fascinating it can be.
within the article about tips for the canine digestive system, there is something called the microbiome, which are good microorganisms “resident in the intestine and the number of microorganisms that live there is so enormous, which report that it is one of the most densely populated communities, even more than the soil than the subsoil and oceans. they are indispensable for the correct corporal growth, the development of the immunity and the nutrition of the pet”.

recommendations to improve digestion in our dogs
among the recommendations for the protection of the digestive system of our pets, it is recommended to give the necessary amount of food for the pet divided into several portions during the day because, if the problem is the speed at which it is consumed, without having a process of complete chewing and swallows too much air, with this tip we will help to reduce aerophagia.
if you are going to make any changes in the pet’s diet, it is necessary to do it gradually, since changes in food from one day to the next can generate the accumulation of gases.
an exercise routine or walks that the pet does will lead to more regular motility in the digestive system.
if your dog or puppy is suffering from too much gas, ensure that you contact the veterinary or professional breeder as soon as possible. notes from our friends at mini goldens 4 you, who now offer   miniature bernedoodle puppies for sale

4 reasons for getting a naked cat

posted on  by bdpadmin uncategorized 



should you get a hairless cat? maybe you should. whether you want to go for the bambino cat, sphynx, or elf cat, these naked cat breeds tend to have some amazing temperaments that make them a good pet. so, is it worth adopting or buying a naked cat? here are some few things to remind you just how amazing it is to have a hairless cat at home.
 
1. they won’t mess up your sofa/carpet
 
of course, this is the first reason some people go for the naked cat. it is obvious that they don’t have the fur that might shed too often like other breeds of cat. don’t you hate it when you are forced to clean the sofa or carpet because of the cat fur? this is not only time consuming, but it can be quite costly to do so. so the naked cats eliminate that worry of having cat hair all over the house.
 
2. hypoallergenic no more sneezes
 
if you or someone in the family suffers from respiratory disorders like asthma, they might be sensitive and vulnerable around cats with hair. but with the naked cats, you won’t have to worry about the allergies. everything is okay since they don’t shed.
 
3. they are the best companion indoors
 
imagine having a cat in the house, but then he walks out and goes to chase some mice outside. maybe she just wants to go bask in the sun. in other words, you don’t get the time to cuddle with her and enjoy the purring. naked cats are totally different because they will keep you company all day long and night too. they are sensitive to the direct sun, which means they are specifically meant to stay indoors. if you are a couch-potato and you need a companion, a naked cat can be the best fit.

 
4. they are not dangerous around the babies
 
do you have young kids and toddlers in the house? you don’t have to worry when you have a bambino cat at home. actually, their name typically means baby, so they will also get along with the kids. they will not bite or put their nails on the skin of the babies. they are not too aggressive, but you should always monitor your babies and toddlers around the cats. also, don’t leave kittens around children.

how to keep your boxer dog healthy

posted on  by bdpadmin uncategorized 


in general, the well-being of your pet dogs depends heavily on the quality and type of foods you give them. it is important to have control of the diet for boxer breeders in order to protect them from the disease. some foods are actually harmful to the health and body of your brindle boxer. that’s why i want to talk to you here about the best diet for this breed of dog, which, it must be emphasized, has very fragile health.
before going into the heart of the matter, i must specify that there are two categories of this animal on the subject of boxer’s skin: the boxer and the brindle boxer. but the skin color does not determine the quality of the diet to be followed to one or the other.
indeed, the quantity and type of meal to be served must respect in particular the boxer’s age, his state of health, his training level, his weight, and his environment. the food also varies depending on whether the dog is castrated or not. and for good reason, your boxer, when castrated, does not require a huge nutritional intake.

brindle boxer diet: what to remember
when it comes to choosing the best diet for the boxer, just be aware that this animal can adapt to many kinds of foods including croquettes, wet foods and other meals. whatever the feeding option, it has its strengths and weaknesses.
if you choose kibbles that are part of dry foods, make sure they are really good. they must not contain too much corn and wheat. this is what allows your boxer to be satisfied without being forced to fill the stomach because its greedy character is likely to make him sick. the option of kibble has several advantages including ease of storage, to measure the number of meals to give the boxer. the preservation of the teeth and gums of the animal is also ensured by the diet based on croquettes. in the same wake, you are sure that the stool of your boxer will be rather solid. in addition, the price of the bowl of croquettes is accessible, which comes to relieve your budget.
split the daily ration of your boxer equally into 2 meals (for large and medium sizes) or 3 (for small sizes) per day.
in addition, you can get your boxer dog used to wet foods that, it should be mentioned, have the advantage of being high in protein and ensure your companion good hydration. being perishable, wet food must remain well closed for lasting resistance. but after opening the box containing the moist food, it must be kept in the refrigerator. you can alternate between the two types of food.
worries?
if your boxer has a specific health concern, i advise you to take the advice of the veterinarian before choosing a diet.
wet foods are convenient for feeding puppies and older dogs because of the lack of strength of their teeth.
if the animal is overweight, wet foods are recommended especially for their high protein content. but he can also eat protein-rich croquettes.
the best choice, regardless of the type of food, is to go to premium foods. while it’s expensive, but it’s natural and organic.
