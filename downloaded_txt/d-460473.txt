tracy says: 
i noticed my husband's rollerblades on a shelf in the garage. although he stopped rollerblading decades ago, he wanted to keep them just in case. after trying several different locations and perspectives, i chose this photo because the back lighting from the window makes the wheels glow. i played with saturation and clarity to enhance the vibrance.

this is the little pot belly stove in the remains from the burned cabin (our 2018 wildfire). the enamel cookpot, a hammer head, and a few other asosrted items are a testamant to the wonderful little one-room log cabin i had built in the summer of 2003. i did a bw dreamscape on this to give it a sort of dim/dismal vibe.

ricky says:  


this was a tough one. i couldn't get the stairs to snake down and down - until i used the inititaion well as a prompt. still not 100% my vision, but i'm good with it. midjourney: use the initiation well in spain as a reference, hundreds of extremely dangerous rocky stairs skirting a large circular crevasse, descending down into a rocky crevasse - a scene depicting stairs on a trecherous and deep rocky crevasse covered in tropical vegetation with the ruins of extremerly narrow, stairs, precarious, dangerous, rough hewn stairs that are hugging the ledge, spiraling down, cascading down the side rock wall, deeper and deeper, vanishing into mist and extending lower and lower until they vanish, descending into the abyss - misty fog - fantastical - realistic - hyper real - photo real --ar 16:9

john  says:
to continue with my year word, learn, i added working with brushes. this image was taken at the vintage car museum just off the square in wetherford, texas. the transportation is an alvis speed 25 lovingly restored at great expense. this model was built between 1936 and 1940. i added joel grimes rays to the headlights and fog lights. i added a soft round brush to highlight the headlights and fog lights. i added a noise filter to soften all the layers excluding the original image. i then added a fog layer using joel grimes fog brush.

week 3, use a mirror
photo by mark whitbeck
 click to view a larger image 
mark  says:
the santa ana winds were down in our area of san diego yesterday afternoon so went down to santee lakes to catch the late light. the goal was to find a likely subject and, using a mirror held horizontally in front of the lens, get a shot where the bottom half of the image matched the top half perfectly. set my camera up on a tripod, set the timer for three seconds, and practiced holding a mirror up in front of the lens, adjusting the angle for the shot, and pushing the shutter release. hah! best laid plans of mice and men. never did get a perfect top and bottom match, but had a lot of fun trying. the beveled edge on the mirror created a horizontal line down the center of the image, which i planned to take out in ps, but decided it looked okay and left it in.

i suppose buskers have been playing in streets for quite a long time. here is my midjourney prompt: a photo-realistic, hyperrealistic, life-like raggle-taggle gypsy man with gold hoop earring, plays violin on a cobblestone street to a crown of excited and enthusiastic onlookers. he has a small box at his feet with coins. --ar 16:9

lisa  says:
my year word is "friendship." since retiring last year, i finally have time to foster old and new friendships. truly looking forward to 2025 as starting a new chapter in my life. we are blessed to live in a neighborhood with fun, caring and dog-loving neighbors. extra special because they like to eat and play cards. there have been so many birds in my backyard the past few weeks. they really enjoy bark butter on the tree. i captured these two acting friendly. i did rotate the image 90 degrees since they were on a tree. i'm not great at identifying warblers. the merlin app said that the bird on the right is a pine warbler and the bird on the left is a nashville warbler.

i tried shooting several indoor setups with a short depth of field. this week. i selected this shot of my dog murphy. it meets the criterion for this assignment. with the selective focus, the background and the ridge on his back in the foreground are soft, while his face is in sharp focus. i also had some shots where labels on wine bottle or statuettes had varying degrees of focus, but murphy is more intersting.

ricky says: 
i would very much like to make this transition from collorado to missouri. it has lingered long enough to start being a bit of a headache. it messes with any 'plans'. however, while i hope this transition will occur in 2025, life is always transitioning. we change. we evolve. nothing stays the same...nothing! for this image, i went outside to our 'happy houses'. since selling the house would be the primary aspect of a 2025 transition, the little house seemed approporate. i had the idea to go from black and white to color. then i added an overlay that also darkened the left and washed out the right - a transition from dark to light. always look for the light!

ricky says:  


who can see into the future? what lies ahead? uncertainty, hope, dreams, ambition. we seem to put a lot on our calendars and make those plans into the future. still, life changes on a dime. i don't have a crystal ball, but if i did, i'm not 100% sure i would use it. this is midjourney and i used a selfie photo that i took wearing a blue fabric turbine with one hand raised. i asked midjourney to use that as a jumping of point. the rest is rambling, but i asked: reproduce the identical face of the the old bearded man in the url photo, in a candle light gypsy parlor peers into a large golden crystal ball swirling with smoke sitting on a short pedistal on the table with brocade table cloth. the room behind the man is filled with ornate and colorful decorative curtains and the scene is dimly lit by candle light, dramatic lighting and swirling smoke , the man's eyes wide and peering into the crystal ball. the room is ominous and magically lit by candles and there is a candelabra in the background --ar 16:9here is link to my prompt photo: https://www.rickytims.com/images/ai-images/img_3562.jpg
