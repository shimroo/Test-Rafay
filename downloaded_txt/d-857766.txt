blasting 101
back in the old days, the blaster would puff on his cigar until it was red hot, touch it to the fuse and "run like hell."

our clients matter

what our clients say about us







 i wanted to take a moment to thank you for the wonderful job your team provided in the drilling and blasting for my quarry. as you know, we faced what seemed to be insurmountable challenges including short timeframes, false stop-work orders from the code enforcement officer, unending complaints up and down the chain of command at your company, politically and to dec. neighbors were difficult to deal with for house inspections. i could go on and on with the friction we incurred. your team was professional, despite the neighbors being difficult, and documented everything accordingly. i want to thank you for getting involved and helping host a meeting with your team, my attorney and assisting me with what was required paperwork you needed from dec to overcome issues with the town. i also want to personally thank your blaster in charge for his professionalism. he always kept his composure and continued with the tasks at hand despite the negativism surrounding him. the blast was a success and i look forward to working with your organization in the future. a big thank you and may god bless you all." eric schachtler -   / schachtler mine

  i would like to thank you and your drillers and blasters with the weiss market project in martinsburg, wv. from start of the project to the near finishing, the work that was performed on site was at high level. we worked through a very wet spring. working together went great i thought. also, working together on the rolling stops on i-81 went great, with no issues at all. as we're near the end of the drilling and blasting operation, once again i thank you and your crews, and hope to work with you in future."
