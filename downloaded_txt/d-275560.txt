for several years i have been seeing dr. monica gavin for bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (bhrt), having bloodwork and reviews every six months, and have been extremely happy with her, the treatment, and her staff. likewise, i have been a botox/dysport client and have always been happy with the professionalism and results.
