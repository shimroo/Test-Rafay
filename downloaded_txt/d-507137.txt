greetings veterans and fellow patriots:
happy new year!
the january general membership meeting location has changed. please join us friday, january 17, 2025 at 7:00pm at the bannock county veterans memorial building, 300 n johnson, pocatello.

we have been asked if we would like to be part of the sportsmen’s against hunger 18th annual fundraiser happening at c-a-l ranch on january 25 & 26th from 9am until 4pm. this is a place we can set up a table and share information on our mission and upcoming events. they also have a prize table to which we can donate an item to help them raise funds.
speaking of fundraisers, we have bullpup tickets available. we have quite a few tickets left to sell. let’s focus on selling the tickets so we can meet the deadline of giving this away during the thunder run on may 26, 2025.please read the december general membership meeting minutes, so we will be able to take a vote to accept or amend them.
keep an eye on the calendar and facebook for all of our events.
thank you,
pow*mia awareness rally association – pocatello
