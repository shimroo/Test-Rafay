common conditions 


















prostate  



the prostate is a walnut sized gland found beneath the bladder, in front of the rectum in men. the urethra passes through the centre of the prostate gland.as men get older, the prostate may enlarge (bph) and cause urinary symptoms such as urgency, frequency, hesitancy and getting up at night. the prostate can also develop cancer which affects up to 1 in 8 men in the uk. men over the age of 50 and those with a family history of prostate cancer are most at risk and early diagnosis and treatment can readily alter the course of this serious disease. 





















bladder 



bladder problems can arise for a number of reasons. common benign conditions include recurrent urinary tract infections (uti), painful bladder syndrome and interstitial cystitis (ic) and bladder stones. cancer within the bladder can present with blood in the urine and should always be investigated as a matter of urgency. a number of simple diagnostic investigations can be performed and will put your mind at rest if these symptoms present. 





















kidney 



common benign kidney conditions include stones and renal colic, kidney pain and cysts found during routine investigations. cancer of the kidney can present with pain and/or blood in the urine or, again, as an incidental finding during investigations for other conditions. investigation of kidney problems relies heavily on radiology imaging such as ct scans and ultrasound to assist with diagnosis in advance of any operative procedures that may be required.

testimonials 










						
most recently, i presented symptoms of prostate problems to my local gp and he again recommended springfield hospital.

i had many procedures and tests before diagnosis – all were fully explained as the process progressed. it was decided, after all tests were completed that i needed a trans-urethral resection – which meant an operation and a two day stay.

i would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all the drs, nurses and staff that i came into contact with both before and during the operation.

special thanks to mr ranjan thilagarajah who operated on me. susie nicol, who was exceptional. sue stirling, pam on the night shift, jessy george and ann wintle who made sure i was fed.

i underwent a right-sided redo robotic pyeloplasty in january 2011, after having had a similar operation 20 years ago to fix a blockage in the ureter. i feel that procedures have advanced in the last 20 years.

after my operation in january, i was discharged from hospital after two days and was back to work in a week. 

following the original operation 20 years ago, i was off work for three months.

i feel that the whole process from consultation to discharge has been exceptional.

						please accept my thanks for the recent greenlight prostatectomy that you and your team performed on me. i must admit to feeling apprehensive prior to attending the hospital but i needn't have worried. all the staff were extremely professional and made me perfectly at ease, making the whole procedure almost enjoyable!
