1 screen saver is here.  however, if you just need a 'regular' kai screen saver, with out
the smarty-pants comments on it, the  kai 2 screen saver has about eighty
pictures in it. both are guaranteed to be silent and non-annoying.  both
are pretty big files that take awhile to download, but they have their own
installers. when you  open it on
your computer it  takes about three minutes to unpack itself and install, 
deal with it. :-)
**which by the way can never be sold for
*money* since it is not official bla-bla-bla, lest salter street summon
a pack of rabid lawyers yata-yata-yata . . . you guys know the drill.
this is an unofficial fan page, which is not sanctioned or associated
in anyway with salter street films, paul donovan, jeffrey hirschfield,
lex gigeroff, michael mcmanus or any other company or person
associated with the creation of lexx.
all copyrights and profits remain
with their legal owners.

also a great big thanks to all the people
who put up these great vid captures, thank you  t'avri,  deejay, pat,
sadgeezer, and every one else who has such great sites for new comers!

since mid june 6, 2002 
plus 15,742 hits on the home page before i revamped
it. for a total of 110,257 page hits on all the kaption pages in this site from
june 1st 2001 thru june 7th, 2002. and we are not even going to mention the at&t/excite
meltdown, thank you very much at&t. this is of course not counting the hits
on the vidcap site since while it was on the free servers that silly thing resets every time i had to change
servers companies.
