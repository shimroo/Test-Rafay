communityat papa joe’s, we understand that it’s all about giving back! one of the many ways we do that is our annual 99¢ anniversary pasta fest where we rally the community to come together in support of a good cause. this celebration has been held every year since we opened in 1981, and each year a different charity is selected as the recipient of all proceeds. here is a list of just a few:hurricane andrew relief fundspecial olympicsdawn centerwomen’s resource centerhabitat for humanityst. jude’s hospitalcooley’s anemia foundationlocal church youth ministriestake stock in childrenthe arc nature coastthe jericho road ministriesmary's housejericho roadlove your neighborlive oak theaternamihernando county veteran's heat factorywe hope you can join us for our next celebration. it’s held the first tuesday of every october. 

 

loving food cooking show & culinary scholarship fundit's always been joe and donna's heart to love and give back to their community where they could.  it was only natural for them to want to combine their love for food with their love for people.  this gave birth to both the loving food cooking show and the loving food culinary scholarship fund. in the loving food cooking show, joe and donna were able to share some of their favorite recipes as they demonstrated various cooking techniques.  during each show they highlighted a local charity as they interviewed their special guest of the day so as to make the public more aware of who they were, what they provided, and what their needs were. joe and donna are also strong believers in the value of our youth and it brings them great joy to see the young people of our community excel.  through the loving food culinary scholarship they are able to take part in helping young chiefs in the making to move forward toward their goals and dreamsclick to download full scholarship application and eligibility requirementspaying it forward for our community













part of serving our community is taking care of our customers by keeping up with the times. during a conversation with the azdell family, some of our patrons who own several tesla electric cars, joe realized there was a need for an electric charging station in the area that would benefit our papa joe’s clientele and others enroute via i-75 that may be running low on power and need a recharge to reach their final destination. mr. azdell, a green architect, was able to relay to joe the necessary requirements, equipment and installation it would take to fill this need. papa joe’s is now proudly able to present for public use a newly installed 4 car tesla charging station right here in our very own parking lot! although it’s not required, drivers and their passengers are welcome to enjoy a meal or something to drink, refresh themselves with one of our healing waters day spa treatments, browse the capricci gift shop or even just relax in the capricci garden while they wait for their vehicle to charge. we’re paying it forward to help you power down the road!
