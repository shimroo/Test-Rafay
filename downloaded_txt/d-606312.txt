farm fresh furnituresince 1980















i have some very sad news to report. last wednesday my shop was destroyed by a fire that burned for over five hours. despite the heroic efforts of over 100 firefighters from ten companies, the high winds and metal roof made it impossible to contain. we believe the fire started due to a failed metal flue from the wood burning stove. the building and most of its contents are a total loss, so for now bradford woodworking is at a standstill. it’s heartbreaking to see everything gone so quickly, especially after spending over 45 years doing what i love-creating custom furniture for people all over the country. this work has been my passion and it’s hard to imagine not being in the shop everyday bringing new pieces to life. but, in the midst of this loss, i am very grateful that no one was hurt. i’m also thankful beyond words for the support and encouragement so many of you have shown over the years. also, the outpouring of hands-on help with the cleanup and recovery these past few days. your prayers and kindness mean the world to sandy and me as we figure out what comes next.friends of ours have graciously set up a gofundme page. there is no obligation, but this is a way that you could help if you feel so inclined.brad’s gofundmewe are a small shop designing and making furniture one piece at a time.

 

brad and his wife sandy have been running bradford woodworking since 1980. in the work you'll find a beautiful unity of form and function. design and aesthetics are given no more priority than attention to detail and fine craftsmanship.
