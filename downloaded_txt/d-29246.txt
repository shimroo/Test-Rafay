wsop 2008 final table delayed until november

four more months, then we’ll see who is the  democratic nominee, er, the wsop champion. 
 the weekly poker net, volume 67a
wsop main event final table adjourned to  november — the big news in poker has to be the announcement by the world series that the final table of the main event will be adjourned to november, once the lineup of players has been determined.  the move had been rumored for some time, being done at the strong behest of broadcaster espn, which has been looking to pump up its flagging poker ratings.  the 117-day delay from july to november will allow espn to televise a “nearly live” final and promote the event in hopes of boosting interest, but drew the ire of many poker traditionalists who believe the change introduces increased possibilities for unforeseen and unwanted events to occur.  call it the “grand experiment” for poker in 2008… only time will tell.

cheesemonster stands alone for ftops win

cheese, beer, (poker)brats. as good as  oktoberfest.
 the weekly poker net, volume 69
 “cheesemonster” captures ftops viii main event — full tilt’s ftops viii series concluded a very successful two-week run with its main event, which easily topped its guarantee and finally paid out a $2,375,000 prize pool.  $410,780 of that went to the player nicknamed cheesemonster, who brie’d to victory over a field stuffed with many of online poker’s biggest names.  “marmoss” finished as the runner-up for $249,375, while “slmelonman” claimed third for $161,500.   jason “strassa2” strasser finished ninth for $30,875, while martin klaeser was the highest of a number of full tilt “red pros” who cashed, taking 62nd spot.  the event’s bubble boy?  only phil ivey.










jung triumphs in partypoker millions

collectively we’re unconscious of any rancor over the german win. but we still dream of playing at party poker again.
the weekly poker net, volume 68
alexander jung captures partypoker millions vi —  partypoker’s annual floating cruise-ship event, the partypoker millions, was captured this time around by germany’s alexander jung.  jung triumphed over a 171-player field light on american players, who were unable to qualify online (party does not accept us players online at this time), but still could buy in directly since it was a land… er… water-based tournament.  jung’s triumph was worth $358,280 over a relatively anonymous final table, the most recognizable player of which was the fourth-place finisher, finland’s mika paasonen.  germany went one-two, however, as dominik stopka captured the runner-up $225,585 prize money.
