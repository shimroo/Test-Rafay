one read community reading program
 

one read is a community-wide reading program coordinated by the daniel boone regional library.
thank you for nominating books for the 2024 one read program during november! finalist titles will be announced this spring. you’ll then have the opportunity to vote and help select the next title for our community to read together.
read more about how the books are selected.
see a list of past finalists in the catalog.



one read is generously underwritten by the friends of the columbia public library and made possible by organizations in our community. we thank all of our partners on the task force for their support.
