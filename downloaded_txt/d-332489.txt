out now!we couldn’t be prouder to bring you tim heidecker’s latest album, slipping away. if you trust critics more than you trust record labels, listen to what they’re saying about it:“'slipping away' thrives on short, sonic vignettes that create a vibe that moves from lighthearted road music to darker existential jams that somehow end up feeling hopeful.” — los angeles times "though many may know heidecker for his comedic brilliance […] he’s also been a lifelong singer-songwriter. and a damn fine one, too.”        — bluegrass situation "slipping away, some of heidecker's most fun and freewheeling work." — rolling stone
