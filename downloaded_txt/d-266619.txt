home insurance

buying a home can be a complex process, but it does not have to be. with help, the journey to purchasing a home can be done smoothly, efficiently, and it is an incredible step towards your future. buying a home is an investment, and the way to protect that investment is with home insurance.















what you need to buy homeowners insurance

when people purchase a home, it is likely to be the most substantial investment they have ever made. protecting this investment from things like flooding, fire, vandalism, and many other risks that come with homeownership is a smart choice. without homeowner’s insurance, the costs of repairing damages can cripple people's finances or force them to change the lifestyle they are accustomed to.




to purchase homeowner’s insurance, you will need the following things:

the location of your home and here it was built
whether or not you have animals as pets on the property
the type of foundation your home has
the type of roof your home has
the distance of the home from the nearest fire station and fire hydrant
information on any businesses you operate from the home
information about updates to your home's systems, including electrical, plumbing, roofing, and heating systems.

there may be other information that you need when applying for health insurance as well, but these are some of the basics.

homeowners insurance – what it covers







homeowner’s insurance covers a wide variety of specified perils and comes in multiple different types. some of the things that can be covered by homeowner’s insurance include fire, hail, snow damage, theft, wind, damage from electricity, and other perils as well.
if you purchase a standard home insurance policy, it will generally cover the physical structure of your home and other structures on your property. you may need to confirm with your homeowner's insurance provider that things such as sheds and detached garages, as well as possessions of various types, are covered under your policy. some specific electronics and other items may need additional riders in order to be included.
there are a few other things that are not covered by a standard policy. these can include earthquakes, sinkholes, flooding, and sewer backups. you likely need additional riders if you want financial protection from these things.

what does homeowner’s insurance cost?
the cost of homeowner’s insurance can vary a lot depending on a number of variables, including the location that you live in. this can include the state you live in, the city you live in, and even the neighborhood that you live in. homeowner’s insurance companies weigh the risks of your area when determining your insurance premiums. areas that are at risk of damage from weather, for example, are likely to pay higher premiums than people who live in states without these risks.


factors in setting your premium
numerous other variables can affect your premiums cost. these can include the size and age of your home, the cost of materials needed to repair your home (which can vary by location), the number of claims you have made in the past, your credit report (in some states). also, the amount of coverage you decide to get.
many professionals recommend getting enough coverage to rebuild your home if it is damaged beyond repair completely.

how can you pay less for home insurance?

there are many ways to pay lower rates for your home insurance policies. one of the most impactful discounts that people can get come from bundling homeowner’s insurance with other insurance policies. insurance policies that people can bundle with their homeowner's insurance include auto insurance, business insurance, health insurance, and life insurance.
in addition to bundling insurance policies, adding security systems and weatherproofing to your home can decrease your rates. other safety systems that can give you a price break on your insurance policy includes smoke alarms and sprinklers.
many people choose to save on their premiums by increasing their deductible. your deductible is the amount that you pay out of pocket when you make a claim. it is essential to keep your deductible affordable, however, so you know that you will be able to pay it if you do need to file a claim.
