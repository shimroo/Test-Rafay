geologic mapping


geologic maps depict the distribution of rock types,
surficial sediments, and geologic structures, such as faults and folds, as they
appear on the earth’s surface. they enhance the ability to identify and develop
mineral and energy resources, understand groundwater and surface water systems,
locate and prepare for natural hazards, conduct scientific research, and inform
policy makers on land-use decisions.

resources


idaho
is endowed with natural resources that include metallic and industrial
minerals, groundwater, oil and gas, and geothermal. these resources are
important to idaho’s economy and are necessary to maintain and increase our
standard of living. the igs conducts research and provides information that
enables the development of these resources in an efficient and socially
responsible manner.

hazards

geologic
conditions and human activities can result in a variety of hazards such as
landslides, rockfall, debris flow, earthquakes, liquefaction, volcanic
eruptions, and expansive soils. as the human footprint in idaho grows it is
critical to understand and identify geologic hazards so their impacts can be mitigated,
and losses can be minimized. the igs conducts fundamental research on geologic
hazards and provides data to the public, state and federal agencies, local
municipalities, academic researchers, and engineering consultants.

outreach


the survey disseminates geologic data on idaho primarily
through igs publications (most of which are available for free download),
interactive web map apps, social media, in-house collections, and efforts by
the staff to educate the public in the earth sciences. the igs seeks to promote
excellence in the teaching and practice of the earth sciences by giving
educational presentations, participating in outreach events statewide, and
preparing outreach materials.
