the site that time forgot...


hello. my name is erik amill and, like they say on "the outer limits," do not attempt to adjust your monitor... i am in control.
within these pages you will find the awe and wonder that are my creations. from comics to illustrations, old ideas to completed projects. all work presented to you on this site is a creation of mine (unless otherwise noted). so please kick back and enjoy my work.
    hopefully you will dig it as much as i enjoyed making it. = )
