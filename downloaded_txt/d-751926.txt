nancy and doug are two of the finest people i have ever met! i can’t put into words my gratitude and my appreciation to both of you. nancy taught me so much about not only grooming dogs but also how to go about the bnusiness. doug showed me how to use nancy’s teaching the most effecient way! because of your school my business is growing way faster than anticipated. i can finally say that i love my job! i get to make dogs look and feel great. my greateset satisfaction is when owners come to my driveway and the only thing i see is their smiles! diamond cut is the only place to learn about dog grooming if you are serious about being successful and groom dogs the right way. thank you so much nancy & doug! you are the best! 



forever thankful, rafael!
