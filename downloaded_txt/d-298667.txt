medical escort
our trained medical assistants on board the aircraft work hard to make our patients and customers feel comfortable throughout the course of their flight.

for inter-facility transports under two hundred miles, air transport is not cost effective.  in addition, some non-critical patients prefer the cost savings of longer distance ground transport.
