what is apld
the association of professional landscape designers® (apld) was founded in 1989 as an international organization dedicated to promoting the highest standards for the landscape design profession. the dc md va chapter represents apld members in the district of columbia, maryland and virginia. organized in 2003, the chapter provides opportunities for members to further develop their professional skills, network with other green industry professionals, and engage in community service. the chapter serves the public by providing online resources for finding and working with local professional landscape designers.









why hire a designer
professional landscape designers have the ecological, aesthetic, and technical training to provide solutions that might not have occurred to you.
a designer will find creative ways to produce an outdoor space that reflects your needs and sensibilities, while at the same time maximizing your available space and addressing site concerns such as drainage, screening and soil conditions.
