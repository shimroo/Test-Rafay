desales community development is a community-based non-profit that advances the ongoing wellbeing of neighborhoods as healthy, diverse urban communities through housing development, property management and community services.   

 

what we do:convert vacant spaces into affordable homes, increasing housing options.collaborate with neighbors, groups and agencies to combine resources and tackle housing challenges successfully.ensure residents' needs are met and properties well-maintained through socially responsible property management.connect our low-income tenants to essential resources.promote vibrant and thriving neighborhoods.
























development is not enough. long-term management ensures the success of affordable housing.
desales believes that sound property management is essential to the health of many urban neighborhoods, especially those with a high proportion of multi-family housing. to meet this need, in 2004 desales formed its own property management company, fox grove management (fgm).
