rumors


jan. 28th, 2016 at 6:19 pm



 


ladyegreeni have heard a rumor that lj and dreamdwidth might becoming back into play as social networks. (i may be starting that rumor, but i totally heard it when i said it out loud and therefore i am being truthful.) wouldn't that be lovely? come on, come on come on, you know want it to be a thing too. chillin on your own page with the awesome theme you picked or created and all your icons, not to mention that neat filtering system and the way you can tell who responded to whom easily. whadda you say? play with me?this entry was originally posted at http://ladyegreen.dreamwidth.org/978981.html. please comment there using openid.

christmas cards 2014


nov. 5th, 2014 at 7:58 pm



 


ladyegreenit's that time of year again folks, heather's christmas card drive will be commencing in the next few weeks.this year though i'm toying with a new idea. feedback appreciated. on an average year i send out around 60 christmas or holiday cards. that's a lot of postage and right now i'm currently only working 2 days a week.what if i "crowdsourced"? would anyone be interested in donating a 1.00 or less to a postage fund maybe through paypal? the more i can pull together the more i can mail out and if people have a request of whom they would like to receive a card i'm happy to do that as well. either from you or from me, kids love receiving their own christmas cards addressed to them as do people who have become rather shut in.many people love receiving real mail, especially during christmas, and i love sending it. i have lots of cards. and i never ask, demand, or push for people to send me a card in return (although, absolutely feel free to do so, i love getting mail). so if i can sort the postage out i can deliver a great deal of cheer this year.regardless, i'll start purchasing postage on my next day payday. if you would like a card please message me your email address or email me at ladyegreen@yahoo.com (for dreamwidth and lj users comments will be screened if you would like to put your address there.) if you would like an additional card sent to someone else please make sure to give me that information as well.i'll put up reminders as i remember so if you want a card this won't be the only post, no worries. i just like to start early so i have plenty of time to get it done in.h.

sometimes life just sucks & it's ok to say so


dec. 4th, 2012 at 6:19 pm



 


ladyegreenthis started off as a comment on a friend's journal and it was getting long in tooth. i moved it here. sometimes life just sucks, it's okay to acknowledge that, at least it is with me. to those of us who are not making it, or are just barely squeaking by: i'm only making it because a good friend paid the last giant electric bill, another provided groceries, and my husband had an unexpected spurt of overtime. you know what? it sucks living like that. i kind of feel like that's my role to play in all this madness so many of us are going through, i'm going to be one of those that walks through the heartache, grief, humiliation (and all of us struggling feel this, not one of us wants to be here), and every once in awhile be the one to bald face acknowledge that it sucks being poor, it sucks having to sweat if you can pay your rent, and it sucks worrying about your loved ones. because i've noticed this about the net (and in analog life)whenever someone vents about their situation a few things happen. some people fall silent, they don't know what to say. some people are silent because they are being judgmental pricks that think you should have done something differently, whatever, those people do well to keep their mouth shut and their fingers off the keyboard. some people are offer hugs and love, share that they know the feeling (oh, yay, my group) and wish you (or whomever) well. and then we have the last two, one who is trying to help, and one who is hijacking but may not know they are being malicious. we have the bluebird warblers who want to post something uplifting and have a silver lining, god or goddess bless them, they are trying to help. and god or goddess bless me, some times i just want to take a damn frying pan to their head. shut up and let me (or anyone) be miserable for a moment so we can acknowledge reality instead of wishful thinking and re-compose ourselves. but we all know they are just trying to help and sometimes their's is the voice we most hope to hear because sometimes we desperately need that cheer. so bless them some more may we never lose them. the last sort... hmmmmmm. the last sort are the ones who want to tell you how horrible they or someone else had it so you can realize by contrast just how well your life is going in comparison. i truly, truly, believe most of these people are really trying to help but like the warblers, they don't know when to cut back some. being online it's hard to tell when a swift kick to the pants is needed and when it's not. so they unfortunately are the ones that make you feel worse about yourself because it comes across as being schooled, in public, or in a private space that you thought you were safe, for whining. which no upset person who is going through trauma needs. ever. so i'll say it for those who don't want to come across as whining or ungrateful or just ugly. being poor is not heart lifting and it is rarely a choice. being poor is hard. being poor means not being able to care for yourself, which is humiliating. being poor means not being able to provide for your loved ones, which is not just humiliating, it breaks your heart, over and over and over again. furthermore, i don't care about your political persuasion but if you really believe 47% percent of americans just want a government that gives them a hand out than i guess i'll have to get out my big paint brush and say something just as brash, huh? which is this, are you insane? i don't care that you personally know a mooch. everyone personally knows a mooch. good for you. but the vast majority of people you know are not moochers and you shouldn't treat them as such. ever.  elderly, disabled, people trapped in repressed areas, and the working poor do not need your judgmental nonsense and especially not through the holidays. okay, i'll go stuff my soapbox away until the next time. take care and love everyone. need tea.this entry was originally posted at http://ladyegreen.dreamwidth.org/937715.html. please comment there using openid.

steven crowder misses the point of his own wedding


sep. 20th, 2012 at 4:46 pm



 


ladyegreeni am in no way joking or being sarcastic. i feel nothing but sadness for this man that this is what he took away from his wedding and new marriage. http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2012/09/14/staying-celibate-before-marriage-was-best-thing-ive-ever-done/   (mostly he wants you to know that he did marriage right and anyone not like him didn't.) frowns, this poor man missed the point of marriage or joined unions completely. i saw this else where first (a site taking the piss out of his article) but i wanted to make sure that this is what he said. no hon, you didn't get married "the right way". there is no right way to get married, what is right for you isn't a blueprint for others. my parents were married on halloween night during a thunderstorm and i believe my mother wore a navy blue dress, my father his military dress uniform. it was right for them and they are still going strong decades later. my brother was recently married to the love of his life, a couple that has been living together for years. the bride wore purple sneakers under her dress, the ring bearer was their beloved dog lucy with ribbons in her fur, and it was one of most moving, most wonderful weddings i have ever been to, it was right for them. you aren't better than my brother and sister in law because you didn't live together first. you aren't better than anyone for the addition of having abstained from sex. having sex for the first time on your wedding night isn't a goal anyone need aspire to. it's something you can do, for you, if it feels right too you. sure. why not. but it isn't the reason to be married in the first place. if your main take away from your wedding is a preoccupation with sex and a judgmental call against anyone not like you than i am afraid it is you that did it wrong. and i feel quite badly for you and sad. the feeling one should take away from their marriage (or union) is a euphoria and joy that you have joined together your souls, not your bodies. i hope in a few years time you realize this and maybe hold one of those services where you renew your vows. you and your wife won't be as young and beautiful, you won't be starting off a new life together, the sex part will have long since been figured out, you'll likely have been shacked up together for years. maybe once all those things have been stripped away you can do it the right way and you can remarry your wife because you love her, despite her flaws, despite your flaws, and it can be about your hearts and your souls this time and not about things that in the end don't really matter.this entry was originally posted at http://ladyegreen.dreamwidth.org/924363.html. please comment there using openid.

today's global experiences link a thon


aug. 6th, 2012 at 3:41 pm



 


ladyegreenworld's 12 worst tourist trapscross off this devil's dozen of overpriced, underwhelming sites from your bucket list. now! or disagree completely! which some people in the comments were happy to do. and i think that's a good thing. which cuisine do global travelers love the most? for me, i'd have to go with the asian over the italian or french but to be fair that just falls in line with my general taste in life. your mileage is destined to vary. and since we're on food, again, my last two links. world's 50 most delicious foods (similar name to another article i linked but this is a different list.) andtop 50 american foods enjoy.this entry was originally posted at http://ladyegreen.dreamwidth.org/920192.html. please comment there using openid.

it made me happy


aug. 3rd, 2012 at 1:55 pm



 


ladyegreenthe web is having a bit of ugly behavior over all today and i've reached my limit on the chick-fil-a fiasco, not only was i right, they had a record breaking day, but some of the wendy's down here jumped on the bandwagon too. so, i went in the other direction. check out this: shewired featured artist: the butch clothing company - england check out the fantastic clothes! and the comely ladies modeling some of them. and i need a girlfriend, so i can wear the one of the left with some loafers in brown and she can wear the outfit on the right, with some highly polished shiny black shoes. and then we go out to a tearoom and sip tea, with scones. i'll have a dashing cane resting against my chair and she'll have a pocket watch and it will be smashing. i've also decided that she will be tall, because while i'm imagining i might as well have it all, yeah? (everyone should know me well enough by now to know i can't stick with being angry or depressed for too long, it's bad for my complexion.)this entry was originally posted at http://ladyegreen.dreamwidth.org/919636.html. please comment there using openid.

dear politics


aug. 1st, 2012 at 10:30 pm



 


ladyegreenmy republican friends: i'm going to be doing a lot of screaming about your party in this entry because while i love you and i know most of you are perfectly reasonable people i do not feel the same way about your party as whole. in fact, i think you guys need to clean house and start over with better reps. all things considered you may not want to read and i encourage you not to if it is going to cause problems between us. ta. dear politics, i wish i could quit you. hard.let's just be honest, i hate you and you know it. if people weren't being such absolute asses and using rubbish logic all over the place i wouldn't have to talk about you. do you have any idea how happy that would make me?

japanimation among other things


jul. 30th, 2012 at 2:06 am



 


ladyegreenlong time since i've seen that particular word mash up used. *smiles* i have a lot of really fantastic memories tied to that word. moving along, i've pulled some interesting articles from cnn go to share and i recommend clicking around but mind the comments section (one of the great over reaching rules of the internet, yeah? there is always an unpleasant person in the comments section.) mostly japanese this go round, a dash of south korean, and all the other lovely links each article will lead you too. ^______^freaky and fantastical dolls, seoul doll fair 2011 some are ball jointed dolls which i am a fan. coolest manga pictures you'll ever see which is a bit stretching i believe but this is still a fantastic photography art project. (definitely avoid comments, unless you are fond of people who use the word 'meh' and like to proclaim what is and what isn't news.) the cooling off of the japanese anime boom i found this to be a bit sad and glum. it's a few years old though and perhaps the situation isn't as bad off as it seems. i'm all for a revival myself. the best ten places to experience tokyo in peace several of these look like perfectly lovely adventures to go and have. and if you are going to have an adventure, you're going to want to eat at some point, forty tokyo foods we can't live withoutthis entry was originally posted at http://ladyegreen.dreamwidth.org/917837.html. please comment there using openid.

ladyegreeni've skimmed this and intend to reread it a bit later and a lot slower. (my son is playing sonic the hedgehog behind me and i absolutely cannot gain any kind of concentration on my part.) my opinion on the matter is still developing. article, is the internet making us crazy, what new research saysthis entry was originally posted at http://ladyegreen.dreamwidth.org/917645.html. please comment there using openid.
