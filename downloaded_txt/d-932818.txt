changes





it has been almost a year since my last post.  blogspot and geocities have made changes that affected my (and everyone's) pages. given that, i lost many of the features i added to the old one, i decided to try a new template.

i will install a new header picture and be re-adding some features in the future as i get to it.

i will even be doing some posting.

in case anyone is wondering; no i haven't run out of things to harp on.

whether i had anything to do with it or not there is now a large number of cornhuskers that have come forward and very handily  took up where i left off. i am so very appreciative of these folks for the fantastic work they have done and are doing on behalf of firearm owners in nebraska.

the tides have turned; instead of them reading my stuff, i am enthusiastically reading theirs.

words will not ever be able to express my gratitude to these people. how can it? from the humble beginnings of this website to what the nfoa is today.

i am often reminded that i am the reason for the nfoa, but i know it would never have come to fruition if not for chris zeeb, dan walz and a few other dedicated individuals that wrote the founding documents and made it a public entity.

andy allen, scott barry, rick mangold, jay & kim, kathy, and many others are responsible for making the nfoa a successful grassroots organization.

thank you all so very much!

... provide for the general welfare ...





there is much confusion about what is or is not in the constitution and how it applies to those in service to we the people. frankly i attribute this to the public education of this countries youth since at least the 1950's.many have queried this writer on the context of the following quote;"congress has not unlimited powers to provide for the general welfare but only those specifically enumerated."-- thomas jeffersonunfortunately too many people believe that "promote the general welfare" gives congress unlimited power to enact any legislation they want too. there were even in jefferson's day those that felt that way. the reason he issued the above quoted text was to remind them it was not so.to understand what he meant, and why, one only has to read the constitution and actually be able to comprehend what it says. i know that may be hard for some that were not home-schooled, but try. it should be a fairly simple process for the common person since it was not written by lawyers. heck even i can understand it!in the preamblewe the people of the united states, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of america.article isection 1. all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a congress of the united states, which shall consist of a senate and house of representatives.how much more simple can that be? our elected representatives have only those powers granted them by we the people in the constitution.if a power is not specifically enumerated then they are violating their oath of office if, as they have been doing, assume any power without the approval of we the people. that approval can only be granted by we the people as a change to the constitution its self.understand this; the only powers that congress has are specified in sections eight and nine of the constitution and in some of the amendments that have been enacted.  the ".. promote the general welfare .." phrase is embodied in the preamble to the constitution. provide for the general welfare is one of the reasons for the document, not a power granted by it.there is no power given to "promote the general welfare".instead of relying on public educated acquaintances to tell you what they heard it means, get a copy of the constitution and read it for yourself. if you have a problem understanding it find a home-schooled student to explain it to you.if we the people had been vigilant and held those we elected to serve us accountable for the last 100 years we would not be in the situation we are today. if we really want to see who is to blame for the fix our country is in all we have to do is look in the mirror and see our apathetic reflection staring back at us.

palins choice- sweet tea with lemon .... or?





when it looked like juan mccain would be unchallenged for re-election in the arizona primary sarah palin threw her support to the lemon flavored, sugary, progressive pantywaist.enter j.d. hayworth. on paper, at least, he is about as hold the liberal condiments conservative as it gets. that should make him the ideal palin candidate.the quandary; does palin compromise her purported conservative tea party principals and continue her support of a progressive rino?or, does she switch her allegiance to the conservative that nearly reflects her own expressed philosophies?it seems to me if palin, for whatever reason, insists on bringing a pitcher of sweet lemonade tea to the party there will be negative consequences.let's do the mathtea party likes palin + palin likes mccain + mccain is not a tea party candidate = somehow this just won't add up!

ben blubbers again





benedict finally makes a statement on the election of senator brown.he essentially blames republicans for the democrats defeat by senator elect brown. he insinuates that the obstruction and lack of participation from the other side of the aisle caused the people of massachusetts to elect a republican to kill the health-care bill. i guess no one told him that there were a number of independents in massachusetts that voted for brown because of ben's cornhusker kickback.“clearly, the vote showed that people are frustrated with washington...you are damn right we are ben. we expect our elected representatives to obey the oath they took by not voting for unconstitutional legislation.and i am too.  that frustration will likely register across the board for all incumbents. right on again ben! count yourself in that "all incumbents" too.the overriding message from yesterday is that people are upset because washington is dysfunctional and not working together for them.ben, yes you and the other 99 are dysfunctional that is true and no you are not working together for us that is correct.ben, what part of you are personally partially responsible for senator brown being seated. thank you ben, although we hate how you did it, we appreciate it.you are however wrong about the overriding message. the overriding message is that we are tired of you not listening to your constituency. we elected you to do what you are told to do by a majority of your constituency. you were not elected to haul your ass down to dc to do what the hell ever you want.it may be a wake up call for you ben, but it came too late and you are late work.don't you think it is a just a little presumptuous to claim that all of the independents will always line themselves up with you?“republicans have a responsibility—and had it in the past—to engage, not sit on the sidelines. their obstruction should give way to participation.ben, how big of hole do you have in that thick head of yours?the republicans made all sorts of overtures and proposals, of course a cloward-pliven pinhead like you sees that as obstruction.their obstruction should give way to participation.ok ben, what hole in the sand did you have your head in when your masters reid and pelosi locked them out of the process.uh ben that would be physically locking them out. as for participation they even refused to allow snowe, who voted with you, to be in the same room with them. and you have the balls to call the republicans obstructionists??  ben has anyone ever told you how juvenile you sound?it is kind of hard to participate when you can't even get in the game.“bipartisanship will bring people together all across our country. bipartisanship will deliver progress for the american people.  working across the aisle is the way in which we get that done.ben since you were there for every little nuance, i have to ask; what part of you and your masters refused to consider anything that came from across the aisle?“i will continue reaching across the aisle as i’ve always done to develop bipartisan health reform that works for nebraskans. i will work for bipartisanship every chance i get, and i believe that bipartisanship is the way forward for congress to deliver for the american people.bipatisanship is the way forward ben, but i call bullshit. reach across the aisle? ben you can't even give a good reach around.you will continue to cow-tow to your masters without regard for your fellow nebraska representatives in dc or your constituency back home.“on health reform, it’s up to congressional leaders to decide the next steps.  220,000 nebraskans without coverage and rising costs for all other nebraskans doesn’t suggest we should just give up.”who are you trying to convince ben? yourself? the current plan will likely price more nebraskans out of insurance that it will cover.ben what do you take us for? a bunch of backwoods country hicks? i, and countless other nebraskans find your arrogance insulting.we have heard you try to explain your way back into our good graces several times in several different ways since you embarrassed us all again and not one of them made any sense. you even had the audacity to ruin our bowl game with your senseless drivel.if you were so right in what you did why hasn't reid or the president come to your defense? are you too stupid to realize he used you like a cheap whore. how does it look from under the bus with harry's boot print on your ass?though you may think different ben, we are not idiots. do the right thing ben resign.

jack hemby, way off target?





where do these people come from?it is people like this that really aggravate me to no end. the older i get the less patience i have to suffer ignorant uneducated fools.the ignorance that is displayed by this current letter to the alamogordo daily journal is a further illustration of why i believe that people should have to pass a competency test on civics before being allowed to vote.i believe in the right to bear arms, but i think it is in bad taste and sets a bad example to pack a gun at a tea party.i believe it in the right to vote, but i think it is in bad taste and elects bad representatives when the electorate has no understanding of the constitution and the bill of rights.guns will only run people off that would like to participate in the tea party movement.jackie, wake up, what part of the tea party movement exists to support all of our creator endowed rights don't you understand? in case you weren't taught that in school, that includes the right to keep and bear arms. helloooo!!!!!jackie, you and jimmy hipps need to read this slowly ... real slowly so your feeble brains can get a grip on it;the rally that was held in alamogordo was organized by a local open carry organization and the local tea party movement. let me say that again in case you didn't get it the first time, it was a dual organization event.both organizations jointly applied for and received a permit from the city of alamogordo for the event.is any of this sinking in jackie? jimmy??jackie, do you know how stupid your, "guns will only run off..., comment sounds? it is obvious that you have absolutely no idea what the tea party movement is all about do you? talk about ignorance, geez dude wake up!i think the only time we should strap a gun on our side is when we plan on using it.another idiotic statement jackie?               ever heard of self defense?or do you believe that the bag guys are going to snail mail, e-mail or call you personally and tell you that they are going to rob, rape or car-jack your sorry ass at such and such a place at so and such a time so you can strap a gun on your side with plans of using it?"....the only time we should strap a gun on our side is when we plan on using it."what a brain dead statement!i do not think we have gotten to that point yet. the american people needs to stand and be heard, but not by a gun shot.no we haven't gotten to that point yet and i hope with all hope that we never do get to that point."..but not by a gun shot."it is my opinion that only an arrogant dumb-ass would make a blanket statement like that. were you there? how many gunshots did you here? how many gunshots were reported in the liberal mainstream media, that you likely watch, were reported.here is a trivia question for you jackie, and jimmy can chime in too if he dares;in all of the open carry events, held all across this great country, in the last 10 years how many gunshots were heard or reported?we need to demonstrate in a civil manner. lets not look worse than the people we are demonstrating against.what was uncivil about the event? everyone including the three anti tea party movement "protesters" were peaceful and civil.not worse than the people we are demonstrating against? would that be the acorn and seiu thugs that have been arrested for physically assaulting tea party goers? would that be some of our elected officials that called us nazi's, traitors, etc....? would that be the coakley thugs that roughed up a reporter doing his job? i could go on, but you likely won't ever get the point anyway.bringing guns to tea party movements will only cause our ideals to die on the vine.die on the vine? you don't have a clue jackie, not one iota of a clue. yes, the tea party is about taxes, but the majority of participants are also concered with the inalienable rights articulated in the constitution and bill of rights. i realize that may be hard to grasp for single minded people like you and jimmy, but that does include the right to keep and bear arms.and finally!you do support the military and its veterans don't you jackie?you know the ones that; ..at one point, wrote a blank check made payable to 'the united states of america for an amount of up to and including their life.the open carry organization in question was formed by a few soldiers that are currently on active duty. many of those attending that were lawfully bearing arms are current or former members of the united states military.it would grieve me to think that you are disparaging those selfless and patriotic individuals.get you head out of your ass!

james hipps must have been out in the florida sun too long!





in a recent letter to the alamogordo daily news this idiot made some pretty scathing remarks about the people that populate this sleepy little retirement town that i can not ignore.having friends and family living there, some of whom were at the permitted event, i am compelled to take jimmy to task in terms that even he should understand. since he mentions seeing it on video i can only assume that it was a one sided crockumentary aired on one of left leaning "main stream media" cable channels.what i've seen of the protest video from saturday's tea party/gun rally makes me ill. this is one of the most un-american protests i've ever seen.un-american??? let me tell you something you ungrateful dipshit; a large number of the participants were either retired or currently active duty military members.for your information, comrade hipps, a military member or veteran is; someone who, at one point, wrote a blank check made payable to 'the united states of america for an amount of up to and including their life.your insinuation that these people, who were exercising their constitutional rights, are un-patriotic is an unconscionable insult to anyone who has ever served this great country.the residents of alamogordo who participated in this event are an embarrassment to those of us who actually love our country.you love your country??? my ass jimmy, you don't have the slightest clue what your talking about. the citizens that participated in this permitted assembly were exercising their inalienable rights to speak, assemble and bear arms. so you think americans being americans is an embarrassment??? if that's the case jimmy then pack up you shit and relocate to a country where people share your thoughts. you are the one that is un-american kipps if you think citizens availing themselves of their rights is an anti-american act.you have the audacity to call that un-american???? in my mind that makes you one of the most ungrateful socialist bastards i have ever encountered. freedom of speech is great. i'll fight to my death to defend that right, even if i don't agree with you, but we all know you can't yell "fire" in a movie theater. freedom of speech is great with you jimmy?yes, sure, right up until someone disagrees with you then they are embarrassing and un-american.do you know how un-american you sound? apparently you are not educated enough to realize that freedom of speech also includes freedom of expression.as for not being able to yell fire in a movie theater; yes i can, if it is actually on fire or if it is not i am willing to accept the consequences for my action.fight to the death to defend my right ..... jimmy i believe you are a liar of the most pompous sort.i have heard that bullshit all my life; mostly from socialist bastards who want the government to tend to their every need and are to cowardly or inept to even take measures to support or protect their own families. people like you disgust me jimmy. be gut wrenchingly honest jimmy you wouldn't even subject yourself to a slight paper cut to defend your own family. because you sat there at your computer denigrating those that are exercising their rights, i know damn well you would not put yourself out to defend anyone against anything.the citizens in the video are what's wrong with america.alamogordo is a retirement town of approximately 40,000. a very large portion of that number is made up of currently employed or retired citizens that work for the federal government and currently on active duty or retired members of the united states armed forces.these are the citizens that you proclaim are what is wrong with america.that you would express such derogatory comments about those that served to preserve your right to be an asshole, i find you to be an ungrateful bastard. if you happen to be a veteran yourself i find you utterly disgusting in that you would express this notion about people you may have served with.how can anyone want to deny people health insurance? no one wants to deny anyone anything comrade. what we want is our elected officials to do is honor the oath they took to obey the constitution. jimmy i defy you to show me in the constitution where congress has the power to enact the current health-care proposal. and don't give me that "for the general welfare" clause either as that dog don't hunt!"congress has not unlimited powers to provide for the general welfare but only those specifically enumerated."-- thomas jeffersonin case you missed it, or likely you were not even taught it in public school, thomas jefferson was one of the authors of the constitution and i think he explains it in clear english what they meant. don't you jimmy?how does gun ownership play into the debate?jim, i guess you are too singular minded to realize that the event was a government approved multi purpose gathering of patriotic americans exercising a number of their inalienable rights . jimmy are you so ignorant as to think that we can or should only be able to exercise one right at a time?what practical purpose does it serve to own an ar-15?i realize that this may be above your level of intelligence but, who needs a purpose to do anything legal?what practical purpose does it serve to own a motor car that can go 140 miles an hour?comrade hipps this is america, i am under no requirement to explain to you or anyone else what practical purpose i have for doing anything that is my right and is legal to do so.just because you assume nanny-ship over me does not make it so. you sir, are a busy body who's time would be better spent minding his own business instead of worrying how others engage in lawful activity.what purpose, other than the incitement of violence against a "black president" and our nation, does bringing a gun to a tea party serve?excuse me !!!!!!!!!!!!!! back that up with facts jimmy. i believe you are a political provocateur.how dare you make such an assessment of those that at one point, wrote a blank check made payable to 'the united states of america for an amount of up to and including their life? where in anything written or otherwise can you claim the veracity of that statement?  that statement is equivalent to the "yelling fire in a crowded theater" that you referenced in your uninformed letter. here is an other quote from someone who actually wrote the constitution;"that the said constitution shall never be construed to authorize congress to infringe the just liberty of the press or the rights of conscience; or to prevent the people of the united states who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms ... "-- samuel adams, debates and proceedings in the convention of the commonwealth of massachusetts, at 86-87 (pierce & hale, eds., boston, 1850) bet you didn't learn that in public school did you? last i knew, the president and his staff are americans, just like those of us who are ashamed of such blatant ignorance as displayed in alamogordo.last i knew comrade those participating in that peaceful permitted assembly were americans as well. many of whom are military members or veterans who, at one point, wrote a blank check made payable to 'the united states of america for an amount of up to and including their life.  obviously, education is not an important issue in alamogordo š a part of america that is truly an embarrassment.in reality comrade jimmy education is an important issue in alamogordo. we want our children educated in the history of this great country. it is obvious that they are not getting it from public education so it behooves those concerned citizens in alamogordo and communities all over this country to take the education of their children on themselves.what better way to educate our youth on the constitution than to publicly demonstrate the right to; speech, expression, peaceful assembly and keep and bear arms.it appears that you, comrade kipps, are too stupid to recognize the real america when you see it. i suggest that you educate yourself on the constitution, our founding fsthers and their intent before you pen anymore unfounded drivel.it is you sir, that is an embarrassment to this great nation, not those that understand what the constitution and bill of rights really means.no wonder so many parents are choosing to home-school their children.

and now for the reach around





i can understand olympia snowe bending over for emperor reid as 57% of maine voted for the current administration and its political agenda. she voted the way a majority of people in her state wanted her too. that is the way it should be.no ky jelly for nebraskansconversely benedict nelson betrayed the 57% of nebraskans that voted against the current administration and its political agenda.for those that claim that this legislation won't cost the taxpayers any extra money forget, aren't aware or just don't care that much of this atrocity is unconstitutional. as soon as it is signed into law a very large number of state attorneys general are going to challenge it in court. especially the "special dispensation" nelson got for nebraska.still no ky jellytaxpayer funds on both sides of this issue will be spent on lawyers over the next several years. the only ones who will ever benefit from this, is not the young, elderly or sick, it will be the attorneys that spend the next however many years fighting this out in court.these legal b/millions are only a small portion of what this bill will cost taxpayers.now benny wants to give us a reach aroundif benny really really believed what he did was the best right thing he could have done for nebraskans then he would not need to schedule television time during a nebraska football game.who are who trying to stroke with this reach around ben? the left that turned on you or the 57% of nebraskans you betrayed.ben most nebraskans want you out of office asap, ruining their bowl game with your pathetic whining is only going to piss them off even more. people from both sides of the political aisle watch sports to escape politics for a short time. we don't need you interrupting our celebration to explain why you bent us over without lubrication.ben you took an oath to follow the constitution and represent the will of the people; this point you have done neither and it is going to cost us millions in just legal fees alone.ben, we know what you did, we know why you did it. just when the 150 million dollar offensive odor of nukegate was about gone you crapped in your own backyard again ben. we are going to have to put up with the stench of your vote selling for a very long time.since it is likely our money being used to fund this game day abomination keep your reach around ben, we don't want.
