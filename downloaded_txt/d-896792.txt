what's new


large jaw couplings
large jaw couplings are now being offered for bore sizes up to 1-3/4” or 45 mm and torque capacities of 2,655 in-lbs (300 nm). these new large jaw couplings are designed for use in precision systems with high deceleration and acceleration curves, such as those found in semiconductor, solar, conveyor, and warehouse automation applications.

pre-assembled modular mounting systems
pre-assembled modular mounting systems are designed for adjustability across many mounting applications. conveyor mounting systems emphasize strict parallel installation using a flange-bolt base and a conveyor rail guide. sensor mounting systems offer flexibility in a mounting application with adjustable or 90-degree connectors, two-way bases, and various mounting brackets. both systems include stainless steel rods (with or without scale) from 100mm to 300mm in length, zinc clamping levers, and connectors that allow adjustment of the rods’ position.

mountable shaft collars with face holes
mountable shaft collars with face holes are designed to mate directly with components such as sprockets, pulleys, and metallic plates. ruland manufactures them with drilled holes for mounting flexibility or threaded holes for the most secure connection between the collar and mated component. they are offered in steel, aluminum, and 303 stainless steel in bore sizes ranging from 3/8” to 2” and 10mm to 50mm.

mountable shaft collars with face holes


mountable shaft collars with face holes are designed to mate directly with components such as sprockets, pulleys, and metallic plates. ruland manufactures them with drilled holes for mounting flexibility or threaded holes for the most secure connection between the collar and mated component. they are offered in steel, aluminum, and 303 stainless steel in bore sizes ranging from 3/8” to 2” and 10mm to 50mm.

clamp universal joint


clamp style universal joints improve over set screw style because they do not mar the shaft, offer infinite adjustability, and can be used on all shaft types. ruland is the only north american supplier of clamp style universal joints and manufactures the clamp feature, bores, and keyways in our advanced manufacturing facility in marlborough, ma usa. they are available in sizes from 1/4" to 1 1/4” in steel for high strength and stainless steel for corrosion resistance.

 more information




technical article


vibration, impact loads, and noise are likely to be important considerations in most environments, and a common way to mitigate these factors is by using vibration isolation mounts and rubber bumpers.
