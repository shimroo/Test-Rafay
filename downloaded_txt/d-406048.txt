          social
awesome dog!


 yespup's 
           veterinary recommended dog training 
          programs offer personalized obedience, socialization 
          and behavior problem solving. over 30 years, our professional 
          certified trainer has trained thousands of dogs and owners! 
with a variety 
          of skills and education, our trainer is able to use methods 
          and tools that work for you and your dog(s). 
          we typically begin with the yespup form of positive 
          motivational, positive reinforcement
techniques (based on our modification of "clicker training" 
          or "positive behavior shaping") which sets the dog up to succeed. 
          this makes for our motto: real. simple. training.
we train 
          dogs and people. from business executive to student, from stay at home 
          parent to single college person, we teach everyone. 
          every client learns how to have their dog respond to them and the members 
          in their household. this creates a strong bond between dog and owners, 
          and it leads to a lifetime of a solid relationship 
          and true bonding 
          with the family's "best friend."
many 
          of our clients have dogs who regularly inteact with children, within 
          their family or neighborhood. to help prevent dogs from being rehomed 
          or abandoned, we train them to be well behaved and mannered around children.
(and we teach parents and grandparents how to teach children to 
          be respectful of dogs.) we teach dogs to respond 
          to voice commands and body language
typical of children! this is vital when training around young 
          children who tend to have unintelligible speech. one client mentioned 
          "our dog obeys our 18 month old son so well, now our son thinks 
          all dogs know hand signals!"

          our methods are simple and gentle, training 
          can begin the moment you get your new puppy or adult dog. 
          it's never too early or late to begin a training program.
behavior 
          problems in dogs are sadly, quite common. unfortunately, we humans learn 
          to accept of our canine friends' flaws instead of fixing them. some 
          quickly and easily solved behavior problems 
          are:




pulling on leash
house soiling
barking
digging
destructive chewing
jumping up
play biting
escaping doorway
running away




separation anxiety & issues
shyness
stealing and "counter surfing"
general disobedience
even some forms of aggression




dogs love 
          to learn. it's actually boredom that creates many bad habits. from five 
          weeks old to fifteen+ years, every dog can 
          be trained!
at yespup 
          we love training our clients to train their 
          dogs. our primary focus is keeping dogs in their homes where 
          they can participate as loved and cared for family members. we hope 
          that we may help you create a best friend 
          in your new puppy or beloved older dog.
let 
          us help you find the right solution for 
          your household and your dog create a balanced 
          relationship to last a lifetime!
