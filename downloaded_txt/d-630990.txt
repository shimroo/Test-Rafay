adon jamal robinson





he's here...yay! adon jamal robinson made his appearance on 11/12/08 at 2:30 pm.weight: 7lbs, 10ozslength: 20 inchesmy water broke around 6:30 that morning, we got the kids ready and dropped them off to school, got breakfast and made it to the hospital by 9:00 am. they confirmed that my water had broken (it was actually a high leak as they could still feel the bag). one of my biggest fears was that i would have to be given pitocin, which i let my dr. know i did not want. well, seeing that my water had broken and was steadily coming out, i wasn't really contracting...so, they gave me pitocin to bring on the contractions. i felt a good 3 contractions and was like, "bring on the epidural". after i got the epidural, it was easy breezy. i was numb all over and good and drowsy. the epidural was administered at 12:30 and at 2:30, two pushes later, adon was here. thanks to everyone for all of your prayers and kind words throughout this pregnancy.adon's photo albumsabriya

it's a new day in america!





i am so excited about the huge possibility of having our first african american family in the white house! i am so proud of where we've come although there a lot of people who are letting me down. there are more people than i care to admit that did not go out and cast their vote during this pivotal and historic moment...just because. no valid reason, just lazy. oh well, god says that he puts one up and brings the other down. so, i believe that god's will will be done tonight as the numbers keep coming in. go obama!we did it, president-elect obama! what a proud day!

health update





hi everyone-i've missed keeping up with everyone and their journey's. i have a few minutes of calm so i thought i'd post. adon and i are doing well. i am now 30 wks, it's been 6 wks since i was placed on bed rest. how time flies!  adon last weighed 3lbs and 6 ozs and is long as ever! he is definitely going to be a big boy and i can't wait for him to get here. for those that noticed the change in the spelling of his name, i changed it from aidon to adon because i wanted him to have a name with a biblical meaning. adon means lord or ruler. so now, i have a rick the ruler (my 10 yr old) and adon the ruler :) take care everyone and thanks for all your prayers and kind thoughts!sabriya and adon

bedrest





well, the dr has put me on bedrest due to complications with my pregnancy so i will be unable to take any new clients or maintain my existing clients until after i have the baby.  the fact that my baby is in danger and that i can't continue on this journey with mrs. pat, drea and eva really saddens me but i wouldn't be able to take it if something happened to my baby because i was being hard-headed. the next two weeks are crucial for me as statistics say that the baby will only have a 10% survival rate if born between 24 and 26 weeks. i'm 24 weeks now. the rate jumps up to 75% after 26 weeks but as my son said, our baby has a 100% rate no matter when he comes...that blessed me so because we know that the power of life and death lies in the tongue? keep us in your prayers! take care.here is a 3d shot of mr aidon jamal robinson...i was so surprised b/c he looks like me!

eva's sl install and baby update





eva's sl locking session:i'm super late with this posting but i was hoping that i would be able to upload pics when i posted. the pictures will be coming very soon though. eva had about 5 to 6 inches of natural hair and it took us 13 hours to complete her install. i wasn't feeling too great on the first day of the install, thanks for hanging in there with me eva! i didn't eat that morning as i don't really have much of an appetite at 6:30 am so at about 10 or so, i felt my hands start shaking...i forced myself to eat the following morning and will continue to do so with every install so that i won't feel that way again, no fun. anyhow, i made up some of the lost time the next day as i felt great that day.baby update:i am 21 weeks along and it is definitely a boy! aidon has become very active over the last few months and i love to feel him moving around in there. i can't wait until he gets here but the first 6 months have totally flown by and i'm huge as ever. i hate to think how big i'll be in my 8th and 9th months...

mrs. pat 's follow up visit





mrs. pat came two weeks after her initial locking session for her follow up visit and alot of the locks in the back were out. we will have to train her hair and watch it very closely due to her texture. but, i was pleasantly pleased when she walked in the door to see how her hair had filled in, it was gorgeous. sorry, i didn't even think to take a picture but i will next time, i promise ;>

eva's consultation





eva is so funny to me. i thought i was excited to get my sl's but she (and drea) have me slap on hold. i love it though, sl's will do you like that. we have chatted on the phone and via email a few times.  eva will have her hair locked on july 4th and 5th. she has not had a perm for about a year so she has a few permed ends but not many. she's already let me know what look she's going for. she loves golden_08's locks. i do too, they are fierce. oh, she just had a little boy too and you all know that i'm expecting too. she' brought brendon with her to the consultation. i was able to hold and love on him...i can't wait until my little man gets here. his name is going to be aidon jamal...what do you think?

i have pictures





it took us 14 hrs to install mrs. pat's sl's. she was a true champ! her hair gave me a bit of a challenge because it was so soft and had a loose curl to it but we did it! i will watch her really close to minimize the amount of slippage she may have. i can't wait to do my next client!

how i love my clients





i had a new retighten client today and we just clicked. she bought work with her and didn't get a chance to touch it. we talked the entire time. we had so much in common. that's what i love about my business. although my body may be a little tired, i always feel completely satisfied once i complete a client's hair. this is so gratifying, it's the best. to all of my fellow consultants that are looking to become full time, it is so worth it! i love sisterlocks ;> well, i'm going to bed now, i have a client coming at 7 am so we can start the full locking session.night...

my hair





well, i have been pressing my hair for the last year or so after i took my sl's down. i couldn't figure out how to manage my loose natural hair but i didn't want a perm so i started to get it pressed. it was so long and pretty and then i had to go and put permanent color in it. it totally altered the texture of my hair. the body was gone and so was the beauty of my hair (to me). anyhow, i have just continued to press it although i knew that it was damaged because when i shampoo my hair, some of the ends were still straight and would never revert back. anyhow, i haven't pressed my hair for about a month or so and i just can't take it anymore. it looks so damaged because those ends are bone straight while the rest was kinky. well, i took the scissors out and just started cutting.it's just hair right, it'll grow back. i will have to go to someone to let them even it out for me but i'm going to let it grow out a little first. i cut a lot off but it was needed. now, it'll be able to grow healthy and so much quicker. i'll keep you updated. hunh, what does this have to do with sl's...i'm still considering getting a second set but i want to court my loose natural for a while first ;>if you are interested in how my journey goes, you can check on me at, http://private.fotki.com/naturalyfree/1/loose-natural-hair/ .night...

starter locks for children





for those looking for a more affordable option for starting locks in your childs hair, there is another option that i provide, braidlocks. don't get me wrong, sl's is the best option imo but braidlocks does provide a great option for starter locks. the new growth would be interlocked  during retightening sessions. it wouldn't be the same as the sl interlocking process but it will help to lessen the amount of slippage that beginning locks experience. if this is an option that may interest you, give me a call today to set up a free consultation at 678) 887-9912.

alertpay





not so sure about alertpay. it has been almost two weeks and i'm still waiting for the two small deposits to show up in my bank to verify my account. if it is taking this long to make two small deposits, how long would it be to extract money out of their system. nah, iill stick with paypal...

tossing and turning





i can't sleep! on top of the fact that i have to use the restroom 20 times in an hour, my mind just won't rest. it is constantly moving. i just want to thank god for his blessings and how he is opening the door for me to receive clients. i just set up a consultation for a young lady from dc for 7/26.  as i was online working last night (i call consider visiting blogs and answering questions/posting messages working to grow my sl biz) joel olsteen was on in the background. i didn't catch it all then i realized that the message was indeed for me. he was talking about god blessing you to do just what it is you desire to do. the reason why i haven't received that promotion is because god has greater things for me than to just become a sr. analyst. i have been trying to get promoted for the last year or so and couldn't understand why it hadn't happened yet.  if i would have received that promotion, my focus would have turned to learning my new position so that i could be all that i could be. i realize now that that is not my future and i praise god for the revelation each and every day. i will walk out on faith and trust him who knows the plans he has for my life. i love you lord and am humbly grateful and i accept this honor/task/responsibility with great regard for your people. may god bring each and every one of you the desires of your hearts as well! until next time...sabriya

another possible client...yay





for the last two days, pat and i have been playing phone tag. i wasn't sure who she was but my intuition told me that she was calling in reference to her hair. well, we finally got in touch with each other , she was responding to an email that i sent her. she had looked me up on the sl website a few months ago and sent me an email. well, she wasn't ready at that time but i was going through my old emails and any of them that were related to sl's, i sent a new email announcing my promotional prices. she is ready but she feels that she needs to let her hair grow out a little more. when she describes her hair to me though, i think it's long enough now. anyhow, she's coming over this saturday for a consultation and if it's long enough, we'll put the sample locks in and she'll schedule her locking session. i'm so excited...how could i have put this on the back burner...
