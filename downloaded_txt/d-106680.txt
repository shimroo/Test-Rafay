5,000 to fight cancer!

























































































monday, february 1, 2010










day one:  well here we go, time to start with a new approach.  so far 2010 has started off with the best of intentions.  all resolutions, while conveniently occurring at the beginning of a new year, incidentally have come out of me simply being sick and fed up with the way things in my life were going.  or not going for that matter.  so, i have decided to start this online journal.  partially out of curiosity as to what this whole other world of blogging is all about, and also in part as a way of holding myself accountable.

i hope to use this blog to help me reach my goal this year.  raise $5000 in the fight against cancer.  it started out on a small scale last year.  i competed in the denver tri for a cure, just for fun.  since then it seems that if i am going to do this, why not do it for a cause.  and therein started the snowball.
