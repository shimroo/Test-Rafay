featured items
pump stuffer $179.95 
$179.95 this is a fiberglass part that was used in the late 1980’s racing and ras vintage has brought this back for the kawasaki x2, sx and sc (super chicken) watercraft! increases the overall pump performance for the craft. its installed by either fiber glassing the part in or glueing in as well. both will work fine but we prefer to glass the stuffer in for that professional look!
“prepreg” carbon hoods!
kawasaki 800sxr $799.00 taking pre orders as these are hand delivered from thailand where the factory is located.

all new “prepreg” carbon hoods for the kawasaki 800 sxr watercraft! the hoods weight 8 lbs! lower the center of gravity of your craft for better handling and a very cool look! email or text to pre order yours and details.
