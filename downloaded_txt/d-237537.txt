cover-upsnot all tattoos are desirable for a lifetime. however, laser tattoo removal can be an extremely costly and painful process, when in many cases, it is possible to tattoo over problematic ink to create a work of art. tattoo cover ups have become increasingly popular for a variety of reasons, especially as high-quality, precise tattoo artwork has become more readily available.

piercingspiercers maintain a clean, sterile, professional and well-organized workspace. no piercing guns are used for piercing due to the fact that they can not be autoclave sterilized.
