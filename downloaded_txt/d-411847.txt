about firstchoice 







 firstchoice group has been in business globally since 1976. we commenced operations in canada as a corporation in aug 2000 and since then have been in the business of managing all levels of procurement services for all canadian federal & provincial govt agencies including department of national defense. no single company in canada quotes more solicitations than us and we average about 350 a month.in addition to this, we also quote tenders for oil companies, petrochemical companies, united nations, world bank etc. firstchoice group canada is your competitive alternative to the major supply houses. for materials, firstchoice group canada enjoys an overall advantage due to our lower overhead, operating efficiencies and our supplier/manufacturer relationships. the fact that we are a “reseller” allows manufacturers to quote firstchoice group canada discount prices no higher, and in some cases quite lower, than our competitors…. 
















we provide innovative product solutions for sustainable progress. 



here is important that you state all your requirements and our team of engineers with a lot of experience will present you with the possible solution for your needs
