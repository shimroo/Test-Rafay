being new to buying silver it was hard to get information to purchase as a professional. with the help of lear capital my first purchase worked out satisfactorily. due to the help and information received i feel confident in doing business with them. the purchase was delivered fast and complete.

they provided exactly the service, and the product, that they promised in a timely manner. their telephone sales consultant, joanne, was knowledgeable, forthright and charming. in the future, i will be purchasing additional precious metals from joanne and lear capital.
