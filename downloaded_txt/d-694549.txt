march 3, 2023 janet perkins 


as technology advances, so does the world of exhibitions. exhibitions are no longer just physical spaces that showcase artifacts and information; they are interactive, immersive experiences that engage visitors on multiple levels. the future of exhibitions will see a continued focus on incorporating technology and creating personalized experiences for visitors. in this blog post, we will explore the latest trends and technologies shaping the future of exhibitions.
virtual and augmented reality
virtual and augmented reality are becoming increasingly prevalent in the world of exhibitions. these technologies provide visitors with a unique and immersive experience that goes beyond what is possible with traditional displays. virtual reality allows visitors to explore a virtual space and interact with exhibits in a way that feels almost like the real thing specially for marketing conventions. augmented reality, on the other hand, enhances the physical environment by overlaying digital information or graphics on real-world objects.
personalization and customization
one-size-fits-all exhibits are a thing of the past. in the future, exhibitions will be personalized and customized to meet the needs and interests of individual visitors. this could mean creating tailored experiences based on a visitor’s age, gender, or cultural background. it could also mean allowing visitors to choose their own path through an exhibition, selecting exhibits and information that are most relevant to them.
sustainability and eco-friendliness
sustainability and eco-friendliness are becoming increasingly important in all aspects of life, including exhibitions. the future of exhibitions will see a focus on reducing waste, conserving energy, and using sustainable materials in exhibit design. exhibitions will also aim to educate visitors on environmental issues and encourage them to adopt more sustainable behaviors in their daily lives.
lastly
the future of exhibitions is exciting, with new technologies and trends transforming the way we learn and engage with the world around us. virtual and augmented reality, personalization and customization, and sustainability are just a few of the key areas where we can expect to see significant developments in the years to come. by embracing these trends and technologies, exhibitions will continue to be a vital and valuable tool for education, entertainment, and social change.

what is an exhibit?
in the world of art, we have exhibitions. these are a great way to find out about new art, to gather inspiration, and to see works that are not always so easy to see in person. exhibit hall is a community-based art gallery dedicated to presenting contemporary art, exhibiting local and international works in a variety of media.  
the art world is filled with museums and galleries. they show off the work of artists, and they all have different styles. some of these museums are filled up with the art of one or two artists, while others are filled with the art of many artists, and each has its own niche. but, while each style has its own purpose, they all serve a similar purpose: to make you think. exhibit design is no exception. exhibit design professionals are tasked with helping events become more engaging, memorable, and successful. the exhibits we create are the building blocks of these successes. exhibit design is about people, not pixels, and it’s not an exact science. to achieve successful outcomes, exhibit design professionals must be able to get inside the heads of the subjects they are designing for.
if you have been to a museum before, you know that there are some very cool exhibits in this world. some of the coolest exhibits can be found in popular museums like the louvre and the smithsonian. there are many reasons to attend an exhibit! one of the biggest benefits of attending an exhibit is meeting your neighbors, and a great way to meet your neighbors is through a neighborhood block party.
attend an exhibit, and you’ll get to see an array of incredible materials in real life and on display for your viewing pleasure. you’ll also get to meet artists and other interesting people. and the best part is that you’ll have the opportunity to leave knowing you supported local and international creators.

what it takes to setup a great exhibit

january 10, 2019 janet perkins 



preparing
to set up an exhibit for a trade show can sometimes be very challenging and
frustrating. you certainly want to put on a great display to present yourself
in best possible manner. in order to be well prepared, you first must learn
about all the specifics of the convention where you will put the exhibit. when
you know the layout of the area then you can better plan your exhibit. be sure
to find out how big or small the space will be, whether there are enough
electrical outlets available, as well as other important details. 
things to do for putting on a great display

make display table visible by
     using a tablecloth along with nice images and attractive color schemes.
     that will make it stand out among the rest and will make visitors curious
     to see what you have to offer. arrange the display table in
     such a way that it looks attractive for the visitors. also use a nice
     presentation board, on which the visitors will read more about the
     benefits of using your products and services. include pictures and logos
     with your company name.use slide shows, pictures and
     videos to draw attention to your booth. by displaying videos on monitors
     you are guaranteed to draw attention, because videos and slide shows are
     much more effective than plain text. if you do not have such equipment
     then a good idea would be to rent it because it will pay off eventually. make sure you use social media
     platforms for promoting your booth. that way you will let potential customers
     know that you are participating in a convention and you can invite large
     number of them to visit you. good thing to do when setting
     up an exhibit at a convention is to prepare giveaways and gift
     certificates for your customers. always have handy brochures, flyers,
     business cards, magnets, pens and other things with your company name
     printed on it. give these to people so they will remember your name and
     things you offer. gift certificates are always very attractive for people
     and people will surely come back to you if you give them something for
     free at first. make sure you create a
     portfolio with your previous work as part of your exhibit. print off some
     of your top work you have previously done and show it to people. make it
     easy for visitors to flip through pages and see what you have done.
     another good idea is to have an assistant that will be there to help you
     in greeting potential customers.finally, always be the first to
     welcome visitors to your exhibit. by being friendly and welcoming you are
     showing that you care for your customers and people will definitely
     respect that. even simple `hello’ or a short welcoming speech can boost
     your reputation and credibility and will make people return back to your
     products and services. 




the best graphics for an exhibit booth

december 15, 2018 janet perkins 


            attracting
visitors to the exhibit booth is a thing that everyone wants to achieve when
attending a trade show or a convention. an effective design of exhibit booth is
very important for getting the attention of the visitors and maximizing your
brand`s exposure. visitors are moving fast, so you need something to quickly
communicate your message to the attendees at the convention. goals that you
should achieve when present at convention is to generate more leads, increase
the awareness for your brand, generate sales, attract more visitors and
successfully promote your products and services. 

things to
consider when designing an exhibit booth
            before
designing your booth, you first need to consider important things that will
help you. you should make an online research and check which components are
important that you need to include in your exhibit booth. remember that most
impactful booths are those that have bold graphics, have large signs that draw
the attention of the convention visitors, have captivating colors and
interactive elements. 
            when
it comes to which graphics work best for an exhibit booth, you should know that
graphics are probably the most important part of the booth design. graphics can
make or break any booth, so having good graphics is a must for capturing the
visitors’ attention. if the graphics are good then you will certainly get large
volume of traffic towards your exhibit booth. 
            first
and most important thing regarding graphics is to use colors that are easily
noticeable and that stand out from the crowd. the color scheme must be
consistent with the marketing design of your choice. always use brighter colors
instead of neutral tones, because brighter colors will make your booth
instantly recognizable. metallic
tones are also attractive, so consider using those too. yellow, red and
orange and their various tones are some colors that tend to stand out in the
crowd.
            besides
using brighter and stronger colors, do not underestimate the importance of
proper lighting. good lighting accentuates the colors and gives the booth
better visual appeal. use the lighting in creative way together with colors for
best effect. your exhibit booth must be well-lit, allowing attendees to easily
spot all details regarding your graphics. with good lighting you can brighten
important parts of your exhibit like the promotional materials and product
displays.
            finally,
remember to keep your main message clear and to use digital graphics as well.
those two things are very important. digital graphics that are shown on large
screens can be very persuasive and can quickly grab the attention of the
visitors at the convention. showing your logo, videos of your products, as well
as some attractive changing images can attract more visitors towards your
exhibition booth. all of these are powerful tools that can make your booth
successful. make sure you consider the pointers above and use proper graphics,
signs and lighting. after that, present yourself in best possible manner and
hope for great success at the convention.
