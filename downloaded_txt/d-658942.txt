finish it up! club
no meetings! no dues! no stress! actually a stress reliever!
this will be a bit of nudge for you to finish some projects.
to help you get motivated to finish it up!, each time you complete a project, bring it (or a picture), to the quilt shop for a “show ‘n tell”. we will enter your name for that month’s drawing for a $10 gift certificate at the back door quilt shop. enter as many times as you have projects completed each month. we will draw a winning name each month.
