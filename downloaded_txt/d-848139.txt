acp s&t dialogue


demanding innovationresearchers in acp countries are facing a growing range of challenges. they are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. they are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. at the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. as the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.
differentiated s&t strategies for improving productivity of acp farming systemsacp farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the acp farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. within the last few years, the acp region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. this dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the acp region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of acp agricultural sector.

enhancing competitiveness in the acp poultry value chain







 




  
  

	
		
	  
	
	
	
	
  	






	 
  





	the poultry value chain in africa, caribbean and the pacific (acp) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. the former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in acp countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. an analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products. this summary is provided by cabi and cta, july 2012.

knowledge for development

this website supports the policy dialogue on s&t for agricultural and rural development in african, caribbean and pacific (acp) countries. it enables the acp scientific community - primarily agricultural research and development scientists and technologists, policy makers, farmers and other stakeholders and actors - to share and review results of national and regional efforts and collaborate to harness science and technology for the development of agriculture in their countries.












cta top 20 innovations that benefit smallholder farmers

by judith ann francis
	

						over the years, cta has contributed to building acp capacity to understand innovation processes, strengthen the agricultural innovation system and embed innovation thinking in agricultural and rural development strategies. the cta top 20 innovations project set out to prove that innovation is taking place in acp agriculture and in the process has demonstrated that smallholder farmers are beneficiaries as well as partners in agricultural innovation. the cta top 20 innovations that were selected from among the 251 submissions that had been received from 49 countries showcase the ingenuity of numerous stakeholders who are innovating and by their collective efforts are making a difference in the livelihoods of acp smallholder farmers and their families. 29/04/2016

food security and nutrition in the post-2015 agenda: from mdg 1 to sdg 2 - some new policy challenges and opportunities 

by bettina prato, lead global engagement specialist, strategy and knowledge department, international fund for agricultural development (ifad), rome, italy
	

						millennium development goal no. 1 (mdg1), agreed by the international community in 1990, stated that both the proportion of people in extreme poverty and the proportion who suffer from hunger should be halved between 1990 and 2015 (mdg targets 1.a and 1.c, respectively). the global agenda for sustainable development features instead a stand-alone goal that goes beyond chronic hunger and brings in the very important concept of nutrition. moreover, the second sustainable development goal (sdg2) combines food security and nutrition with sustainable and climate-resilient agriculture, and calls for a special focus on small-scale food producers (notably women farmers), recognising their major role in food systems globally. this is a novel approach compared to the mdg agenda. 27/04/2016

bio-economy and green growth: integrating farmersâ knowledge for a public goods-oriented approach

by otto schmid, susanne padel, les levidow and nic lampkin
	

						the bio-economy and green growth have been on the international policy agenda for several years. two main views prevail concerning the âbio-economyâ â an industrial perspective, and the other a public goods perspective â each promoting different futures for agricultural systems and farmersâ roles; some address both perspectives. 28/04/2016

agro-processing â a kenyan perspective: enhancing food security and farmersâ livelihoods 

by christine a. onyango and mikah nyaberi
	

						kenya is considered food-insecure, with a general deficit in production, particularly of staple foods; maize, wheat, beans, rice and sugar, and this is supplemented by imported food commodities. postharvest losses, especially of perishable produce are high, while poor postharvest handling of cereal maize and related products compromises food safety because of aflatoxin contamination putting farm families, livestock and consumers at risk, further exacerbating the food insecurity situation.kenyaâs agriculture sector development strategy (asds) contributed to a restructuring of the agricultural sector and encompasses cross-cutting issues of climate change, youth and gender engagement as well as industrialisation and finance. however, the sector continues to be negatively impacted by several binding constraints. 26/04/2016

the ethics of animal production and sustainability

by andreia de paula vieira, and raymond anthony
	

						over the last 50 years, the ethical values around animal production have steadily changed, mainly through widespread adoption of industrial and intensive practices. industrialisation and pro-productionism have taken precedence over agrarian values and farming methods emphasising material prosperity. this has displaced the ethos of independent, community farmers and pastoralists as stewards of the land and farm animals.  food safety, quality control, animal welfare and traceability practices are overarching norms and have become sites of political and economic contest, as producers and multinational agribusinesses seek to maximise product quality and economic profitability. 29/04/2016

intellectual property rights in plant breeding and the impact on agricultural innovation

by bert visser, bram de jonge
	

						in plant breeding, two types of intellectual property rights (iprs) play a major role; plant breedersâ rights (pbrs), developed between 1900 and 1950; and patent rights, which emerged with the rise of modern biotechnology. this paper examines the impact of both systems on breeders, farmers and agricultural innovation. 29/04/2016

enhancing private sector engagement in agricultural research and development in eastern africa

by michael waithaka, gerald masila, janet ngombalu, joseph methu
	

						a survey of private sector firms in eastern africa revealed that 65% of them did not allocate any budgets for research. over 50% of the firms indicated that they responded to calls for collaborative research whenever they were advertised. of the firms interviewed, 97% indicated that they knew research institutions that could address some of their business challenges. the three priority suggestions by private firms on how to improve uptake and commercialization of improved technologies were: involvement of end users in the research process; establishment of frameworks for regular interactions between researchers and industry players; and awareness creation and training for end users. 29/04/2016

can we end hunger in the post-2015 frame with food as a commodity? 

by jose luis vivero pol
	

						global hunger statistics, portraying a world that is progressing remarkably, serve to justify the dominant economic ideology (productivism, neoliberalism and privatization of resources). this text provides a careful examination of those data (undernourishment and chronic malnutrition), revealing caveats and biased interpretations. the world is not doing so well under the market-driven industrial food system and the mdg1 on hunger was clearly not achieved. the supply/demand rules will never get rid of hunger, as preached by the post-2015 sustainable development goals, since the market does not have incentives to provide food to those who do not have money to pay for such essential resource. we need a paradigm shift and social contract whereby food is considered a commons and nutrition a public good. 29/02/2016

education and training in food science and technology to enhance food security in developing nations

by donald g. mercer, obadina o. adewale and daryl b. lund
	

						the population of sub-saharan africa has been growing at an average annual rate of 2.7% in 2013, compared to 0.7% in 2013 for the usa. in 2014, the populations of nigeria and niger grew at annual rates of 2.8% and 3.9%, respectively. at the same time, the economies of many african nations have been growing at an annualized rate approaching 4% and urbanization and life expectancy have also been increasing. these trends have created new pressures, especially for achieving food security, fuelling the need for a more productive, diversified and competitive agri-food sector. 26/04/2016

transitioning from public to private sector agricultural extension: drivers, challenges and implications for policy, practice and research

by margaret najjingo mangheni, associate professor department of extension and innovation studies, college of agricultural and environmental sciences, makerere university, uganda.
	

						agricultural extension systems everywhere are experiencing unprecedented changes and transformations, accompanied with tremendous challenges for all involved. historically conceived as a public service targeting farming populations with agricultural information and technologies, the private sector and civil society are increasingly playing a role. there are new clients (including the diverse actors in entire agricultural value chains located in urban areas versus the traditional focus on rural farmers; large-scale commercial farmers as opposed to subsistence small-scale farmers, youth, women); and new messages. despite the problems with public-sector extension systems, private-sector provision will not resolve all of them. evidence supports pluralistic systems with both public and private actors performing different roles and targeting different extension needs in a coordinated manner. the transition to private sector provision needs careful planning. 26/04/2016

the ethics of innovation in agriculture: inclusivity and reflexivity

by kristal jones, research associate, national socio-environmental synthesis center, university of maryland, usa 
	

						innovation has become a buzzword in the realm of international development over the past decade. major funders such as the united state agency for international development (usaid) and united nations childrenâs fund (unicef) support âinnovation labsâ, where resources and expertise are focused on asking new research questions that build on past successes and failures. non-governmental organisations around the world facilitate and emphasise local innovations to meet local needs, in an effort to generate new ideas that are appropriate and relevant to specific places. these and other approaches to innovation in international development are influenced by the private enterprise model of start-up firms in the information technology sector, where innovation is seen to be a collaborative process that is constantly working to adapt and improve existing things, systems and ideas. as fabian and fabricant highlight, however, the orientation toward creative destruction in technology innovation, where change is constant and âfailing quicklyâ yields further innovation, does not reflect the ethical and practical realities of research and programming in international development, where human well-being is at stake. 25/04/2016

financing agricultural research for development (ard)

by isaac j. minde
	

						pouring millions of dollars in a research system does not necessarily guarantee good research and useful outputs and development. first and foremost, we need qualified, competent and motivated researchers, with necessary incentives to ensure focus on the research instead of other things. in tanzania, for example, the number of phd holders was lower in 2011 compared with 2008. this decline, gives cause for concern, especially given the importance of the agricultural sector and the value of research in addressing present and future challenges. 26/04/2016

an innovation platform approach for up-scaling banana xanthomonas wilt (xanthomonas campestris p.v. musacearum) control technologies in western kenya

by m. makelo, m. onyango, j. kwach, f. makini and m. odongo, kenya agricultural and livestock research organisation (kalro), nairobi, kenya.
	

						the innovation platform (inp) has become an attractive approach for supporting agricultural development. an inp is generally established to foster interaction amongst a wide range of stakeholders including producers, researchers, development practitioners and policy-makers, around a shared interest. this article describes how an inp in western kenya contributed to increased control of banana xanthomonas wilt (bxw). the inp approach, as an extension tool, is effective especially when the technologies are well packaged and they are considered relevant by the community involved. 25/04/2016
