case study
the demands that are placed on network environments are rising steadily: large image files, uninterrupted videos and a generally fast working website that avoids irritating the user with long waiting times. however, especially in the deployment of new software, neofonie required high levels of reliability and more bandwidth for their own projects.
given a long-term planning period of 5-10 years, a technology that is future-proof and can easily grow with the demands was needed.



neofonie – future-proof network infrastructure
as one of the largest online agencies in germany, berlin-based company neofonie accompanies local businesses on their journey to digital business. for its customers, the digital agency develops customized websites, web applications and online stores.
