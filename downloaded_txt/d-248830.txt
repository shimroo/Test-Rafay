established 1917, the max theatres is known for providing a unique moving going
                experience by dishing up a little nostalgia mixed with all the current popular films at a very reasonable price.

to our max theatre friends and patrons


due to the covid-19 virus the governor's office of iowa has issued public health disaster emergency. this emergency requires that we must not show films until further notice. we are going to try and periodically have our concession stand open for carry-out. please visit our facebook page for times and updates.
hopefully we will see you all again at the movies soon. until then, be safe and follow cdc guidelines.
