welcome!
      breastfeeding is an important women's issue, human rights issue, health issue and feminist issue. breastfeeding empowers women. women who wish to breastfeed their babies but do not, because of inadequate support from family or health workers, constraints in the workplace, or misinformation, often feel guilty because of this failure at something they wanted to do.
      breastfeedingonline.com hopes to help empower women to choose to breastfeed and to educate society at large about the importance and benefits of breastfeeding.
breastfeeding your baby will bring you a joy that words cannot express. the feeling you get when you continue to nourish your baby at your breast and see your baby grow and thrive on your milk is awesome. 
breastfeeding is a choice; i hope that you make the right choice to breastfeed your baby. there is no substitute for mothers milk. 
according to the world health organization (who) and unicef about 1.5 million babies die every year because they were not breastfed. many more millions suffer from infectious diseases and malnutrition, never reaching their full potential because they were bottlefed. 
with education and support you can successfully breastfeed your baby, happily and healthily!
