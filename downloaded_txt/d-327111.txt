over the years i have observed certain themes and issues that seem to be constant when working with people coming out of an addictive life style and have addressed some of these key issues in my book âour lives in recoveryâ. it is available below in several formats. the course is biblically based, written with a new christian believer in mind. i have used this course mainly in recovery homes because it has been the best environment to work through this material. however, whether you are taking these discipleship classes in a transitional home or a correctional institution, you should find this course helpful in working with people whose lives have been affected by incarceration or chemical abuse. additionally, each class has questions and homework assignments that can be sent in to us to receive a certificate of completion.
