tired of teaching phonics through boring worksheets and repetitive drill? action factor's sing your way through phonics program cds, mini-charts, and read-and-sing books help kids build reading foundations by capitalizing on their natural playfulness, energy, and creativity. dedicated to the principle that children learn best when they are actively involved, we ask these questions: as a child, would you rather learn phonics through rhythm and song or through workbook exercises? would you rather prepare for a test by playing a game or through traditional study and review? action factor answers these questions the same way you do. view and listen to our easy-to-use phonics education products and check them out for yourself!
