what others are saying about xojo 









 
xojo makes cross-platform development easy and affordable. compiling apps for windows, macos and linux with just one set of source code is fantastic. choosing xojo was our best software development decision!
- fred roller, fw roller & associates 


 
i've made many apps in the past with xojo, but it opened up ios to me in a familiar way as i struggled with xcode and still do. it is so easy to develop for the mac, ios, linux, and if you have to, windows. one ide, killer.
- jim ginn 






 
i think i spent more time deciding on what host name i should give the raspberry pi than what it meant to compile my application for the raspberry pi. without changing one line of code, the app fired up with no problem.
- rich hatfield 


 
xojo is quickly becoming a swiss army knife of sorts for me. it’s amazing that with one development tool, i can do so much. being able to go from concept to something that is production-ready, secure, and scalable in no time at all it a testament to xojo.
- tim dietrich 






 
xojo means a lot to me and is part of my life, it's like a best friend! thank you for providing a service second to none and for a wonderful product. xojo is the professional development software that is an absolute pleasure to use!
- gordon smith 


 
the thing that i love most about xojo is that it is so fast and so easy to go from idea to working application. not only that, but that i can use the same fast, easy language and ide to develop for so many different target platforms.
- john joyce, brennan, inc. 






 
i needed to expand into mac development after many years under windows with vb. xojo gave me a familiar working environment, without which i may never have released my mac applications. i've looked at the alternatives, and they don't come close!
- jeff tullin, ursa software 


 
i use xojo because of its broad capability for lots of platforms and any feature you might need. i have been doing lots of web app development and i like how you can approach the design similar to a desktop app without having to be an ajax guru.
- mark strickland, university of louisville 






 
xojo strikes the perfect balance between flexibility and structure. it keeps me from all the tedious things and boosts my productivity. the community and the documentation are outstandingly helpful.
- alex von siebenthal, zurich university of applied science 


 
xojo is simple and has a great interface. i don't have as much fun programming in other languages (javascript, java, c++, etc.). if you are interested in concentrating your efforts on algorithms and object oriented design - xojo is my preferred tool. 
- yvonnick macon
