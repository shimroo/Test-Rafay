paso fino hacienda guadalupe | 222
over hundreds of clients, let’s see what some have to say?
we love our clients and are fully dedicated to keeping their trust by offering outstanding after sale support!
dear ernie:
after evaluating how well my horses are doing, i felt compelled to write you this letter. training my horses with your long distance coaching has been a very satisfying experience. as you know, i have had some real and significant professional trainers working for me in the past.
i have to admit that i did learn some things from them. however, they would “fix” what was wrong without teaching me how, when and why to do things so that i could do it myself. without an “in-house” professional trainer i have come to rely on your long distance coaching. your effective techniques have proven to be unexpectedly important in preparing my horses for competition. your expertise has allowed me to have well trained, competitive horses that are ready for the show ring. you have also given me the self-confidence to handle the problems that may arise, or that i create, with my horses.
i feel that any problem that i have can be solved by simply calling you and then carrying out your well-explained instructions. i do not like to send my horses away where frequent contact and practice with them is impossible. in the past i have had misgivings about purchasing highly competitive (and expensive) horses because it is difficult to bring a quality trainer to the midwest. your succinct explanations have made it a joy to own and train my own horses.
thank youraúl e. pérez, m.d., `dear ernie:
recently, marilyn and i were in the company of a fairly well known paso fino
breeder who commented upon a show that was judged by the honarable ernie
sanz. he remarked upon your knowledge and steadfast integrity which he had
observed and about which others had told him. naturally, we were very proud to
tell him that we have been dealing with you for some time, two years when we
lived in south florida running the financial federal bank and the last two years
that we have been back here at shawnee valley ranch. i wish that you could
have heard all the good things said about you.
later, marilyn and i agreed that we should write this to you rather than just tell
you about it by telephone.
ernie, you need to know how highly regarded you are in the paso fino world, not
just in florida and latin america, but, now, up north as well.
people have come to know, as we certainly do, that you can be counted on for the
correct and honest answers to the many questions that arise in buying, training,
breeding, and showing paso finos.
thanks, ernie, for all that you have done for us over the past four years in our
program.
yours very truly,raymond t. gusnarddear ernie,
bill and i were honored to be among the first outside farms with a 222 baby and wanted you to know how very pleased we are with ‘grace’ our beautiful 222 filly out of faraona, our piloto daughter. grace is farona’s 2nd foal and we can see great differences between the two fillies. the 1st filly is linebred by milagroso del ocho.
farona is 13.3 hands, short coupled, excellent hocks with a short stocky neck. grace has a beautiful long neck with a natural head set, is somewhat longer in body, and has gaited from the minute she took her first steps and has excellent temperament. it appears that she will be more refined than farona and we believe she will be 14 hands. bill and i are very pleased with her. we can definitely see 222’s imprint on grace.
we believe the early video we sent speaks for her: she is with farona and you can see the contrast. everyone that has seen the video or her has reacted the same: each have raved over how nice she is and what great conformation and gait she has.
we have bred two other mares to 222 for ’97 babies. la diosa de la molienda, our linebred resorte mare that gave us guala de classico, who is now shoing so well in puerto rico. we are anxiously awaiting this birth. we also bred cari selfa de la libertad (mayoral x cari sello la melodial) who has produced 4 very nice fillies out of classico and we are hoping for a beautiful 222 filly out of her in 97.kim m. casano-ware
