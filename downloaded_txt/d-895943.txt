transform your life by telling the truth


get your introduction to radical honesty now
















  

radical honesty is a pragmatic, functional path to reduce human suffering through sharing in depth and detail what you feel, what you think, what you have done, and what you want. based on the bestselling book by dr. brad blanton, the practice of radical honesty is not to be confused with a moral obligation to tell the truth. it is a way to liberate yourself from being at the mercy of your untrustworthy reactive mind and to get to a place where you forgive other people and yourself at the same time.

the best way to heal the past, reduce stress, and revitalize yourself, is to tell the truth.
  











radical honesty means simply to report out loud to another what you notice in front of you, in your body, and in your mind in the present moment.



 











radical honesty offers you a process to directly express and get over anger, reach full body forgiveness, and create real connection with others.



 











radical honesty is a practice through which you bring bold self expression and new, creative energy into your life and relationships.








   

being radically honest means you tell the people in your life what you’ve done and plan to do, what you think, and what you feel. it’s the kind of authentic sharing that creates the possibility of love, intimacy, aliveness, and action. 

  

a few words from people who are practicingradical honesty in their lives

































“i love the radical honesty community and the changes i’ve observed in my life as a result of being involved in it. i’ve done a lot of so called “self-development” work and have enjoyed most of it, but find that radical honesty has made the biggest difference for me.i appreciate that there are no gimmicks - it doesn’t claim to be a miracle fix, doesn’t claim that all my problems will magically disappear and i’ll never feel sad or angry ever again. as brad says, “it works pretty good most of the time.” and that’s been my experience. when i do the work, and i practice radical honesty and commit myself to telling the truth, even when i’m scared, i find i feel lighter, and generally happier.” -tony



“my life and my relationships after i started practicing radical honesty, have changed a lot. my experiences with the people around me are completely different. they’re deep and nice and easy [most of the time], and i can express whatever i want to, and the other person can do the same. that’s very much a feeling of freedom.” -begoña



"practicing radical honesty has helped me to experience my life with more freedom. i literally feel "lighter" in my life. i have found that the thoughts in my head about telling the truth and what will happen if i do tell the truth are so much scarier than what actually happens when i do get the courage to speak my scariest truths. i learned that if i can allow myself to feel uncomfortable for a relatively short period of time when i tell the truth, i am then free from these scary thoughts and the anxiety associated with these thoughts. i'm much less anxious than i used to be and have developed a more connected feeling to the people i tell the truth. i highly recommend this practice to anyone who feels like they are always worried and consumed with thoughts! there is so much freedom on the other side of telling my truth!!" -dan

what they're saying about the books






testimonials





















“just what we need—a book that finally celebrates the healing power of truth! our culture and world will grow radically different as parents get real with their kids, kids get real with teachers, teachers get real with politicians, and politicians get real with the flowing truth of the world. thanks, brad, for your deep commitment.”~ kathlyn hendricks, ph.d.,co-author of conscious loving andthe conscious heart






















“brad's honesty is so refreshing and liberating. his work is about true love and living the truth. i recommend his books to all lovers of authenticity.”~ joan tollifsonauthor of awake in the heartland and bare-bones meditation






















"the kind of love that is possible after somebody tells the truth (in the way brad defines telling the truth), is a whole different animal—fresher, looser, deeper, sweeter, wilder, stronger—than what usually passes for love.”~ grace llewellyn,author of the teenage liberation handbook, co-author of guerrilla learning






















"radical honesty is a means of helping me to lift the veil of my opinion and judgment…a tool to help me wake up from this dream. so that, at last, i can forgive myself, and consequently all others, and love completely. i am the source of all of that.”~ leo burmesteractor, les miserables, the abyss, the last temptation of christ
