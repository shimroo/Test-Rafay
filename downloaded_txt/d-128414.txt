“amazing guided adventure with haley and teagan!! stopped at tom thompson island to see the totem pole, cookie snack and dock swim! then on to whiskey bay and saw a bull moose from the canoe! our guides were patient and taught the kids proper techniques. safe and fun!! super recommend. the pup loved it too!”

"thank you for such a great experience, the staff was super helpful and knowledgeable. we didn’t feel rushed at all. they took their time explaining and helping us find the perfect ski gear for my husband. thanks again to all of the guys that worked there tonight and to all the staff for being so kind."
- cindy b.
 



"must-go place for kayak/canoe rent. we’ve been looking for a kayak tour and found algonquin outfitters, huntsville. you can rent guided or self-guided tours there. we rent two kayaks there to do a self tour around hunters bay to the narrows. thank you for your great and kind service!"

"great service! very helpful even with tying up the canoe to our van. will definitely be back! price was great, canoe was in great condition. were also helpful in showing me how to tie the canoe up when by myself. thanks so much for a great experience!"
- jeff k.
 



"i had a great experience at algonquin outfitters in huntsville thanks to the wonderful customer service from bob. i purchased new equipment, used equipment, and also left some of my previously loved equipment on consignment to be sold for store credit. bob was knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. he patiently took more than an hour to discuss various options and price points, and took the time to size my two children to fit properly into their new skis and boots. i highly recommend algonquin outfitters for your new and used ski equipment."
- carol mk
