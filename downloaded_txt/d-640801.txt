 saltus river grill4.6based on 445 reviewspowered by googlereview us onbryan duff01:26 04 jun 20great manhattan cocktail with whiskey cherries.  i had the special: bouillabaisse with tilefish, perfectly cooked scallops and shell fish with a yellow tomato base.  plus dipping bread covered in bacon jam.  fantastic, best meal in recent memory.  truffle fries with bearnaise sauce and parmesan.  patio seating over looking over the beauford marina under old oak trees.  my server terry was well timed with perfect service.  thank you for making it worth every penny.deb laufer16:41 05 mar 20nice ambience.  service wasn't all that fantastic (although she was very nice).  sushi was good.  but just didn't see anything to make me want to go back.  i think everyone liked what they got fine, but that's about it.naomi aldrich14:37 14 feb 20my husband and i came here for the first time the day before valentine's day because they were fully booked. well that is for a reason. this up scale restaurant was a nice atmosphere right on the bay. our meals were amazing and the drinks were perfect. we sat at the bar and the staff were busy but were super friendly and attentive! we will definitely be coming back! love this place!!walt nowakowski02:10 13 feb 20wonderful.  every  course was delicious. the presentation of each dish was great and more eye catching than expected.  the staff is confident and knowledgeable. food was excellent.  our waiter, joey did  a tremendous job taking care of us. four of us had dinner and each of us loved this place.suzanne chesser11:57 12 feb 20great dinner spot on the river! this was recommended to us by our host at our b & b, we were not disappointed. the ambiance, not too noisy ( my husband has a hearing problem), but it has a fun vibe! i had the shrimp and grits.... grits were so dreamy and smooth with the right amount of kick to it. highly recommend this!rick rollins01:09 14 jan 20we ordered off the special menu for beaufort restaurant week. the meal was excellent. we ate at the bar. the bartender was very nice and pleasant, but a little slow taking our drink orders. if he were a bit more attentive it would be 5 starsdale william neal13:04 08 jan 20definitely a nice spot. a little on the pricey side, but the service and food were wonderful.melody probert12:32 09 dec 19we sat on the patio, which i highly recommend if it's warm enough, and at some places service outside lacks but not here. our server was highly knowledgeable, gave great recommendations, took the time to explain dishes and kept our glasses filled. our steaks were absolutely perfect! i had the steak salad and it was glorious!! i still have dreams about it and will be having it again very soon. saltus is the place you go for a special experience and you won't regret it.john fears16:53 01 dec 19i adore this venue a lot. theres a different mood. the kitcen is superb. the service is efficient and the team is polite. the cost is decent. truly recommend.jonathan cooper01:35 01 dec 19you could pay so much more and not get so great a meal!  chicken and dumplings?  donâ€™t let the imagery fool you.  itâ€™s a lovely deboned breast, apparently stuffed with a bit of sausage under the skin and broiled over a lovely bed of fresh peas and carrots and gnocchi with a savory sauce.  and yes virginia, there is such a thing as gourmet grits. youâ€™ll find them here with a carefully prepared topping of shrimp sautÃ©ed in butter with mushrooms and perhaps shallots.carter swenson18:47 20 nov 19been there several times now. each time has been great. my dad lives close-by and we get treated like royalty. everyone in the place including the workers seem to be enjoying themselves.shannon reuter14:48 16 nov 19one of our absolute favorite dinner spots in beaufort.  service and food are always fantastic. i'm no southern girl and i dont "do" grits, but the saltus river grill has the most spectacular creamy grits with stewed tomatoes and i get them every timeaustin floyd01:05 03 nov 19great service and amazing food. the local oysters were fantastic, surprisingly briny which i love with a cocktail sauce with a perfectly heavy amount of pepper i couldn't get enough of.the beef carpaccio was the best i've ever held, and i've had a good bit from many countries. the wood fired dorado topped with lump crab was great, nice and tender.key lime pie dessert was nice and tangy, though i do wish the serving was slightly larger as the slice was pretty thin.overall really enjoyed the food, but do be prepared to open the wallet wide. but with that said, i'll still be back!ann hyde20:00 31 oct 19delicious seafood and sushi. great service and a view of the water. what more could you want?larry r21:35 24 oct 19the menu is varied and full.  everything i ate there on october 23,2019 was cold.  they kept bringing it to the table warning me that the food and plate were too hot to touch, which was funny bc none of the food was.  they apologized and even sent one dish back and it was still cold when it came back.  i think they were just having a bad night.  i'd still recommend.holly epley11:41 17 aug 19the hostess was very rude as they had literally 2 tables with people in them and people at the bar.... the whole left side of the bar area had tables available and outside was open she was not thrilled to see or sit us anywhere. then i asked about the open area and she said that was for a party of 14 reservations at 6:30 ok thatâ€™s fine but what about the ones to the right or the bar? plenty of space for 2 people. will not recommend this restaurant to anyone as rude as the hostess was.  as a manager iâ€™d hope someone would have a talk with her. cause the servers are missing out on money if not seated properly...ann vishy18:38 12 aug 19we have experienced great food, great service, great atmosphere while dining at saltus river grill. the excellent food and service they provided for our daughterâ€™s pre-wedding festivities 8 years ago is still consistent today. always a must for our beaufort visits. excellent!caryn desmond21:29 27 jul 19visited this restaurant twice during our stay in beaufort as it was so good. food was great, loved the blackened dorado was very tasty.  lovely patio area to sit and watch the sun go down over the water. very friendly and helpful staff. would definitely recommend a visit.vanessa tate14:53 24 jul 19ordered sushi and seafood, everything was super fresh and the dishes were incredibly interesting. service was above and beyond. the outside space is beautiful if weather permits. perfect date night place, even if a tad pricey, it's worth it.j juice01:34 07 jul 19the food is great and the best thing is that the food is not salty. wait staff is well trained and knowledgeable. awesome ambiance!j root15:06 25 may 19all in all we were happy with saltus.my only gripe was the teeny portion of crab soup and then the lack of actual crab - woefully disappointed for the $ spent.now onto positive items.mixed drinks were solid.  old fashioned and chili margarita.my dorado was cooked perfectly and my sweetheart enjoyed her sushi.we'll be back...  just gonna pass on the crab soup.donna mcglynn02:26 22 may 19food was fabulous and the waitress was kind and very knowledgeable.  i gave it three stars because when i entered the restaurant at 4:45 to make reservation for that evening i was immediately told there were no times available.   the host did not ask me how many people or what time i would like to come. so i left a little disappointed. my husband proceeded to enter the establishment 10 minutes later and was  promptly given a reservation for 8 pm that evening no questions asked.   i was very disappointed that this host would not offer me the table and it took my husband going in to get the table 10 minutes later.denise berry13:06 13 mar 19best crab cake i have ever had. soups were especially good. going back tomorrow to try more deliciousness! adding to this review after our second visit in as many days: i have tried shrimp & grits at countless restaurants over the years & now can say saltus river grill has, hands down, the best shrimp & grits of any place where i've ever tried them. they go light on the salt because the ingredients are so fresh, particularly the shrimp (also perfectly cooked), the chef can let the natural flavors shine.            more reviews
