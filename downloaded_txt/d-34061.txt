english language & literature and education & child study major
“i might be biased because i’m an education major, but i have never seen so many professors who are just dedicated to their students, not only as students but as human beings. i feel like a collaborator and a co-facilitator rather than a student in these classrooms.”

jean and david w. wallace foundation director of the smith office for the arts
“we have such talented students, and [the art sale] is a [great] way for the smith community to see all the ways they’re being creative. students have loved to share what they’ve made, talk about their techniques, and discuss their processes.”
