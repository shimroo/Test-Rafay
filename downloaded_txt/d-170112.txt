this christmas, we also want to share another important message with you: sustainability.
our tree shines with decorations made of local, reusable gifts, because we believe that the future is built together, starting with the simplest gestures.

and, as every christmas, sweetness cannot be missing: our giant panettone is here to remind us that the best things in life are meant to be shared.

thank you for being part of our story.

situato nella pittoresca piazzetta marinella a sant’agnello, sarà un ambiente raffinato e affascinante dove poter gustare bevande e specialità culinarie italiane, dalla mattina fino a tarda sera.
i principali lavori di riqualificazione sono posticipati al prossimo inverno, in modo da permettere a cittadini e turisti di godere sin da subito nella bella stagione di questo spazio iconico. parliamo quindi di una soft opening, con un’atmosfera già però profondamente rinnovata e moderna.
nell'attesa di una inaugurazione ufficiale, chiediamo a tutti di farci un grande in bocca al lupo.

  this is a story of sailing ships racing across the sea, like seagulls among the waves.
this is a story about the great women and men of the past, who lived in times without engines or advanced technology. this is a dream that repeats every evening: hotel mediterraneo was born long ago, and every year it grows. it becomes bigger, stronger. but the essence remains the same: every time we see a boat, we see a bit of ourselves.

  3, 2, 1: drink 🍸
the art of creating a good drink, as our giovanni teaches us, lies not only in the measurements and preparation but in the details. the uniqueness of being able to adapt it to the customer's needs, their personality, and their passions. this is how the barrier reef is born: belvedere vodka, savoia aperitivo, elderflower syrup, cranberry juice, fresh lime juice, aqua faba.
our way of communicating.

  siamo lieti di annunciare che l'hotel mediterraneo srl si è aggiudicata il bando comunale per la gestione del bar “la terrazza”, sulla piazzetta marinella di sant'agnello.
è nostra intenzione riqualificare l'immobile rendendolo adeguato alla posizione meravigliosa in cui si trova. è un progetto ambizioso che necessita di investimenti importanti sia in termini economici che di tempo.
ciò nonostante, per non privare cittadini e turisti della possibilità di godere di questo luogo iconico nei mesi estivi, desideriamo aprire il prima possibile, dopo un intervento minimo necessario per mettere il sito in condizione di poter lavorare.
abbiamo finalmente avuto accesso all'immobile, ma  il complesso iter burocratico non è ancora completo. ci impegneremo ad essere con voi il prima possibile per accompagnarvi durante la stagione turistica in corso.
per il futuro meno prossimo invece, possiamo annunciare che trasformeremo il bar in un salotto sul mare suggestivo ed elegante, una "casa" pronta ad accogliere tutti con la consueta ospitalità che contraddistingue da sempre il mediterraneo.

  our collaborators are our strength: the true soul of our hotel. this is why we have decided to showcase their faces at least once a week and share their stories, because our hotel is an international excellence thanks to them as well.

let's start with one of the most delicate and fascinating roles: alessandro in the kitchen. what are the secrets of a true sous chef? our vesuvio restaurant, awarded multiple times, is the beating heart of this passion. today, we introduce you to alessandro bisconti, the sous chef of the hotel mediterraneo, who, with his dedication and skill, transforms every dish into a masterpiece of flavors and tradition.

  today we share a beautiful story with you.
our benito and arturo, father and son, pizza chef and bartender of our hotel, have finally received recognition for their work skills, empathy, and especially the mutual trust we have placed in each other over more than fifty years of working together. two important magazines, such as upscale living and on-magazine, have dedicated articles to tell their stories, their lives, and our adventures together. and many more are yet to come. 
thank you guys, and remember: the best is yet to come.
you can find the article links in the bio and in the first comment for the desktop version.
