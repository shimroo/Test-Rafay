trump's ultimatum to hamas to release all hostages by 12 noon saturday, else 'all bets are off' 


   
the ultimatum:  "i'm concerned if all of the hostages are not returned by saturday at 12:00, not in drips  and drabs, not 2 and 1 and 3 and 4 and 2. i would say cancel it (the precarious ceasefire agreement between israel and hamas) and all bets are off and uh, let hell break out."

selections from our archives 




us deporting another ‘487 presumed indians’ to india 



analysis:  "the standard operating procedure for deportations by aircraft used by ice that is effective from 2012 provides for the use of restraints," says the government. that means, it is taken for granted the us will set the standard for deportations. for another, the government is more interested in comparing with what happened in 2012 under a different government to justify its own compliance! no surprise, others are trampling upon us. (how we conduct ourselves inside decides, inherently, how we are treated outside) thirdly, the government blamed the gangs doing the business of human trafficking for the illegal migration. for all the crimes taking place in the country, let us blame the criminals! funny! we will never move an inch forward! the mindset defines what we are. 
meanwhile, a un-returned congress leader shashi tharoor sounded like a layman when he said, "if they are citizens of india we have an obligation to take them back." who said 'no'?. he should know that is not the issue now. who will identify an undocumented person, and how?(see report)
trump slaps tariff; canada, mexico retaliate: trade war begins     


opinion: a nutty 'new' trump must know checking illegal immigration is his job and not theirs. and 'penalty' tariff is not a solution. however, trump talking about "major threat" from "illegal aliens" (illegal immigration) is about what he believes, right or wrong, and to that extent he is genuine and honest; it is certainly not a pretension to prop up his political relevance. bullies are always true to themselves. look at india's crooked politicians shouting day in, day out to prove they are more patriotic, and to whip up public sentiments for them to ride on!

sworn in as president, trump orders national emergency at mexico border 


 
the function was held indoors from 12 pm (10:30 pm ist) at the rotunda of the us capitol building because of unusually intense cold and snow.  delivering his inaugural address, trump remarked, “the golden age of america begins right now," and just hours later signed a slew of executive orders to redeem the election pledges.

'there isn't a snowball's chance in hell' for canada merging with us: trudeau snubs donald trump

 the issue: trump says he is open to 'economic force' to acquire canada as its '51st state' if it does not stop the flow of illegal migrants and drugs into the us and secure its border.
trudeau gets ready for the battle: trudeau under trump's onslaught had appeared quiet as a lamb because he was facing serious internal problems and now the situation has changed. he has resigned and has enough space for a single-minded counter-attack as acting pm. and that is what he is doing to canada's advantage. he will prapare canada to take the 'bull' by the horns (literally) when he takes office on january 20. 
there is more to it: on the same page now, conservative opposition leader pierre poilievre has also outlined his plan to deal with the us president-elect's threats. both will stand united against the common enemy, and take on him adequately when he assumes office.
 and the latest: the counter-attack begins. in a cnn interview, trudeau strategically addresses the americans, tells them  a ghostly 25% tariff will create a recession in canada but will be equally devastating for the us economy. and he has a point.

trump names musk, ramaswamy to head 'department of efficiency': who will call the shots in america 




 a president-elect at the instance of 'sensible'     aides has declared, “a smaller government, with more efficiency and less bureaucracy,     will be the perfect gift to america.” a trump statement said he will chop     off the bureaucratic flab, or in his own words, “drain the swamp” in washington.   this contrasts with india where millions and millions of clerks rule the roost     with the blessings of petty vote bank politicians, who badly needed them, all these 77 years. 
the south african migrant who will benefit more than trump himself from 
    the election victory has climbed to the helm - elon musk will be the monarch 
    of all he surveys in washington! 
musk will lead a 'department of government efficiency' with vivek ramaswamy, 
    the eccentric dreamer. 
they will slash bureaucracy and government spending and restructure federal 
    agencies. (but no mention of what next and how!) 
the irony lies here: musk will also be the boss of all federal agencies, 
    including those currently investigating business frauds in his own companies 
    like tesla, spacex and starlink, which receive government funding, inter alia 
    making him the richest man on earth.

56 bomb threats to indian flights in two days, 90 in 7 days: scapegoat dgca shunted out



mayhem in the air:  the civil aviation ministry wants to take strict action to prevent more such incidents disrupting indian aviation!!! punishment: culprits of the hoax bomb threats will be put on no-fly list!!! ludicrous! typically this will continue - both the crime and the punishment. because our system pushes the scum to the top.

starliner bungling: is everything ok with nasa?



comment:  dragon, unlike what has been reported in the media, is not a rescue  mission. its schedule of liftoff or return has not been changed to suit the stranded astronauts. on the other hand, the astronauts' return has been put off by several months to suit the dragon's schedule. what spacex has done is only dropping two spacemen to accommodate suni and wilmore on the capsule's return. and that too was at the instance of nasa which has authority over the choice of astronauts under the contract which facilitates flow of moneys from the american treasury to the pocket of elon musk for running his spacex business, making him a billionaire and dance with abandon. result: nasa is a divided house!

presidential: harris to meet trump, a prosecutor vs. bully spectacle 


   
kamala harris had pleaded for unmuting the mic but trump had his knees knocking. she was a prosecutor and wanted to have a face-to-face with him, an exchange, some pointed questions, unmask him and his money power, expose him before the american people. but that was not to be and we will not call it a debate. only the moderator will ask questions!
harris will be seen tuesday night on the television on the viewers' right side as they sit in front of the set. viewers tend to focus towards their right side and that in turn can provide a better impact on their voting behaviour. and from the stage's right podium, or the interviewer's stand, she  will be in a commanding position vis-a-vis her rival.

white house warns putin, 'stop talking about our election... stop interfering'  


here's the proof:  attorney general merrick garland has accused russian state broadcaster rt of paying a tennessee firm $ 10 m to create and distribute content to us audiences with hidden russian government messaging. rt chief editor margarita simonyan (see pix) is one of 10 people sanctioned by the us for trying to manipulate the elections. 
and now putin declaring an unsolicited support to harris: a close connection is seen in trump, in his interview with his chum musk, making an inappropriate comment calling harris as most beautiful and comparing her to his wife with a view to blunting her electoral campaign like the fox in the crow story. and musk later sharing an ai-generated image of harris as communist dictator in uniform. the south african has joined the war as his empire is at  stake!! all these look like a coordinated russian traditional job. the russians managed to give it to trump in 2016 by damaging clinton, but failed in 2020!

trump is a threat to america, harris warns countrymen at dnc



 in a fiery speech, an emboldened "girl fallen from the coconut tree" opened 
    her box of agenda and promised the americans she will take the country to 
    new heights. 
kamala exhorted all americans to forge a new unity that will "chart a new 
    way forward," a first in history, laying the foundations of a new america, and that's her vision.     she was greeted with a non-stop standing ovation by the delegates as she took 
    the mike at the jam-packed convention arena. 
"i will be a president who unites us around our highest aspirations. a president 
    who leads and listens. who is realistic. practical," she promised.

elect harris to protect american democracy: biden at convention     

 

joe biden was so pleasing to the ears as he sought to invoke the power of democracy and list his government's achievements all due to the grace of god.  but what broke the mike was clinton's hard metallic, sounding so genuine and dedicated as, may be, she had a revenge  carryover from 2016, the year when the russians were alleged to have  begun a social media misinformation campaign in favour of trump and a suspected hacking of the machines using applications quite unfamiliar to the rest of the world. which was thwarted by the democrats in the nick of time in 2020 although trump as president tried to block them by cutting postal funds. he went violent and attempted insurrection not fully because of his animal insticts but also because he was made to believe in a result like the 2016's and that belief was shattered. what marked out day one at the convention was a 'presumptive' candidate's unscheduled  appearance on the stage made possible by the virtual roll call of august 1 - kamala harris, the vice president. the day also facilitated a less known but deserving new york guv kathy hochul, the american cheetah  breaking into the national scene for future purpose! not well done this time!

muhammad yunus takes charge of govt in b'desh: who's muhammad yunus?



all isms apart, who is muhammad yunus? aside from a nobel prize that does not assess but compare, yunus's  social biz idea of melding capitalism and social responsibility in the late 1980s, known as microfinance, did revolutionise rural bangladesh - unlike the destructive infrastructure funding mania of the political underdogs - pulling millions out of perennial poverty, setting an example for many other poor countries to emulate.  
on the lines of  dr verghese kurien of india much much earlier, who was hounded by the communists as a cia agent out of compulsive ignorance and a lack of basic ability to gauge what he had done which they should have indeed. he mobilised the indian grassroots, introducing the concept of cooperatives, the implications of which the pseudo socialists and their forefathers couldn't  ever dream of.

kamala harris: "i will be thinking about my mother, who is 
  looking down from heaven." 

at that momentous event, "i will be thinking about my 
mother (the late shyamala gopalan), who is looking down 
from heaven," harris said. the scaled back presidential 
inauguration this time will have no precedent with a 
devastating coronavirus locking down everything and a 
heightened security bandobast with reports of armed trump 
protesters likely to re-enact the capitol episode posing the 
gravest threat to biden, the president-elect, and others.(see report)
the hand that rocked the cradle... 


"we were taught to see a world beyond just ourselves. to be 
conscious and compassionate about the struggles of all people." 
- kamala harris, vice-president-elect, united states of america. 
she is releasing a series of her reminiscences of her early 
period, of people and events that had deep influence on the 
course of her life and thoughts, in the coming days leading up to 
her inauguration as the vice-president of america, the first 
woman ever to occupy a position that high in the greatest 
democracy yet.(see report)
'brown girl, brown girl...' kamala harris serenaded on becoming first 
woman vice-president of us 


the first woman vice-president has become an inspiration for girls 
of colour, and for all girls. kamala harris is becoming an icon. her 
passionate speech had a great, lasting impact on the listeners, 
when she said, “while i may be the first woman in this office, i will 
not be the last, because every little girl watching tonight sees that 
this is a country of possibilities.”(see report)
