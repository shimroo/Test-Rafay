                             ​​the correct method is the least costly in the long run having repaired bleach stains on carpeting for over 40 years, i will offer a few tips for saving time and money. while there are many incorrect methods, there are only a few correct methods. i will focus on what not to do and then what to do. the most significant misunderstanding mentioned by many is to rub the area with dish soap. dish soap will remove more color, while rubbing will distort the fibers. these suggestions may prevent an exact match when using carpet mill dye later. they do not work, and the stain will not gradually disappear. another is to apply vinegar and baking soda. these will make the proper repair much more complex and costly.carpet color restoration should never be viewed as a "trial and error." you want to know for a surety about what you are doing. you should never guess. the look and feel should be the same as the surroundings. common sense would tell you not to use the following: acrylic paint, automotive carpet paint, interior house paint, ink, sharpies, and carpet dye of the same color as the carpet. these will make a simple repair using the correct method more difficult. the dyes used in crayons are another wrong method frequently used when searching on the internet. applying crayons puts a waxy coat on the surface of the carpet fibers. this would not replace missing carpet dyes, as the wax usually prevents dye from entering the dye sites within the fibers. the danger here is when the dye from the crayon does enter the dye sites. this can happen when the carpets are cleaned or when heat is applied. most bleach spots lose only partial color. a matched color will join the remaining color, resulting in the wrong shade or color for the repaired area. this complicates matters as the repaired area looks worse than the original stain. the wrong shade or color must be removed before using the correct method. the crayon wax may also block the dye sites from receiving carpet mill dye later on. it is much easier to use the proper process in the first place.​using hair dye for bleached carpeting is at the top of the wrong methods not to use. the result is usually a dark-looking stain that is difficult to remove. the hair dye binds with the carpet dye sites, creating a permanent stain. the difficulty now is in removing this dark stain. partial color from the hair dye remains after bleaching the stain. yellow is the remaining color. this yellow creates a wrong shade when using the correct method.i mentioned all the incorrect methods not to use.i will now share the correct techniques. the only dyes that must be used are carpet mill dyes. these will result in a perfect match. the look and feel will be the same as the surrounding fibers.  applying these dyes is an exact science and works in all situations. there is no guesswork involved.i will explain the proper application of using carpet mill dyes.  all colors are composed of only three primary colors. these are blue, red, and yellow. the trick is to obtain the correct ratio of these primary colors while ensuring that the dyes strike the entire fiber strand evenly. that being said, the top and bottom of the fibers are dyed equally. before beginning the process, all traces of the bleaching agent must be removed. the only acceptable means of neutralizing chlorine would be hydrogen peroxide or sodium thiosulfate. this is applied with a roller ball applicator coating the fibers.as mentioned before, most bleach spots lose only partial color. we do not match colors, as we replace only missing colors. we follow a set of rules in determining which primary colors are missing. blue is the least stable of the three primary colors, followed by red. yellow usually remains. however, some yellow may be removed when the carpet has been bleached. the rules for determining the replacement of these colors are simple.  dilute carpet mill dye is used according to the color of the bleach stain at any given time. red carpet mill dye is applied to green or blue discolorations. yellow is only used only on lavender discolorations. blue carpet dye is used on any color other than lavender, blue, or green. that is it.there are only three approved methods for applying carpet mill dye.  spraying a dilute dye solution with a sprayer and extraction device such as a wet vac or equivalent machine is one method. the other two methods are the recently patented usage of roller balls and a precision method using an eye dropper with gelled carpet mill dye. these make it possible for touch ups and quicker drying time.  when the carpet fibers are dry, it is much easier to visualize the color in touching up any off fibers.  both methods, if used correctly, will result in a near perfect color s match.  anyone can follow these proper methods with the correct information.  
it is our opinion that bleach stain repair is a growing field and will continue to grow,  largely ignored in the past. one of the reasons for growth is the recognition that has taken place when bleach stains are dyed correctly.  when performed correctly, it is impossible to tell where the stain had occured.  this in itself would be reason enough; for to replace sections of a carpet is not always practical,  nor is the appearance always acceptable.  a bleach spot should always be dyed first using liquid carpet mill dye.  if this should fail, which is rare, plugging or cutting a section and replacing it should be performed only when color repair can not take placel. another reason for growth is the recognition of partial bleach spots.  these occur when one of the three primary colors is missing in a small degree.  all shades and colors of carpet on the market today are composed by combining a different ratio of only three primary colors.  all it takes is a slight amount of any one of these colors missing to produce a discoloration mark.  this occurance is very frequent in the off white and lighter colored carpets popular today. the treatment of urine stains is another big reason.  urine in time will shift to form ammonia,  which will cause a partial bleach stain. the color shifts to a yellow orange as some of the primary colors are missing. one of the reasons for spot dye failure in the past and present that continues to make some people leery was based on incorrect assumptions.  many years ago, we only had a few dark colored carpets.  it was fairly easy to match the carpet color with pre-mixed dyes. the mistake was in the continued effort of matching carpet colors with pre-mixed dyes trying to keep up with the ever growing number of new colors available.  the problem was that these new carpet colors contained less dye and were lighter in color. to add any of the matched colors to the bleach stain would result in a darker shade.  spraying dye from spray cans will not be accurate. we can correct mistakes caused by these.​
