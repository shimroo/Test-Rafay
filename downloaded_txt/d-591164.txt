stephen rosenfield
“my collaboration with my students works both because of what i do and what i don’t do.- i don’t teach fill-in-the-blanks comedy formulas. i don’t teach how to do comedy the way i do it. what i do is enable my students to discover what is original and funny about their comedy, teach them how to apply the most important techniques of writing and performing comedy to their unique comedy voice, work with them to create stand-up that is so undeniably good that they get paid to perform, guide them on how to keep growing as a comedian to reach the boundaries of their talent and go beyond them.”
