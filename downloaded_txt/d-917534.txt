welcome to the village cluster website dedicated to our galician-rusyn ancestors from the peregrymka/perehrymka/pielgrzymka village area. this site is, and will continue to be, a work-in-progress. its purpose is the continual expansion of an established base of knowledge about our immigrant family members and their carpathian foothills homeland.there will be several research areas--most of which will take considerable time to complete. rather than wait until all topics are researched and written, we invite you to join with us as fellow-creators of this site. we welcome all contributions--photographs of your ancestors, family histories, genealogical information and anything else which would help in our mission to honor those who have gone before.the site contains a current appeal to support the restoration of st. michael the archangel church, the only church remaining in our grandparents' and great-grandparents' villages, but it is hoped that support for this tiny orthodox church will be an ongoing commitment of the larger american-peregrymka family.please send any relevant genealogical information to maryann at maryann@avillagecluster.com and proposed text additions to carol at carol@avillagecluster.com. we are particularly interested in photographs of any of the immigrants listed from these villages in the old world or the new. andrew smith (ajsmith@avillagecluster.com) has the major responsiblity for maps and village historical documents.we look forward to our work together.carol, maryann and andy

Â 











"the immigrants still live; they live within us."
patricia a. krafcikthe island of tears/two generations laterthe carpatho-rusyn americanissue 2, summer 1978















the name of the village of pielgrzymka, called peregrymka by our rusyn grandparents and great-grandparents, has the beautiful meaning of pilgrimage--a spiritual journey.















a pilgrimage is of course a metaphor for life itself--the passage from birth to death--the human search for growth and meaning.
this website attempts a different kind of journey--a journey not forward, but backward--to a different time and a different world. we dedicate this site to our immigrant ancestors from peregrymka and its neighboring villages--pilgrims who in their own time, through their unremitting courage, determination and labor, sought a better life for those who followed.
