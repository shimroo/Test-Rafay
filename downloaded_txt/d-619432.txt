how to rally one's best society, vol. 24, issue 9


february  9, 2025





“we mustn’t despair. above all things we mustn’t despair.” — charles coburn as sir simon in the paradine case (1947)to say that perfect propriety has taken a beating in the last few weeks would be an understatement. no need to go into why. as we can no longer look above us for good examples of good behavior, it becomes necessary to look around us, and within us. we must take action to reinforce what we believe perfect propriety is.etiquetteer had to turn back to emily post herself for a little light in the darkness, to her description of best society*. new york and paris “love to be amused, thrilled, and surprised all at the same time” and will welcome anyone who can provide that sensation. (perhaps this explains the ascent of the kakistocracy . . . ) “puritan america,” however, ranks “birth, manners and cultivation” above novelty — “but this is because puritan america, as well as the general public, mistakes the jester for the queen.”well, if best society isn’t “shock and awe” or the mere accident of birth, what is it, and are we a part of it? do you think of yourself as part of “an unlimited brotherhood which spreads over the entire surface of the globe, the members of which are invariably people of cultivation and worldly knowledge, who have not only perfect manners but a perfect manner?” do you aspire to that? are you reading etiquetteer? if you answered yes at least once, you’re off to a good start.how can we band best society together in this national moment? if you think it’s frivolous for etiquetteer to suggest having a party, you’re not thinking deeply enough about the value of gathering one’s community together. there is comfort and reassurance in assembling around a dinner table or coffee table or kitchen table, or holding up the bar, with people who share your values. whether you’re better at dinner for six or drinks for 20 or coffee for just one guest at a time, send that invitation. reach out and reinforce your community.this is also the time, when hearing an offensive opinion, to raise an eyebrow and ask “could you repeat that?”, “you don’t really believe that, do you?”,  “how did you form that opinion?”, and “actually, that’s not funny.” standing up for perfect propriety means calling out bad behavior with perfect propriety. (other tips at mind journal here.)etiquetteer wishes you courage and joy as you begin to consult your calendar and your address book. don’t delay — now is the time!*etiquetteer also turned to this passage just after election day, in this piece on civic pride.
































social media, vol. 24, issue 8


february  2, 2025





dear etiquetteer:here’s my predicament: so many businesses invest heavily in selling sex appeal, and i have fallen into online popularity by sex appeal through utter chance and circumstance. over the last few months, gay men seem to have found me, especially on instagram, and the growth and engagement with my business account, which is my only account on that platform, have consequently evolved into the algorithm such that this seems to be the only demographic now consistently served my content.i appreciate the growth, in terms of bare numbers, but this audience has so far not converted into any paying customers. yet they flood my inbox with up to hundreds of often quite rude messages per day, replying to which consumes a lot of time, sorting and culling for messages of actual salience to my work. this says nothing of the sometimes overtly graphic public comments that have begun to appear on some of my posts, too.i’m working with my team to develop a strategic social media marketing plan for this year, and i am quietly asking individuals in dms to kindly cool down overly hot comments.however, do you suggest any sort of public address or messaging to diplomatically and effectively redirect lusty over-enthusiasm to more productive engagement, that will be more comfortable for everyone in my audience? thanks, sir, for your thoughts and wisdom on this!dear besieged:attention is oxygen online. withhold your attention from these senders of unwelcome messages —starve them — and they’ll fall away. for those of us taught to reply to every bit of correspondence, this is quite an adjustment. but repeatedly leaving someone “on read” (meaning that they can see you have seen their message, and that you haven’t responded) sends a message without sending a message.depending on your tolerance, for first offenders you may wish to respond “thanks, but is my business account, and my business is not to be beautiful, but to [insert business here]. i’d much rather engage with you only about that.” inappropriate comments on a public post should be deleted; you may or may not wish to warn repeat offenders. and for those who can’t take the hint, etiquetteer has no qualms at all about blocking. as humphrey bogart so memorably said in the maltese falcon, “if you want to hang around, you’ll be polite.”etiquetteer feels ambivalent about a public announcement to stave off this behavior, because it introduces this problem to the rest of your audience, who probably have no idea what’s going on — and shouldn’t need to. in the meantime, perhaps it will be possible to game the algorithm by commenting on the posts of others in your field, or followers in other demographics. (but etiquetteer is admittedly nowhere near an expert on the algorithm.)etiquetteer wishes you and your marketing team successful engagement with your true demographic: ladies and gentlemen.
































receiving lines, vol. 24, issue 7


january 29, 2025





dear etiquetteer:your advice is requested to help better manage a small crowd of devoted music fans after a symphony concert. i recently attended a post-concert reception where a small group in a crowded room had an opportunity to meet the conductor who had just performed. fortunately, everyone, for the most part, was well behaved in congratulating the maestro on a wonderful performance. some fans lingered a bit long, standing close and blocking other’s access and any chance for the maestro’s escape. the maestro herself was more than gracious, staying 20 or 30 minutes to speak with her fans, pose for selfies, etc. i only wished, after the fact, that we had taken steps to make the event flow more smoothly, to ensure better use of the artist’s time and energy, and to assure all gathered that it was appropriate to speak to the maestro albeit in a limited manner.i was reminded of how helpful a receiving line can be at formal events like a state funeral. (is it true that jacqueline kennedy met aristotle onassis in the receiving line at jfk’s memorial?*) is it appropriate to use a receiving line in a smaller less formal event, and how does etiquetteer advise employing such a technique with perfect propriety? as an event organizer, i aim to be helpful, not officious. my goal is to ensure an ease of exchange between the maestro and her many enthusiastic fans. dear fan planner:etiquetteer loves a receiving line as much as music groupies love a conductor. but there are two problems with using one here. first, they are often (unjustly) thought of as stuffy and rigid, and this post-concert event sounds appropriately loosely structured (which is fine). second, a receiving line is for greeting only, not extended conversation. but celebrities of any stripe tend to have circles of admirers form around them regardless, wherever they are. no matter what arrangements you put in place, etiquetteer fears your guests will just swarm the maestro when she arrives.what this event** needs is a host or a handler (or two) to escort the maestro through the crowd, allowing her to speak with guests but who will add “there are some people over here who would also like to speak with you” with a firm hand on her elbow. your maestro will also need to become adept at concluding conversations with such methods as the firm handshake, the kind but final smile, and phrases such as “it was such a pleasure to meet/see you,” “i hope you enjoy the evening,” “thank you, goodbye,” and “won’t you excuse me, please?” (receiving lines can be inexcusably held up if one of the hosts is a long talker — for instance president biden, who kept a receiving line going so long that dinner was not served until 10:30 pm. read etiquetteer’s column on that contretemps here.)etiquetteer wishes you a smoothly run event with respectful guests and beautiful but brief conversations.*no, this is not true. certainly they had met by 1963, as jackie spent some time on the onassis yacht recovering from the birth and death of her infant son patrick in summer of that year.**etiquetteer defines “a small crowd” as less than 50. more than 50, and a receiving line might work better.

super manners for the supermarket, vol. 24, issue 6


january 26, 2025





etiquette is for every person in every time and every place, not just weddings or other dress-up occasions. that includes the supermarket, and it may be that some people need a little refresher about what is perfectly proper.the most important rule for supermarket shopping is to stay out of the way. be aware of where you are in relation to other people, especially on narrow aisles with extra-wide carts. accidentally blocking the aisle makes shopping frustrating for others.in the same vein, don’t take too long to choose. while you dawdle over which kind of mustard you want, another shopper knows exactly which jar of capers to get on the shelf below — that you’re blocking. give way with a smile if someone asks you to move briefly.if you’re very tall, expect to help others reach that item on the top shelf. if you’re not that tall, ask for help nicely starting with “excuse me, please . . .” so that tall person knows you’re speaking to them. “i need that” just conveys that you’re bossy.count your items before you get to the express lane so that you know you don’t have too many. some snarky shopper behind you in line might make a point of pointing that out.don’t be that snarky shopper. sorry you’re having a bad day, but you will only end up looking like a jerk.never abandon your cart in line to go back for something you forgot. it’s rude.when approaching the register, get off the phone. the cashier deserves your undivided attention, especially if there are questions about your items. and speaking of which . . . . . . know your coupons. coupon shopping is great as long as you actually buy things covered by the coupons. not knowing what you’re doing complicates things for the cashier, and frustrates everyone behind you in line.smile and thank the cashier and the bagger. they’re people, not drudges. always return your cart to the proper place, especially in a parking lot, where errant carts are a true safety hazard. this is such a small thing to do, and so many just cannot be bothered. don’t be that person. 










“i don’t know why they always put what i want on the top shelf.”


































eleanor roosevelt's etiquette book, vol. 24, issue 5


january 22, 2025





you can’t forget what you never knew. because eleanor roosevelt left such a broad and colorful legacy as a tireless first lady and human rights advocate, her book of common sense etiquette has been left to languish in the shadows. people simply don’t know that she produced 555 pages on space age perfect propriety in 1962. this could be for two reasons: she doesn’t really tell you where the forks go when setting the table (so many people believe that is the only function of an etiquette book — that and weddings), and her all-purpose answer to just about anything is “democracy” (which is not always that helpful). what makes her common sense an innovator of the period is her inclusion of young people with special sections on “thirteen to nineteen (teen agers*),” etiquette for interacting smoothly with the disabled, and especially (to etiquetteer) her words of wisdom and good taste about patriotism. the former she approached with some reluctance but with great sensitivity and understanding: “the rules that govern [teenagers’] behavior should be no different form those that govern the behavior of anyone else. yet they are in the grip of physical and spiritual drives which they have not known as young children, and which will not affect them in quite the same way when they grow up. their situation is special, and for that reason they deserve a special chapter.”** tellingly, she begins this section with “idealism and the call to leadership.” mrs. roosevelt may well be the first etiquette writer to consider the needs of the disabled***, and she does so with her trademark compassion backed up with expert medical opinion. her most helpful advice could be distilled to don’t overdramatize: “one who is sincerely interested in . . . cooperation, in being genuinely helpful, will pay only so much attention to the disability as is necessary to give the other the help he needs and wants, will not call undue attention to it by extravagant gestures of sympathy and elaborate offers of undesired help . . . ” and will basically keep calm****.but to etiquetteer, her most important chapter comes at the very end, “showing your colors: patriotism, the flag, and the national anthem.” mrs. roosevelt doesn’t just cover the mechanics of how to behave when the united states flag is raised, lowered, displayed, disposed of, or carried in a parade, or what to do when the national anthem is sung (in a stadium, if you are not at your seats yet, you stop where you are in the aisle and stand at attention until the anthem is finished), but she gets right to the heart of what patriotism is for all people: “true patriotism springs from a belief in the dignity of the individual, freedom and equality not only for americans but for all people on earth, universal brotherhood and good will, and a constant and earnest striving toward the principles and ideals on which this country was founded.”***** etiquetteer invites you to reflect on those words today, and every day.*in the text she refers to “teenagers,” but it is amusing to consider this moment in the linguistic evolution of a new word, from “teen ager” to “teenager” — much as “e-mail” gradually became “email.”**page 418.***again, it is interesting to observe how our language has changed since this book was published in 1962. we no longer refer to the handicapped, for instance, but to the disabled or the differently abled. the term “crippled,” once standard, is now considered an insult. ****page 459.*****page 550.
































reader responses, vol. 24, issue 4


january 15, 2025





readers (and randos from the internet) have had a few things to say about a few things etiquetteer has had to say.regarding alternative hostess gifts:“since i know nothing about wines and which one to select, i always send flowers. but i send them a day or two early so the host has time to deal with them, but also knows they don’t have to order flowers if they wanted some to brighten their house anyway.” what could be more perfectly proper than this?!“understanding a little about you, the gifts you appreciated most are from guests who had an intimate knowledge of you. if you know your host well, choose something your host will appreciate; if you do not know your host well, choose something safe and practical (that includes wine). speaking for myself, i prefer no host gift be given as i tend to be very specific in my tastes . . . around the holidays my preferred gift is high quality eggnog in a bottle from a local dairy.”regarding wedding gifts:“etiquetteer, you wrote ‘finally, brides today can be so uppity about getting anything that looks like it might have belonged to their grandmothers.’ actually, grooms today can also have strong opinions about wedding presents. our society is moving away from public acceptance of stereotypes based on gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, handicap, addiction or body size. it seems brides are the one group of people who can be sneered at with impunity.” the wedding industrial complex has given us the bridezilla, and etiquetteer will continue to call her out for her lack of consideration. grooms may indeed have strong opinions about wedding gifts, but etiquetteer has yet to see anything like the news coverage bridezillas get over their rapaciousness.regarding “the star-spangled banner”:“it’s not a ‘song.’ it’s an anthem.” perhaps you are referring to this sentence from column 20.16? “if you’d rather the united states pick another song as the official national anthem . . . or start your own.” if another song is ever chosen to become the national anthem, it will become an anthem. thank you kindly for pointing that out. etiquetteer hopes it made you feel better.
































alternative hostess gifts, vol. 24, issue 3


january 12, 2025





over on instagram, old soul etiquette (the marvelous mariah grumet, you must follow her) has suggested that one of the in things for 2025 needs to be “host gifts that aren’t wine.” and let’s face it, the bottle handover can sometimes feel like payment for services rendered*. so let’s look at the custom of giving a gift to one’s hosts and consider some options — particularly since etiquetteer received some thoughtful gifts yesterday after hosting an afternoon party.a hostess gift is, first of all, a gift for the hosts to enjoy later, not something expected to be used or consumed during the party. experts differ on whether or not gifts are required; some say “never arrive emptyhanded,” others believe a lovely note of thanks sent the next day is more important, and still others say to do both. etiquetteer firmly believes that you are not a bad person if you don’t bring a hostess gift, but it’s charming and thoughtful when you do.if wine, especially red wine, is the default hostess gift, fresh flowers run a close second. some hosts complain vigorously (but not to their guests) that having to find a vase and arrange a bouquet while simultaneously welcoming guests, taking coats, and pouring drinks is too much to deal with. etiquetteer (who loves fresh flowers) would remind them that the inconvenience is momentary, and would encourage guests to consider a small potted plant instead. chocolates and other foodstuffs are often good choices, too. etiquetteer has occasionally been brought lovely boxes of chocolate so beautiful it has been a struggle between sharing them immediately or saving the entire box to gorge on later. but a food gift doesn’t have to be candy. yesterday, for instance, a guest brought etiquetteer a bottle of herb-infused olive oil — something to lend depth to some standard recipes. still another guest brought a small bottle of small batch gin from a specialty distiller. finally, the theme or novelty gift that has something to do with a party theme or a special interest of the hosts could make a hit. yesterday’s gathering was to tell fortunes for the new year, and a guest brought as a gift an unusual deck of tarot cards, exactly tying into the party’s purpose. but these could also be small paperback books, suncatchers, votive candles, magnets, etc. use your imagination, and your knowledge of your hosts’ interests. etiquetteer wishes you joy as you consider how to thank your hosts for a good time.*but not if the hosts have asked for guests to bring wine.
































holiday fallout, concert edition, vol. 24, issue 2


january  8, 2025





dear etiquetteer:when exactly is the right time to remove a restless infant from an auditorium or concert hall?dear eagle-eared:at any time before the child’s fifth birthday, depending on the policy of the house. while the boston symphony orchestra declines to admit children younger than five, the los angeles philharmonic allows no children under six, and the chicago symphony has a minimum age of eight. when boston ballet produces the nutcracker, one of the most attractive holiday spectacles for children, the company notes “that infants and children under two years of age are not allowed in the theater, and the nutcracker is recommended for children ages five and up.” parents should heed these recommendations.but these are large professional arts organizations. it doesn’t surprise etiquetteer that for church and community concerts during the holidays, infants and too-young children get brought along with the family — possibly because other family members are performing. as always, etiquetteer sympathizes most with the rest of the audience. the minute a child becomes vocal or overly fretful, their responsible adult should take them from the house and not expect to be reseated until it’s appropriate. it’s worth noting that many performing arts organizations have child-friendly performances (for instance, the boston symphony orchestra’s family concert series) to accommodate families. etiquetteer hopes others will also consider this appproach, which feels like a win-win.dear etiquetteer:when i arrive at the concert hall on time, may i sit in the “reserved for latecomers” seats?  i was here on time after all. i don’t see why latecomers should get better seats than i do. 🤷‍♂️dear seated:etiquetteer understands it, of course. you’re tired of virtue being its own reward, and want your gold star. but let’s look at this situation from a different angle. who really benefits most from convenient seats after a concert has started? you might say the latecomers, but etiquetteer would say it’s everyone else in the auditorium. late arrivals are made as inconspicuous as possible with those specially reserved seats (etiquetteer bets they were on an aisle), so no one has to be stepped over or have their view blocked during the first act. much easier, must less disruptive.while thanking you for being on time for the start of the concert, etiquetteer would like to encourage you to embrace the spirit of the holidays just past and look on those seats as a kindness to all rather than a benefit to the undeserving. 
































dry january, vol. 24, issue 1


january  5, 2025





dear etiquetteer:sometimes i want to cut back on my alcohol intake or, in the case of dry january, not drink any alcohol at all. personally i find i’m able to stick to these resolutions at a party if i bring my own non-alcoholic drink. yes, a good host will always have non-alcoholic beverages on hand. but if i bring my own i find that i am actually able to stick with my plan. do you have any thoughts on this?dear drying:dry january — abstaining from all alcohol for all january after presumed winter holiday excess — has been getting a lot of press in recent years. many people have found it a valuable challenge, but a challenge nonetheless. rather than go cold turkey, others opt to reduce their intake and call it damp january. moderation is usually perfectly proper; this should be encouraged.the trick to byob(everage) is just the same as it is for a special diet: discretion. showing up with a big gulp or a camelbak when everyone else is drinking from glasses is going to call attention to yourself. if you’re bringing your own stash of soda (or what have you), leave it in the kitchen and drink it from the host’s glasses. etiquetteer is fond of the example of trailblazing vegetarian gloria swanson, who would bring her own sandwich to a dinner party and slip it to the butler on arrival so it could be served to her when everyone else got their meat. she kept to her diet, but didn’t put a spotlight on it.etiquetteer wishes you a discreet and successful dry january.

top ten of 2024, vol. 23, issue 75


december 29, 2024





for this last column of 2024, etiquetteer picks out the top ten columns of the year, for entirely random reasons. you may have different choices; take a look at the index and share what worked for you.in chronological order:etiquetteer may be the only etiquette writer to have put down some rules for how to attend drag brunch, but if you haven’t been — and even if you’re not thinking about going — this will give you a window on what to expect at a function not known for perfect propriety. “tipping is part of the total entertainment experience of drag brunch — etiquetteer never knew anyone could accept a bill with their teeth — so save yourself some trouble and change those twenties for ones and fives before you get there.”the home wedding deserves a comeback*, and etiquetteer shared the story of president woodrow wilson’s second wedding at the home of the bride, mrs. edith bolling galt. “‘fifteen or twenty would have been a crowd,’ hoover observed, but president wilson had told him 40 guests. unfortunately the combined families took up almost all that space, and they still had to consider cabinet members and their wives as well as personal friends. ‘. . . there were many keen disappointments on the friend list . . .’”to celebrate etiquetteer’s first auntie mame mob cocktail party in march, that mr. dimmick shared some important life lessons from auntie mame: “mame did not let prejudice or stigma get in the way of loving and learning from people . . . let’s not forget her entertaining “a distinguished lithuanian rabbi and two chorus girls from the cast of blackbirds” the day mr. babcock found out about patrick’s school, too. and especially the way she took down the upsons over their narrow-minded attitudes. auntie mame enjoyed a wide circle of acquaintance, but bigots had no place in it.a reader with concerns about facetiming in the gym’s locker room led to a popular column on locker room etiquette: “it is so tempting to respond with a snappy comeback, e.g. ‘is that for your onlyfans?’ or ‘are you sure your wife doesn’t know we’re here?’ but that is not perfectly proper, and it really will not do anything to help the situation.”women’s jewelry for men turned out to be popular with readers, as one male reader contemplated how to incorporate his late mother’s jewelry into his own wardrobe: “by all means experiment at home, and seek the advice of someone you trust who can look you over in person and say yea or nay. but remember that jewelry is supposed to call attention to the wearer, not itself. that means showing some restraint.”at the start of summer it was time to explore the perfect propriety of iced tea: “mrs. macdougall also wrote ‘don’t forget that the chinese use no sugar at all — and they know tea.’ she clearly didn’t know the american south, where sweet tea is more than nectar for some; it’s a lifestyle . . . it’s very sweet (which is the point), so it’s not for everyone. restaurants will ask if you want ‘sweet or unsweet tea.’ order wisely.”an etiquette education included some interesting bits etiquetteer picked up after successfully completing the english manner’s train the trainer curriculum: “the reason lemon forks exist (all right, first — surprise, there is such a thing as a lemon fork) is to remove the pips from lemon slices because they affect the way your tea tastes. to which i can only exclaim “science!” and continue to take my tea black.”a reader wrote to ask how to handle inappropriate dance floor behavior in what turned out to be a popular column: “while the presence of masks traditionally encourages unbridled freedom — think of carnival in venice — ‘no means no’ is more generally accepted as a stern warning than a clandestine invitation now, or should be . . . in fact, you updated ‘sir, you are no gentleman’ for this century.”tips on thanksgiving manners also proved to be popular: “the only reason one leaves the table mid-meal (besides seconds) is ‘to wash your hands.’ no one needs to know specifically what you’re going to do in the bathroom, for heaven’s sake.”etiquetteer examined six types of party guests and what to do about them: “nothing is good enough for some people, who share suggestions about how things could have been done differently . . . people forget sometimes that a private home is not a restaurant where one pays for the hospitality one wants. if you don’t want to be invited back (and perhaps you don’t), this is the way to do it . . .”so . . . farewell, old year! it’s been . . . well, it’s been full. here’s to a new year of tenacious perfect propriety for all!*etiquetteer sees you, observant and devout catholic readers, ready to pounce with a reminder that catholic weddings may only be solemnized inside a church and never at home. etiquetteer covers that very issue in the column. 
































holiday fallout, vol. 23, issue 74


december 27, 2024





etiquetteer darling:this is a real question for the expert. this happened in real life on christmas eve. i was invited to a feast. i offered to bring a dessert and bubbly. the host/chef replied, “oh, bring prosecco. yum!” no comment about sweets. however, i knew that there would be at least one gluten-free guest so i made a gluten-free sheet cake with frosting. when dinner transitioned to dessert they didn’t bring out my cake. yes, i’m hurt. i’m offended. please help.dear baked:etiquetteer understands why you feel hurt, of course, having gone to the trouble of looking out for a guest with a special diet at this feast to which you both had been invited. clearer communication from the host/chef would have been helpful. obviously “bring prosecco” was not specific enough; adding “we have the food part all set” would have eliminated any confusion. this is something for you to remember next time. if you don’t get every part of your question answered, keep asking until you get the answers you need.to be charitable, it may be that the hosts got so distracted or engaged with getting everything done that they completely forgot about your cake* and woke up the next day to ask “what on earth is this gluten-free sheet cake doing in the kitchen?!” but the general rule is, if you’re bringing anything to a party (unless it’s a potluck and it’s been requested), you shouldn’t expect it to be served at the party because it’s a gift to the hosts. etiquetteer thinks it would be lovely for you to begin the new year by baking that cake again and inviting your gluten-free friend(s) to a candlelight tea. dear etiquetteer:i was invited to come over for christmas eve but given no time. i replied that i was afraid i wouldn’t be there before 7:00/7:30 pm because of a family holiday dinner. they said “oh, ok,” then told me that it would start “after 7:00 pm.” i had no idea if it was a buffet, open house or what. i got there and the table was set for eight. they had to pull a chair for me even though i had confirmed. what should i have done?dear extra:oh dear. “come over for christmas eve” is not very specific, is it? that could mean a meal (as in this case), or a cocktail party, or a gift exchange, or a viewing of seasonal movies, or anything! whether it’s for a holiday or not, invitations need to be specific:who: exactly who is invited (e.g. guest, partner, children, visiting relations [if any]).what: what kind of party it is so people know what to expect. in this case they should have said “christmas eve dinner.” and also exactly what to bring (or not — see letter above).when: exactly what time to arrive at the door, and also when to eat. “please come at 7, we’ll be sitting down at 7:30” would have helped you so much.where: the location of the party.your query actually sounds as though everyone did everything they were supposed to do in the moment. you showed up when you said you would, and the absent-minded hosts accommodated you. etiquetteer understands how that looks and feels awkward, but you need not reproach yourself. if these hosts invite you again, though, etiquetteer suggests you get a written invitation (not a text), and that you confirm your plans with them on the morning of the event. *this is more typical of that mr. dimmick who thinks he knows so much. as leonide massine so memorably said in the red shoes, “chaos chaos chaos!”
































quick tips before christmas, vol. 23, issue 73


december 22, 2024





christmas — all the winter holidays, in fact — are mere days away. the excitement and, yes, anxiety will soon reach the frenzy stage if they haven’t already. etiquetteer has a few quick tips to make the run up to the most wonderful time of the year hopefully a little less frenzied.expect something to go wrong. a wise old man taught etiquetteer 20 years ago to expect three things to go wrong, and that’s actually good advice. there is so much striving for the perfect holiday — the perfect meal, the perfect gift, the perfectly decorated home — that any accident or deviation can darken the mood sharply. and unnecessarily. more important than the perfect holiday is knowing how to handle crises calmly, and therefore with perfect propriety.* and to do that . . . have a backup plan. what do you do if the gift isn’t delivered on time, if the turkey refuses to thaw, if your child or grandchild has a tantrum or a wardrobe malfunction, if a candle accidentally sets the curtains on fire? brainstorm in advance what might have to be done so you can transition to plan b if necessary. in these cases they might be apologies or alternate gifts, takeout chinese food, naptime, and a fire extinguisher. be kind to the staff. people get so intently focused on their tasks and errands (and impediments) that they forget to be courteous to cashiers and sales staff. this is not perfectly proper. get off the phone before approaching the cash register (no, really!), remember the magic words, and express appreciation for their help. that will go a long way to making the season bright.allow extra time. for everything. especially travel. it’s better to be early than late, and miss your flight. it might not be the gift you want, and that’s ok. and if it isn’t, keep it to yourself. respond kindly. if you celebrate christmas (or hanukkah or kwanzaa) and someone wishes you “happy holidays!” recognize that that that person is wishing you well and not intentionally minimizing the holiday of your choice. etiquetteer wishes you smooth sailing in your final preparations.*it is a lesson that mr. dimmick must relearn almost daily.

six types of party guest, vol. 23, issue 72

even people who never entertain are more likely to give a party during the winter holidays than at other times of year. maybe that’s why etiquetteer has been thinking about different kinds of party guests and what can be done about them . . .the early: you’re rushing about filling candy dishes or turning the roast or, saints preserve us, getting out of the shower, and ding-dong, there’s miss pearl early, 15 minutes or more ahead, blithely unaware and ready to party. park her in the living room with an apologetic smile and a “i’ve still got a few things to do before seven o’clock, but then i’ll be right with you.” (etiquetteer sees no reason not to mention the time, as long as you can do so kindly.) if they offer to help, put them to work! hosts can mitigate the impact of early arrivals by planning to have “curtain up” 15-30 minutes before the party starts*. but really, weather permitting, it’s more thoughtful for early arrivals to walk around the block or wait in the car until the party starts. the tardy: flip the coin and you get the guest who waltzes in after dinner has been both held for them and finally served out of consideration for the other guests. (it can also be fatal on games night when you absolutely must have six players.) one can use traffic as an excuse only so much. hosts may only express surprise and delight when the tardy arrive, but if they’ve missed the soup, they’ve missed the soup. the allergic: now before you get all up in arms, etiquetteer has to point out that we live in a much more sympathetic time about food allergies. you can’t just grin and bear it if eating something could send you to the hospital or the morgue. but to hear “oh, i can’t eat this” when everyone is already at the table is one of the greatest challenges a host can face. the standard solution is scrambled eggs, but even then that takes the host back to the kitchen away from the table. for those with severe allergies**, pre-party communication is key to a smooth evening. sometimes that means bringing your own refreshments, which is perfectly proper when handled with discretion. the critic: nothing is good enough for some people, who share suggestions about how things could have been done differently throughout the party. people forget sometimes that a private home is not a restaurant where one pays for the hospitality one wants. if you don’t want to be invited back (and perhaps you don’t), this is the way to do it — but etiquetteer doesn’t recommend it. be kind. the deejay: don’t like the host’s music? don’t like the host’s absence of music? grin and bear it. unless specifically asked, keep your hands off the a/v, and don’t maneuver your own playlist over the speakers. hosts makes choices about whether or not to have music to create the atmosphere they want to project. if you prefer a different atmosphere, what a wonderful opportunity for you to give your own party.the perfectly proper: this is the guest we all enjoy the most, who has reread the invitation on the day of the party to know when to arrive, how to get there, and what to bring (if anything). the perfectly proper arrive on time, smiling, ready to make conversation with all present, and to help out if absolutely necessary. they don’t overstay their welcome, and send a lovely note of thanks the next day. it is a joy to entertain them.*and really, that moment of quiet anticipation when everything is ready and the lighting is just so . . . it’s one of the nicest moments any host can have.**it is really not at all perfectly proper to plead allergy when you just don’t like something. 
































random ideas about the holidays, vol. 23, issue 71


december 11, 2024





they’re getting closer and closer, the winter holidays*. the jury is out on whether or not that mr. dimmick who thinks he knows so much will, like christina crawford, “get the cards out on time, ok?” but there is still time to consider a few things “to make the season bright.” etiquetteer turns for inspiration today to dame curtsy’s book of novel entertainments for every day of the year. first, let’s consider gifts of money. etiquetteer is not alone in wanting gifts to feel more like gifts and less like transactions. that is one of the drawbacks of the ubiquitous gift card. dame curtsy gave a surprise when she wrote “there are occasions when it is best to give money instead of articles.” but she quickly justified etiquetteer’s position by adding “even then there may be a pleasant mystery about receiving it.” origami is one way (several possible folds may be found here at the daily dabble), and dame curtsy describes a man folding greenbacks into the folds of a paper fan to give to his mother. she also recommends a scavenger hunt for young children to find silver dollars hidden throughout the house. (that could be challenging.) of course there is nothing wrong with the plain white envelope (either handed directly to the recipient or hidden on the christmas tree); etiquetteer likes those best when they include a handwritten message from the giver, too.dame curtsy recommends some, shall we say, involved ways of distributing gifts. etiquetteer doesn’t think much of her “snowball christmas” idea to roll every gift in cotton, “dip lightly in mucilage or gum arabic water, then sprinkle plentifully with diamond dust. pile these balls in a pyramid . . . with a wreath of holly around them.” the entire house would glitter like varykino until memorial day! more user friendly is the “christmas barrel,” a large barrel decorated with crepe paper and holly and ribbons, placed somewhere in the house where everyone could get to it before christmas to put their presents in. “at breakfast it was rolled into the dining room and the contents disclosed” by a family member chosen to be santa by drawing candy canes instead of straws. “this is not much trouble, and infinitely better than just the ordinary way of giving things.” she also suggests putting presents into an urn as a table centerpiece, and making a “huge stocking . . . with a wire in the hem around the top to keep it open.” if you’re looking for some novelty in your christmas morning, one of these methods might be worth exploring. etiquetteer wishes you joy as you contemplate novelty, tradition, and of course perfect propriety for the holiday of your choice.*indeed, 2024 uniquely synchronizes the three winter holidays. hanukkah begins at sundown on december 25 and kwanzaa begins december 26.

punch, vol. 23, issue 70


december  8, 2024





“fill the flowing bowl with cheer, make the welkin ring!” — “jingle bells from capitol records,” capitol studio orchestra“. . . and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim with their delicious steam.” — a christmas carol, by charles dickens“claret for the curate, burgundy for the vicar, port for the bishop, champagne for the archbishop — the hierarchy of punch.” — uncle paxton in the flower girls, by clemence danedoes anyone really make and serve punch at home any longer, or is it just confined to wedding receptions and other events in church halls? (one certainly does not see it in hotels.) perhaps it’s because the necessary equipment is so bulky to store. one must have a proper punch bowl — which doesn’t have to be large; they can hold as little as a gallon — and punch cups, and a good-sized ladle. or perhaps punch just acquired a reputation for being too sweet. etiquetteer grew up with something called golden methodist punch, invariably served at any function in the church hall, which included ginger ale or sprite, various frozen fruit juices, and lemon sherbet. (often these are enhanced with an ice ring of frozen punch decorated with maraschino cherries and mint leaves and heaven knows what else.) palates of this century require something a bit more sophisticated — or spiked. etiquetteer once made a punch with nothing but sauterne and lemon sorbet. most refreshing, but lethal after more than two servings.the more english tradition is for a hot punch made with some sort of wine, often (and fondly by the cognoscenti) known as smoking bishop. eggnog is more typical in the states; people forget that it is actually a punch, milk punch, and may be served from a punch bowl as well as a pitcher or individually. etiquetteer loves a good eggnog (in moderation), and you’ll find etiquetteer’s family recipe here. (max miller at tasting history offers a boozy eggnog and another 19th-century recipe — worth your attention.)if you’re going to serve punch at your holiday party (or home wedding — and why not?), be sure you have all the needed equipment: a punch bowl and a handled tray of silver, glass, or porcelain; punch cups (glass or silver are best, repurposing teacups is not what etiquetteer would call perfectly proper), a ladle, and napkins*. none of these things have to match, thank goodness. if the punch is so good the bowl gets emptied, it should be brought back to the kitchen to be refilled. no one should see the magic happen. there’s an old stereotype about church socials with two punch bowls at opposite ends of the table. one is spiked and one is plain. if alcohol isn’t part of your regime, for whatever reason, and there’s only one punch bowl, you may certainly ask if the punch is spiked before accepting a glass, and decline it if it is.etiquetteer wishes you the punchiest and most perfectly proper functions this season. *dear mother, may she rest in peace, would want you to have a napkin in case of drips.
































ten tips for holiday parties, vol. 23, issue 69


december  4, 2024





hosts and guests need a refresher on getting through the holiday party circuit happily and with perfect propriety. it can be done! herewith, a few tips, not just from etiquetteer.etiquetteer has long said “for maximum fun potential, arrive early.” but the great shirley bassey said it even more forcefully: “you better get this party started!” don’t wait around. show up in the first 15 minutes. the hosts will be relieved people are actually there.the late sarah bernhardt had two words she used to make guests feel especially welcome. when someone arrived she would exclaim “enfin!”* to indicate that she had been eagerly awaiting them. and when they came to bid farewell, she would ask “déjà?” in a regretful tone, perhaps cocking her head a little, to show sadness that their time together had come to an end.**for many people, covid is still an important, anxious factor in going out. the pandemic has made us more sympathetic to last-minute cancellations due to illness (or should have). if you’re experiencing symptoms, please be prudent. joan crawford includes noel coward’s praise of her in her book my way of life: “‘joan not only gives a party, she goes to it.’ i think that’s one secret of a good party: all the arrangements seem so effortless as if they floated down from a nearby cloud and the hostess had nothing to do but enjoy herself.” spoken like a hostess who could hire help and did, but the point remains for those of us who can’t. when you have to do it all yourself, the arrangements seem effortless at the party when you put rigorous attention into the details beforehand.***if you are bringing wine, as many people do, don’t expect to be served what you’ve brought, especially on arrival. the best hors d’oeuvres are those that leave nothing behind. toothpicks and shrimp tails are inconvenient enough, not to mention lamb bones from those succulent lamb lalas (or whatever they’re called). but porcelain spoons for meatballs and other tasty bits, and even demitasse cups for soup sips — as that precious woman said in unzipped, “fussy, finished!” keep your refreshments simple. more wisdom from joan crawford: “even with a buffet, people must sit down to eat. you just can’t ask guests to stand around balancing a plate, silver, a serviette****, and trying to find a fourth hand for a glass of wine.” she’s not wrong!*****party conversations swirl like river currents, which means they can begin and end abruptly. don’t feel offended if you weren’t able to finish that story because the other guest was tapped on the shoulder by a long-lost friend. just keep moving. lady macbeth was perhaps a bit brusque when she told her dinner guests “at once, good night. stand not upon the order of your going, but go at once.”****** great-grandmother dougherty was more succinct: “if ya gonna go, go!” don’t bring your hosts to the point where they’re ordering you out of the house. leave early enough that your departure is regretted — so that when sarah bernhardt asks you “déjà?” she really does miss you already.now you knew etiquetteer would say this . . . send a lovely note of thanks afterward! if you time it correctly, your holiday card can double for this purpose. now sally forth and have a good time!*etiquetteer has been known to exclaim “finalmente!” for much the same reason.**etiquetteer just cannot find the source of this charming little bit at the moment.***my way of life, page 78.****“serviette” is never perfectly proper; she could be the french maid. always say “napkin.”*****my way of life, page 78.******macbeth, act iii, scene iv

sweaty palms, vol. 23, issue 68


december  1, 2024





“men wore white gloves, i’m glad to say, and that was very nice that they wore gloves. because then your dress didn’t get stained behind [by] the sweat from the hand.” — diana tennant, interviewed in the 2001 bbc documentary debutantes dear etiquetteer:my wife and i are going to a weekly scottish country dancing class/social dance. it’s a mixed bag of experienced dancers and beginners, with singles as well as couples. the social part is everyone, and the experienced people pair up with beginners. regardless, most dances involve progressing through other partners. one of the other dancers has what can only be described as grossly sweaty hands. is there anything one can politely say to get them to maybe dry them between dances?dear dancing:there are few better ways to get to know an entire room full of people than country dancing. if you are dancing “longways for as many as will,” which is two lines of couples facing each other, you will end up dancing at least one figure with everyone in the line. perspiring hands have long been known as a dance hazard, so gentlemen already have a couple solutions. at a ball a gentleman wore a pair of white gloves* (sometimes provided by the hostess) so that his hand would not leave sweaty marks on the ballgowns of his partners. “if a lady waltz with you, beware not to press her waist; you must only lightly touch it with the open palm of your hand, lest you leave a disagreeable impression not only on her ceinture*, but on her mind,” wrote the perfect gentleman in 1860. indeed, professor thomas e. hill, in the essential handbook of victorian etiquette, suggested that gentlemen have two pairs, one to wear before supper and one to wear after. to etiquetteer that suggests that freshness matters.dancing gloves must be white. “white gloves are indispensable,” according to the amateur’s preceptor on dancing & etiquette, by d.l. carpenter. '“do not wear black or colored gloves, lest your partner look sulky,” added charles william day in his hints on etiquette. their emphasis was that gentlemen who might prefer darker gloves because they were in mourning had no business in a ballroom to begin with. a country dance is too informal for white gloves. but professor hill provides our solution. “no gentleman should use his bare hand to press the waist of a lady in the waltz. if without gloves, he should carry a handkerchief in his hand.” why not offer this oblivious sweaty dancer a clean handkerchief in friendly fashion after the first dance? “i find i work up a sweat after the first dance, don’t you? oh no, keep it, i have another.” a bandana might be more in keeping with the informality of the dance, or even a tartan hanky since you specify scottish country dancing. make this a habit every week, and this person should eventually take the hint and provide their own. you are careful not to specify the gender of this dancer — and of course all humans can work up a sweat. but etiquetteer must emphasize that a gentleman does not correct a lady on something as basic as hygiene, nor a lady a gentleman. the offer of a handkerchief is one thing, but an extended discussion is quite another. take care not to create embarrassment.etiquetteer wishes you many joyful evenings, “foot[ing] it featly here and there, and sweet sprites bearing the [sweaty] burden.”****a lady always wore gloves no matter what, including while dancing, but not at table.**“a belt or sash for the waist,” according to the dictionary.***the tempest, act i, scene ii.
































ten tips for thanksgiving manners, vol. 23, issue 67


november 27, 2024





for those who might need a little refresher in perfect propriety at the table before thanksgiving tomorrow, etiquetteer has ten tips that should help the great feast go smoothly:if your thanksgiving dinner is served at table, wait until everyone is served before starting to eat. if it’s a buffet, wait until at least one other person has joined you at the table before starting. many households include the saying of grace before the start of a meal. under no circumstances should you begin eating until after grace has been said.the only screen involved in a great feast should be a coromandel screen masking the kitchen door. that means no television, and especially no phones at the table. it does not matter if the game is on. don’t make etiquetteer come after you.remember the handy mnemonic bmw for your place setting: bread is to the left, your meal is in the middle, and water/wine is to the right. it’s so easy to reach for someone else’s bread plate, especially at a round table. take care.serving dishes are passed to the right in the u.s. they are not properly passed to the left, and they should not be passed across the table. be patient with those who have difficulty serving themselves. keep everything moving — don’t let the whole service stack up to your left!use the ladle in the gravy boat. don’t pour out of the spout, which was actually created not for pouring but to rest the handle of the ladle.salt and pepper shakers may look alike. if so, go ahead and shake a little into your hand to see what you’re getting yourself into. (etiquetteer comments more on this here.)your napkin goes in your lap, and stays there until you leave the table. if you’re leaving the table for seconds (as happens at the great feasts) or to wash your hands, put your napkin on your chair. if you are leaving the table for the final time, casually leave your napkin to the left of your plate.the only reason one leaves the table mid-meal (besides seconds) is “to wash your hands.” no one needs to know specifically what you’re going to do in the bathroom, for heaven’s sake.it is thoughtful to ask your hosts how you can help, especially after the meal. and it is even more thoughtful to do what they ask of you, whether that’s hand-washing the silver or leaving them alone to take care of cleanup themselves.never assume you’re going home with leftovers, even if it’s a tradition at the thanksgiving dinner you attend. sure, bring your containers to be prepared, but leave them in the car or disguised in an opaque tote bag. no one needs to be aware of your mouth-watering, anticipatory gluttony.etiquetteer wishes you a beautiful, savory, peaceful, and perfectly proper thanksgiving.

restaurant dining, vol. 23, issue 66

“you should know,” she explained, in an indulgent tone, “that we of the non-useful class depend for our amusement upon departure from precedent. just now it is a fad to put ice in champagne. the idea was originated by a visiting prince of tartary while dining at the waldorf. it will soon give way to some other whim. just as at a dinner party this week on madison avenue a green kid glove was laid by the plate of each guest to be put on and used while eating olives.” — from “while the auto waits,” by o. henrydear etiquetteer:we ordered a nice bottle of wine with our dinner at a great restaurant in our neighborhood recently. (we live in a big city.) i was a little wary when the server brought a stemless wineglass for my partner to try the wine first — surely it was only for the initial tasting, right? but no, we were brought stemless glasses after all. etiquetteer, this is not my favorite choice. could i have asked the server to bring actual stemmed wineglasses?the other problem with this otherwise good dinner was the silverware. when our first course plates were cleared, the server carefully moved our used knives and forks from where we had put them across our plates back onto the table so that we could use them for the next course. at those prices, i felt like they needed to up their game and bring clean silver for each course. what should i have said?dear dining:etiquetteer sympathizes. when expectations are not met, it can feel disconcerting. even so, it’s really important not to take it out on the waiter. front line restaurant staff don’t make decisions about a restaurant’s standard of service, including equipment; they merely carry it out. so be kind in how you bring this up.stemless wineglasses are not perfectly proper*, not just because the heat of one’s hands affects the temperature of the wine, but because of the unsightly fingerprints. and yet etiquetteer understands it, of course. they came to be because humans crave novelty. earlier this century it was novel to serve craft cocktails in mason jars, as though they were moonshine. when etiquetteer was served a martini that way in a new york hotel noted for its sophistication — let’s just say the entire experience was off brand. etiquetteer hopes the novelty of a stemless wineglass will fade**.had you asked for a stemmed wineglass, though, etiquetteer doubts the restaurant could have accommodated you. restaurants and bars have very limited storage for their equipment, and they probably don’t have space for them. ask politely if you will, but be prepared to grin and bear the stemless to your lips***. if you return, bringing your own glassware might feel right in the moment, but a) it will only call attention from other diners, and b) you then have to take home dirty glasses. etiquetteer does not recommend this approach.as to the soiled silver, yes, etiquetteer shares your, um, revulsion. used silver is never put back on the table. but some restaurants are like that. you could have asked “could you bring us fresh silver, please?” immediately as the waiter was moving the silver. but what if the response had been “no, one knife and fork per person!” the only recourse then would have been to “accidentally” drop your silver onto the floor. then they would have to bring you fresh silver. this is an opportunity to vote with your pocketbook. as with any business, if you’re unhappy with the product or service, bring your business elsewhere. but don’t be a karen about it.*it’s possible to repurpose them for trifles, parfaits, and other desserts.**more on the pros and cons of stemless wineglasses may be found in this 2022 article from the wine enthusiast.***when you are a guest in a private home, you absolutely say nothing if you don’t like how something is served. good heavens!



























chain of gossip, by norman rockwell.







gossip, vol. 23, issue 65


november 20, 2024





“reputation, reputation!” — victor von frankenstein*“he that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips**.” — proverbs 20:19dear etiquetteer:it has recently come to my attention that an ex-partner has been circulating all sorts of baseless and malicious stories about myself to anyone who will listen. this poses a problem as we have friends and acquaintances in common, some of whom have no qualms whatsoever in questioning further based on what has been said about me. my question to you is this: how does a person politely go about defending themselves when accused of malicious nonsense? my concern is that a failure to answer would be taken as admission whereas any answer at all is a loss of one’s temper and therefore impolite and graceless.dear silently outraged:etiquetteer is so sorry that you have to go through this. the best defense has always been to live your life in such a way that any malice directed at you would be unbelievable on its face. of course that’s a high bar to clear. etiquetteer could not clear it, and as for that mr. dimmick who thinks he knows so much . . . nuffus dixit! it didn’t even work for catherine of aragon, that pillar of domestic virtue. that business about virtue being its own reward is the bunk.etiquetteer appreciates that you want to deflect this situation politely, when it’s much more natural to go for the jugular. dignified silence remains perfectly proper, besides being a time-honored standard. even so, it isn’t always possible. that the source of these rumors is an ex-partner should encourage you that anything said can be brushed off. “oh, pat! still upset about our breakup and invested in making things difficult for me. none of it’s true. just disregard.” reverse the narrative. the real story is about your ex spreading lies, not about anything you did. etiquetteer doesn’t see the need for a social media post on the subject***, but something to address individually with friends when they bring it up (or if they already have).what’s more disturbing to etiquetteer is those of your circle so eager to gossip that they are asking for more details. that says more about who they are than it does about you. use that knowledge to create some distance. cultivate more distant acquaintances in your circle, and new friends. etiquetteer understands your anxiety not to be thought of as losing your temper. the manner of your response will make all the difference here. remaining calm in difficult situations is always the best defense. instead of vesuvius, be the placid stream slowly wearing down the rocks.etiquetteer wishes you the victory of truth over malice, and a circle of undoubted friends.*that’s fronk-en-steen.**more simply translated as “a gossip betrays a confidence; so avoid anyone who talks too much.”***etiquetteer almost said “press release” . . . how dated!
