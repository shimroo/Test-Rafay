servingwe work on behalf of god’s mission in and for the world, though giving and through our prayers. we believe that our faith calls us to care about the needs of our local community and world.



worshipping we sing together, listen to scripture together, confess together, pray together, and share meals together. in all these things, we seek to glorify god, and not ourselves. sunday worship services begin at 10:30 a.m., and last about 60-70 minutes.
