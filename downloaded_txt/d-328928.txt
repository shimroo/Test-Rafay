our mission

the congregation of the resurrection announces and gives witness to the paschal mystery.
convinced of god’s unconditional love for us, we herald the liberation and salvation of each person and society as a passage from death to life, in which every situation of evil and injustice will be overcome.
we call others, especially youth and families, to communities of the risen christ in which faith, hope and love radiate as a sign of our union with christ and his mother, mary, in the church. we are convinced that to do this, our congregation must be a model of christian community in which people are one in heart and mind.

we desire to be faithful to the grace received by our founder, a grace we now share by our call to the congregation of the resurrection. we recognize certain truths to be especially important for our life and work as resurrectionists because they give expression to the grace and call.
