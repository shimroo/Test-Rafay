formaldehyde free bkt contains 2% ether!





we currently do not offer brazilian keratin treatment (bkt) due to safety concerns. some people think it is safe to be treated with a 2% formaldehyde solution. i believe it is not especially if the salon is doing many bkts per day the air in the salon will be toxic containing greater that a 2% concetration of formaldehyde gas in the air!most salons have varying concentrations of ammonia in the air ( from perms, color and tr)  when you do a bkt the  formaldehyde or ether turns to a poisonous gas when pressed with the hot flat iron, mixing this gas with ammonia creates a deadly cocktail of gases. maybe it won't kill you today but one day your liver won't be able to handle it. this service is so easy to perform any client can do it at home! many hairstylists have difficulty with math and make up answers to your questions, so do your own research.formaldehyde free brazilian keratin treatment contains 2% ether!, which is an anesthetic with side effects such as nausea and lung irritation.click here to read the article in new york magazine . i don't understand why people just don't care about themselves or others until they get sick. more detailed information on the dangers of formaldehyde and aspartame which converts to formaldehyde then formic acid in the body!i love my clients and my staff. i want all of you to live long and be happy!!!

brazilian straighting aka bkt is deadly!





after studying the ingredients and speaking to some stylists in brazil, i have decided not to do this procedure. it is a procedure that has caused death from exposure to the chemical ingredients. not only are they toxic during the procedure the chemicals stay in your hair so you are exposed 24/7. i have included a link to a woman who has died from this cancer causing product.click her for cbs news storymost hairstylists are uneducated, never ask the right questions, are generally lazy, they believe what the salespeople tell them. so please don't blindly trust your stylist ask questions, do research, be a smart consumer.me in brazil doing my research! bkt is basically a service done by the low end salons in brazil. the nice salons don't touch bkt. as they say in brazil "es muito mal"
