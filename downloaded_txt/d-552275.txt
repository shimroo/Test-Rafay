“to me, this is the best crab house in the country. the spice they use for crabs is outstanding. i've never got a bad batch from here, and the atmosphere is great! on cooler days/nights, definitely go outside to eat your crabs. they are right on the water. i always get at least a dozen large crabs here every time i go. the staff is very friendly and attentive, and the food is top tier! if you are looking for the best steamed blue crabs, your search is over! .... see, now i have to go visit after writing this .... see y'all soon!”– robert f, google review august 2021
