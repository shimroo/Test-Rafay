“it is so important to me that everyone know this bank is actually helping the community and local small businesses. i want to give credit where credit is due, my business island dragway is forced closed by covid-19. i applied for the paycheck protection plan as soon as it was available and have heard horror stories from friends using big-name banks. first hope bank was on top of everything, in constant communication, and always treated my business as a priority without blowing me off for a ‘bigger fish.’ thanks to them i can pay my full-time employees and our health insurance for eight more weeks.”— melissa m., island dragway“we just wanted to thank you for all your help and patience throughout our home buying process! we know we had a ton of questions and needed a lot of help. you were wonderful! we are so excited about our new home and couldn’t have done it without your guidance. thank you!”— jackie & ted“may i just mention that i love the new page configuration for the bill payment section of the online banking site. so much nicer to see all the activity on the one page with that quick payment section. thank you so much for this very great improvement!”— anonymous
