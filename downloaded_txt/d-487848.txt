vision and mission

partnering with the local and international community to conserve the falkland islands’ natural environment.




 






 

our work
falklands conservation is the largest membership-based conservation charity in the islands, since 1979. we work on behalf of our members and in partnership with the local and international community to conserve the falklands’ natural environment through community outreach, practical conservation research and delivery.

          find out more        





we work in the following ways:
 
community involvement
understand and represent the falklands community in falklands conservation’s programmes, including the junior membership, the watch group.
 
conservation action
effective conservation of habitats and species.
 
conservation ambition
influence decisions within society for the benefit of the natural environment.
 
conservation priorities
strengthening bio-security and invasive species policies and procedures, ensuring best practice for offshore and onshore developments, terrestrial habitat restoration and enhancing marine management.












 

new island restoration
the new island restoration programme aims to restore our new island site in the falklands, by removing invasive species to protect and rejuvenate its unique wildlife and habitats. key goals include reintroducing endemic species, safeguarding endangered birds, and combating ecological degradation. but crucial funding is still required in order to realise this programme through to success.

whale projects
the project aims to better understand sei and southern right whales in the falkland islands, critical to developing effective conservation and management of whale populations, and ensuring their continued recovery from the whaling era. here you can view the 2020 video whales of the falkland islands, produced alongside our research project.

#falklands conservation has completed the first-ever trial translocation of cobb’s wren, moving birds to an island that has previously been cleared of invasive rats, opening up new rodent-free territory for wrens to thrive in. 🐦🌿 

our team spent the day carefully gathering, measuring, and ringing the birds before transporting them in specially designed boxes to their new home. by giving them a helping hand, we’re helping them reclaim lost habitat and boost their population. 

a huge thanks to our partners & volunteers for making this milestone possible, especially the darwin plus scheme for funding this vital conservation action. 

now, we wait & watch—fingers crossed for breeding success next summer! 🤞💚 #conservationwin #falklandsnature6 days ago

🧡🐧 happy penguin awareness day! 🐧🧡

today, we’re celebrating the incredible penguins that call the falkland islands home. 🏝️ with five breeding species—including the iconic king and gentoo penguins—the falklands are one of the best places in the world to witness these charismatic birds in their natural habitat. 🌊

but our penguins face challenges, from climate change to threats to their food sources. that’s why falklands conservation works tirelessly to protect their habitats and ensure their future. 🌱

join us in honouring these amazing birds by supporting our conservation efforts! 🐧💙
