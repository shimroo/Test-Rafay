welcome to the hostel in the forest.












































we teach a hands-on approach to a sustainable lifestyle through activities such as alternative building and organic gardening while complementing the processes of nature.while the hostel is not dedicated to any particular religion or denomination, its educational programs and services are designed to integrate the ecological, social, spiritual, economic and emotional aspects of the human condition.



welcome back to the hostel in the forest, it has come to my attention that we are still getting guests who have only recently found out that we have reopened and are hosting again. the hostel has never really done any form of advertising, and most articles that are on the web are done with us finding out after they've been published. i guess that we have always been old fashioned in depending on word of mouth means of spreading news of our existence.i suppose that we have caught up in some sense, as our board determined that some social media presence might be helpful, and of course you are reading this message on our web page.i would like to take this opportunity to welcome you back to the hostel in the forest, and hope that you might tell a friend that we are open and ready to host you in this very special place. we have done a lot of work on the space and are almost finished with the cedar shingle restoration project on both of our geodesic domes. they look as if they were built just yesterday, and not back in 1975.a pebble is tossed into the stillness of the lake, and its ripples move outward in all directions. that is similar to the spirit of this forest and the goodness that resonates within all who visit this land. they take something with them when they leave, hopefully some amount of peace, similar to the stillness of that lake.i look forward to seeing you again, or to perhaps meeting you for the first time under our canopy of oak, pine, gum, maple, and holly.may the forest be with you,tom
