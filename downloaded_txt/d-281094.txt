thank you for checking in on us.
while lou deals with his medical treatments, all band activity is essentially on hold, meaning every show we had confirmed for 2024 has been canceled. at present, we don’t have any other shows booked in 2025, because we have to wait until lou’s treatment is complete before deciding when we can hit the road again.we are eternally grateful to everyone who donated to help lou, either directly or through the various merchandise charities other bands or companies have helped out with. the outpouring of support means the world to us, and is a reminder of how lucky we’ve been to have such a fiercely loyal fan base.new york city hardcore legends sick of it all aren’t slowing down with age, the long-standing quartet are still pissed off…




  



the genre stalwarts still see many years ahead. sick of it all remain a beacon of continuity, integrity and resolve. that's good news for sick of it all fans and the hardcore scene. since forming in 1986, sick of it all have traveled the world many times over, played in front of hundreds of thousands and released 11 acclaimed full-length albums. the latest of which is the riotous if anthemic "wake the sleeping dragon!".
