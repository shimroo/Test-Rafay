about 
uc choral ensembles, also known as ucce, is at the heart of music at uc berkeley. we are comprised of nine groups, and we’re based in the basement of the cesar chavez student center on lower sproul plaza. we offer students many exciting learning and performance opportunities, including the development of musical and vocal skills and the exploration of a wide-variety of musical styles. there’s something for everyone in ucce, from cal songs, to jazz, to classical, and even musicals! our groups have plenty of individual shows as well as larger shows, such as welcome back to a cappella and the west coast showcase. if that’s not enough, many of our groups love to perform for passers-by on sproul plaza on a weekly basis.
