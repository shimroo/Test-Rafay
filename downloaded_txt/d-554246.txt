the mean reds
[mar. 25th, 2006|09:20 pm]
vintageserenade




it's not quite that feeling of the blahs, but rather the blahs and the 'mean reds' (to quote breakfast at tiffany's... possibly one of my favourite movies of all time). tomorrow is another swimming trial (4 hours about... another 5 in the auditorium... 8 o'clock wakeup call; joy) then finally can i faint with the realisation that i've finished my instructors. who knew that becoming a swimming instructor was so difficult and trying??but... tomorrow could pose other, more troubling problems. ie = history essay on the fall of the roman empire, due monday =(*sigh* i suppose i deserve it, being the worst procrastinator ever. i think that certain people have been influencing me, so it is partially their fault. i seem to do better (strangely) with this terrible horrible and malicious (=p) influence directed my way...after monday is tuesday (ha, both jazzy days) and then skip wednesday to thursday, which is ovjf. solo madness!!friday is a bit of a relief, the end of this bloody week and (skip saturday) sunday! sunday promises to be very epic. in a few words can i sum it up = timbits, cuddly, nerves, loooooove and 6 months. gosh.last lesson plan done... ranger *bloody* patrol. and now time for bed. dark hot chocolate for brekkie tomorrow, then swimming madness and crash.i've got my zen back, i think. - cheers

quote... madness

"switch to 1951. it has been a long winter: picture snow drifts, as big as the bathtub filled with tepid water where you thawed your frozen feet from skating, falling in shallow pools of melting snow, snowflakes you can taste (peppermint and the black soot from the glass factory across the water). i revelled in a glorious winter; cold enough to chill the bone, almost warm."guess.

first post in weeks...

they're telling me 'do you know how easy it is to add a photo?' well, dearest livejournal, no i don't... (or so i thought... before seeing the drop down menu juuust above this space -_-).

damn.

but anyway, i've decided to post something (surprise) just for the hell of it. no idea what to say, which is always something nice in a situation like this.

but how unoriginal is this title? -----------

moving on from the useless commentary up there... i've decided to post this poem i wrote on demand (read: at the end of a flaming poker) for jess. i don't know if she likes it, and frankly i don't care too much for it... but *criticism* is welcome. not like anyone reads this =pno your majesty    sweet lover of apolloit was not my purpose to say.but he who writes prosy proseunder pretense of a scowldoes flutter my heart.black brows drawn impossibly close    and dark eyeslay out my features like a puzzle;that which do anger my heart.ill favoured lover!    do not scoff with impatiencebut laugh, at your folly.majesty, with irrepressible selfishness,i abhore your visage completely.what a strange fawn    to come to me,    (pan on lute)for a lover's trifle.no measure of garish coverdo cloak your sneer,and none very well mark a pretty face(which ere would i laugh long)is it a faithless curse majesty,    to leave a love under that loveless gaze?(but not my purpose to say...)i tread the starsto find one to shed softer lighton your hardened cheek.and a lover's hand    will only smooth away marring frowns.but oh majesty! forget this lowly thane,or would i be last?    not to hide        my majesty's love letters...... yeah... i think it's a wierd shakespearian - (i can't believe i made the comparison!) (edit: think horribly overdone/historically inaccurate shakespearian movies) jane eyre cross over. with the one described as one mr rochester. -_-bleh. not to be compared to my other *stuff*, since this was written as a favour (read: in a life-death situation).it's dumb, but amusing i think... oh well...

the sun don't shine anymore...
[dec. 10th, 2005|09:50 pm]
vintageserenade




it's the 10th of december. a day that brings a pain to me, if only because it is the day that we lost one of the most soulful, cryin' voices. rick danko. formerly of the band, bassist and vocalist. violinist (fiddler?) and country boy.
now, i unabashadly say that i am in love with rick and have been this way for a year. it's hard to acknowledge his passing, because that would mean admitting we lost one so dear.
i know that not very many people are upset today, because not very many people know about rick or the band or how amazing they are. it was the song it makes no difference that really changed my focus and view; it made me see what the band truly was, what rick truly was. emotional, raw and heartwrenchingly beautiful...
it has been said that richard was the bluesy soul of the band, and levon was the guts. i think it's appropriate to say that rick was the heart. the wistful, loving heart. if you listen to the unfaithful servant, you'll see what i'm talking about. from the first flawless note, he sings from his heart and manages to touch other people. including yours truly.
the band's harmonies were a wonderful part of who they were, and rick usually took the sweeping harmony to add to richard's falsetto and levon's low end. it was a perfect blend, and none more perfect to do so. listen to the instrumentation, and the voice is almost instrumentation in itself.
it was the music he so loved, and the stage where he felt safe that was part of the end. for, it was just to make music that he really lived. 
thank you for the music ricky; always loved and remembered.
-- cheers

happy birthdays!

i'd just like to send out a big happy birthday to a couple of people very dear to me (one who i've been pestering all day; he's probably used to me now...)aaliyah - sweetie, you're three now. that means you're even more princess like. and one of these days, i will watch the last waltz with you, promise.andrew - we both know that i derive great joy from breaking these rules of mine, and bothering you to no end. hopefully, you don't think of it as 'bothering' per say; just great love. but as i said this morning, i hope you've had an amazing day. i just wish i could have spent it with you =)--cheers[oh, and to ricky on the 29th = *heart*]... even though i'll be making a special post that day...

slander to counter the atrocious propaganda put forth by the enemy...
[nov. 27th, 2005|10:22 pm]
vintageserenade




what follows is another installment into the on-going case about the maddening character of king harvest. this week we will focus on the man and his actions which prove to be a menace to all who have the misfortune to meet him.king harvest is a menace to society, due in large part to his love of flaunting his recent band acquisions in rienna's face. most recently, he waved the cds of rick danko and garth hudson in front of his webcam, knowing full well that rienna so coveted said music. even worse, he showed her the amazing picture of her unrequited love (rick) and then refused to show more, just because she wished to profess her love for the picture. a horrible person, who obviously wished to smite rienna's poor heart.it was a case of karma (divine intervention perhaps?) that put king harvest back in his place; bringing him down from the land of 'high and mightiness'. this came in the form of a so called 'mental lapse', where he saved a blank file over his reply to rienna's (always amazing) e-mail. previously, king harvest had laughed in rienna's sad face, when she told him that this incident had happened to her before. now, am i wrong to snicker when i say that he got his comeuppance?in a recent e-mail, kh made a reference to rienna's 'incompetence'. this man should be given the title of 'brutally cruel' and society should be wary of his seeming niceness. why is it that he so easily agreed with her when she mourned about her lack of competence? it is nice to know that he is such a supportive person in these matters. (which is ment with only the most potent form of sarcasm and scorn)the 'unhealthy viewing of king harvest's webcam', (referenced by him in the post that provoked this entry) is nothing but admiration and appreciation for the man. how it is that he calls rienna a spy is beyond her. she is simply smiling at the utter cuteness of said subject. and it is saddening that her admiration is met with cries that she is cruel. king harvest deserves all those threats of violence upon him. among the many, many other offences he has committed (too numerous to list) he has laughed long and hard about rienna's shortness. a thing she is not amused at. standing 5'4, she may be small to his 5'11, but her only defense mechanism at times of dire need will be to throw heavy objects or perform her (limited) karate skills. why the man goes to say that these actions of rienna are violent is a mystery; shouldn't they be easy to deflect and avoid? maybe he is just lying when he boasts about his 'superhuman skills' and afraid he will get ko-ed sometime in the future.this character also has a maddening lack of self confidence, which can be very eye-rolling-inducing at times. why he must worry is beyond the limits of the mind. he is already amazing and wonderful (to look aside of his mean-streak and cruel behaviours) and there is nothing that can change that.many times he has said that sagittarius are better than pisces - which every informed person knows is a complete lie. a pisces is better than a stupid cenetaur will ever be. they can swim, are very pretty (opposed to the strange sight of those pan-like creatures), agile and more. i do not wish to elaborate, or else kh might accuse me of being pigheaded. which i am not, because it is the truth. period. ask the astrologists and galileo.[i will go into detail at another time, just to list all the glories of the pisces.]king harvest is selfish. today, he remarked in an e-mail that he wishes the rain will freeze so the buses that rienna relies on to get her to school will be cancelled. even though she secretly wishes the same, he does not have to know that! it's his selfish wishes which attribute in part to her insommnia. because she is thinking of him, of course.he has also infiltrated her subconscious, as at times, rienna's friends have remarked on her sudden bouts of smiling and lack of attention to matters of school. which is all well and good, as he is not here at the moment. she must resign herself to keeping him in her thoughts instead. when he does come however, it will be even more difficult to get him out of her conscious thought.i must also remark sadly about the sorry tale of his boots. they have lasted 2 years... and are all scuffy and broken in. what's even worse is the fact that they double as dress shoes. a traversty, to say the very least. rienna now has to take it upon herself to bring some new shoes into his life. while these boots have been faithful and loyal, it is time to say goodbye m'dear. it's over the hill for them.the man is a menace and cruel. rienna only hopes that this will not change, as she rather likes the menace in him... but will continue to deny this comment because she is very stubborn.so ends part two of our investigation. will there be more?! i should say so, as it is 100% certain that king harvest will continue his menace-like behaviours and take delight in doing so.

king harvest: insight into this shady character
[nov. 22nd, 2005|08:00 pm]
vintageserenade




this is a journal about the elusive, maddening king harvest. yeah, that guy.many people believe that this king harvest character is a stalker. i know i did once. however, evidence has suggested that monsieur kh is no stalker. this guy would be a very sad stalker, indeed as he has no methods to pursue active transportation. simply put: he must use public transit or walk. not an ideal situation for stalker material.king harvest has proven himself guilty as charged when it comes to his mean streak. this guy frequently calls the sad rienna names. names like 'stupid' when it comes to dancing to footloose, and likes to laugh evilly at her woes against technology at large. just because some people don't have tech savvy skills, doesn't mean they should be laughed at.this man, who has an enormous illegal cd stash, also laughs when rienna talks about her own pathetic collection. she takes this moment to stick her tongue out at king harvest. even if they will have an assimilated collection someday...another thing about king harvest is that he likes to mess around with his hair. secret footage (taken from a webcam kh unwillingly set up for rienna's utter amusement) shows him frequently fixing his hair. reader, we have lost count of the number of times. for future reference, king harvest, you should know that rienna will now proceed to mess up your hair herself. in fact, she will derive much pleasure from it.this man seems like he doesn't have a weakness... but he does!we managed to find out that he loves strawberry/banana cupcakes. he said they lured him in with their deliciousness. this may be true, and proves that he does in fact have a weak spot.(which rienna will proceed to exploit to her own advantages...)there is also the case of poking. kh has gone on record on the case of poking. rienna takes great delight in knowing that she will have the chance to poke said man.(even though he will probably use his own form of force - hugging - to stop her onslaught.)this is only part of the investigation into the king harvest character. stay tuned...

staging full scale noodle warfare at a pool near you

[music: richard manuel: georgia on my mind]it's this kind of music that puts one in a blog-writing kind of mood...i'm beginning to question the sanitary conditions of ontario pools. i don't think they have someone hired to check conditions. they are terrible... and yes, i know that this is to be expected. but if i'm going to be -eventually- working there, then i think that some guarantee of sanitation is required.point and proof: yesterday we were doing various guarding sits and i happened to see a millipede crawl on its millipede legs on the pool deck.then someone took a lid, smashed it and dunked the newly christened millipede covered thing in the pool...ah, the sanity of people make me question the human race.recently in to, there was the santa claus parade. that was my childhood man. that and the ex. it makes me really sad that no one will go with me to these things any more; they are busy or have strange excuses. i want to ride the rickety old rides at the ex and go to the food buildings and go insane (only like the wierd torontonians can). and ride the streetcars instead of the stifling subways.the same with the santa claus parade... i loved everything but the upside down clowns. they still scare the hell out of me; i always wondered how they managed to walk on their hands the whole time... santa is great though. that jolly ol' elf. it makes me sad that he is using the internet now. telling kids to e-mail him their christmas lists instead of by mail. what happened to the post? and the little elves who sort the mail and check the naughty-nice list?my childhood dreams have died and burst into flame.my bob dylan documentary got stolen today. one of my friends wanted to borrow it, and my enthusiasm for educating the uninitiated to the wonders of good music won over my parinoia (somewhat). there were groundrules that were laid though. yeah.1)any scratches on said disk or cover mean death2)losing no direction home means death3)stealing ndh means death4)falling in love with rick danko is unacceptable because i have already done so... and therefore means (a less painful) death--cheers"now you understand the oriental passion for tea," said japhy.

why is it that i am not internet savvy?
[nov. 19th, 2005|10:56 pm]

the first post and already i hate this site.getting here (to this post, as this user) was an adventure. fucking livejournal.to start, i will bitch and complain as i usually do:why is it that it was so damn hard to find a username? at first, i had the brilliant idea of looking up the jellicle cats names. turns out i wasn't the only one. every name was taken. i'd be alright with it if a few were used. but no.i wanted my name to be 'tantomile' at first. looked up the name; user was purged and deleted. heh, turns out i have to purchase some sort of rename thing ($15 american) to use the name.so now, i've ended up with 'vintageserenade'. sounds like a rejected stevie nicks song.another thing; uploading the picture was terrible. it had to be resized (which for the life of me, i couldn't do) and then there were errors downloading it. ah, things are so messed up.--cheers
