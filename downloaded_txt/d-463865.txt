how to train your cockapoo to be more confident 



learning a dog can really be fun, and it will allow him to build his confidence in you, and in the human
being in general. teaching him some simple commands like sitting, lying down, and coming is a good
foundation for the next exercises. when your dog is lost, he will then be inclined to turn to you for
instructions. his shyness will be replaced by confidence in you. other education like agility can build a
confidence and ultimately bring him to be a proud dog.
here are some examples:
teach him politeness
have your dog sit down every time you pet him, give him treats, feed him, play ball with him, or open a
door. if this may seem extreme, these exercises will help him build a behavioral framework. this
framework will allow him to de-stress since it is a situation that he will be used to addressing. this
exercise will also push your dog to turn to you when in doubt.
sensitize your dog
the best way to help him control his fear is still to submit him to it. in no case is it a question of stuffing
it into the arms of a stranger the first time, be careful! but if your dog is afraid of a child, start by
showing him a child from afar, several meters away. little by little, approach, and after a few weeks, he
can accept to be touched by the child! stop exercising as soon as you notice that your dog is stressed.

rewarding efforts
this can be a good complement to the previous exercise. as soon as your dog makes a social effort,
reward him. if he sits next to strangers, congratulate him with a word or sound (a clicker or a simple
&quot;yes&quot;) and then deliver him a treat. do this as soon as he approaches someone he was afraid of before,
and it will make him want to do it again. conditioning is the best way for him to no longer be afraid.
a social problem
the vast majority of the time, the fear of the animal is triggered when it sees a stranger or a certain
type of person. the first step in your procedure will need to determine who your dog is afraid of. you
may sometimes think that your dog is scared for no reason, but you will really have to think and analyze
his environment. start making a list of things or people that may have frightened your dog or made him
shy. the list may be different for each dog, and thats not a problem. some animals will be afraid of
strangers, others of children of a certain age, others of men of a certain size, etc. once the culprit is
found, you can start the exercises.

if you need more care tips for your new cockapoo, a good breeder, like puff n stuff cockapoos who offer pre-trained cockapoos for sale as well as new cockapoo puppies for sale!

hotel for dogs and cats, how to choose it 


there are hotels for dogs and cats that have wonderful facilities and services. depending on your budget, you can opt for a hotel for cats that has a brushing service, piped music with chill-out music, and even individual luxury suites with their own private garden.

if you are going to leave your cat in a hotel, keep in mind that you must make sure that it meets certain requirements. a hotel for cats that you can trust, and that allows you to go on vacation with peace of mind knowing that your cat is in good hands, must have certain characteristics:

must be licensed to operate as a cat hotel. the residences and hotels for cats and dogs must have a license to operate as a zoological nucleus that regulates each autonomous community.
even if they offer a pick-up and delivery service, they should allow you to visit the facilities before you make the decision. when you visit, talk to the caretakers and make sure they have the necessary experience.
the facilities must be spacious and clean. your cat will need an individual space where he can eat, drink and rest. if you indicate it, your cat can access spaces shared with other cats, but it must always have its own space. this is critical.
the food must be adequate, even if you prefer it, make sure that the cat hotel allows you to bring your own food.
it has a permanent surveillance system, also at night.
although health care is not mandatory, you will leave your cat and go on vacation with more peace of mind if the hotel has a veterinary service. during your visit to the facilities, ask about a california certified veterinarian service in the area and the action protocols in the event that a cat becomes ill.


if you go on vacation, make sure your cat is in the best condition. do not feel guilty if you have to leave it in a cat hotel, just make sure it is a suitable place where it has its space and privacy. remember that if you get your cat used to socializing with other animals and people in advance, it will be easier for him to adapt quickly to a short stay in a cat hotel. it could be a great experience for him!

what to take into account before adopting a golden retriever? 


before running to choose your puppy, i want to share with you this very useful information that you should read very carefully so that you can draw your own conclusions about what is most convenient when making a final decision.
there are some aspects that you should consider before adopting a dog of the golden retriever breed, these are excellent dogs, beautiful and very friendly if after considering all these points you still decide to adopt one, a thousand congratulations because i assure you that this decision will make you very happy.

golden retrievers are ideal as family dogs, they are gentle, love to play, and are very affectionate with children and other pets. ideal to have them at home.
they are robust and strong, very cheerful, and need a lot of physical activity, they like to jump, run and play, so they require at least two walks a day of one hour each.
they are very simple and cheap to care for since they do not require special haircuts, but they do require a good brushing every week to keep their beautiful coat in perfect condition and also because they lose a lot of hair.
you must pay special attention to the health of the dog, make sure it is the correct weight for its age, that it does not have an inflated belly or mucus in the eyes or nose. check that the dog is not limping or having any difficulty running or jumping.
look at the behavior of the dog, make sure he is happy and very alert, if you notice him sad or shy, it is better to choose another one, because he may be sick.
decide on the sex of the dog you want to obtain, there are differences that you must take into account between a female and a male, for example, males have a more dominant temperament, a characteristic of the male is that he will mark territory or raise his paw and leave your mark every time.
the females are less dominant, but you must take into account that they will have times of heat after reaching sexual maturity, and in that period they can be covered by a male and become pregnant.
a golden retriever breed can have between 8 and 14 pups in a litter.
if you want your bitch to get pregnant, you should make sure you get a partner of the same breed during her heat times and get ready to receive a beautiful litter of puppies.
sterilization is an option that you can take into consideration in both the male and the female. in the male, his dominant instinct and the instinct to cover the female are diminished or disappear.
sterilization in the female eliminates the heat cycles, therefore, she will not reproduce.
you should also take into account the size of your house, the climate, and the time you will have available to dedicate to the dog. all dogs will adapt to being alone while you have to work, but they will always need time for themselves that will depend on the characteristics of the dog.
one of the issues that you must take into account is the economic part since a dog requires special care as much as if it were a human being. these cares range from food and hygiene to veterinary control.


you must take into account the size of your house and the space where the dog can stay, golden retrievers are very active and love to play and jump, although they adapt very well to floors, in this case, you will have to take them for a walk with more frequency.

if you live alone you can also have a golden retriever, only you must take into account that when you return from work all your attention must be on your pet, spend a good time taking it for a walk.

would you like to adopt a golden retriever puppy, you should consider the shadalane golden retriever dog breeders. they are reputable breeders in california that will give you the help you need.

facts about bambino cats!

everything has some aspects that might not be so exciting to the owner. but still, you will enjoy having this cat at home. here are some of the things you should be prepared to experience when you bring home a bambino cat;
 
 you might need some earplugs sometimes
 
bambino cats can be noisy as they inherit this from their ancestors the sphynx cats when they are hungry or when they want to send you a message, they will meow as usual. but the problem here is that the meow can be too noisy, especially if you don’t attend to them immediately.
 
they might catch an attitude (like all cats)
 
don’t be surprised about this, but it does happen when your grown bambino cat doesnât get what she wants. for instance, if you tell her no or stop, she will meow you back. almost like giving you the whatever-answer of the teenagers.
 
they are quite needy (isn’t every cat?)
 
we have already stated that the bambino cats can be noisy with their meows when they want something. but that’s not all. these cats will want to cuddle almost all the time. when you sit down on the sofa, the cat will come on your lap wanting some cuddling. even when you get up, the bambino cat will try wrapping around your legs so that you can pick her up. so be prepared for that.
 
they can leave some stinky stuff behind
 
these cats are one of the most adorable breeds out there. however, you might want some air freshener when the little guy does his thing in the litter box. they do leave some stinky stuff that you may not really get used to in the first days. but this will not be too strong for you if you stay with the cats for a few more days. maybe if she does her thing when the visitor is around. that’s why you should place the litter box in a well-aired place, and ensure that you empty it frequent enough.
 
in general, having a bambino cat is super amazing, but you need to learn the right ways to live with this amazing cat breed. as long as you know the right tips and tricks, and you attend to the cat’s needs appropriately, you should be good to go.

how to kill termites for good! 



the fact that termites have settled in your house can threaten you with serious problems. they are capable of causing significant damage to property, trees, plants and water bodies. if you have any suspicions that termites might be giving you trouble, here’s what you can do to eradicate them.
inspect your property for signs of termite infestation. you can either hire a specialist or try to find signs of termites yourself. termites attack everything wooden, things become covered with small holes or seem to be contaminated with dirt. inside the tree, you can see small yellow or white insects. the incomprehensible appearance of sawdust is another indication of the defeat of the house by termites.
buy a liquid termite pesticide. spray the pesticide around the entire perimeter of the house and use it to spray any crevices through which insects can enter. if the termites cross the barrier you created, they will die.

if you suspect your home is infested with termites, try using powdered pesticides. they work in the same way as liquid ones. sprinkle the powder wherever you think there might be termites, and around the perimeter of your home.
use termite bait to kill an entire colony of termites. place the bait outside the house. place a piece of wood inside it to attract insects. the tree is surrounded by a plastic barrier. the trap must be stuck into the ground. the pesticides inside the trap will kill the insects.
hire professionals to fully disinfect your home. disinfection requires special equipment available from insect control companies. this method will only be effective for a specific type of dry wood termites.
the company is engaged in the sale and delivery of termite inspection. you can buy a bridal bouquet at a low price, there are different sizes of bouquets and you can make a personal order. to choose a wedding bouquet, you need to visit the company’s website and look at the available catalog from the san diego termite inspection

how to work with your dog breeder during covid-19 



 
given the rapidly changing situations and the current awful circumstances, the government has rightly advised against all non-essential travel. it is therefore imperative that you take into account every directive issued by the government as you work a way out with your dog breeder. 
amid the covid-19 pandemic, the government has put in measures that everyone must comply with. 
so, how do you work with your dog breeder even as you comply with the government’s directives?
well, let’s dig in.
here is how to deal with the coronavirus concerns
i don’t think it’s a case of doing away with breeding, but changing the way we usually do things. but really, how do you ensure you are in contact with your dog breeder without violating the rules?
here is what you should do with your dog during the pandemic:

if you already have a litter of golden retriever puppies, you can stay in contact by phone, email, and video calls. you can as well send photos. 
you can use all the technological tools available to vet buyers. they include facetime and teleconferencing. “that way, i can see them and talk to them and see their body

language. if someone wants to see where the puppies were raised, we can do a virtual tour of my house” says skou, a breeder field representative.
dressing up your puppies in different hats, wigs, and costumes. it is another way to bring “new” people into your puppies’ lives without bringing in strangers. 

below are suggested safety measures for breeders.

ensure you book appointments to see a puppy. while at it, make sure you limit the number of puppies shown.
have a prior discussion with the customer. make them know what to expect when they come.
as a health measure, get to know from your client if they have anyone in their family who has flu, cold, or allergy symptoms.
do not restrict yourself to a small room. do the transaction outside where there is a large space.
try to limit physical contact with the customer. 

this might be a new way of doing things. we may not even welcome strangers in the near future. however, that may the only way we can ensure safety for our dog breeders and families.
