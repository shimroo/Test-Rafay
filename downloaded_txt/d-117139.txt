welcome to mirex 2024
after a break of 3 years, we want to bring back the mirex (music information retrieval evaluation exchange) competition starting from 2024. we want to bring in new tasks, benchmarks, and datasets in response to the rapid development of computer music research.
the mirex community will hold its annual meeting as part of the international society for music information retrieval conference. this year, the conference will be held in san francisco, ca, usa and online from november 10–14, 2024.
in a long run, we want to make mirex a platform for researchers to share their latest research results, to compare their systems with others, and to promote the development of the field.
