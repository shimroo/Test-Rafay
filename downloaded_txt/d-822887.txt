¡bienvenidos!
welcome to our website dedicated to the cuban tourist hub of holguin, more specifically to the seaside resorts along its northern coast (between the municipality of banes and rafael freyre).these resort areas include: playa guardalavaca, playa esmeralda, playa yuraguanal, playa pesquero, playa blanca and recently playa baracutey. learn here about what to do and see in this region, where to stay, and how to plan your trip.






holguin is a province in southeast cuba. its beaches and resorts lie along the north coast (atlantic ocean) of the province. these seaside resorts are served by holguin international airport, named aeropuerto frank pais; transfer time between the airport and the resorts is 1-1â½ hours (depending on the hotel). the holguin airport also serves the neighboring province of las tunas, the transfer time to the resorts in las tunas (playa covarrubias) is about 2 hours . visit our location & maps page for further information on the location of hotels and tourist attractions and services in the area.
this tourist hub has a large number of small hotels and guest houses (casa particular), but is better known for its comfortable all-inclusive resorts (2â½* to 5*) distributed throughout the various beaches of the region, visit our hotels section for more details.

unlike many other cuban resorts, such as varadero or the cayos, in holguin there are no continuous beaches stretching for several kilometers straight. we find a succession of beaches backed by verdant hills, and separated by bays, rocky escarpments or streams. their length varies from about 250 meters to 1 km. visit our beaches page for further information.
the area is full of beautiful white sand beaches, but it's also covered with hills and lush tropical forests, and dotted with picturesque villages, which also makes holguin a preferred destination for ecotourism and the discovery of the local way of life. the natural beauty of holguin, extends beyond its wonderful landscapes, with an amazing underwater world that will delight any snorkeling and scuba diving enthusiast. for more information, visit our sections: attractions & activities and tours & excursions to see how holguin is a destination that can please everyone, thanks to the perfect mix of relaxation and adventure activities (both on land and water).
since holguin is located in the southeastern part of cuba, it's a destination where you can expect slightly higher temperatures than many other cuban tourist areas, most of them being located north of cuba (such as: havana, varadero, cayo coco, cayo santa maria, etc.).
holguin covers an area of 9,300 km2 (3,600 sq mi) of which about 25% is forested. it is the third most populous province of cuba, after havana and santiago de cuba, with a little more than 1 million inhabitants. 
in october 1492, when christopher columbus first landed in cuba on the coast of today's holguin province, he described it as "the most beautiful land human eyes had ever seen!"... go and see why!
our holguincuba.net website has been online since 2005 (20 years!).  itâs updated regularly, and we humbly believe that it's the most complete and detailed source of information about this cuban destination. having no business relationship (or otherwise) with any hotel chain or the cuban government, our websites are created simply and solely for the purpose of keeping you informed about this beautiful caribbean island that we had the chance to visit dozens of times. enjoy you visit!
