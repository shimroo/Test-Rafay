the cathedral church of the holy trinity (the american cathedral in paris) is a house of prayer for all people, the spiritual home for the convocation of episcopal churches in europe, and the seat of our bishop in charge, as well as one of the seats of our presiding bishop. we offer a radical welcome regardless of language, gender identity or expression, sex, sexual orientation, differing abilities, race, ethnicity, political affiliation, creed, or class, recognizing that we are called to pursue justice and advocate for the vulnerable. we also intend that leadership and ministry be shared by all faithful members, reflecting and celebrating with joy the richness of our diverse community because god loves us all, no exceptions.
