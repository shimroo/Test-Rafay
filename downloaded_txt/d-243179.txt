several neighbors asked me who did my windows...  i would have been very happy to advertise with signs in my front yard.  i'm told we (meaning andersen as i'm an employee) used to do that on big jobs but we don't do it any more.  seems like a missed opportunity.  the good news is i'm told neighborhood canvasing will happen soon...
