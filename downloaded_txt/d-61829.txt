welcome to eugene's original curated guide, including lane county and beyond. oregon's second largest city is known for its mix of arts and culture, education and scenic attractions with a passion for recreation. tour the broadway pearl district and the fifth street public market/historic market district which date back to the turn of the 20th century. visit some of the pacific northwest's finest cafes, restaurants and a varied assortment of eclectic boutiques and galleries.
 
eugene, nicknamed tracktown or emerald city, has an official slogan: "a great city for the arts and outdoors". the area is one of the most "bike-friendly" communities in the u.s. and offers miles of paths throughout city streets, gardens, parks, wetlands and along the banks of the willamette.
 
drive one hour east of eugene to see the snow-covered cascade range and enjoy camping in central oregon or along the scenic mckenzie and stop to take in a hike through old-growth forests.
 
head west (1â½ hrs) through the coast range to the pacific ocean and more than 360 miles of public beach access. stop in the seaside villages to savor fresh seafood and local ambience.
