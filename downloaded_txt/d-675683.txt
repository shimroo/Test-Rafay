preserving and enriching primitive hooked rug artistry






quail hill designs has moved to maryland!
marion ham began designing primitive hooked rugs and directing workshops nearly 50 years ago in clark, new jersey. in the early 1970s, marion began holding summer workshops at a restored farmhouse in limerick, maine. over the years she developed one of the largest portfolios of hooked rug patterns in the country and developed her own dying techniques based on historic processes.
in the the late 1980s, marion and husband ed ham moved quail hill designs to a new home, a restored ship-builder's house in brunswick, maine. they hosted workships there during the summer, as well as at cultural centers and museums around the country, working with over 1,000 rug hookers at all levels in the craft. 
marion stopped conducting workships in 2002, although quail hill designs continued to sell patterns and create new ones, including many by her daughter, barbara ham bancroft.
in 2010, marion and ed turned the business over to barb, who is running it from her studio in the historic district of hyattsville, maryland. 
quail hill designs is updating its product line and pricing. customers should note that quail hill designs no longer sells hooking supplies, other than two types of burlap. 
we look forward to continuing the tradition of quail hill designs and contributing to the primitive rug hooking community. thanks for your interest in quail hill designs.
