historical background
the little bighorn battlefield national 
            monument (custer battlefield)  is located near crow agency, 
            montana.  the battle of the little bighorn, known to many as 
            custer's last stand, was fought on june 25-26, 1876. lt. col george 
            armstrong custer led the u.s. army of 12 companies of the 7th 
            cavalry. along a ridge above the little bighorn river, custer and 
            five companies were wiped out by bands of the lakota and cheyenne 
            warriors led by such men as crazy horse, lame white man and gall.
            
major marcus reno and captain frederick benteen 
            would command the remaining seven companies, while besieged by the 
            warriors on the bluffs 4 ½ miles from where george custer fell. 
            fighting in rifle pits and behind hard tack boxes, the soldiers 
            survived two days of combat. these same soldiers would bury the 
            custer dead on june 28, 1876.
one name stands above the rest; that of sitting 
            bull of the hunkpapa lakota. sitting bull was once a great warrior, 
            but was aged by the time of the battle. his people considered him a 
            holy man and his principal role that day was to protect the 
            non-combatants as they escaped the battle.
