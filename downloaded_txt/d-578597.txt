beyond normal broker expectations

a “win / win” for every deal


i have worked with david and mumford & co - hotel brokers since 1991. i have used them numerous times as both a seller and a purchaser. david’s deep knowledge of the market and timeliness in working the "deal" is without question the best i have experienced in the hotel real estate brokerage. in these challenging times, i value david’s integrity and creative ideas in getting to a "win / win" for every deal we work on. my highest recommendation!

new albany hampton inn


"dear robert ... you recommended the mumford company two years ago, and i could not have been more pleased. as you know, the sale of the new albany hampton inn was challenging. steve kirby and the rest of his team were very professional, gave me consistently good advice, was clearly on our side through the whole ordeal, i always felt very well represented by them and were a joy to work with from beginning to end."
