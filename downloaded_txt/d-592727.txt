the nature center association of caesar creek (ncacc) has operated this site for several years.  it was originally operated by odnr.  they donated the site to us when they established their current ohiodnr.gov network. we created a separate website but we decided that continuing to maintain this one would be a lot more beneficial to the community so we are going to continue. above you will find the links to the current odnr website for caesar creek along with some other links of interest for the park. 
this site will tell you more about the caesar creek nature center and what the nature center association is all about. we hope that this page will help you find what you are looking for but if not, feel free to send us a message.

caesar creek state park nature center


the nature center is a great place to learn more about the caesar creek state park and the wildlife which you might find around the lake. you can find our head naturalist here on most days and she is always happy and excited to talk about the park and the wildlife. you can also find information about the trails and the volunteers with the nature center are more than excited to answer any of your questions about the park. if you are wanting to see some of the wildlife which calls the park it’s home, we have a few rescued animals inside and outside of the nature center. 
you will also find the nature center staff and volunteers all around the park. below you can find the link to the events which the nature center sponsors along with pictures from some of the different activities.
