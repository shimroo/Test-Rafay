mayor must act to protect immigrants



marcia flannery


thursday february 13, 2025 - 10:18:00 am




                        n one of donald trump’s first acts in office, he stripped away protections for schools, hospitals, and places of worship from immigration enforcement. these were once safe spaces where people could learn, receive health care, and pray without fear. now they have been turned into targets for ice raids.  	this is unconscionable. as the world’s largest historical climate polluter, the united states has a responsibility to immigrants. our pollution is causing the climate chaos — droughts, floods, hurricanes, rising waters — that is forcing people in latin america, asia, africa and elsewhere to leave their homes. others are fleeing violence, poverty, and hunger — all of which are caused or made worse by the climate crisis.  	people have the right to be able to leave their homes and migrate with dignity to find safe haven. but right now, immigrant families are facing the unimaginable: the fear that seeking education or health care could mean deportation, or that a peaceful moment of prayer might be shattered by ice agents barging in.  	as municipal leaders, mayors have the power to fight this. they can protect immigrant families by ordering police not to participate in ice raids and even to block ice agents’ entry into schools, hospitals, and places of worship.  	the future of so many families in our communities is on the line. we must call on local leaders to do the right thing, even as the federal government does not. i’m writing to urge mayors to hear this call and take action to protect immigrants.

                        it’s been quite a week. on monday, february 3, 2025 when i called in to the berkeley council’s land use, housing & economic development committee to make a non-agenda comment, i said i had been listening to the morning news and it was very unsettling, the closing of usaid, the takeover of the treasury payment system, that i was concerned we were in a soft coup, that i would like to see our city government call a special meeting to talk to us about what is happening nationally and how we will respond locally.

trump’s third week



bob burnett


wednesday february 12, 2025 - 08:36:00 pm




                      donald trumps third week in the oval office was characterized by three major failures: tariffs, foreign policy, and negative court orders. the number of trump executive orders diminished as trump focused on shoving his cabinet nominees through congress and letting his department of government efficiency (doge) have open access to all federal computer systems. trump continues to fire or “surplus” thousands of federal employees.

trump’s proposal for gaza met with scorn and outrage



jagjit singh


wednesday february 05, 2025 - 05:32:00 pm




                      president trump’s recent proposal regarding gaza, outlined in a press conference with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu, has sparked global outrage. his suggestion that the u.s. should “own” gaza and develop it into a seaside tourist destination not only disregards palestinian sovereignty but also perpetuates the ongoing ethnic cleansing of the region’s indigenous population.

trump's second week



bob burnett


monday february 03, 2025 - 08:41:00 pm




                      trump ended his first week with the illegal firing of 17 inspector generals and ended his second week with the illegal firing of hundreds of fbi agents. trump also attempted to stifle most federal grants. although foreign policy hasn’t been trump’s focus so far, we’ve seen enough to be able to discern major changes.

kash patel, a clear threat to democracy



jagjit singh


monday february 03, 2025 - 01:19:00 pm




                      kash patel’s nomination as fbi director is a clear and present danger to democracy. his extreme loyalty to donald trump, combined with his questionable actions and beliefs, would make him a disastrous choice for the position. patel has consistently pushed conspiracy theories, including the false claim that the fbi played a role in the january 6th capitol attack and that the 2020 election was stolen. he also has ties to far-right extremists and has exhibited a vindictive streak, publicly targeting political opponents and the media.

the future of usaid in peril



jagjit singh


monday february 03, 2025 - 01:17:00 pm




                      the future of the u.s. agency for international development (usaid) is at risk following recent statements and actions by elon musk, who claims president trump has agreed to shut the agency down. musk, who has inserted himself into the federal government’s workings, has reportedly gained access to sensitive usaid systems, making drastic changes without clear authority. over the weekend, usaid’s website and social media channels were taken offline, and two top security officials were placed on administrative leave after attempting to block musk’s so-called department of government efficiency (doge) from accessing classified information.

for people with psychosis, lies are poiso



jack bragen


wednesday february 05, 2025 - 12:32:00 pm




                      lying may not be unique to human beings. i can vaguely recall seeing an animal documentary, in which some animal essentially lied in specific scenarios--for purposes of survival. i don't recall what animal they were talking about. cuckoo birds might be one of several examples. lying in animals will necessarily be hard for people to measure since animals other than humans can't speak english. but apparently, there are methods for a non-human to be deceptive.

is it coronation time?  watch those hats



becky o'malley


wednesday february 05, 2025 - 11:11:00 am




                        the word on the street is “watch what they do, not what they say”.  except when it’s “believe them when they tell you what they’re going to do”.  or try dorothy parker’s phone greeting: “what fresh hell is this?”                                                                                                                                                          	well, when you’re trying to figure out what the hell the new regime in washington is up to, there’s some visual evidence from the inauguration ceremony  to be considered.  i refer, of course, to the hats worn by the first consort and the lady in waiting.                                                                                                                                                          	melania’s peculiar chapeau (are we still allowed to use french?) was clearly inspired by the hat-like decorations worn by ladies of the british royal family to weddings and coronations, often called fascinators.  ivanka’s headpiece was an echt fascinator, perched on the side of her head.  both of them, clearly, are announcing that the trumps, emulating the windsors, are a new royal family.                                                                                                                                                          	then there are the doges.  someone who chose that acronym for the administration’s dictators-in -chief must have been thinking of the italian doges.  they were heads of state in the former republics of venice and genoa,  autocrats, oligarchs, the whole nine yards. elon musk is angling for the job it seems.
