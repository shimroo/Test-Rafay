recent news & updates
ahc update at lurie childen’s hospital
our medical advisory board members, dr. sho yano and dr. ken silver, did a joint presentation on may 4, 2024, on the latest information on ahc related to atp1a3 at lurie children’s hospital for the neurology department. they did a great job introducing the complexities of atp1a3 and educating the staff about ahc. one topic of note – the time it takes to diagnose an ahc patient now is measured in weeks vs. the years it took when dr. silver started 20 years ago.
