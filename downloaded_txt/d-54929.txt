welcome to planewalker
 





   







in 2014 planewalker suffered a catastrophic database crash that took most of our content at the time with it. luckily we had a cache system running for anonymous users. this cache was preserved and we are able to provide access to some of the old information in the cached format of the site. that is what you see here.
the repository of the archived version may be found at github: https://github.com/planewalker/mimir




who are we? planewalker is the official fansite for the planescape setting produced originally by tsr, then by wizards of the coast. we've kept the fires of the planes alive for over a decade now in one form or another. take a look around the site, you'll find we have a lot of material here including:

active community forums
a wiki if you need to look up information
a vast collection of articles and extra material
conversions for 3.x , 4th ed and other systems.


what are you waiting for?

we have forums, play-by-post games, projects and all sorts of good stuff going on on the site. hop into the forums and take a look around. or if you have your own idea for a project or game on the site post a thread and get it started!
