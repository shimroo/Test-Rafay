domo arigato 3d blu-ray




    order now
  















shipping starts 1/13/25!the final film of golden age radio storyteller turned filmmaker arch oboler, domo arigato finally arrives as it was always meant to be seen in this deluxe, fully restored blu-ray edition from the 3-d film archive. sourced from one-of-a-kind film elements, domo arigato whisks us away on the magic carpet of space-vision 3-d to a world long since erased and redrawn by the hand of time — japan, 1972, where a world-weary u.s. airman meets tara, a girl with a tragic secret, and together they map out the joys and sorrows of star-crossed young lovers in a landscape that is both exotic and compellingly familiar.
