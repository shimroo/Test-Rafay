learn with landmark 



as an educational charity we are passionate about knowledge-sharing with our community of heritage enthusiasts and guests.
from time to time we run seminars, webinars and events to inspire and educate people on the subject of built heritage and heritage property maintenance.
our ability to restore heritage buildings and keep them in good repair depends on the survival of traditional craft skills and the use of traditional materials and craftspeople. irish landmark uses only the best artisans, builders and craftspeople and we give them scope to revive traditional skills that might otherwise be lost. 







our history 







 



 



 



 



 



















 



 



 







since our foundation we have taken the approach that we repair rather than replace. our primary aim is to conserve and sustain. irish landmark trust always respects the history and architectural integrity of the buildings we conserve, but we also ensure they have all the contemporary comforts you want in a holiday home.
