   the man-booker committee has announced that for the second year in a row, an american is the winner. it is lincoln in the bardo by george saunders, a story that they say "is both rooted in, and plays with history."


   with awards season now in full swing, the nobel committee has named the winner of the 2017 nobel prize in literature. this time it is not a singer-songwriter. it is kazuo ishiguro,

daniel alarcón: the king is always above the people (another book that doesn't exist yet, but with an author so famous, why should that matter?), 

lisa ko: the leavers, 

min jin lee: pachinko, 

margaret wilkerson sexton: a kind of freedom, 

jesmyn ward: sing, unburied, sing (our favorite for the award, which probably means it won't win), and

   this year's national book award for fiction was been announced last night at a gala affair (it was shown live on c-span). the winner is (as we expected)  the underground railroad by colson whitehead. 

   the booker committee has now released this year's short list of authors who will vie for the booker prize, and it comes down to two americans, two brits, and two canadians. they are:  the sellout by paul beatty,
 hot milk by deborah levy,
 eileen by ottessa moshfegh,
 all that man is by david szalay, and 

 do not say we have nothing by madeleine thien.

   after the nobel prize in literature went to a surprising  and controversial choice, poet/bard, bob dylan, we have all been waiting to see how the booker people would respond. the booker committee has now released this year's long list of authors who will vie for the booker prize. they are:  the sellout by paul beatty,
 the schooldays of jesus by j.m. coetzee,
 serious sweet by a.l. kennedy,
 hot milk by deborah levy,
 his bloody project by graeme macrae burnet,
 the north water by ian mcguire,
 hystopia by david means,
 the many by wyl menmuir,
 eileen by ottessa moshfegh,
 work like any other by virginia reeves,
 my name is lucy barton by elizabeth strout,
 all that man is by david szalay, and 

 do not say we have nothing by madeleine thien,


   this year's national book award short list has been announced. the nominees are 

 the throwback special by chris bachelder,
 news of the world by paulette jiles,
 the association of small bombs by karan mahajan,
 the underground railroad by colson whitehead and, 

 another brooklyn by jacqueline woodson.

   this year's national book critics circle award for fiction goes to  the sellout by paul beatty. described by many as an important and difficult novel, it provides an up to date, in-the-moment, intentionally casuistic, first-person analysis of this united states in a time of political and social chaos. the other nominees were 

 between the world and me by ta-nehisi coates (probably the favorite), 

 fates and furies by lauren groff, 

 the story of my teeth by valeria luiselli, 

 the tsar of love and techno by anthony marra (stories), and 

 eileen by ottessa moshfegh.

   unlike the other major awards, the pulitzer committee doesn't announce the finalists for their fiction award until the day they announce the winner. but this years winner, 
 the sympathizer by viet thanh nguyen, wasn't that big a surprise. first off, although it's about an old american war, the book did come out during america's continuing involvement in war (you do remember we are still in a war in afghanistan, don't you?). secondly, nguyen's book is actually very well written, and he describes himself as a deconstructionist. some might have thought it was time for a book of short stories to win, so some might have been rooting for get in trouble, kelly link's book of stories. others might have seen some hope for maud's line by margaret verble, a novel set in oklahoma in the early part of the twentieth century. but it was not to be. war books seem to be winning all the awards these days.

  &nbspthe pen faulkner award has announced the finalists for this year. they are:  delicious foods by james hannaham, 

 mr. and mrs. doctor by julie iromuanya (a debut novel), 

 the sympathizer by viet thanh nguyen (another debut novel), 

 mendocino fire by elizabeth tallent (a short story collection), and 

 the water museum by luis alberto urrea (another short story collection). in this era of never-ending american foreign wars, the sympathizer, set at the end of the vietnam war, is undoubtedly the favorite for the award. the novel portrays the us military's failure to learn any lessons from vietnam as the ironic prelude to the other failed glorious wars of invasion that were sure to follow. 


  &nbspthis year's booker award did not go to the odds-on favorite,  a little life by hanya yanagihara, but instead went to a somewhat more politically-correct jamaican writer,  marlon james  for his startlingly graphic novel,  a brief history of seven killings. the book, a "voice" novel of many voices, is set in the mad and heartless world of kingston's slums. it is dramatic and engaging, but it is not an easy read. 
  &nbspyet again, the national book award went to a book of short stories,  fortune smiles by stanford professor adam johnson. he was one of the favorites for the award because of his 2013 win of the pulitzer prize for his postmodern novel,  the orphan master's son. it is estimated that more than 60,000 books of fiction are published every year in the us, but this year, only 419 were considered by the national book award committee. it would be quite a challenge for the committee to read and discus even a fraction of the many books published. as a result, they have become very restrictive about which publishers are allowed to submit, and therefore, all ten of this year's finalists were from major publishers.

  &nbspthis year's nobel prize in literature goes yet another politically-correct choice, belarusian writer and longtime critic of the soviets, svetlana alexievich. she is described as an investigative journalist and non-fiction prose writer. she is the first journalist to receive the nobel prize in literature. (remember when these "literary" prizes used to go to writers of fiction?)

  &nbspthe nominees for this year's booker prize are,
 a brief history of seven killings by marlon james,
 satin island by tom mccarthy,
 the fishermen by chigozie obioma,
 the year of the runaways by sunjeev sahota, and under the new booker rules, two americans, 

 a spool of blue thread by anne tyler, and 

 a little life by hanya yanagihara.


  &nbspthe nominees for this year's national book award are, 

 a cure for suicide by jesse ball,
 refund: stories by karen e. bender,
 did you ever have a family by bill clegg,
 the turner house by angela flournoy,
 fates and furies by lauren groff,
 fortune smiles: stories by adam johnson,
 welcome to braggsville by t. geronimo johnson,
 honeydew by edith pearlman,
 a little life by hanya yanagihara, 

and  mislaid by nell zink.

  &nbspnow that american writers are eligible to win the booker prize, you might think the winner would be one of the two american writers nominated. wrong! the winner is an australian. it is the narrow road to the deep north by richard flanagan, a book that has been described by some as ambitious, and by others as maybe a bit overly ambitious. it wasn't the politically-correct favorite, but it is about war. 


   the lit world is still abuzz with news about the record-breaking sales of harper lee's "new" novel, go set a watchman. as it turns out, it is not really a new novel, but is, in fact, lee's first novel that was rejected by a publisher sixty years ago. however, in that era of civil-rights turmoil, the publisher did see an interesting story "within" the novel, the story of a innocent black man being unfairly tried in a small alabama town (as seen by a young girl). the editor "helped" lee turn that story into the book, to kill a mockingbird. unfortunately, somebody held onto that old manuscript and now they've published it, unedited. the reviews are, predictably, pretty negative. one called it "amateurish and cloying as a bad sitcom." other reviews: "almost unbearably clunky," "clumsy," "uneven pacing," "meandering," "as if a lesser author commandeered these beloved characters and put them where they don't belong." can you imagine anything more horrible for an author than to have somebody publish your first beginner efforts, unedited? on the other hand, a lot of people will make a lot of money off this old unedited manuscript, and maybe these days, that's all that is important in the publishing business.



   here is this year's short list for the booker literary prize. 

to rise again at a decent hour by joshua ferris, 

the narrow road to the deep north by richard flanagan, 

we are all completely beside ourselves by karen joy fowler, 

j by howard jacobson, 

the lives of others by neel mukherjee, 

how to be both by ali smith.

   as we predicted, the pulitzer prize in fiction once again went to the politically correct choice, all the light we cannot see by anthony doerr

   this year's national book critics circle award for fiction goes to  lila by marilynne robinson. although some have accused her of writing the same book over and over again (this is her third gilead novel), the book - which is said to remind america of its forgotten midwestern moral heritage - was the most politically correct choice. the other finalists for the award were  an unnecessary woman by rabih alameddine, 

 a brief history of seven killings by marlon james, 

 euphoria by lily king, and 

 on such a full sea by chang-rae lee.



   this years nominees for pulitzer prize in fiction are 

all the light we cannot see by anthony doerr (lately, with our nation constantly at war, war novels like this have been the politically-correct winners), 

let me be frank with you by richard ford, 

the moor's account by laila lalami, and 

lovely, dark, deep by joyce carol oates.

 

   

there is a new james patterson alex cross book  out,  hope to die, and there is rumor going around that he actually wrote this one. we assume the publisher "took a chance" and had the word "bestseller" imprinted on the front cover even before it was released.

   

the national book award people have announced the winner of their 2014 fiction award. it is (ta da)  redeployment by phil klay. this memoir-like book of war stories was the most politically-correct choice because, unlike the stories of ernest hemingway (a farewell to arms) and stephen crane (the red badge of courage), these stories were written by a soldier who had actually been in combat. the other finalists for the award were  an unnecessary woman by rabih alameddine (a protagonist who lives mostly in what she reads and in memory. highly literary, but it was a long shot for the award.); 

 all the light we cannot see by anthony doerr. (one of two war novels up for the award this year, and war novels often win. the story jumps back and forth in time making it interesting, but not an easy read.); 

 station eleven by emily st. john mandel (post-apocalyptic stories are interesting, and they often get nominated for these awards. but so far, they haven't won.); and 

 lila by marilynne robinson (another gilead book, a follow-on to her pulitzer-winning novel, but apparently, the nat book committee didn't want to follow in the footsteps of the pulitzer people).  

   

this year's man booker prize for fiction short list has been announced, and for the first time, americans are eligible for the award: 

 to rise again at a decent hour by joshua ferris, a pretty good attempt at making boring subjects somewhat interesting; 

 the narrow road to the deep north by richard flanagan, which is such a gripping story about a group of australian pows during world war ii that a male writer might once again actually have a chance at winning this prize; 

 we are all completely beside ourselves by karen joy fowler, yet another family story by an accomplished author (but this one has some interesting twists); 

 j by howard jacobson who gets serious this time with a spookily-realistic dystopian novel; 

 the lives of others by neel mukherjee, a novel about a rich family in india (and as we know, novels about exotic foreign places have done well in man booker history); 

and  how to be both by ali smith, which explores our artificial perceptions of time.

   


this year's noble prize for literature has gone to  patrick modiano. i'm sure many of you will ask who is patrick modiano? he is a french writer and is somewhat of a surprise nobel winner because he is not all that well known outside of france. (although people think of ireland as being the home of famous writers, there have been only four irish nobel lit winners - james joyce never won it - while french writers have received fifteen lit nobels.) modiano writes lots of different kinds of books, including novels about the german occupation of france.

   
the national book award people have announced their expanded long list for their 2014 fiction award: 

 an unnecessary woman by rabih alameddine; 

 the unamericans by molly antopol; 

 wolf in white van by john darnielle; 

 all the light we cannot see by anthony doerr; 

 redeployment by phil klay; 

 station eleven by emily st. john mandel; 

 thunderstruck & other stories by elizabeth mccracken; 

 orfeo by richard powers; 

 lila by marilynne robinson; 

and  some luck by jane smiley; 

   
the 2014 man booker short list has been announced, and for the first time, americans are eligible for the award: 

 to rise again at a decent hour by joshua ferris, a pretty good attempt at making boring subjects somewhat interesting; 

 the narrow road to the deep north by richard flanagan, which is such a gripping story about a group of australian pows during world war ii that a male writer might once again actually have a chance at winning this prize; 

 we are all completely beside ourselves by karen joy fowler, yet another family story by an accomplished author (but this one has some interesting twists); 

 j by howard jacobson who gets serious this time with a spookily-realistic dystopian novel; 

 the lives of others by neel mukherjee, a novel about a rich family in india (and as we know, novels about exotic foreign places have done well in man booker history); 

and  how to be both by ali smith, which explores our artificial perceptions of time.

   
earning season continues with the announcement of the edgar award winner,  ordinary grace by william kent krueger.

   
the national book critics circle, perhaps sensitive to the controversy surrounding the awarding of the pulitzer to the goldfinch, has gone in a more politically correct direction and given their award for fiction to chimamanda ngozi adichie for her novel,  americanah. the finalists were  americanah by chimamanda ngozi adichie,  someone by alice mcdermott,  the infatuations by javier marias (although the critics circle people don't normally go for inventive style, you never know),  a tale for the time being by ruth ozeki, and  the goldfinch by donna tartt.

   the finalists for the l.a. times book prize finalists have been announced. they are  the woman upstairs by claire messud,  a tale for the time being by ruth ozeki,  percival everett by virgil russell by percival everett (get it?),  spectacle: stories by susan steinberg, and  the maid's version by daniel woodrell.so who will win? percival everett's new novel is fantastic, but postmodern novels never win. daniel woodrell's novel is also very good (as usual), but can a white male win these days? more likely, it will be claire messud, a creative writing professor whose earlier novel was named one of the new york times 10 best books of the year.

   
the 2014 edgar award nominees for best mystery novel have been announced. they are  sandrine's case by thomas h. cook,  the humans by matt haig,  ordinary grace by william kent krueger,  how the light gets in by louise penny,  standing in another man's grave by ian rankin, and  until she comes home by lori roy. who will win? well, krueger is the most prolific of the group (and the best selling). on the other hand, cook is a former winner. haig's book is a cross-genre sci fi story (do they ever win?). louise penny's book is the ninth in her chief inspector gamache series, and it is a best seller. in addition, she is a female writer which is usually an advantage in this era of political correctness (even though the mystery genre is one in which there are almost as many male readers as female readers). lori roy stands out as a relatively unknown female writer in this list of mostly male writers who have created best-selling books with male protagonists. need we say out loud that she therefore has a good chance at winning this award?
   the 2013 national book award for fiction was announced (with great fanfare on live tv). the following day, the new york times headline said  the good lord bird by james mcbride was a surprise winner. really? it seems to us that the committee merely continue its tradition of making the politically-correct choice. by the way, the committee made a point of saying that this year they had looked a large number of books, including books from small publishers and even from self-publishers. however, we couldn't help but notice that the five finalists were published by penguin, penguin group, scribner, knopf, and random house, 

   literary awards season continues with the announcement of the booker winner. it is eleanor catton for the luminaries, making her the youngest winner ever and at 848 pages, it is the longest winner ever (described as "a publisher's nighmware"). it's interesting to look at the booker award 2013 short list. it includes the shortest novel ever nominated and a debut novel (they usually do include one debut novel, but it never wins). the six books that were considered for the 2013 man-booker prize were we need new names by noviolet bulawayo  (the debut novel), the testament of mary by colm toibin (the short novel), harvest by jim crace, the luminaries by eleanor catton, a tale for the time being by ruth ozeki, and the lowland by jhumpa lahiri. lahiri novel was the favorite because he's won every other prize, so why not the booker too? in case you're interested, here are the nominees from the long list that didn't make the cut: debut novelist donal ryan (the spinning heart ), eve harris (the marrying of chani kaufman ), tash aw (five star billionaire ), colum mccann (transatlantic ), richard house (the kills ), and charlotte mendelson (almost english ). three of the nominated books are yet to be released, the luminaries  by eleanor catton, unexploded  by alison macleod, and the lowland  by jhumpa lahiri. (how do unpublished books get included? does the publisher slip the manuscript to the committee over lunch?)
more book news

   the national book award has doubled the number of finalists (from 5 to 10). 
they are: 
 pacific by tom drury, 
 the end of the point by elizabeth graver, 
 the flamethrowers by rachel kushner, 
 the lowland by jhumpa lahiri, 
 a constellation of vital phenomena by anthony marra, 
 the good lord bird by james mcbride, 
 someone by alice mcdermott, 
 bleeding edge by thomas pynchon, 
 tenth of december by george saunders, and 
 fools by joan silber. hard to pick a favorite this year. tom drury's novel is a sort of sequel to a novel he wrote twenty years ago so he might be considered a sentimental favorite. elizabeth graver's book is the history of a family, and family dramas written by a woman usually do well in this competition. rachel kushner is a former finalist, and they often come back to take the big prize. jhumpa lahiri has the advantage of being female, and she has been winning a lot of literary prizes. in addition, her story is foreign (and therefore, exotic). however, the lowland is shortlisted for the man booker prize, and that may be a disadvantage if the committee doesn't want to "compete" with the booker. anthony marra's book is a debut novel, and although the committee often includes at least one debut novel, they rarely win. james mcbride is considered an underdog for the award by most commentators. we disagree. he is african-american, and he is writing about a runaway slave in the civil war era. that much political correctness gives him a good shot at winning it all. that said, alice mcdermott, a former winner and a pulitzer prize finalist cannot be counted out. next we come to thomas pynchon. he's such a great writer it's hard to believe he even made the list. besides, he doesn't like awards. his nomination was a gesture. he won't win.  george saunders, a professor of english at syracuse university, is a heck of a writer, but he doesn't have much political correctness. we consider him a long shot. joan silber's short stories are great, but maybe the committee is not quite ready to give the award to another writer of short stories.  

expanding the finalist list to ten has to be a good thing because it will expose readers to the works of more great writers (and help more writers sell their books). maybe they should double it again to 20. or 40. that might even get some self-published novelists noticed. oops, never mind; they don't allow self-published books. in fact, none of the major awards allow self-published books. the edgar award, for example, has made up a harsh-sounding list of eleven rules just to make sure not even books published by very small publishers get to be considered. this year, the national book award fiction judges will include not only include writers, but also a literary critic and a bookseller. the 2013 national book award fiction judges are  charles baxter, novelist,  gish jen, novelist, charles mcgrath, critic, rick simonson, bookseller, and  rene steinke, novelist.

   the folks in sweden announced that the 2013 nobel award for literature would go to 
 alice munro, the 82-year-old canadian writer. the fact that she only writes short stories added to the fact that she is not an obscure writer of postmodern novels from a country that oppresses writers made her a long shot for the award.

   the 2013 pulitzer prize for fiction goes to 
 adam johnson for his novel about an adventure in north korea, 
 the orphan master's son (even though the prize is supposed to "deal with american life"). the finalists were 
 nathan englander for 
 what we talk about when we talk about anne frank, and 
 eowyn ivey for 
 the snow child, an unlikely story about an elderly couple who adopt a feral girl.

   heard in the lit underworld: there will be a nobel prize for literature this year. the word is that they have already picked five final candidates. there is even talk that it might even be a citizen of the united states for the first time in ten years. if so, who might that be?  philip roth?  don delillo? how about  dylan? yeah! let's all vote for my old greenwich village pal bobby zimmerman. that would be the most interesting choice. well, don't hold your breath waiting to find out. the nobel committee doesn't even announce when they will announce. supposedly it will be sometime this fall. maybe.

   the finalists for the 33rd annual l.a. times book prize for fiction were  jami attenberg for her novel  middlesteins, a family drama that made the cover of the new york times book review, popular writer,  michael chabon, for  telegraph avenue (the one in berkeley),  ben fountain for  billy lynn's long halftime walk, a story of the war in iraq,  lauren groff  for  arcadia which is set in the post-hippie days of the early 70s, and  lydia millet for  magnificence, a story of wandering and thinking in modern-day la. in addition,  margaret atwood will receive the times' innovator's award for "her efforts to push narrative form" (she is embracing new electronic forms of storytelling).

   although the man booker award is not on the radar screen of many americans, worldwide it is a very big deal. last year,  there was a first: the award went former booker winner 
 hilary mantel  for  
 bring up the bodies, a sequel to her prior winner, 
 wolf hall. over here on this side of the pond, we have the national book award, and last year a few of the nominees were better known than recently. perhaps stung by criticism that the nat book awards were becoming overly politically correct, the list of nominees included a few very accomplished, if not famous, writers. (as we have learned, just because an author is famous, it doesn't mean they are also accomplished - e.g. famous writers like james patterson and nora roberts have never been nominated.) the nominees were a mixed bag of well-known and not so well known. postmodernist  dave eggers was nominated for his novel  a hologram for the king.  louise erdrich, who was nominated for a pulitzer prize in fiction a few years back, was nominated for her new novel  the round house. being female and a member of the turtle mountain band of chippewa indians, this long-time writer of native american stories was the pick for those who were betting on continuing the trend toward political correctness. also vying for the political correctness honor were two books about the iraq war. first was  the yellow birds, a debut novel by iraq war vet  kevin powers. a second nominated iraq war novel was  billy lynn's long halftime walk by  ben fountain. boy wonder (relatively speaking),  junot diaz was nominated for his book of short stories,  this is how you lose her. many thought he would add this year's nat book award to his macarthur award and his pulitzer prize. but it was not to be. the cynics that predicted political correctness won out in the end when the award went to (ta da)  the round house by louise erdrich. congrats to ms. erdrich.

   congrats also to  natasha trethewey who has been appointed as the 19th u.s. poet laureate. she won the 2007 pulitzer prize in poetry for her poetry collection,  native guard, poems that relate the stories of the louisiana native guards, an all-black regiment that was called into service during the civil war.


   in cse you missed it, the 2011 national book award fiction winner went to 
salvage the bones by jesmyn ward some saw her semi-memoir as a long shot because it was a personal story rather than "great literature." but the more cynical said it had a good chance because it was quite politically correct, a personal story written by a young african-american woman about a poor african-american family that suffers in the aftermath of politically-significant hurricane katrina. others sarcastically said it should have been in the young adult category, not in the general fiction category. nevertheless, it was the 2011 winner. some thought her selection indicated the committee was moving away from the big name writers, but this result only partly confirmed that trend. of the 2011 nat book award finalists, 

binocular vision by edith pearlman was probably the favorite. it is a book of short stories, some old and some new written by an established writer. (the book was published by lookout books, an imprint of the department of creative writing at the university of north carolina wilmington.) others thought 
the tiger's wife by tea obreht would win simply because it was the best written book in the group. it is a story woven around a young girl's remembrances of her grandfather's fable-like stories. add to that the fact that the young yugoslavia-born american author was named by the new yorker as one of the twenty best american fiction writers under forty, and she was included in the national book foundation's list of 5 under 35 and you can see why it might be among the favorites. the other 2011 finalists were as follows. 

the sojourn by andrew krivak, a story of a austrian boy who ends up a soldier in world war i. 

the buddha in the attic by julie otsuka, a story about japanese mail-order brides in 1920s california. the story is told using a very interesting plural (we) point of view.


   and what about the pulitzer? the winner was  
a visit from the goon squad by jennifer egan. it is described by the pulitzer people (rather vaguely) as "an inventive investigation of growing up and growing old in the digital age." it is actually a very interesting study of compulsion and rationalization. of the three nominees, it was far and away the favorite for the award. 2010, on the other hand, was the year of the dark horse in fiction awards. first, 
howard jacobson was the surprise winner of the man booker prize for his eleventh novel,  the finkler question. it's pretty rare for a comedy novel to win the booker, but it is very well written. most observers (including us) thought 
tom mccarthy would walk away with the award for his novel 
c. other nominations like 
 room by emma donoghue were supposed to have a better chance than jacobson, along with 
parrot and olivier in america by peter carey,  in a strange room by damon galgut: and  the long song by andrea levy. next, it was long-shot   jaimy gordon winning the 2010 national book award for her sixth novel  lord of misrule which was published by mcpherson, a small indie publisher out of kingston, n.y. considered an unlikely finalist, let alone a possible winner of the award, the book is about horse racing--more specifically about the kind of people who race wornout horses in rigged races at obscure race tracks. she says she started it more than ten years ago, and despite pressure from her publisher didn't want to finish it because she didn't want to write yet another novel staring a wild and reckless young woman. however, in the end, she couldn't stop herself from doing exactly that--and the result is pretty good. all of the other finalists were better known and judged to have a better chance to win the award. they were:  great house by nicole krauss from norton,  parrot and olivier in america by peter carey from knopf,  so much for that by lionel shriver from harper, and  i hotel by karen tei yamashita from coffee house press.



   by the way, amazon.com has posted their opinion about what novels are hot.  
(you can click here  to see what they think we all should be reading) the list includes 
dead in the family by charlaine harris, 
storm prey by john sandford, and the latest novel by the "discovered" scandinavian phenomenon, steig larsson: 
the girl who kicked the hornet's nest.

   have you heard of the so-called arabic booker prize? it's real title is the international prize for arabic fiction and they recently announced their short list for the prize. the five nominees are: muhammad al-mansi qindeel (egyptian) for a cloudy day on the west side, mansoura ez eldin (egyptian) for beyond paradise, rabee jabir (lebanese) for america, abdo khal (saudi arabian), raba'i madhoun (palestinian) for the lady from tel aviv, and naji, jamal naji (jordanian) for when the wolves grow old. a lot of good reading from a little-known group or writers. there has been a lot more interest in writing from that part of the world ever since 
naguib mahfouz won the nobel prize for literature.
   the news that 
paul harding won the 2010 pulitzer fiction prize for his debut novel 
tinkers was more significance than it might seem. turns out the book was published by one of small indie presses that are having such a hard go of it these days. and the publisher is a newcomer at that. the book was published by bellevue literary press which is housed at and sponsored by the bellevue hospital center in new york. only in business 2005, they are one of the new specialized publishers (they are looking for fiction and nonfiction that focuses on medicine). another pulitzer finalist, arizona author  lydia millet's collection of stories   love in infant monkeys was also published by a small indie press, soft skull press. it shows things are changing out there in publishing land. but will it be for the better? stay tuned.
