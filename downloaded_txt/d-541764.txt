phasing out murder isn't good enough 








rabbi
                      reuven p. bulka, national post | 13/06/12 | 
                    





while the canadian
                        media focused on
                        matters closer to home, a developing matter of
                        global concern - and life and
                        death - went unnoticed.


last month, on may 17,
                        the associated
                        press reported that "china
                        is phasing out dependence on executed prisoners
                        for organs." in the weeks
                        since, there has been no reaction to this news
                        item. we do hear about overtures
                        to mend fences with china,
                        most recently by the united states, including on
                        such vital issues as
                        cyber theft. but the shameful matter of organ
                        harvesting is ignored.


for years, china denied
                        that it was killing
                        prisoners to extract their organs. during these
                        same years, human rights lawyer
                        david matas and human rights activist david
                        kilgour, a former edmonton-area mp
                        and secretary of state for asia-pacific,
                        insisted that this was a lie, and that
                        china
                        was indeed guilty of wholesale murder for
                        profit.


matas and kilgour
                        deserve credit for
                        exposing this outrage, and having the courage to
                        stand up to the barrage of
                        denials. russia, for
                        example, banned their groundbreaking 2007 report
                        "bloody harvest",
                        and made matas and kilgour subject to arrest
                        should they enter russian
                        territory, for the crime of inciting hatred
                        against china.


the scale of this
                        harvest is alarming. we
                        know from china's health
                        ministry that in 2005, 2,960 out of 2,997 liver
                        transplants performed in china
                        came from executed prisoners. we also know that
                        china, with no organized system for
                        organ donation, and a cultural aversion to it,
                        could advertise a one-week wait
                        time for a kidney and a two-week wait for a
                        liver. in ontario, a five-year wait for a kidney
                        can
                        be expected. to be sure, ontario
                        can do better. but not that much better. where
                        else could china be getting these organs from
                        but the thousands of prisoners it executes each
                        year?


all these facts have
                        been known for years.
                        yet the world turned a blind eye, and even went
                        along with staging the olympics
                        in china
                        in 2008, while thousands of future organ
                        suppliers languished in chinese
                        prisons. the fact that the main victims of this
                        brutality are the falun gong,
                        of whom around one million members have been
                        imprisoned and who make up the
                        overwhelming majority of the organ "donors,"
                        makes this disgusting
                        practice even more distressing. this is more
                        than just a crime. it is a crime
                        against an oppressed minority. …


china now faces a new
                        challenge - if it is to
                        begin reducing its use of executed prisoners as
                        organ donors, where will it
                        find the organs and tissues its people need?
                        china has not developed a culture
                        of that supports voluntary organ donation. it
                        had no reason to -the heavy
                        reliance on murdering prisoners exempted the
                        general population from needing to
                        even consider it. and even in the west, where
                        organ donation is culturally
                        accepted to a far greater extent and despite
                        steady progress, there are never
                        enough donors to meet demand.


in february of this
                        year, china
                        launched a nationwide donor network. its
                        officials project donated organs will
                        fully replace those harvested from prisoners by
                        february, 2015. that ostensibly
                        cheerful estimate, however, ignores the fact
                        that china will continue to harvest
                        organs from executed prisoners until that time -
                        and, if donations come in
                        slower than projected, beyond.


that is unacceptable.
                        phasing out murder
                        still means murder. the time has come for the
                        entire civilized world to let china know that
                        this barbaric practice must be
                        stopped, and to bring whatever pressure is
                        possible against beijing to make sure that
                        message is heard.

‘free china,’ directed by michael perlman







nyt -- short in minutes but long on ambition, the stirring documentary “free china: the courage to believe”
 expects viewers not only to feel but also to act: it ends with a 
three-point guide for how audiences can help counter the chinese 
government’s persecution of practitioners of falun gong.        




                            a spiritual movement, somewhat a combination
 of the traditional exercise qigong with buddhism and daoism, falun gong
 is depicted as so popular that it threatens a paranoid chinese 
bureaucracy, and so admirable that it’s earned the support of charles 
lee and jennifer zeng, the interview subjects at the heart of the film. 
both project a radiant good will; both tell of being imprisoned and 
tortured for their beliefs. 



                            mr. lee is an american who traveled to his 
native china to stand up against government disinformation about falun 
gong; during his incarceration, he was one of many forced into labor — 
in his case, making homer simpson dolls. ms. zeng,
 who was granted asylum by australia, offers the more wrenching account,
 of physical abuse and family separation so destructive that she denied 
her beliefs to make the reprisals stop.



                            their stories, unobstructed by any attempt 
at balance, build in narrative power, and the director, michael perlman,
 has abetted that with commentary from international observers and 
images of historical and contemporary china, as well as archival footage
 of mr. lee and ms. zeng. usually the visuals enhance his points 
(particularly accusations of internet censorship and organ harvesting), but occasionally they confuse (are we seeing reality, re-creation or footage unrelated except for its subject?).        



still, “free china” is not news, and, 
however moving, it’s really not art. it’s advocacy. in that aim, it is 
ardently committed.

canada: new religious-freedom watchdog faces uphill battle






but bennett, the ambassador of religious freedom, acknowledged the new office is not sitting well with all
        of canada’s trading partners. he said the chinese were upset
        when mr. harper singled out religious persecution in china
        during his february announcement of the new ambassadorial
        appointment. during a discussion with mr. junsai, mr. bennett
        said, the chinese ambassador called on canada to be consistent
        in what it says about the asian country in public and behind
        closed doors. 

“one of his concerns was that what we say publicly is also what
        we say privately,” the canadian official said.

mr. bennett said he told beijing’s envoy that he believes
        canada and china can have a “mature discussion” – but he added
        he would be firm on the need to speak out about china when
        necessary.

“when it comes to human rights and particularly freedom of
        religion, we will continue to express our concerns in that area,
        and i said to him at the time that i will be meeting with groups
        such as tibetan buddhists, falun gong, christians,” mr. bennett
        said. “i don’t think he was particularly pleased with that.”

china's bloody harvest






national post · is china harvesting organs of falun gong practitioners, killing them
    in the process? a japanese television news agency reporter and the
    ex-wife of a surgeon in march made claims this was happening at
    liaoning hospital in sujiatin, china. are those claims true?

    the coalition to investigate the persecution of the falun gong in
    china, an organization headquartered in washington, d.c., in may
    asked former minister of state for asia and the pacific david
    kilgour and me to investigate these claims. we released a report in
    july which came to the conclusion, to our regret and horror, that
    the claims were indeed true.

    the repressive and secretive nature of chinese governance made it
    difficult for us to assess the claims. we were not allowed entry to
    china, though we tried. organ harvesting is not done in public. if
    the claims are true, the participants are either victims who are
    killed and their bodies cremated or perpetrators who are guilty of
    crimes against humanity and unlikely to confess.

    we examined every avenue of proof and disproof available to us,
    eighteen in all. they were:

    - the communist party of china, for no apparent reason other than
    totalitarian paranoia, sees falun gong as an ideological threat to
    its existence. yet, objectively, falun gong is just a set of
    exercises with a spiritual component.

    - the threat the communist party perceives in the falun gong
    community has led to a policy of persecution. persecution of the
    falun gong in china is officially decided and decreed.

    - falun gong practitioners are victims of extreme vilification. the
    official chinese position on falun gong is that it is "an evil
    cult."

    - falun gong practitioners have been arrested in huge numbers. they
    are detained without trial or charge until they renounce falun gong
    beliefs.

    - falun gong practitioners are victims of systematic torture and ill
    treatment. while the claims of organ harvesting of falun gong
    practitioners have been met with doubt, there is no doubt about this
    torture.

    - many falun gong practitioners have formally disappeared; they are
    the subject of formal disappearance complaints by family members.
    many more practitioners, in an attempt to protect their families and
    communities, have not identified themselves once arrested. these
    unidentified are a particularly vulnerable population.

    - traditional sources of transplants -- executed prisoners, donors,
    the brain dead -- come nowhere near to accounting for the total
    number of transplants in china. the only other identified source
    which can explain the skyrocketing transplant numbers is falun gong
    practitioners.

    - falun gong practitioners in prison are systematically blood tested
    and physically examined. yet, because they are also systematically
    tortured, this testing can not be motivated by concerns over their
    health.

    - in a few cases, between death and cremation, family members of
    falun gong practitioners were able to see the mutilated corpses of
    their loved ones. organs had been removed.

    - we interviewed the japanese journalist and the ex-wife of the
    surgeon from sujiatun. their testimony was credible to us. in order
    to be cautious, we relied on this testimony only when it was
    independently corroborated.

    - we had callers phoning hospitals throughout china posing as family
    members of persons who needed organ transplants. in a wide variety
    of locations, those who were called asserted that falun gong
    practitioners (reputedly healthy because of their exercise regime)
    were the source of the available organs. we have recordings and
    telephone bills for these calls.

    - waiting times for organ transplants in china are incredibly short,
    a matter of days. everywhere else in the world, waiting times are
    measured in years.

    - chinese hospital web sites host incriminating information
    advertising organs of all sorts on short notice.

    - a falun gong practitioner who had been in prison in china told us
    that her chinese jailers lost interest in her once they found out
    that her organs had been damaged.

    - china is a systematic human rights violator. the overall pattern
    of violations makes it harder to dismiss any one claimed violation.

    - there is huge money to be made in china from transplants. prices
    charged to foreigners, also available on a web site, range from
    us$30,000 for corneas to us$180,000 for a liver and kidney
    combination.

    - corruption in china is a major problem. the huge money to be made
    from transplants, the lack of state controls over corruption and the
    marginalization of the falun gong are a deadly trio.

    - until july 1 of this year, there was no law in china preventing
    the selling of organs and no law requiring consent for organ
    harvesting. china has a poor history of implementing laws designed
    to ensure respect for human rights.

    it is easy to take each element in isolation, and say that this
    element or that does not prove the claim. but it is their
    combination which led us to the chilling conclusion to which we
    came.

    we are reinforced in our conclusions by the feeble response of the
    government of china. despite all their resources and inside
    knowledge, they have not provided any information to counter our
    report. instead, they have attacked us personally and, more
    worrisome, attacked the falun gong with the very sort of verbal
    abuse which we have identified as one of the reasons we believe
    these atrocities are occurring.

    our report has seventeen different recommendations. virtually no
    precaution one can imagine to prevent the harvesting of organs of
    falun gong practitioners in china is currently being taken. all
    these precautions should be put in place.

    but there is one basic recommendation we make which must be
    implemented immediately. organ harvesting of falun gong
    practitioners in china must stop.

    - david matas is a winnipeg international human rights lawyer. the
    full report is available at http:// organharvestinvestigation.net.

china kills falun gong members for organs, ex-mp says





national post · ottawa — the conservative government is planning to investigate
    allegations in a new report that the chinese government and its
    agencies are torturing religious prisoners and harvesting their
    organs, tory mp deepak obhrai indicated on thursday.

    “we take these allegations quite seriously, and we’ll look into
    that,” said obhrai, who is parliamentary secretary to foreign
    affairs minister peter mackay. “we’ll look to have it confirmed.”

    the report, prepared by former alberta mp david kilgour and
    international human rights lawyer david matas, included transcripts
    of recorded conversations in mandarin with hospital and
    detention-centre officials who admitted they had organs available
    for transplants from falun gong prisoners.

    the chinese government banned the practice of falun gong in the
    country in 1999, and rounded up its members accusing them of
    anti-government activities.

    “what we’ve got here is a new, shocking, different form of evil,”
    said matas at a news conference. “the chinese communist party sees
    the falun gong as an ideological threat to the regime, because of
    the large numbers, the ability to mobilize a large group of people,
    their commitment and their tenacity.”

    obhrai said the government had already been concerned about the
    issue before the report was released, asking the united nations
    special rapporteur on torture to look into allegations of organ
    harvesting and human rights violations.

    a spokesperson for the chinese embassy in canada has denied the
    government has any policy to forcibly harvest organs, dismissing the
    allegations as “rumours spread by the falun gong.”

    the report recommends the canadian government revoke passports of
    citizens suspected of travelling to china for transplants and stop
    chinese doctors from studying transplants in canada.

man beaten for aiding falun gong






    four men attack person who tried to stop harassment of the
    movement's members
    thursday, 13 june, 2013, 5:05am

scmp -- political parties have asked the police to speed up an investigation
    into a violent attack on a man who says he was repeatedly bashed
    after an altercation with people believed to be supporters of a
    pro-establishment group.

    the 50-year-old, who wanted to be known only by his surname chan,
    said he was set upon by four men after he argued with some people
    who were holding up placards around a falun gong booth in mong kok
    on june 6. chan believes they were from the youth care association.

    chan, who still had stitches on his head and a swollen eye, spoke to
    the media yesterday, alleging that he was hit 20 times by the men
    and bashed in the head with a stool, leaving him with the injuries
    to his head, eye and shoulder.

    he claims the assault was politically motivated. groups including
    the democratic party and the league of social democrats have urged
    police to take action and curb "political violence".

    lee cheuk-yan, chairman of the hong kong alliance in support of
    patriotic democratic movements in china, criticised police, saying
    they were slow to act on the case and had been derelict in their
    duty.

    chan said that on the night of the attack, he was going to an event
    in mong kok to mark a year since the death of mainland dissident li
    wangyang . when he got to sai yeung choi street at 6pm, he saw
    people surrounding a falun gong booth. he argued with them and tried
    to make them lower their placards. he was headed for the ladies'
    market when he was set upon.

    "i was smacked in the head with a stool - there was no warning," he
    said, adding that it would not deter him from taking part in future
    pro-democracy activities.

    an association member would say only that the matter should be
    handled by the police.

    a police spokesman said they tried unsuccessfully to find the
    attackers on the day it happened. no arrests have been made.

behind cry for help from china labor camp






    originally published tuesday, june 11, 2013 at 8:50 pm--by andrew
    jacobs, the new york times

    masanjia, china — the cry for help, a neatly folded letter stuffed
    inside a package of halloween decorations sold at kmart, traveled
    5,000 miles from china into the hands of a mother of two in oregon.

    a part of a letter found in a package of halloween decorations.

    scrawling in wobbly english on a sheet of onionskin paper, the
    writer said he was imprisoned at a labor camp in this northeastern
    chinese town, where he said inmates toiled seven days a week, their
    15-hour days haunted by sadistic guards.

    this letter to the world human right organization,” said the note,
    which was tucked between two ersatz tombstones and fell out when the
    woman, julie keith, opened the box in her living room last october.
    “thousands people here who are under the persicution of the chinese
    communist party government will thank and remember you forever.”

    the letter drew international news media coverage and widespread
    attention to china’s opaque system of “re-education through labor,”
    a collection of penal colonies where petty criminals, religious
    offenders and critics of the government can be given up to four-year
    sentences by the police without trial.

    but the letter writer remained a mystery, the subject of speculation
    over whether he or she was a real inmate or a creative activist
    simply trying to draw attention to the issue.

    last month, though, during an interview to discuss china’s labor
    camps, a 47-year-old former inmate at the masanjia camp said he was
    the letter’s author. the man, a beijing resident and adherent of
    falun gong, the outlawed spiritual practice, said it was one of 20
    such letters he secretly wrote over the course of two years. he then
    stashed them inside products whose english-language packaging, he
    said, made it likely they were destined for the west.

    “for a long time i would fantasize about some of the letters being
    discovered overseas, but over time i just gave up hope and forgot
    about them,” said the man, who asked that only his last name, zhang,
    be published for fear of reprisal.

    he knew well the practices of the camp in question, which was
    corroborated by other inmates, and he spoke as other inmates did of
    their work preparing mock tombstones. his handwriting and modest
    knowledge of english matched those of the letter, although it was
    impossible to know for sure whether there were perhaps other letter
    writers, one of whose messages might have reached oregon.

    if mr. zhang’s account truly explains the letter’s origin, the feat
    represents one of the more successful campaigns by a follower of the
    falun gong movement, which is known for its high-profile attempts to
    embarrass the chinese government after being labeled a cult and
    outlawed in 1999.

    emboldened by an unusually open public debate in china that has
    broken out here in recent months over the future of re-education
    through labor, scores of former inmates have come forward to tell
    their stories. in interviews with more than a dozen people who were
    imprisoned at masanjia and other camps around the country, they
    described a catalog of horrific abuse, including frequent beatings,
    days of sleep deprivation and prisoners chained up in painful
    positions for weeks on end.

    several former inmates recounted the death of a fellow inmate,
    either from suicide or an illness that went untreated by prison
    officials.

    “sometimes the guards would drag me around by my hair or apply
    electric batons to my skin for so long, the smell of burning flesh
    would fill the room,” said chen shenchun, 55, who was given a
    two-year sentence for refusing to give up a petition campaign aimed
    at recovering unpaid wages from her accounting job at a state-owned
    factory.

    according to former inmates, roughly half of masanjia’s population
    is made up of falun gong practitioners or members of underground
    churches, with the rest a smattering of prostitutes, drug addicts
    and petitioners whose efforts to seek redress for perceived
    injustices had become an embarrassment for their hometown officials.
    

     all agreed that the worst abuse was directed at falun gong members
    who refused to renounce their faith. in addition to the electric
    shocks, they said, guards would tie their limbs to four beds, and
    gradually kick the beds farther apart. some inmates would be left
    that way for days, unfed and lying in their own excrement.

    “i still can’t forget the pleas and howling,” said liu hua, 51, a
    petitioner who was imprisoned at masanjia on three separate
    occasions. “that place is a living hell.”

    even if they found the work exhausting, many inmates described the
    time spent in masanjia’s workshops as a respite from mistreatment or
    the hours of “re-education classes” that often entailed an endless
    recitation of camp rules or the singing of patriotic songs while
    standing in the broiling sun.

    much of the work involved producing clothing for the domestic market
    or uniforms for the people’s armed police. but inmates say they also
    assembled christmas wreaths bound for south korea, coat linings
    stuffed with duck feathers that were labeled “made in italy” and
    silk flowers that guards insisted would be sold in the united
    states. “whenever we were making goods for export, they would say,
    ‘you better take extra care with these,’ ” said jia yahui, 44, a
    former inmate who now lives in new york.

    corinna-barbara francis, china researcher at amnesty international,
    said that given the abundant money-making opportunities, abolishing
    or significantly reforming the system would prove daunting. in
    addition to the profits earned from the inmate labor, prison
    employees often solicit bribes for early release, or for better
    treatment, from the families of those incarcerated. “given the
    serious money being made in these places, the economic incentive to
    keep the system going is really powerful,” she said.

    during labor shortages, inmates say masanjia officials simply buy
    small-time offenders from other cities on a sliding scale that
    begins at 800 renminbi, or about $130, for six months of labor. they
    include people like zhang ling, a 25-year-old from the eastern
    coastal city of dalian who said she was among a group of 50 young
    women rounded up by the police last may during a crackdown on
    illegal pyramid sales schemes and then sold to masanjia. while
    there, she sewed buttons on military uniforms but was released 10
    months early after a brother paid for her release.

    masanjia officials did not respond to faxes and phone calls
    requesting an interview. approached one recent afternoon, a
    half-dozen guards on a cigarette break outside the women’s work camp
    refused to answer any questions. one guard, however, made a point of
    correcting the way a question was phrased. “there are no prisoners
    here,” she said sternly. “they are all students.”

    sears holdings, the owner of kmart, declined to make an executive
    available for an interview. but in a brief statement, a company
    spokesman, howard riefs, said an internal investigation prompted by
    the discovery of the letter uncovered no violations of company rules
    that bar the use of forced labor. he declined to provide the name of
    the chinese factory that produced the item, a $29.99 set of
    halloween decorations called “totally ghoul” that include plastic
    spiders, synthetic cobwebs and a “bloody cloth.”

    although he was released from masanjia in 2010, mr. zhang, the man
    who said he wrote the letter, has vivid memories of producing the
    plastic foam headstones, which were made to look old by painting
    them with a sponge. “it was an especially difficult task,” he said.
    “if the results were not to the liking of the guards, they would
    make us do them again.” he estimated that inmates produced at least
    1,000 headstones during the year he worked on them.

    his letter-writing subterfuge was complicated and risky. barred from
    having pens and paper, mr. zhang said he stole a set from a desk one
    day while cleaning a prison office. he worked while his cellmates
    slept, he said, taking care not to wake those inmates — often drug
    addicts or convicted thieves — whose job it was to keep the others
    in line. he would roll up the letter and hide it inside the hollow
    steel bars of his bunk bed, he said.

    there it would remain, sometimes for weeks, until a product
    designated for export was ready for packing. “too early and it could
    fall out, too late and there would be no way to get it inside the
    box,” said mr. zhang, a technology professional who studied english
    in college.his account of life in the camp matched those of other
    inmates who said they produced the same halloween-themed items.

    last december, ms. keith, the woman who bought the product in 2011
    but did not open it until the following year, sent the letter she
    found to the federal immigration and customs enforcement agency,
    which said it would look into the matter. an agency spokesman,
    citing protocol, said that he could not confirm whether an
    investigation was under way, but that such cases generally took a
    long time to pursue.

    for ms. keith, a manager at goodwill industries, the experience has
    been sobering. she said she previously knew little about china,
    except that most of the household goods she bought were made there.
    “when that note popped out and my daughter picked it up, i was
    skeptical that it was real,” she said. “but then i googled masanjia
    and realized, ‘whoa, this is not a good place.’ ”

chinese official makes conflicting statements about forced organ harvesting in china -dafoh






washington, june 3, 2013 /prnewswire-usnewswire/ -- facing international pressure about the unethical harvesting of organs from convicted prisoners, china's top health care official apparently can't make up his mind about the status of the brutal and inhumane practice. in a may 17 news conference
 called to trumpet an end of the policy, dr. huang jiefu promised that 
organ harvesting from executed criminals would be "phased out" within 
two years—and then defended the practice three days later in an interview with the australian abc news agency, leaving it uncertain if china will phase out the practice.



under pressure from the international community, china has recently vowed to "phase out" its practice of harvesting organs from executed prisoners. at a may 17 press conference in beijing, dr. huang jiefu, former vice minister of health, described china's current organ procurement practice as "profit-driven, unethical, and violating human rights."
 medical doctors, lawyers, human rights watchdogs, and parliamentarians 
worldwide have demanded an immediate end to forced organ harvesting in china.



three days later in an interview with australian abc news on may 20, huang took a completely different approach. instead of condemning the practice as he did on may 17,
 he defended the more than two-decades-old practice. he suggested that 
the use of the prisoners' organs provides an opportunity for redemption, saying: "before he dies, he forms a conscience. he needs to do something to repay society. so why you object?"



ethical organ donation is based on altruistic choice and voluntary, informed consent. in 2006, the transplantation society stated: 



"because
 of the restrictions in liberty in a prison environment, it is unlikely 
that prisoners are truly free to make independent decisions and thus an 
autonomous informed consent for donation cannot be obtained. … thus, the
 transplantation society is opposed to the recovery of organs and 
tissues from executed prisoners and from any other individual where an 
autonomous consent for the procurement is lacking."



huang disclosed in his may 20
 interview that he has "taken" organs from executed prisoners for his 
own surgical transplant practice. according to huang's statement from may 17, many of the liver transplants that he performed would be considered "unethical and a violation of human rights."



the recent statements of huang come on the heels of an investigation at the prestigious university of sydney (australia) concerning huang's known conduct in transplant medicine. a coalition of academics, doctors, and lawyers lead by professor  maria fiatarone singh ,
 faculty of health sciences and faculty of medicine, are requesting that
 the university revoke the honorary professor titles given to huang in 
2008 and 2011. 



huang's
 transplant practice conflicts with the university's code of conduct. it
 is incomprehensible why the university's leadership continues to defend
 huang's honorary professor title even after he openly admitted to 
having violated ethical standards. as former vice minister of health, 
huang has overseen china's organ harvesting system for over a decade and is responsible for the unethical organ harvesting practice.



 

abc has described huang as saying the world needs to be understanding and give china
 a chance. the distorted call for "a chance" is like a slap in the face 
of the tens of thousands of innocent lives who did not have a slightest 
chance and were killed for their organs. 



without
 admitting that the ongoing practice of harvesting organs from prisoners
 and unlawfully detained prisoners of conscience is unethical and wrong,
 we are concerned that the current practice will continue. without 
transparency and traceability, as demanded by the who, we are concerned that convicted prisoners and prisoners of conscience, mostly detained  falun gong  practitioners, will continue to be subject to forced organ harvesting in china.
