          we 
are the washington state leader in 
instant privacy® 
trees --no other nursery in washington state  
has our combination of:


thousands of 
 privacy trees growing in our 
fields;


great selection, including privacy trees not available 
	elsewhere;

many years' of experience in 
	"what works where";

free, no obligation estimates;

professional planting 
	services;

ongoing support after 
planting; and 

thousands of satisfied 
customers.

 

         
our 
instant privacy trees 
  are big enough to be an immediate
barrier, plus we usually have smaller sizes as well.  you have several choices including big, bushy "emerald
green" arborvitae, excelsa cedar, leyland cypress,
emerald tower, and various laurels.  plus, we have many of these trees 
available in a "hedged" form which allows us to immediately plant a narrow hedge 
for you.  no other nursery or tree farm specializes in privacy trees the 
way we do.

our 
"service area" 
is the greater puget sound 
region--roughly bellingham to olympia including seattle, everett, bellevue, redmond 
issaquah, renton, tacoma, etc., etc.--plus stevens pass/wenatchee.
 if you are outside of 
this area we won't be able to plant for you.  you may still buy trees from 
us but you will need to have them planted locally.

privacy trees: 

 we are a nursery tree farm specializing in
privacy trees for screening.  


we sell retail & wholesale, 
for residential and commercial projects and we "deliver & plant" our trees.  

our most common project is planting a line 
of privacy trees for a homeowner.  we have several thousand privacy trees growing at our snohomish farm.  plus 
we have many years' experience in "what 
works where", professional planting services, ongoing support, and thousands of 
satisfied customers.  buying directly from a grower has great 
advantages--fresh trees, great selection, and low prices--you maximize your 
purchasing power.  
we also have privacy trees 
	that are not available elsewhere, such as our
"hedged privacy trees" 
and "thin man" arborvitae.  
you can see our hedged 
	and natural privacy trees in our beautiful 8 minute youtube
	farm video.



ornamental trees:



 we also have a nice selection of
	ornamental trees, with many of our trees being on the "great 
	plant picks" list for the pacific northwest.



delivery & planting:


 we usually deliver & plant our trees 
for customers.  click 
here for more information.





free estimates:


 we will help you determine which trees 
are right for your project, and provide you with free, no-obligation estimates.  
this is often accomplished by e-mail and phone, usually first using our online
free estimate 
	request form.  where necessary, we will send one of our experts out to 
	review the project (no cost or obligation).  

more information



location: 
 were conveniently located 
	just 15 minutes north of woodinville.  here's a link to our 
"directions" page.  please also read the next section.   
	



farm visits:  

we are a working farm not a retail nursery so we don't keep regular retail hours; instead we set up appointments so that 
	we can focus on your project.  this is particularly important during 
our busy seasons.  here's a link to more information about
why "appointment only" is the best 
approach.  so please set-up an appointment instead of "just coming 
out".  thank you.  (425) 
343-2650; info@nurserytrees.com.   



covid-19 precautions:

 covid-19 
caused us to make 
some changes in the way 
we do things.  for a detailed break-down of these steps please see our
"covid-19 precautions" webpage.  
these can change with the "ebb and flow" of the covid virus and we respect any 
steps a person wants to take to protect themselves.

payment:  we dont require any 
	money up frontyou only pay when the job is completed (unusual exceptions 
	to this are large/special projects or lengthy holds on trees).  be careful of 
	contractors asking for up front money; they might not come back!


 warranty 
& support:

 when we plant your trees we include 
	staking (if necessary), transplanting fertilizer, and an 
	easy-to-use watering system that hooks into your garden hose.  

more 
	information.  
	we also give a one year warranty on trees we plant, for no additional 
	charge.  
more information 
 we have a detailed care 
	of your trees section of our website, and provide ongoing support--we're 
	available to answer your questions as your new trees grow.

customer service: 

 we pride ourselves on our 
	customer servicereal people answering the phone.  we have an "a+" rating 
	with the better business bureau (their highest rating), are an angie's list super service award 
	winner, have excellent reviews on yelp, google, etc. and a 100% satisfaction rating with ebay. 


 


our 
business:  weve been in business 
	since 1995 and have a dedicated, experienced staff, most of whom have 
	been with us for many years.  see: 

"about 
us" for our history.  

we are a registered washington state contractor 
(license number: nursel*956j1). 

more information 

 be sure to hire a 
	registered contractor  --  to go to the department of labor & 
	industries website to check a contractor's registration, 
click here.  as it says 
	there:  "unregistered contractors carry no bond or insurance to 
	protect consumers.  consumers can face serious issues if anything goes 
	wrong on a job."   these liability risks are in addition to  
	fraud, poor workmanship, worthless warranties, etc.  we are fully 
bonded and insured, of course.


 customer 
satisfaction:


 most important of all is 
	what our customers think of us:

"i am really pleased with your work.  you saved me several 
thousand dollars, steered me away from trees that wouldn't work, provided 
healthy and beautiful trees, did a great job planting them, and did everything 
on time and on schedule.  you can quote me."                                                                          jo, vashon island


"our privacy bank of trees has done nothing but grow well 
into maturity.  our back yard and deck area is totally private and the 10 
trees your team planted [in 2005] are rich, leathery and dark green.  we 
remark on them every day it seems.  please include me in any of your 
"testimonials" as you would be hard pressed to find a more satisfied 
customer."               

                                                                                                   
jim, port orchard


"for quality vs. value, your trees are the best landscape 
purchase ive ever made."    jeff, seattle

"michael, i just wanted to pass along a note to tell you how thrilled i am with 
the trees.  the effect they have brought to our new courtyard in the front 
of our home here in seattle has exceeded my expectations!"            
chip hanauer, hydroplane driver--click here 
to see his project.   


"i work in customer service so i know good service when i 
experience it and you have my top rating.  i would definitely recommend you to 
anyone who needs new landscaping.  thanks again.               carol, camano island

"the 
[new] trees were a great privacy feature when we sold the last 
house!  we now have a much larger space we want to talk with you about . . "                                                                                   
katherine, fall city

my compliments to your crew.  weve had a lot of contractors 
working on our house recently and weve seen the entire range; and your guys 
were excellent. the trees make things look so much betteri started smiling as 
soon as i saw them going in."                                                                                    
holly, queen anne

"you guys are the best nursery i've ever done business with! and i 
have dealt with a few. you did what you said you would, on time with attention 
to detail rarely found. from the beginning of the quote process all the way 
through to the last detail you made it easy. and you work to ensure that the 
trees will thrive after planting with detailed advice, a complementary 
irrigation system, and a website filled with useful information. most nurseries 
will just dump off the goods and tell you best of luck, put some water on them. 
you provide a quality product that sets you apart. your crew was friendly, 
polite and operated as a well organized team. i would recommend you without 
hesitation! thanks for doing a great job!                                                                                                   ryan, buckley

"we can not believe how beautiful your trees are.  the privacy is 
unbelievable. if you ever need a testimonial let us know.   our yard 
is perfect!  we sit there and say "my oh my!               suzanne, tacoma 

"i don't think i've ever been as happy with something i've 
purchased."                           
sarah, sammamish
