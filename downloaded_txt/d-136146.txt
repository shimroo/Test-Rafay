cracketology: reveal reset



the ncaa selection committee released their midseason top-16 on saturday. let's rundown the teams that were included, then see if there are any takeaways from the reveal.1-seeds: auburn (1), alabama (2), duke (3), florida (4)auburn, alabama, and duke were the easy selections. the only question was who would be the last 1-seed. the committee went with florida. as we said in our preview, the gators were a team we thought could jump up to the last 1-seed if they included tuesday results. clearly they did.2-seeds: tennessee (5), texas a&m (6), purdue (7), houston (8)the first three were expected, the only surprise with houston is they were that far back. the cougars don't have a great collection of wins to support their elite metrics, which has to be what cost them. with the arizona win and texas tech, iowa state, and kansas still on the schedule, there's room for them to move up.3-seeds: iowa state (9), kentucky (10), wisconsin (11), arizona (12)we had iowa state, kentucky, and wisconsin here, though in a different order. arizona was our first 4-seed. most likely this means the arizona win at byu tuesday was included.4-seeds: texas tech (13), michigan (14), kansas (15), st. john's (16)we had michigan state in and michigan out, but as mentioned in the preview, which michigan school is a protected seed would tell us which games were included. if this comes out sunday or monday, it would've been msu. because it was michigan, we know their win over purdue was factored in.we also had st. john's too high at 12. the loss to 'nova on wednesday probably knocked them down, but this spot indicates they were probably always a 4-seed, indicating that being big east leaders didn't help them much (similar for michigan).in consideration: michigan state, marquettethese teams were said to be right there for the last spot in the top-16. both have winning records in q1 and losses in q2, which stands out against ole miss, who was not mentioned but came into the reveal better metrically but with with a losing q1 record and no q2 losses.takeawayswins over metrics: houston had better predictive metrics than florida, tennessee, texas a&m, and purdue, but was behind them with only one q1a win (the teams ahead all have at least three). similarly, kentucky was on a 3-seed with a bevy of good wins despite being a metric 4-seed. this is the exact opposite trend we saw last year.focus on resume (metrics): the resume metrics were better seed predictors than the predictive metrics. sor (5 exact, 13 +/-2 spots, 2.3 average away) and wab (4 exact, 13 +/-2 spots, 2.2 average away) were the metrics closest to the selection committee's seeds. bpi was worst (0 exact, 7 +/- 2 spots, 4.6 average away).rap is still king: the average of the two averages was still the best predictor, with 7 exact, 15 within 2 spots, and an average of 1.3 away. if you used rap as a strict guideline, 16 of the 18 teams mentioned would have been on the correct seed line, with only kansas and kentucky flipped.marquette's future: chairman bubba cunningham mentioned marquette as "right there" for the #16 overall spot. a 4-seed is still a very realistic goal, while a 3-seed is possible if they get hot (think 7 more total wins). i do think getting back to a 2-seed is probably unrealistic unless they get a lot of help.championship week might matter: we put the bracket together with monday's data because historically, the selection committee hasn't included later in the week results. it is clear they at least used tuesday data and likely used wednesday results as well. might this indicate that championship week results on thursday, friday, and maybe even saturday will be factored into the final bracket? it seems more possible if this committee is capable of processing data beyond what's immediately available when they walk into their meeting room.so what did this mean further down the bracket? we feel confident with memphis as a 6-seed thanks to their q1 wins, even though their metrics would be an 8-seed. on the bubble, we looked closer at q1 win percentages and teams with q1-3 winning records. vanderbilt, arkansas, and georgia were all in our last field, but now all are below .300 wp% in q1 and have losing records in q1-3. as a result, the sec is down to 11 schools, with texas, george mason, and uc irvine replacing them. texas' late win over kentucky lifted them into the field. byu also moved in with their hot streak of late (including a win over k-state last night), as did wake forest after winning at smu.for the big east, xavier losing at villanova was their last q1 opportunity, which likely ends their at-large hopes. there just isn't enough meat on the musketeer resume. villanova's own tourney hopes took a hit yesterday with the loss at providence. if they win their next two (at uconn, vs marquette) maybe they can get another look, but for now they are under water and continuing to take on losses outside q1 isn't helping.finally, let's see where we stand now with both what we learned from the selection committee and saturday's results included:multibid leaguessec: 11big 10: 10big 12: 8acc: 4big east: 4mountain west: 3a-10: 2big west: 2wcc: 2

cracketology: predicting the top-16 reveal



cbs reveals the 2024 top-16photo from cbs sports broadcaston saturday, the ncaa will reveal their initial top-16 seeds ahead of the ncaa tournament. this always occurs after the super bowl and shows the exact order of the first four seed lines if the tournament were to begin that day. well...sort of. in each of the past two seasons, the cracked sidewalks projection from the beginning of the week was more accurate than the projection we released on the eve of the reveal.what this tells us is that when the selection committee gets together on tuesday, they are using the metrics and results including games on sunday or monday. while it seems counter-intuitive, it makes sense. they likely start work on putting together the top four lines on tuesday, so they continue to work with the same data all week. it's not dissimilar to the week of selection sunday. in the past, we've dug into the numbers that show championship week results have minimal impact on the sunday bracket, so why would the week of the top-16 reveal be any different?we are using the records, quadrant results, and metrics from tuesday morning because it seems unlikely anything that happened after that will impact what we see on saturday. today, we will go seed by seed through the top-16 to explain not just who you can expect to see in the reveal, but why they are there. we'll also include at the end some other teams that may be considered.as far as things to consider, to fit a seed line teams should have average resume metric averages that are four times the seed line. this means being at an average of 4.0 or under for 1-seeds, 8.0 or under for 2-seeds, 12.0 or under for 3-seeds, and 16.0 or under for 4-seeds. volume of wins in quadrant 1a, quadrant 1, and quadrants 1+2 are also heavily considered, usually more so than losses. having winning quadrant records is also a positive.1-seeds1-auburn: the tigers 21-2 record is better than anyone else in contention for the top lines. their 11 q1 wins and 15 q1+2 wins are both most in the country. they rank #1 in 5 of the 7 metrics on the team sheet. this one is an easy choice.2-alabama: the tide edge out duke because they have the same overall record, 7 q1 wins to 5, and 14 q1+2 wins to 9. the teams are near metric mirrors, with alabama averaging 4.0 in the metrics while duke is at 3.8, but the strength of what alabama has had to do in the sec to match duke's overall record is the deciding factor.3-duke: this is the last easy selection. while other teams have a few more q1 wins, duke is the only team left that has 5 of their 7 metrics ranking in the top-3.4-houston: this would be the first surprise of the bracket, and it will depend on what data the committee is using. you could also argue tennessee or florida for this spot, but houston has the same number of q1+2 wins as tennessee, more q1 wins than florida, and a better predictive average (2.0) than the vols (4.3) or gators (6.0). ultimately, predictive metrics are thought to drive seeding, and combining that with the cougars being the presumptive big 12 champs (another factor that has weighed heavily) gives houston the edge.2-seeds5-tennessee: comparing the vols to florida, the vols have more q1 wins (8-3) and rank higher on five of the seven team sheet metrics, including a better net, resume average, and predictive average.6-florida: if the committee considers results through tuesday, the gators could jump up to the last 1-seed, but we're confident they won't be lower than this. six of the seven team sheet metrics have the gators in the top-6 and no one left has fewer losses (3) and more q1+2 wins (11).7-purdue: if purdue can improve their predictive average (9.0) they have a legitimate shot at a 1-seed. the boilermakers' 7 q1 wins trail only auburn and tennessee, while their 14 q1+2 wins are tied with alabama for second best in the country. metrically, they are two points behind the six teams ahead of them, but three points better than anyone behind them. this is one where using later data could hurt as the boilermakers took a loss to michigan tuesday night.8-texas a&m: another tough call here because no one fits the mathematical 2-seed profile of 8.0 or better averages. the aggies are metrically deadlocked (both 10.7 average) with arizona but have more q1+2 wins (12) than the wildcats. wisconsin has as many q1+2 wins, but the aggies are better in 5/7 team sheet metrics and have more q1a wins (4) than bucky (1). no other team can claim a metric edge nor better collection of wins than buzz williams' team, so the aggies land here.3-seeds 9-wisconsin: the strength of wisconsin's resume are 7 q1 and 12 q1+2 wins. while their metric average (13.0) fits a 4-seed more than a 3-seed, they have better results than the only two teams that meet a 3-seed mathematical profile: arizona and iowa state.10-iowa state: iowa state's 12.2 metric average is better than anyone left except for arizona, who we'll get to later. the only competition there is kansas (13.3) but isu also has more q1 wins (6 to 5) which keeps the cyclones on this line.11-kentucky: metrically, kentucky should be a 5-seed. so why are they here? quite simply, the wins. their 6 q1a wins are more than any other team left and behind only auburn. their three wins over top-5 teams (up to 4 on tuesday) are more than any other team in the country, auburn included. no one can match their quantity of quality, which bumps them up higher than their metrics would indicate.12-st. john's: there are two teams that have a better metric claim to this spot. arizona is at 10.7, kansas is at 13.3, and st. john's is only at 15.2. the wildcats (7) and jayhawks (5) have more q1 wins than st. john's (3), but the johnnies 
only have 3 losses with both of their competitors having double that. the real differentiator is that st. john's is recognized as our big east champion.  we've seen the selection committee nod to this in the past when marquette was given the #8 overall in 2023.4-seeds13-arizona: the wildcats fit a 3-seed perfectly. their metric 
average is 10.7, no one left has more q1 wins (7) than they do, and they
 don't have any bad losses. however, they also have more total losses than anyone ahead of them and they don't have any top tier wins away from home. it wouldn't surprise us to see them higher, but there just isn't room on the 3-line for them so a 4-seed feels appropriate.14-kansas: the jayhawks edge michigan state in 5 of the 7 team sheet metrics, a better metric average (13.3 to 15.0), have more q1 wins (5 to 4), and more q1+2 wins (10 to 9). they edge texas tech in 4 of 7 metrics with metric average edge (13.3 to 15.0 again), but have one fewer q1 win (5 to 6). however, kansas' q1+2 advantage (10 to 7) and not having multiple q2 losses kept them ahead.15-texas tech: while msu was a better comp for kansas, texas tech gets the slight nod over sparty. they are in a metric dead heat, though ttu is better in 4 of 7 resume metrics when net is included. the red raiders also have more q1 wins (6 to 4) and digging deeper, the win at houston is something sparty just can't match. if they factor the tuesday games, it favors the red raiders even more.16-michigan state: metrically, no one left is close to sparty. their 15.0 metric average is far better than the next closest team (michigan at 18.5). there are seven other teams with metric averages below 24.0 and msu. illinois is the only one that is ahead of michigan state in as many as three metrics, the rest sparty leads in at least six of seven. the biggest question is which data set they use. if it is from tuesday morning, michigan state belongs here. if they include this week's results, the edge likely goes to michigan who we have at #17. which of the michigan schools is a protected seed likely tells us which games they included.in consideration17-michigan: the wolverines have better metrics than kentucky and added the big purdue win this week. 10 q1+2 wins is excellent, but the two q2 losses knocked them down here.18-marquette: the golden eagles boast 11 q1+2 wins, but shoddy metrics (20.7 average) and three q2 losses keep them out of the top-16.19-ole miss: this team fits the 5-line perfectly. nine q1+2 wins, a losing q1 record, and 6 of 7 metrics outside the top-16 keep them outside the conversation.24-memphis: the tigers are a wildcard here. their resume average is 13.3 but all predictive metrics are sub-40. their metric profile fits an 8-seed, but the selection committee has boosted conference champs with great w/l profiles before (2022 providence). i don't think they'll be here, but they could be the out-of-the-blue shocker.here's the current s-curve and bracket:multibid leaguessec: 13big 10: 10big 12: 7acc: 5big east: 4mwc: 3wcc: 2

pull up your therapy furniture of choice



well, we were hoping it wouldn't come to this but it's time for some #scrambledeggs therapy. it's been a rough 7 days of basketball outcomes for #mubb, so let's do the hard work and come to a good place. first we talk through the losing streak overall and what our biggest concerns are. we then talk about the results directly and what needs to change. we then get therapeutic for a bit before closing out on #dltd. also there is the jinxiest jinx to ever jinx. enjoy!

cracketology: what's a protected seed worth?



 marquette was the #12 overall seed when they reached the 2013 elite eightphoto by alex brandon | ap photonext week the ncaa selection committee will reveal their midseason top-16 seeds. the reveal is often considered a way for teams to gauge where they are at and for bracketologists to get an idea of how the committee will approach selection and seeding. however we also hear about how in a single-elimination tournament, anything can happen and every team has a chance to win it all through their conference tournament and luck of the ncaa draw. today, we will dig into the truth of that.2012 was the first year the ncaa revealed their complete s-curve. cracked sidewalks went back through every bracket since that reveal and pulled the data to see how far each of the protected seeds went. past is not always a perfect predictor, but this might be worth bookmarking for march if you want an idea of how successful the various seeds are.first, let's talk about what the table shows. each seed is broken into four columns for the four exact seeds. so if we look at the first column, that represents the #1 overall seed, projected to be the favorite by the selection committee. the top line represents wins (see the leftmost column) by that exact seed, color coded so no shading represents an outcome that has never happened, lighter green shading representing fewer instances and darker shading representing more likely outcomes. the bottom shows the average number of wins per seed and the number of times that exact seed reached the final four (4 or more wins). with the data above, let's go seed by seed to see the best case scenario, worst case scenario, and expected results.uconn captured the title as the #1 overall seed in 2024photo by tyler schank | ncaa photos1-seeds#1best case: national champions (2012 kentucky, 2013 louisville, 2024 connecticut)worst case: first round loss (2018 virginia)expectations: half of all #1 seeds made the final four, with half of those winning it all. all but two made the second weekend, so if you are getting this seed, the expectation should be a second or third weekend run with odds as good as anyone of winning the title. 3.5 wins puts the average outcome between the elite eight and final four. interestingly, this is the only exact seed that has had ever possible outcome, from zero wins to six.#2best case: national champions (2018 villanova, 2019 virginia, 2021 baylor)worst case: second round loss (2015 villanova)expectations: 33% of these teams reach the final four, but 92% made the second weekend, the highest rate of any exact seed. the #2 overall has been unlikely to be upset early and has also won the national title as often as any other seed. 3.42 wins puts the average outcome between the elite eight and final four, leaning slightly toward the former.#3best case: national champions (2015 duke, 2017 north carolina, 2022 kansas)worst case: second round loss (2014 wichita state, 2021 illinois, 2023 kansas)expectations: the #3 overall is less likely to go to the final four (42%) than the #1 but more likely to be a first weekend victim (25%) than the #2. 3.33 wins puts the average outcome between the elite eight and final four, leaning more likely to the former.#4best case: runner-up (2015 wisconsin, 2017 gonzaga)worst case: first round loss (2023 purdue)expectations: this is the first notable expectation dropoff. only 17% reach the final four, half as much as any other 1-seed. 33% do not get out of the first weekend and the 2.33 wins on average puts the expected outcome between the sweet sixteen and elite eight with the former being more likely. interestingly, when #4 seeds do get to the final four, they have always made the title game.kris jenkins' buzzer beater won the title for #7 overall villanova in 2016photo by bob donnan | usa today2-seeds #5best case: runner-up (2012 kansas)worst case: first round loss (2016 michigan state)expectations: considering this seed is the first team to not be a 1-seed, it feels disappointing. no final four appearances since 2012, the fewest average wins of any 1/2-seed and there are teams on the 3-seed and 4-seed lines that average more wins than the #5 overall. 1.92 average wins means the outcome is between one win and the sweet sixteen, with the latter far more likely.#6best case: final four (2016 oklahoma, 2019 michigan state)worst case: first round loss (2012 duke, 2021 ohio state, 2022 kentucky)expectations: if the #6 can get out of the first round (three losses are the most for any 1/2-seed) they will most likely go to the elite eight. five times ending the season there is one of the highest prevalence outcomes. despite that, the average win total of 2.25 (pulled down by the first round exits) puts them between the sweet sixteen and elite eight as the average finish, with the former more likely.#7best case: national champions (2016 villanova)worst case: first round loss (2013 georgetown, 2023 arizona)expectations: this is one of just three non-1-seeds to win the title. this seed has a wide range of outcomes, and while the 2.25 win average puts them between the sweet sixteen and elite eight with the former more likely, having multiple outcomes of every possibility from a first round exit through the final four makes this one of the more unpredictable seeds.#8best case: final four (2014 wisconsin, 2021 houston, 2022 duke)worst case: first round loss (2012 missouri)expectations: the most frequent outcome is a second round loss, but when the #8 does get out of the first weekend, they make it to the final four half the time. the 2.00 average win total equates to a sweet sixteen expectation.#10 overall seed texas tech came up short in 2019photo by hannah foslien | getty images 3-seeds#9best case: final four (2017 oregon)worst case: first round loss (2013 new mexico, 2014 duke, 2015 iowa state, 2016 west virginia)expectations: like the #5 overall, the top 3-seed is the least successful on its line. it stands out that this seed suffered four straight first round upsets followed by its only final four appearance. the four first round losses are tied for the most of any protected seed. by and large, this seed loses early. 67% of the time the #9 does not get out of the first weekend. 1.33 wins on average puts the expectation between one win and the sweet sixteen, with the former more likely.#10best case: runner-up (2019 texas tech)worst case: first round loss (2015 baylor)expectations: while the highest frequency outcome is one win, this seed's outcomes are evenly split between a first weekend exit and making the sweet sixteen or better. 1.83 wins projects between one win and the sweet 16, with the latter more likely.#11best case: runner-up (2018 michigan)worst case: first round loss (2021 texas, 2024 kentucky)expectations: the sweet sixteen is the most frequent outcome, but they rarely go further than that (83% lose in the sweet sixteen or earlier). this is the seed that led to shaka smart leaving texas for marquette after the loss to abilene christian. 1.75 average wins puts most outcomes between the second round and sweet 16, with the latter more likely.#12best case: elite eight (2013 marquette, 2015 notre dame, 2018 texas tech, 2019 purdue, 2024 illinois)worst case: second round loss (2012 georgetown, 2021 kansas)expectations: this has the narrowest range of outcomes, with every #12 seed winning between 1-3 games. 83% made the second weekend, but none went further. because of the low volatility, the 2.25 average wins puts the expected outcome between the sweet sixteen and elite eight, with the former more likely. this seed has the best win average of any 3-seed. marquette checks in at #12 in today's s-curve.#13 overall uconn is the lowest protected seed to win a national titlephoto from getty images 4-seeds#13best case: national champions (2023 connecticut)worst case: first round loss (2012 michigan)expectations: this is the lowest protected seed to win it all, though 2014 7-seed uconn won it from outside the protected seeds. while there's a wide outcome range, half of these teams saw their season end in the sweet sixteen, and the 2.33 average wins is the best exact seed outcome for any team outside the 1-seed line. that win average leads to an expected finish between the sweet sixteen and elite eight, with the former more likely.#14best case: elite eight (2014 michigan state, 2017 florida)worst case: first round loss (2013 kansas state, 2016 california, 2018 wichita state, 2021 purdue)expectations: this is the least successful protected seed. it is the only protected seed that has seen less than 50% of its teams reach the second weekend or beyond. the 1.25 win average puts the expectation between the second round and sweet 16, with the former being more likely. the four first round losses are tied for the most of any protected seed.#15best case: elite eight (2015 louisville)worst case: first round loss (2019 kansas state, 2024 auburn)expectations: this is the second least successful protected seed. it also has a narrow range of outcomes, with 75% of the teams winning 1-2 games. the 1.42 win average puts the expectation between the second round and sweet 16, with the former being slightly more likely.#16best case: final four (2012 louisville, 2024 alabama)worst case: first round loss (2018 arizona, 2021 virginia, 2023 virginia)expectations: the most frequent outcome is the sweet 16, but there is a wide range of outcomes. the 2.00 win average puts the expectation at the sweet 16.here's the updated s-curve and bracket:

yep, we have the nmd sads too



 welcome back #mubb fans, and we at #scrambledeggs are just as sad about the nmd result as you. we kind of, sort of, skip over the butler game and jump right to the disappointing result against uconn. we break down what we saw in the game, what we're concerned about, and how this team pivots from this moment. we then spend a lot of time talking about the st john's game on the road as it is likely the toughest test left on the schedule. we also talk about the road game at creighton and what #mubb can do to replicate the early conference season victory. it's gonna be a tough week but there's potential to come out at the end of the week fighting for possession of a conference title. enjoy!

cracketology: is bpi fixed?



 espn's bpi metric has drawn criticism from all corners of bracketologyimage from espn.comin 2022, cracked sidewalks called out a discrepancy in the rankings witnessed on the basketball power index metric. it is one of the predictive metrics used on the ncaa's official team sheets that help with selection and (more so) seeding when it comes to the ncaa tournament field. one of the things that really stood out at the time was how much bpi seemed to favor teams that were in leagues with espn television contracts. the reason that seemed newsworthy is because bpi was designed and is run by espn. that metric, along with another espn resume metric strength of record, are the only metrics on the team sheets that are owned and operated by a media company that has a vested financial interest in which teams are selected and perform well in the ncaa tournament.earlier this week, @jbrbracketology pointed out that it looked like bpi might have been fixed. in recent years, bpi had a strong bias against mountain west teams compared to other predictive metrics. jbr noted that over the years, bpi compared to kenpom rated mwc teams 39.2% worse (2022), 25.9% worse (2023), and 32.2% worse (2024). but compare last year to this year and it's a stark difference: comparison from @jbrbracketologywhen we first looked at this our focus was on the 21 teams in the 2022 net top-100 that had bpi as a 10+ spot outlier from both of the other metrics in either a positive or negative direction. these are teams that are typically in the running for ncaa bids, either as at-large teams or the better performing mid-major teams that are able to earn automatic bids through their conference tournament. here is the original graph we shared, with the "average" being the average of the three predictive metrics at the time (bpi, kenpom, sagarin) and the "change" being the amount that bpi improved or decreased a team's metric average from the average of the other two metrics.a few things stand out. first is the number of teams with radical changes in their ranking. 6 of the 21 outlier teams had a metric drag of greater than -10. the teams most effected were from the western part of the country, primarily in the mountain west. further, every team that had a metric advantage was broadcast on an espn network. we weren't the only ones to take issue with bpi. another bracketologist pointed out that bpi had by design a negative impact on teams that played at elevation:espn's bpi, a predictive metric used on ncaat team sheets, factors/seems to penalize altitude into its metric. here's the highest-altitude arenas & their team's kp & bpi. a startling 40% diff on avg between them.affects teams in the mountain west, pac 12, big 12, wac & big sky. pic.twitter.com/ye4hlkabuu— made for march (@madeformarch) january 9, 2024  this certainly explained why teams like wyoming, colorado state, and byu were negatively impacted. this also was a problem that provided a true issue for the teams it impacted. in the 2024 ncaa tournament, excepting byu and gonzaga who were swapped seed lines to adhere to bracketing principles, here are the 6 teams that bracketmatrix.com found to be furthest away from their expected seed from the 227 bracketologists that participated:five of the six largest bracketmatrix discrepancies were negative seed impacts on mountain west teams that play at elevation (boise isn't in made for march's tweet above, but they play 2,700 feet above sea level). considering the league's lack of success in recent years, maybe those mountain west teams were due to lose regardless, but their paths were significantly more difficult than would have been expected. nevada, boise, new mexico, and colorado state all lost in the round of 64 as underdogs. utah state won their opener in an 8/9 game, but then faced purdue and lost. might these teams have fared better if they had been given the expected 6-9 seeds their non-bpi metrics indicated they earned?the excellent bracketology blog bauertology also took bpi to task last year. he cites many different sources in his longer article but it all comes to the same conclusion cracked sidewalks had in 2022, that bpi was a problem that was an outlier from the other metrics and was negatively impacting teams. now in 2025, it seems that these cries may not have fallen on deaf ears as the metric has clearly been reworked. first, let's look at a 2025 version of the top-100 net outliers:there are once again 21 outliers in the top-100, but only one team (#100 south dakota state) is at a metric gain or drag of greater than 10. not a single mountain west team appears in our outliers, and big east teams like uconn, butler, and providence actually benefit more from bpi than any other metrics, indicating the appearance of a network bias that seemed present in 2022 has been corrected, with eleven of the twelve most negatively impacted teams having espn contracts.for those with big east interests, eight of the eleven teams in the league have bpi as their best of the three predictive metrics, while just one (st. john's) has bpi as their worst metric. i would still argue this bears monitoring. it seems problematic that any of the team sheet metrics are intellectual property of a media outlet that has a vested interest in their media properties succeeding. i feel the ncaa would be better served still by replacing bpi with another predictive metric like haslametrics or evanmiya that does not make money on league or team successes. i would much rather see something like brct (pronounced "bracket") on the team sheet than sor. but if nothing else, an improvement to bpi is a welcome change.now let's see what bpi and the rest of the team sheet metrics and on-court results have produced with our latest s-curve and bracket:multibid leaguessec: 13big 10: 9big 12: 8big east: 4acc: 4mountain west: 3wcc: 2big west: 2

cracketology: big east check-in



 stevie mitchell & marquette are keeping the big east at arm's length in the s-curvephoto by michael conroy | ap photoas the calendar creeps toward february, the big east season is coming into the home stretch. the league's dismal november damaged any hopes of getting 6+ bids, but the league looks in solid position to exceed the 3 bids it earned last year and has a shot at getting 5 if things break right. today we'll look at the resumes of teams in the big east and what they need to do to get into the ncaa field.marquette: the golden eagles are flying high thanks to a solid non-conference performance that was highlighted by three wins over big 10 teams (maryland, purdue, wisconsin) currently in the field. at 18-3, shaka smart has the best record of his career through 21 games and marquette is a solid 2-seed. they are as close to lock status as can be. marquette still has an outside chance to reach the 1-line and is almost certainly going to be in the field.record needed: 2-8 or betterremaining schedule: uconn, at st. john's, at creighton, depaul, seton hall, at villanova, providence, at georgetown, at uconn, st. john'sst. john's: while st. john's boasts the same record as marquette, they went just 1-2 against ncaa tournament caliber competition in non-conference. they have just one quadrant 1 win (at xavier) and a losing record in q1+2 (4-5). the lack of quality wins means their ceiling is probably a 5-seed unless they manage to pull off a big east double-championship, but they are highly likely to be in the field.record needed: 4-6 or betterremaining schedule: providence, marquette, at uconn, at villanova, creighton, at depaul, uconn, at butler, seton hall, at marquette dan hurley & rick pitino are in position to earn ncaa bidsphoto by c. morgan engel | getty imagesconnecticut: the huskies have been considered a lock all year long, with most people still feeling bullish about the two-time defending champs even after an 0-3 maui. they have slid down to a 9-seed behind creighton and still have the meat of their schedule to come. if they look better with liam mcneeley back and don't lose games they are supposed to win, they should be in the field but after facing depaul tonight, they are underdogs per kenpom at marquette, hosting st. john's, and at creighton. their back loaded schedule gives them the opportunity to move up as high as a 4 or 5 seed, but they are trending closer to the bubble and still have work to do as they could easily miss the field if they lose games they aren't supposed to lose.record needed: 6-5 or betterremaining schedule: depaul, at marquette, st. john's, at creighton, at seton hall, villanova, at st. john's, georgetown, at providence, marquette, seton hallcreighton: the blue jays are inching their way up the s-curve, with wins over kansas, st. john's, and at uconn checking the big win box. the ceiling here is a protected seed, possibly as high as a 3 if they really get hot. i think it's more likely they end up in the 5-7 range and barring collapse are likely to be in the field. record needed: 5-6 or betterremaining schedule: xavier, at villanova, at providence, marquette, uconn, at st. john's, georgetown, depaul, at xavier, at seton hall, butlerwhen xavier takes on villanova in february it could be a de facto elimination gamephoto from xavier athleticsxavier: after xavier beat villanova at home, i told my bracketology group chat "if they can win two of their next four, xavier is in really good position to earn a bid." most people aside from the xavier fan laughed that off, but adding wins at marquette and over uconn have put the musketeers in much better position. at just 1-6 in q1, the musketeers really need at least one more top-line win (at creighton, at villanova are the last two chances) but their schedule is very favorable, as they are favored in 8 of their 10 remaining games per kenpom. get one of those q1 road games, hope for uconn to get back into the net top-30, and win the games you're supposed to and i think xavier could slip in, possibly getting as high as a 9 or 10 seed.record needed: 8-2 (with a q1 win)remaining schedule: at creighton, georgetown, at villanova, at providence, depaul, butler, at seton hall, creighton, at butler, providencevillanova: the wildcats are all but done, and it wasn't big east play but rather losses to columbia, st. joe's, and virginia in november that put them in jeopardy. with a 0-5 q1 record and multiple bad losses, i don't see 'nova punching a ticket, but they do have opportunities with creighton, st. john's, and marquette all coming to philly and a road trip to uconn. they need to not take any more bad losses and stack those quality wins to get to dayton. it's unlikely, but not quite impossible.record needed: 8-2remaining schedule: creighton, at depaul, xavier, st. john's, at providence, at uconn, marquette, at seton hall, butler, at georgetownthe rest of the big east needs 4 wins to get to the ncaa tournament, but they would all have to come at madison square garden in march.interesting note about this week's bracket is marquette's path, and i swear it just happened like this. the opener is against milwaukee in cleveland. they play because uwm couldn't go to fiserv against a protected seed, making this the closest available site when their slot came up. in the second round, it would be clemson or texas, both schools shaka smart previously coached at. in the sweet 16, the most likely opponents would be michigan state, who eliminated marquette in 2023, or ole miss, coached by chris beard, who followed smart at texas. it's funny how the bracket breaks sometimes.let's take a look at our current s-curve and bracket: multibid conferencessec: 13big 10: 9big 12: 8big east: 4 acc:
