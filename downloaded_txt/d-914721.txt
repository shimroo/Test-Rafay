something long in the works, iwillworship will now be featuring new independent artists/worship leaders every month.this will give worship leaders/artists recognition (and some income), help support the cost of the website, and gives worship leaders some new fresh music all the time.we've just launched and will be making sure any featured song has a chord chart available.if you'd like to be a featured artists and your currently not signed with a label let us know where we can hear your song online.  if we like it make sure we have a way to contact you on that site and we'll get you the proper documentation on getting your song setup and featured (including how much you get paid, etc.).  no transfer of ownership takes place with any of the songs!  at this time we are only looking for worship songs, please make sure you have posted a chord chart with lyrics on iww before having us listen to your song.let us know your thoughts, and where to hear your songs!

	 blog update!
	 
    


i've just spent a bit of time reading the posts on the blog and wanted to share my heart a bit with everyone.  i'm glad to see everyone starting to use it.  it makes me really happy when i read about  someone asking for a song, and i see that someone else has posted it for them.  that's what this site was created for, so we may all share, so we may all worship to the songs we love to listen to at full volume.thank you to everyone that has made this site so awesome.  we want to make february bigger than ever.  i challange you to take a minute to email 10 people to tell them about the site.  encourage them to use the blog.  that's where the real community is.  if we are not in contact with each other, we can't know the needs to the bunch.  i know this site is great, but it isn't about us, it's about the body as a whole.  it's about changing the face of worship, it's about seeing the dream of chris tomlin, louie giglio, matt redman, and all the other visions of a new generation of worship come to pass.use the previous posts including favorite songs, inspirational stories/testimonies, passion06 notes, and request new songs.i pray this site will bless you, and everyone that comes accross it!
