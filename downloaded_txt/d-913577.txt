since our founding in 1997, we have focused exclusively on investing in technology companies to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders
 partner with us















rapid transformation
"patrick dennis led the successful transformation of aspect software’s core product business in rapid time.  his leadership and vision helped the aspect team dramatically improve operations and increase profitability. the successful transformation resulted in the sale of our majority stake in aspect and simultaneous merger with noble systems to form alvaria, a truly global business.  we are excited for alvaria’s future and look forward to continued partnership with patrick and team in its next phase of growth."

                        – andy fishman, managing director

complexity solved
“saba is both a terrific outcome and an excellent example of vector’s strategy in action.   phil saunders has been a valuable partner with vector for over 13 years across multiple companies.  saba’s complex turnaround couldn’t have been done without his expertise and leadership as ceo.   phil successfully expanded saba’s platform through two material acquisitions, improved its financial performance, and facilitated saba’s acquisition by cornerstone ondemand, and he continues on as it’s ceo.”

                        – dave fishman, managing director

product leadership
“with multiple successes in silicon valley, bob chen understood that technology leadership is what builds great companies.   the ground-breaking products he developed at rae enabled the company to lead its market.”

reigniting growth
"at landesk, and then again at watchguard, joe wang reinvigorated product development, broadened distribution channels, and inspired the teams to scale new heights.  he is one of the most capable growth ceos in the technology business."

a company reborn
"corporate spinouts are tough, but when you get them right, the rewards are fantastic.  we recruited atul bhatnagar to transform a collection of motorola assets into cambium networks, turning it into a fast growing technology leader in the fixed wireless industry."

                        – rob amen, managing director

global expansion
"hagai hartman and josef ahorner co-founded emarsys in vienna, austria in 2000. without any venture capital, they built innovative saas marketing analytics products and drove 10x organic growth between 2009 and 2014, expanding across europe and asia. as the first outside, institutional investment partner, we are extremely proud to have helped the company expand its geographic reach into the u.s. and latin american markets which helped facilitate its acquisition by sap."

                        – alex slusky, managing director
