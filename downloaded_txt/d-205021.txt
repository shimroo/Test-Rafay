questions











1


1



what is an electric cooperative?











electric cooperatives are local power providers, owned by the member-consumers they serve. each electric co-op is governed by an elected board of directors who are members of the co-op. when the local board determines it is financially feasible, excess co-op margins are returned to the members over time as retired capital credits. due to their organizational structure, electric cooperatives are accountable and accessible utility organizations that also support their local communities and invest in economic development efforts to improve quality of life. iowa's electric cooperatives are committed to providing power that is safe, reliable, affordable and sustainable.

what are the governing values of electric cooperatives?











every electric cooperative is governed by a local board of directors, who must be members of the co-op and are elected by members of the co-op. additionally, electric co-ops adhere to the 7 cooperative principles:
1. voluntary and open membership
2. democratic member control
3. members' economic participation
4. autonomy and independence
5. education, training and information
6. cooperation among cooperatives
7. concern for community

how did electric cooperatives get started?











back in the 1930s, there was an electric divide in america. 90% of town and city dwellers had access to electricity while 90% of rural citizens were left in the dark. the investor-owned utilities at that time saw no profit in serving sparsely populated areas. president franklin d. roosevelt created the rural electrification administration (rea) in 1935 as part of the new deal and the rural electrification act of 1936 provided official status to the rea as a lending agency to serve rural areas. with low-interest financing in place, rea representatives helped rural citizens band together to form not-for-profit electric cooperatives for access to safe, reliable and affordable power. most of iowa's electric cooperatives were formed in the 1930s and 40s as a result of this effort.

how many iowans are served by electric cooperatives?











electric co-ops power the lives of 650,000 iowans throughout all 99 counties every day, representing about 15% of the state's population. electric co-ops serve primarily rural areas and we cover more than two-thirds of iowa's land mass. we maintain about 62,000 miles of power lines, which is enough to wrap around the equator 2.5 times!

do not-for-profit electric cooperatives pay taxes in iowa?











yes - collectively, iowa's electric cooperatives pay almost $29 million in local and state taxes each year. these taxes help fund local emergency services, road maintenance projects, healthcare services and schools throughout rural iowa.
