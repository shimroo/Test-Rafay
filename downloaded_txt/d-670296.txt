financial astrology








there is a close correlation between astrological  economics and cosmological economics. we have one of the largest collections of works on financial astrology (astroeconomics) in the world.
these studies are very important in developing wider theories of causation, and our catalog contains most works of value written on the subject.









baumring reading list








dr. baumring's reading lists were very comprehensive, covering all areas of the markets, sciences and metaphysical fields.  
baumring was an intensive scholar who read 1800 words a minute and had a photographic memory, thus extendinghis scope.  
baumring's 10,000 volume library included around 500 books which he saw as core information.









risk management








among professional traders, risk management is understood to be the absolutely most fundamental element leading to successful trading, because with proper risk management one can use randomly generated signals and still trade successfully. 
this is done by limiting ones losses while letting ones profits run. 










franz bardon








franz bardon's magical works present a path of initiation through 3 levels of the tarot. 
the first book teaches internal training, the second teaches the science of magical evocation, and the third teaches transcendental methods of the kaballah.
frabato presents biographical informatioin about bardon, with commentaries by friends and students. 










secret societies








private groups and organizations that specialized in particularly practices and studies within their groups.  these can range from the freemasons to the rosicrucians, the alchemists, temple initiates and more.









harmonics and music








the science of harmonics is one of the most important subjects in the esoteric and scientific traditions, positing that harmonic relationships of vibration govern the structure of the universe. 
w.d. gann called his system of market order the "law of vibration", and used principles of harmonics and vibration to predict trends in the financial markets. 










dr. alexander goulden








a cambridge scholar who, intrigued by the challenge of gann's esoteric work created a powerful set of technical tools based upon principles of ancient geometry, celestial mechanics, and pythagorean harmonics, which project price, time and trend with exact precision. 
his 2nd course applies the secrets of ancient astrology to forecasting.






























	translation society



	the sacred science translation society began in 2004 as a project to translate a collection of the most important and rare works on cosmology & esoteric science into english. through angel donors & subscribtion contributions we raised over $40,000 to translate famous foreign masterpieces from french & german on critical subjects in harmonics, geometry, esoteric mathematics, & ancient cosmology.




hans kayser

 





hans kayser was one of the 20th century's leading scientists who made a profound mathematical, geometric and philosophical study of the science of harmonics. now finally avaible in english though our translation society, kayser's series of works explore the deepest principles of pythagorean harmony & order.  his profound research reveals critical insights into gann theory & the law of vibration.




petrus talemarianus




our second translation is a french masterpiece on the establishment of a "golden rule" according to the principles of tantrism, taoism, pythagoreanism, & the kabala, serving to fulfill the laws of universal harmony & contributing to the accomplishment of the great work. it develops a system of correspondences between the symbolic, geometrical, mathematical & astronomical systems of architecture of the ancient world.



eberhard wortmann




the law of the cosmos: the divine harmony according to plato's republic/timeaus. the platonic riddle of numbers solved contains hundreds of the most sophisticated diagrams on sacred geometry, pythagorean & platonic number theory, harmonics & astronomy with analysis & elaboration of universal order & cosmic law. herman hesse called him a magisterludi of the glass bead game.



saint-yves d'alveydre




the archeometer: key to all the religions & sciences of antiquity, synthetic reformation of all contemporary arts. the archeometer is the instrument used by the ancients for the formation of the esoteric canon of ancient art and science in its various architectural, musical, scientific forms. a highly respected elaborations of the universal system, by one of the great esotericists of the 19th century.

w.d. gann works








we stock the complete collection of the works of w.d. gann.
his private courses represent the most important of his writings, going into much greater detail than the public book series. our 6 volume set of gann's collected writings includes supplementary rare source materials, and is the most reliable compliation of gann's unadulterated vital work.







dr. jerome baumring








the work of dr. baumring is the core inspiration upon which this entire website is based.  baumring is the only known modern person to have cracked the code behind wd ganns system of trading and market order. 
baumring found and elaborated the system of scientific cosmology at the root of ganns law of vibration. 
there is no other gann teaching that gets close to the depth of baumrings work.

visit our new "all financial market" website: the institute of cosmological economics
for over a decade we have been slowly working to split off the financial market section from sacred science to it's own individual specialized website. this way, those interested in esoteric topics and alternative science do not have to browse through too much market material, while serious investors and traders do not have to sort through too disassociated esoteric interests.
visit our new "all financial market" website: the institute of cosmological economics!
in 2019 we mostly completed the new ice site and in 2020 this new ssi site. for those primarily interested in financial markets, you are best jumping over to our new ice website. for those more interested in the crossover between markets and esoteric science, or not interested in the financial markets at all, best to stay here at the sacred science institute.

we consider these books to be the best of the best in their specialized fields, each containing some critical insight, key application, or valuable knowledge essential to deciphering the underlying order behind the mechanical system of cosmology upon which the law of vibration is based. many of these books were selected by baumring, gann, bayer, richter and other experts as critical research elements or clues to uncovering the lost system of the cosmos, the unified field theory that integrates not just the 4 fundamental forces of physics, but the many and complex layers of consciousness which overly, interplay, or potentially even manifest the grosser universe itself.
there is a higher science, known by the ancients, that is written in the annals of sacred science, just waiting for exploration and application by modern society. applications fall within the realms of musical harmonics, perennial philosophy, esoteric mathematics, sacred geometry, temple architecture, subtle energy manipulation, consciousness development, anti-gravity & levitation, free energy, financial forecasting and every unimaginable form of new advanced technology.
our library and catalog bring together the best and the brightest representations of this lost scientific tradition from across of history, with a particular focus upon works with technical details and applications which can create new forms of all things on higher planes... come join the quest for higher wisdom and advanced learning! there is nothing more exciting or fulfilling!

the sacred science translation society: rare source works in the esoteric sciences
the sacred science translation societyover a dozen titles translated over the last 15 years! new kayser translations by joscelyn godwin coming soon!



since the field of sacred science is based upon many historical and ancient systems and theories of the universe, we often discover important key works that have never been translated into english, and which are 100’s or 1000’s of years old, from varied cultures and civilizations across the world. we developed the sacred science translation society by pulling together a group of clients who were dedicated researchers and who, along with some angel donors, contributed to a fund to translate a collection of rare cosmological masterpieces into the english language for the first time.
we have translated 15 important technical works so far, 2/3 of which have been published, with several new titles ready for release. we have also now created a 501(c)(3) not for profit, charitable foundation, the sacred science preservation foundation, to continue this works with the help of grants and tax-deductible donations. please feel free to contact us with ideas, funds, donations or translation abilities to join the project! 

cosmological economics - the ideal research laboratory for sacred science
the sacred science institute has been active on the internet since 1998. what initially began as a scientific, metaphysical and gann/baumring bookstore, over the decades, morphed into a site overly dominated by financial markets books. for years we've been working  to separate these two distinct branches into two different websites. finally it is done!
this sacred science institute (ssi) site is our 3rd generation rebirth of sacred science. our new sister institute website, the institute of cosmological economics (ice), will serve as the new permanent center for the financial market books and work, gann & baumring courses and other cosmological economics research and information. we encourage everyone primarily focused on financial markets to jump to ice for direct market access.
new website! the institute of cosmological economicsafter 22 years, the institutes of sacred science and cosmological economics have been partitioned to meet two distinct, yet interrelated audiences. ice is all market! ssi is alternative science and esoterics in all applications.
however, we have found that there is no way to fully divorce these two studies, since the foundation of cosmological economics is sacred science, and the ideal laboratory for exploring sacred science is the financial markets. few people know or understand this, outside of a small cadre of market analysts who, like tesla, reached beyond institutional and academic dogma, penetrating fields of knowledge that are more common to theoretical physics and mystical vision than economic theory.

the most committed and educated esoteric scientists we have come across were generally focused upon the markets. following that, it was the free energy researchers and anti-gravity guys, both of who track a similar course. it's all the same system, where tesla and kepler and newton and anyone who approaches the higher science begin to discover the alternative studies that have been missed or suppressed by the mainstream.
the insights provided by the gann and cosmeconomics studies, as we call them, are of benefit to all esoteric researchers in attempting to do the impossible, forecast the future with a mathematical precision. has it been done? yes! it is based upon a logical, scientific system of great depth and complexity, that has remained mostly secret. amazingly, the basis of this system lies in the great ancient works of the geniuses and architecture of antiquity. hidden within this nearly lost sacred science, is a wisdom of such depth and beauty that it runs circles around much of modern science.
just as alchemy once served as a psycho-physiological laboratory of experimentation for the higher sacred science, so does cosmological economics present a modern, advanced, technological medium capable of serving as a laboratory for the experimentation on mass psychology and subtle thought forms with existence in multiple dimensions, perhaps even transcending the limitations of linear time.
the cyclicity of time and the malleability of past and future to seers beyond the veil has been the domain of sacred science since the beginning of time. financial markets provide the ideal medium to study time, space/time, and multidimensional nature of reality. the following write-up and article links will provide a doorway into a collection of essays that will provide an interesting and entertaining introduction to the subject.
article: the relationship between esoteric cosmology & gann analysisthe implications behind gann's law of vibration require a paradigm shift beyond academic science to a higher system of knowledge which incorporates the mind/matter interaction of being and cosmos.


w.d. gann’s famous may soybeans chart (1947–48). this chart inspired the late dr. jerome baumring to enter into the study of the law of vibration.w.d. gann’s famous may soybeans chart (1947–48). this chart inspired the late dr. jerome baumring to enter into the study of the law of vibration.
cosmological economics is a new and cutting-edge scientific paradigm emerging from an age-old tradition of investigation into universal order, mathematics and natural science. by analyzing systems of ancient and alternative cosmology, the science of cosmological economics seeks to examine potential correlations between such seemingly disconnected events as financial market movements and natural phenomena, like cycles, solar influences, celestial mechanics and the underlying structure of space/time. read our introduction to cosmological economics.
the grandfather of this tradition in modern times is william d. gann, one of the most famous market analysts and traders of all time. in 1909 gann produced a 10,000% return in 1 month under the eye of an auditor and explained in the ticker interview that he accomplished this using the law of vibration.his original theory posited that the financial markets were controlled by mathematical laws which can be used to forecast future price movements through what is essentially a cosmological system based upon late 19th century principles of electromagnetism, aether physics, chemistry, vibrational harmonics, and the forces, laws and cycles of nature, the sun and the solar system. learn about our origins & history.
the scientific theory upon which gann’s system is based is more similar to that of his contemporaries, nikola tesla or john keely, than to academic science both then and now, but with a different application to sociological patterns and mass psychology rather than physics and energy transmission.what is cosmological economics?an introductory overview of the cutting-edge paradigm which integrates the principles of scientific cosmology and solar physics with economic theory to produce powerful applications in financial market analysis and forecasting.
gann’s law of vibration has proved to be the precursor to new technologies and world views far ahead of his time. current research into super-string theory, free energy, chaos theory, solar physics, galactic structure, anti-gravity and quantum mechanics have confirmed numerous insights discovered or used by gann. these theories provide the key to a lost, suppressed, or deeply hidden scientific system of universal order and causation that was known, in part, by both ancient civilizations and alternative researchers over 1000’s of years.
this system illustrates a direct correspondence between the forces and energies of the universe and the physiology and psychology of individuals and masses of humanity. this symbiotic interplay between man and cosmos reveals a more refined and subtle science of unification and interaction than is recognized by the current scientific paradigm.
w.d. gann & the law of vibrationgann was the forefather and most influential figure in the study and development of cosmological economics and technical analysis. we have the best historical and modern-day courses and trading tools derived from his teachings.
later researchers like dr. jerome baumring who is one of the few known experts to have cracked gann's system, updated and extended gann’s theories after discovering wider correlations with dna, molecular and atomic structure, plasma physics, hyperdimensional geometry, toroidal vortex systems, topology and numerical astrophysics. dr. baumring investment centre gann series in the 1980's opened up a new era focused upon the scientific exploration of the basis of gann's law of vibration. baumring's work provides the core foundation and inspiration for the sacred science institute and the institute of  cosmological economics, which is the official home, archive and resource for dr. baumring's work and teachings.gann harmony: the theories & teachings of dr. jerome baumringan introduction to jerry's breakthrough research, school and teachings, which revolutionized the field of gann research and cosmological economics, having been the first to crack the scientific system behind the law of vibration.
with baumring's untimely passing in 1992, his approach to gann research was pursued by a number of old and new students, but it was dr. lorrie bennett  who managed to next penetrate the veils and secrets hidden in gann's work. dr. bennett was fortunate to have baumring's course manuals, lectures notes and reference works for her two decade long study of the subject. and it is dr. bennett that we now have to thank for reviving the baumring approach to gann analysis and bringing it new life and new discoveries though her 4 volume series on the law of vibration, our premier educational program here at ice.our premier course series: dr. lorrie bennett's law of vibration seriesdr. lorrie bennett's 4 volume gann series unravels the scientific foundations of w. d. gann's law of vibration, by the patterns, numbers, planets, and geometry. our most advanced and comprehensive educational program.

t. g. butaney








t. g. butaney, a famous indian astrologer, wrote 3 books on astrological financial market forecasting and horse racing prediction.  
his books were judged "the best money minting books on speculation and racing by readers all over the world", and explain market forecasting, race astrology & numerology and handicap formulae.

the gann pyramid, square of nine essentials. by daniel t. ferrera. a groundbreaking course on the square of nine, gann's most mysterious calculator. 
this course explains the essence of this fascinating tool and its useful principles, with detailed expositions of key applications to the market. gann's most secret and powerful trading tool!








law of vibration








the law of vibration 4 volume series by dr. lorrie bennett on gann analysis explains the scientific foundations behind w.d. gann's forecasting system, the law of vibration. dr. bennett is the first person since dr. baumring to solve much of the puzzle left behind by gann! v1-patterns, v2-numbers, v3-planets, v4-geometry.








gann theory








w.d. ganns original work is a critical element for any gann researcher, but many find ganns deeper work challenging without help from well-seasoned analysts and traders.  
we offer valuable secondary works presenting and developing ganns ideas: the best teachers in this field are not so much competitors, but fellow contributors to ongoing research.










long term investing








the time window is a main consideration when investing.
position trading methods will be of importance to the long term investor because he will want to know when to expect his greatest returns, and when to exit or hedge his position. 
much of ganns work focuses on long term market movements, as he always tried to see the big picture. 











market timing








the two fundamental elements of reality are space and time, and of the markets price and time.  
gann always said that time is the most important variable.  
if you know exactly when to place your trades, when the market will turn, top, bottom, react or breakout, you will be able to trade or invest with great precision. 










the square








the square: quantitative analysis of financial price structure by catalin plapcianu develops the science behind gann's squaring of price and time. proves that financial markets are mathematically controlled and predictable. a deep insight into gann and baumring's deepest system which tracks energy through the space/time matrix.








hermetics








the wisdom teachings of the egyptian "thoth" (the greek hermes) were preserved in the hermetic arcana, translated from greek by ficino during the renaissance.
these trace back to the likes of pythagoras and solon (socrates teacher), filtering through many channels to become the basis of western philosophy, science and esoteric traditions.  










sacred geometry








sacred geometry explores natural order representing foundational templates of the cosmos, via special proportions like "phi",  the divine proportion, ubiquitous throughout nature as a primary generating and ordering principle.
musical harmonic ratios dominate sacred geometry, showing how nature is a form of frozen music.   









yoga








yoga is an indian system of human development with many branches and schools.  
the word yoga means "yoke", as in yoking a horse to a carriage, and yoga gives methods for man to link himself to the divine.  
yogic systems include laya yoga, bhakti yoga, raja yoga, jnana yoga, kriya yoga and karma yoga.









art








in ancient times, art was more than a form of entertainment or decoration, being a means of preserving various forms and levels of knowledge, including scientific principles.  
a core element is called "the canon", whereby through ratio, proportion, shape and symbolism, an entire system of universal knowledge can be encoded and preserved.
