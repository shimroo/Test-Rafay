raising standards inspiring trust...

the association of british investigators


the information commissioner’s office (ico) has approved the abi uk gdpr code of conduct (under article 40 of the uk gdpr) that provides guidelines and standards for gdpr compliance in the field of investigations and litigation support. click here for information about the code. by choosing support services that adhere to and are audited to this code, clients can ensure that their service providers demonstrate the necessary data protection standards.

the law society of england and wales works with the abi. our accredited members provide litigation support, process serving, and investigative services to the legal profession. with members across the globe, the abi provides an extensive network of professional investigators, ensuring quality and accountability.

your own compliance rules may demand that investigators you use are ‘accredited’. the sector is unregulated  and so the association of british investigators fills the void through its strict membership criteria and code of ethics and behaviour.

working with the law society
the abi is the only professional body in this industry to be working with the law society of england and wales.
the highest independent professional bodies for solicitors put their trust in us.
we're confident you can do the same.
the abi's other partners also recognise the value of affiliation with the principal professional body in the investigation and litigation support sectors.
the ico-approved abi uk gdpr code of conduct for investigative and litigation support services affords the abi  the ultimate sector-specific accreditation, offering three key opportunities, each with unique advantages:

a best practice guide.
a voluntary membership scheme for professional investigators.
specialised sector-specific data protection training.

trust and respect must be earned, not claimed through a sense of entitlement.
