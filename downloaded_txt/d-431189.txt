you will 
need java (free download) to get some of the scripts working on this page but 
it's perfectly safe (honest) on this web:-)
 
my
      name is gary roberts & i was born in 1956. i live in a small village
      near swindon in wiltshire (england) originally i intended this site just
      for friends & family but i thought i'd open it up. this is my first attempt at
      a web page (started late 2001) & hopefully it will improve as i go along. it's evolving
      shall we say so check back when you can. as you can see
      from the picture (and picture gallery) i'm a wheel chair user due to an accident on my motorcycle
      on june 9th 2000 which would change my life forever. i'm left as a c3-4
      incomplete tetraplegic/quadriplegic. 
check
      out links on the left for more details & other stuff.
i
  obviously consider myself very unlucky but at the same time also pretty lucky
  compared to others. for instance i'm married to heather (26 yrs now) &
  have two big lads 21 & 19. i live in a single level house (bungalow) which 
we had before my accident & it's fine & i can get by with help from my
  wife. i have had a lot of support from family & friends which i believe is 
really important and also vitally i've received compensation. also importantly i work full time as a senior technical support engineer/team 
leader
  (hardware) for a large computer company & have done since 1983. this really helps
  motivate me & gives me some self worth. i'm fully supported in working from
  home, & got myself a digital camera & digital movie camera now & along with the web stuff they are
  my hobbies. 
i'm hoping
that my experiences will help others & perhaps motivate some as i've sunk as
low as you can get and now feel much more positive. i guess the most important
motto is 'don't give up'  



   


i'm always looking 
for good info or links so let me know and i'll publish.
