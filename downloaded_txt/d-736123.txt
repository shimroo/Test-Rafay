oldest meadery in wisconsin established 1996








white winter winery has been creating hand crafted meads for over twenty years here in iron river. bayfield county, wisconsin is famous for its fruits that thrive on the unique climate created by lake superior. we even have an apple festival to celebrate the end of our growing season. locally grown blueberries, cherries, strawberries, blackberries, pears and, of course, many varieties of apples are what make our meads so special. white winter prides itself on not only crafting meads that have been winning awards year after year, we are pleased to help our local economy.
