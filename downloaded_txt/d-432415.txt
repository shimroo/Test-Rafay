wilno is the oldest polish settlement in canada and is also known as canada's kashub heartland.




























the area was initially settled in 1859 by polish immigrants arriving from the kashubian region of poland.  over a century and a half, these
                                            strong-willed people and their descendants have laboured and thrived in this still distinctly kashubian region of canada.
                                             the wilno heritage society applauds the efforts made by these pioneers and commemorates and celebrates canada's unique polish kashub cultural heritage
