wood grips 


 

is devoted to manufacturing handgun grips from the most beautiful
wood in existence.  the cocobolo is 
a very rare species of hardwood sourced from a specific region in the
pacific coastal hills of central america.  the 
cocobolo
is highly figured and displays contrasting colors ranging from reddish/orange to
deep burgundy.

the ivorywood is sourced from brazil & is carefully 
selected for its off-white coloration, similar in appearance to actual ivory, 
hence the name given to the wood.  our walnut comes from the sacramento 
valley of california.


beautiful
figured wood grips can do more to improve the appearance of a pistol than any
other after market accessory.  the
aesthetics of fine handgun grips are very important but they must also feel
right.  
our
1911, ruger and browning grips are made to a design which provides a comfortable feel and control
ergonomics which yield better results when shooting.
