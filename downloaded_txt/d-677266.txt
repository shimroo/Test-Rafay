the tracking project 















bringing the pieces together again.® 
















the tracking project was originally founded in 1986 to work with traditional native elders and community educators from numerous cultures to design a series of teachings which connect individuals – especially young people – directly to the natural world. 
the project’s programs of natural and cultural awareness include a wide range of skills – from traditional tracking and survival skills to music, storytelling, dance, peacemaking and martial arts training. 
the name arts of life® was chosen to describe these programs, which emphasize indigenous knowledge, the lessons of nature and the power of dreams and art.
