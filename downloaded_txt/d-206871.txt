civil servant, and educated at dulwich college.

earn his living as a journalist and storywriter, writing the 'by the way'
column in the old globe. he also contributed a series of school stories to
a magazine for boys, the captain, in one of which psmith made his first
appearance. going to america before the first world war, he sold a serial
to the saturday evening post, and for the next twenty-five years almost all
his books appeared first in this magazine. he was part-author and writer of
the lyrics of musical comedies, including kissing time
 an enormously popular and prolific writer, he produced about
100 books. in jeeves, the ever resourceful 'gentleman's personal
gentleman', and the good-hearted young blunderer bertie wooster, he created
two of the best-known and best-loved characters in twentieth century
literature. their exploits, first collected in carry on, jeeves,
were chronicled in fourteen books, and have been repeatedly adapted for
television, radio and the stage. wodehouse also created many other comic

numerous members of the drones club. he was part-author and writer of
fifteen straight plays and 250 lyrics for some 30 musical comedies. the
times hailed him as a 'comic genius recognized in his lifetime as a
classic and an old master of farce'.


p. g. wodehouse said, 'i believe there are two ways of writing novels. one
is mine, making a sort of musical comedy without music and ignoring real
life altogether; the other is going right deep down into life and not
caring a damn � '

created a knight of the british empire in the 1975 new year's honours list.
