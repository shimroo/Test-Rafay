hello. we are so glad that you have found our site! here's a little bit about us. clay city pottery is one of the few family potteries still making traditional stoneware. the pottery was started in 1885 by beryl griffith, an english-welsh pottery. since then, the business has been passed down by generation to generation, now ran by the 6th generation, justin lewicki. you will find him in the back, working hard to produce the pottery that so many of you have loved for years! also at the shop is his sister, ashley lewicki, whom you will most likely see in our retail store, or on the other end of the phone when you call our store! even with today's modern equipment, many of the processes in making pottery conjure up the images of days gone by. the way the clay is worked, and the kiln is fired has changed very little since the beginning. modernization has come slowly and each generation has contributed its own values while preserving it's heritage. the original griffith family way of making the glazes, processing the local clay, and producing utilitarian stoneware is still in use today. we now use a method of forming the stoneware called "jiggering." it was adopted around 1900 and involves quite a bit of hands on work while preserving the look of our traditional wares. our stoneware is kiln fired for about 72 hours at 2300 degrees, which makes our stoneware very durable! it is also, microwave, oven, and dishwasher safe. one big thing, our glaze is lead free, which makes it safe for all foods!Â  our stoneware looks great on your shelf, but is even better for cooking and baking! you can serve up cornbread, chicken casserole, or home bakes pies just like grandma used to make.
