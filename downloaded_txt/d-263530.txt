the kidney stone center of the rocky mountains, the first local provider of lithotripsy, has been serving denver and the colorado front range since 1986. we utilize 60 referring urologists and a staff of 30 treating urologists. we are one of the few kidney stone facilities in the united states to employ multiple machine technologies. we optimize your treatment by matching your therapy to the best equipment available, affording you the greatest opportunity for a successful result.
as far as we know, we are the only kidney stone facility in the united states to use a second opinion requirement. this practice guarantees your case is reviewed by at least two urologists, ensuring the quality and appropriateness of your care. though we maintain high standards of review we can treat appropriate cases within 48 hours.
since our inception we have helped in excess of 25,000 patients while treating more than 30,000 kidney stones. our center has worked in cooperation with the university of colorado urology residents program and has trained over 30 physicians in the art of lithotripsy. we routinely engage in basic research and contribute to the current medical literature, thus helping to improve the quality of care for all patients.
