tips on keeping your watch water resistant
 take off your water-resistant watch prior to showering or washing dishes. soap reduces the surface tension of water and increases the chances the water can get past the seals. once a year, have your watch's water resistance checked and have any bad seals/gaskets replaced. if you notice condensation under the crystal or on the dial of the watch, take it to a watchmaker immediately. if your watch has a screwdown crown, make sure it is screwed down before swimming of getting it wet. always rinse your watch in tap water after swimming in chlorinated water or in the sea.

											what are some tips for quartz watches?
									 	

operating a quartz (battery) watch
 if the watch is not going to be worn for a long period of time, stop the movement by pulling the crown out to time setting position. this will stop the watch and preserve the battery. have the battery checked every two years by a competent watchmaker. when the battery is changed, have the watchmaker insure the watch is pressure-tight to withstand dust and moisture if the second hand starts advancing in four-second increments, the battery needs to be replaced. watches will run another 1-4 weeks when the battery is low.

											can i change the date at any time?  no, here's why...
									 	

setting the date on mechanical watches
 never change the date manually when the hour hand is about the 9 and 3.. adjusting the date with the quick-set can damage the movement in this position. never wind the hands back beyond the 12-midnight position, this can damage the movement. some watches with complex movements and/or features require special care; please check the instructions that came with the watch.

											how do you use an automatic watch?
									 	

operating an automatic watch
with a new watch, wear it every day for at least two weeks.
wind the watch first, and then set the hands with the crown.wind an automatic watch 30 to 40 times to power the main spring. this helps guarantee optimum torque.if you wear the watch daily, and only take it off at night, there should be no need to wind the watch.
note: many watches have a screwdown crown that must be released.
