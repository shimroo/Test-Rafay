            oakland "streets eats" street food festival

we decided to head over to the oakland "street eats" street food festival yesterday, not sure what we'd find.  it was way better than we anticipated.  we'd never been to jack london square, and it was a very pleasant spot; right on the water, sunny, live band playing. but the food was the star.  we tried gerard's paella, which we have been wanting to try for a long time.  it was truly delicious.  although we thought it would have been even better with a little spice added, we recognize that when you are cooking in a pan that easily feeds 100 people, you have to season to the lowest common denominator.my great find of the day was laloo's goat milk ice cream.  since ronin is allergic to dairy from cow's and i am breastfeeding, i haven't had any ice cream in about 7 month.  i was so happy to see this stand!  i didn't even know that goat milk ice cream existed.  also, it was surprisingly un-goaty.  i was expecting a little tang, based on my experience with goat cheese.  what i got was a lovely, deep chocolate, not-tangy-at-all, super creamy ice cream.  yum.another great moment was when we happened upon a tasting stand for little bug, a locally grown, organic, baby food company.  even ronin got to taste something at this festival: peaches!  giao and i also tasted the fig baby food and it was tasty.  since i find it much more economical (and easy) to make my own baby food, i probably won't be purchasing any in the near future.  however, if i were going to purchase baby food, this would be on the top of my list.i think giao took some pictures and we'll try to get those posted later.labels: event

            pineapple jerky!?!

we love jerky--any kind of jerky.  but we'd never heard of fruit jerky before.  we recently tried a product called "pineapple jerky".   we weren't sure what to expect since we've only ever had jerky that was derived from an animal, not a plant.  essentially, it turned out to be dried pineapple, but without all of the added sugar and crap you find in most commercial dried fruit.  this pineapple jerky was more like the essence of pineapple, but without the mess of a fresh pineapple.  it was nice and tart and not cloying at all.  and delightfully chewy.  it was pretty darn tasty.  i'd eat it again.  in fact, i demolished all the samples in about 5 minutes.jerky.com also sells regular beef and turkey jerky.  but what i really want to try next are their more interesting jerkys, like venison, elk, buffalo, ostrich and...wait for it...bacon jerky.  man, bacon jerky just sounds amazing.(full disclosure: we were sent free samples from jerky.com.) labels: product review

            baby hiatus

we had a baby and the blog has been taking a backseat, and probably will for a while.  but we'll be back at some point.

            fabulous meal at chez panisse cafe, berkeley, ca

my family was in town for the holidays and we thought it would be fun to go to chez panisse.  although i called a month in advance (and they only take reservations one month in advance), by the time i called they were all booked on the days we could come for the restaurant, so we made a reservation in the cafe instead.  the cafe was still delicious and everyone really enjoyed their meals.  when all was said and done, including drinks, the bill was about 15 per person.blood orange, fennel and olive saladthis was simple and delicious.  the sweetness of the oranges truly complemented the anise notes of the fennel and the bright, dill infused, dressing was an inspired addition.serrano ham and cheese pizzetanot sure why this was labeled in the diminutive form, because it was quite large for an appetizer.  anyhow, it was very good.  chez panisse has some of the best pizza outside of new york, complete with a crispy thin crust.stuffed squid in ink sauce with artichoke salad and beetsthe squid were very tender and the sides were interesting and tasty.stinging nettle and ricotta pizzathis was another tasty pizza, with a super crispy crust.  for some reason, despite falling into a nettle patch as a child, i'm always drawn to eating nettles.chocolate ganache tart with whipped cream and pistachiothis was super chocolately and very rich.  it should have been served with more whipped cream.ratings:food:    2decor:    3service:    2chez panisse   1517 shattuck avenueberkeley, california  94709 labels: decor: 3, food: 2, nouveau american, restaurant, review, service: 2

            miso udon with beef

thirty-nine cent packages of instant udon are a great thing to have around.  for this quick meal, i simply made a quick miso soup, then added the instant udon and sliced of leftover grilled tri-tip.  this week i seem to be reinventing leftovers all over the place.labels: beef, dinner recipes, homemade, japanese, noodles, soup

            upscale mexican at maya, san francisco, ca

i'd been to maya once before and hadn't been tempted to go back.  but it's close to my work and i went with a coworker.  it was a bit better than i remembered, but still quite expensive for mexican food.guacamole $9the guacamole was tasty, if a bit salty.  it didn't stop us from eating it all, though.skirt steak torta $13once i took 1/2 the bread off, this was a tasty sandwich, although, it necessitated being eaten with a knife and fork.  the fried potatoes were surprisingly tasty.ratings:food: 1decor: 1service: 1maya303 2nd streetsan francisco, ca 94107labels: decor: 1, food: 1, mexican, restaurant, review, service: 1

            pretty good thai at osha, san francisco, ca

after some football watching at the bar, we headed to osha next door for a quick meal before going home.spring rolls $9these were just ok.  the wrapper was a bit thick.spicy catfish $16this was a tad sweet, but overall, very tasty.shrimp paste fried rice $12this is better at the tenderloin location.  for some reason at this location they add frozen peas and carrots, which is just weird.ratings:food: 1decor: 2service: 1osha thai149 2nd st.san francisco, ca 94105labels: decor: 2, food: 1, restaurant, review, service: 1

            pasta with lamb ragu and cucumber-tomato salad

this was a quick meal that reinvented some leftover lamb stew.  alexis simply reheated the lamb stew and tossed it with some pasta.  the salad was simply cucumbers and tomatoes, tossed with a homemade vinaigrette.labels: dinner recipes, homemade, lamb, pasta, salad
