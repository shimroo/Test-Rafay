welcome to blue 

                                            ridge georgia real estate. 

                                            the city of blue ridge, ga is located 

                                            about 90 minutes north of atlanta, 

                                            georgia, in the blue ridge mountains. 

                                            we are east of ellijay and west of 

                                            blairsville in georgia and south of 

                                            murphy, north carolina. at the heart 

                                            of our town you will find lake 

                                            blue ridge, one of the most pristine 

                                            lakes in the blue ridge mountains. the lake was built 

                                            by tva and provides excellent spring 

                                            and summer activities. 
blue ridge is the “gateway 

                                            to the blue ridge mountains.” 

                                            from this point north and east, you 

                                            will find amazing homesites with long 

                                            range, year round mountain views. 

                                            you also will find that most of the 

                                            real estate here is “green” 

                                            – the area is not built up and 

                                            crowded. the reason? about half of 

                                            the land here lies within the chattahoochee 

                                            national forest.
