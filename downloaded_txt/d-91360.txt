chicken ranch
located in pahrump, nevada, and known as "the las vegas brothel" since it's the closest brothel to las vegas clocking in at a little over an hour drive from the strip.
the brothel has 17 rooms, outdoor pool, indoor and outdoor hot tubs, and bungalow with upgrade rooms. the bungalow which sits in the back yard has 3 themed bungalows, with a state of the art dungeon for those bdsm fans.
the leghorn bar is connected to the chicken ranch with it's own separate entrance. it has a fully stocked bar, pool table, sun room, and merchandise for sale. they have everything from caps, to bar keys, to official zippo lighters. you'll be sure to see some of the beautiful ladies girls lingering around there. they have a big tv behind the bar with the ladies who are there scrolling across it. you can choose your lady from there and they'll bring her up. this works for men who are a bit timid about a lineup.
the chicken ranch does not have the ladies in the bar when patrons are there. only if you request them. however, they have parties in their bar about once per month where all of the ladies are hanging around and having fun.

nevada brothel faq
			






							are nevada brothels really legal?

whereas most u.s. states prohibit prostitution entirely, the silver state takes an unusual approach in regulating it. under state statute, counties whose population doesn't exceed 700,000 residents are permitted to license brothels, which a handful do. guidelines for these establishments, whom must adhere to rigorous health and safety protocols, ensure both workers and patrons are protected in controlled settings. the system, while controversial to some, has been operating thus since the early 1970s - though interestingly, the largest counties like clark (home to las vegas) prohibit it. inspections occur regularly, with the facilities needing to meet exacting standards set forth by state regulators who monitors compliance. despite common misconception, it isn't legal everywhere in nevada; rather, only in specific counties meeting certain demographic criteria.




							how old do you have to be to work or visit a nevada brothel?
						

according to state regulations the law is 18 years or older to visit or work in a nevada brothel. however, in nye county, the closest brothels to las vegas, which include: the chicken ranch, alien cathouse, and sheri’s ranch, the age is 21 years old. remember to bring your license if coming from las vegas! the chicken ranch and sheri's ranch are 1 hour away from the las vegas strip. it's confirmed that both brothels have id scanning software.



							how much is sex in a nevada brothel

						

it varies, not only from brothel to brothel, but from lady to lady. most of the time, the ladies working there are independent contractors and set their own rates based on time and activity. most won't give you rates over email and you generally can't talk to them on the phone. your best bet is to visit the brothel and go into negotiations. if you don't come to an agreement with your chosen girl ask to speak to another. again, they all set their own rates. if you'd like to learn more, we wrote a blog post about it.




							do i have to do a lineup?

it depends on the brothel as most operate differently. some will allow you to sit in the bar and enjoy some drinks. others want you to speak to one of the ladies, still others may insist you doing a lineup. we'd recommend contacting the brothel beforehand and asking them.



							what is the best nevada brothel?

great question! we get it so much, we wrote a complete blog post about it.
