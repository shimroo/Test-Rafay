i don't want this to be a big deal but this blog has reached its end.  the reasons are selfish and my own and i don't really feel that i can or really need to explain it.fear not, i will still be joining jayt on a weekly basis for real men wear pink so you can find me there and i'll still be reading, commenting, listening to y'all.  i want to say a huge thanks to everyone i've gotten email from, comments from, chatted with, and met through this...experiment.  also special thanks to those who have donated to the blog/podcast, to vj for the amazing new banner and podcast artwork, and to the person who purchased the domain name, thekrebscycle.com, for me.  it is so much appreciated.its been great connecting with everyone and please feel free to correspond with me via email or via aim.   take care, don't forget to vote, be yourself, think for yourself, reflect, progress, speak up, speak out, scream, and dream.

today was mostly spent shopping and doing errands while my mom was in town.  she's been here many times and has seen everything of note in the city, which is substantial but still limited.  therefore we had a very nice day of reading, talking, cooking, and eating.  we also rented some movies.earlier in the day my mother was talking about how my brother's partner designed the set for the previously off-broadway - soon to be on broadway production of "grey gardens."  brad had seen the documentary some time ago with a group but i decided to stay in that night.  my mother had never seen it and was extremely curious about it. we headed over to premiere video, one of the most comprehensive video stores my mother has ever seen which is a feat to accomplish since she is a new yorker and is impressed by almost nothing outside of the city limits save for parts of europe.  we picked up the movie and also transamerica.transamerica was a cute movie, next.  grey gardens was phenomenal!filmed in 1975, its a documentary about two women, a mother and a daughter, living in an old run down mansion in the hamptons named, grey gardens.  these aren't just ordinary women, they are the aunt and cousin to jacqueline lee bouvier onassis and once part of new york society.  but that is hardly what is extraordinary about them.  they have since lost their fortune, lost some of their minds,  and are left with only the house, grey gardens.  the mother and daughter primarily live on the patio of their beach home and in a single bedroom.  at one point in the movie one of the many cats living in the house with them is relieving itself behind a portrait of the mother when she was young and bejeweled as a member of the upper echelons of the hampton set.  her reply to the act, "well i'm glad somebody is doing what they want around here."  as much as their lives appear putrid there is beauty an depth of experience to be had.  i can't capture the film in words so all i can say is please rent it and watch it for yourself. i found a "remix" of some scenes from the movie on youtube:

one year ago today i took a stand.the boss that i walked out on one year ago once told me "pressure makes diamonds."  yeah it does...and i cut her good.  today is my blogoversary.  thanks for a great year everybody.  speaking to you and reading what y'all have to say is my favorite hobby.  thank you so much for reading, listening and participating.  enough sappy shit.gomo art. peaches new album is fantastic.  check it out.  thanks for the recommendation kalvin.i don't remember it being this hot when i was a kid.  i think being gay is having an adverse effect on my blog popularity.  i'm thinking of playing it straight so i can have more mass appeal.  i'm in an extremely stable relationship and all but i think if i were perceived as straight to pre pubescent  girls i think i could really make something of myself.  if you were in my position you'd do the same thing right?  i can always have the gay thing to fall back on if it doesn't work out.
