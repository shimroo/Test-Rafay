† if you require support the best place to ask a question, request support, or give feedback is at the dban help forum. we prefer to give dban support in a public forum so that the conversation is archived and other people can benefit from the outcome. by asking a smart question in the public forum you positively contribute to the dban project and help other people. you can also browse outstanding bugs and feature requests at the dban issue tracker.

 
 
 
 




while dban is free to use, there’s no guarantee your data is completely sanitized across the entire drive. it cannot detect or erase ssds and does not provide a certificate of data removal for auditing purposes or regulatory compliance. hardware support (e.g. no raid dismantling), customer support and software updates are not available using dban.

if you are an enterprise that needs to erase data from ssds or requires a certificate of erasure for compliance purposes, request your free blancco drive eraser trial for enterprise organizations.
