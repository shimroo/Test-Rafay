webinar: glp-1 weight loss drugs and their impact on value-based care




on-demand
learn more

a panel of distinguished experts discussed the potential future role of glp-1 weight loss drugs in delivering value-based care.
a group of drugs known as glucagon-like peptides 1 (glp-1) were originally developed to better manage diabetes. but glp-1 drugs such as ozempic, mounjaro and wegovy have more recently been used to combat obesity, with some users reporting weight loss of 60 pounds or more that remains permanent so long as they continue taking the medication. a study released by the manufacturer of wegovy also concluded that using the drug for weight loss reduces the risk of serious cardiovascular episodes by about 20%. manufacturers are also formulating new glp-1s that may be even more effective in achieving dramatic and permanent weight loss.

that begs the question: will these drugs play a role in value-based care for patients with chronic conditions such as obesity, or will the cost of glp-1s take such a proposition off the table? faculty: angela fitch, m.d., julie balter and emma hoo
