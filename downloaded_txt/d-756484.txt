who we are
beginnings 








leon lotzkar started this company in 1912 based on a simple philosophy: be honest, be fair, work hard, and treat your customers well. stick to that belief and business will look after itself.
we have continued to adhere to this philosophy over the past century and look forward to maintaining it well into the next century. some things must never change. this is our commitment to you. 






origins
pacific metals recycling international has been in the lotzkar family for four generations since its inception. founded in 1912 by the late, leon lotzkar. pacific metals has since changed hands twice from father to son.











the original vision
leon lotzkar started pacific metals with a vision, knowing the value and potential of scrap metals. when leon retired, his son, joe, 
            successfully managed pacific metals and became a well-respected spokesperson for recycling, habitat and wildlife conservation. today mark and other 
            members of the family have carried on the tradition and work in similar recycling and environmental fields.
          






today's vision
mark lotzkar is the third generation president & ceo of pacific metals recycling international. continuing his family legacy, 
            he is sensitive to the needs of both customers and suppliers, and supportive of environmental issues. educated and experienced in business management, 
            mark is the director of nascoop, the trade association buying co-operative of the institute of scrap recycling industries (isri). 
          








the legacy continues
a fourth generation of lotzkars is now nearly ready to receive the pacific metals torch, and carry on a proud family tradition.
