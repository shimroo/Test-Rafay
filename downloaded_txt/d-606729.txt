advent is a time of hope in the darkness
	
	i wonder if one reason so many people experience 'holiday blues' is that the culturally dominant holiday calendar is all feasts and no fasts. even funerals, in the us today, have often been entirely replaced by 'celebrations of life'—an attempt to chase away the sadness, rather than experience it. historically, advent was a season for fasting when christians might mourn for the broken state of the world and pray for christ to come quickly to set all things to right. today, many churches (at least the american protestant ones with which i'm most familiar) begin singing festive christmas hymns from...

descartes, cudworth, and god
	
	ren. cartefius, (though otherwise an acute philosopher) was here no less childish, in affirming, that all things whatsoever, even the natures of good and evil, and all truth and falsehood, do so depend upon the arbitrary will and power of god, as that if he had pleased, twice two should not have been four, nor the three angles of a plain triangle, equal to two right ones, and the like...than which, no paradox of any old philosopher, was ever more absurd and irrational: and certainly if any one did desire, to perswade the world, that cartesius, notwithstanding all his pretences...

some confusions about early modern deism
	
	today, 'deism' is often characterized in terms of an image of god as an absent watchmaker—a designer, usually conceived in fairly anthropomorphic terms, who set the world going and walked away, not only never intervening in history but also not caring about us and how we live our lives. this conception often informs discussions about religion in the american founding, the french revolution, etc., as well as discussions in philosophy. however, this is not how deism was understood in the 17th and 18th centuries. in the first place, the definition of 'deism' is, in a slogan, the sufficiency of natural...

xunzi and le guin on ritual and social structure
	
	the fate of man lies with heaven; the fate of the nation lies in ritual. xunzi, "a discussion of heaven," tr. watson "solitude" is my favorite of all of ursula le guin's works (mild spoilers to follow), and i have often assigned it to students together with xunzi and wittgenstein on ritual. the story is about an anthropological investigation into the planet eleven-soro. the investigation is stymied by the local system of taboos, which includes a taboo on adults teaching one another. one anthropologist, a woman named leaf, decides that the only solution is to move in with her son,...

philosophy and science fiction, unit 1: rights and wrongs
	
	as i mentioned last time, i'll be teaching philosophy and science fiction this fall, for the first time in 8 years or so. the general theme will be personhood, and i've been crowdsourcing suggestions for science fiction to include. i'll be posting results here. at the end of each of the four units, students will be asked to give a philosophical analysis/critique of a work of science fiction that addresses a particular philosophical question. the task for unit 1 is to analyze a work of science fiction that involves an apparent conflict between a plausible moral rule (e.g., respect for...

philosophical themes in the 'homo superior' trope in science fiction
	
	i am currently preparing a course on philosophy and science fiction for the fall, focusing on the theme of personhood. it has been 8 years since i last taught a course on this topic, so i am re-designing it more or less from scratch, and i recently asked on social media for suggestions of scifi works to include. i'll be doing some more of that and posting the reading list and additional suggested reading here over the rest of the summer. this post, however, is about some neat stuff that i probably won't manage to squeeze onto my syllabus (this...

zagzebski and cuneo on religious communities
	
	in her book epistemic authority, linda zagzebski defends a view on which epistemic authority (the right to be believed) is very closely analogous to practical authority (the right to be obeyed). according to zagzebski, both are justified by my conscientious judgment that i am more likely to achieve my goals (including the goal of believing the truth) if i trust the authority than if i go off on my own. in justifying authority within small communities, zagzebski (pp. 144-148) uses the example of a community dedicated to a particular skill or way of life. i might participate in an orchestra,...

apophaticism and religious pluralism
	
	many world religions include some tendency toward, or tradition of, apophaticism, the view that the divine (or ultimate, or absolute, the object of our religious devotion) defies description in human language, and we must therefore restrict ourselves to saying what the divine is not. however, most of these religions are also committed to texts or traditions which appear to describe the divine in various positive ways. puzzles arise when we attempt to combine these traditions of negative (or apophatic) theology and positive (or kataphatic) theology. if we can speak truly of god only by negation, what are we to make...

a good friday reflection
	
	in reading the good friday narrative, it is important to see ourselves in the characters, who are not monsters but people like us. i am thinking today of the way the characters are driven by fear. pilate, herod, and the temple elites are adversaries who have achieved a kind of uneasy peace. they all see that if that peace is broken, it will be disaster. if there is civil unrest, the army will come, they will all be removed from their positions, and many, many people will die. they see jesus' questioning of the fragile status quo—and some more drastic...

a brief reflection on the history of apophaticism
	
	apophaticism is the view that affirmative statements about god cannot be both literal and univocal. 'literal' is here opposed to 'metaphorical'. (how precisely to spell out that opposition is a rather difficult question that i won't pursue here—i will just assume we have some kind of grasp of the concept of metaphor.) 'univocal' means that the word has the same meaning when applied to god as in its other uses. so, for instance, to say that 'wise' is used univocally in 'god is wise' would be to say that it has the same meaning in this sentence as in the...

reflections on the science fiction of poul anderson
	
	poul anderson's science fiction is, in my opinion, not so uniformly excellent as theodore sturgeon or ursula le guin. however, he produced some real masterpieces (the 1972 novelette "goat song"—a futuristic retelling of the myth of orpheus, with a computer in the role of the god—being my favorite) and he pioneered several major tropes of the 'space opera' sub-genre, as well as the "time police" trope. the majority of his stories are simply fun adventures. one of the most striking and interesting things about anderson's work for me is the way his image of the future differs from many other...
