mount sinai downtown: bringing the future of care to lower manhattan


for more than a decade, mount sinai has been modernizing, enhancing, and transforming care to best serve our downtown manhattan communities. mount sinai’s vision for care downtown is based on the idea that today care can be delivered to anyone, anywhere, at any time. that’s why we are creating an advanced, flexible, outpatient-based, community-connected model of care that is, most importantly, supported by mount sinai’s world-leading hospitals, ambulatory practices, and institutes and centers of excellence. 
to accomplish this, mount sinai has invested more than $600 million to upgrade and build state-of-the-art facilities below 34th street. and we are just getting started. in creating a more modern, accessible health care platform, we have brought the unparalleled expertise and dedication of mount sinai’s medical teams closer to the residents of lower manhattan.
today, more than 600 mount sinai physicians practice downtown, offering over 30 medical and surgical specialties across 20 centers. high-quality, comprehensive care is available throughout lower manhattan. from cancer care to urgent care, from behavioral health to specialized ambulatory surgeries: no matter the need, mount sinai can bring the care to you.
we are proudly changing how we deliver care to keep our patients healthy, out of the hospital, and in their community by providing an interconnected network of services, physicians, and care centers closer to where they live and work.
update on mount sinai beth israel: as part of our ongoing transformation downtown, mount sinai plans to close the hospital on 16th street. in july 2024, the new york state department of health (doh) approved our closure plan, and we are currently awaiting a court decision to proceed with closing the hospital.
in the meantime, the 16th street hospital remains open. we will update everyone as we learn more from the court system and will continue to work with the doh and to communicate with our staff and patients as things progress. 
for more information, please visit our closure plan for 16th street:
