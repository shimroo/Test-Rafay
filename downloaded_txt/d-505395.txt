when pastors work too much

16 january 2025


        workaholism in pastors is a form of spiritual dysfunction. it's also deeply rooted in the life and work of pastors and the expectations of many churches. "dysfunction in the name of jesus: confronting the idol of pastoral workaholism" is a new book, edited by seminary professor and pastor james ellis iii, releasing early in 2025. in this conversation he unpacks the roots of workaholism and how pastors and churches can work together to keep everyone healthier.

"religion" as a polluted word

09 january 2025


        what does it mean for words like "religion" to become "polluted"? how does it happen, and can they be cleaned up and made usable again? scholars sam reimer (crandall university) and galen watts (university of waterloo) reflect on the questions which led them to research and co-write an article on these topics.

          what our affiliates have to say
        





christian reformed church in north america
darren roorda, former canadian ministries director

    "affiliation with the efc is an important part of our ministry posture in the christian reformed church. it demonstrates to the local churches of our faith stream that the cause of christ is a mission we share together with other traditions nearby to us. it is also a demonstration to the world of the uniting power of god's love for those who are called to express that love in places ranging from church basements to the towers of parliament."
(crcna.org)

  





crandall university
dr. bruce fawcett, president & vice chancellor

    "we have deeply appreciated the benefits of our affiliation with the efc. we have enjoyed efc resource staff who have spoken to faculty, staff and students on our campus, and have served as advisors via email and phone on other occasions. i have personally enjoyed the connections made with other ministry leaders through the efc's annual presidents' day gatherings. i also deeply appreciate the role that the efc has had in giving birth to what is now known as christian higher education canada - an association which has been an excellent source of fellowship and encouragement for our university. the vision and insights provided by the efc have been a wonderful gift to the canadian church!"   
(www.crandallu.ca)
  





outreach canada
craig kraft, executive director

    “i am thankful for the evangelical fellowship of canada and for their outstanding resources. many of their booklets and resources on canadian issues have been well read in our office. the efc is our own private guardian. they stand up with us and for us when we can not do it by ourselves. we are blessed to have them acting and interceding on our behalf. their helpful team of experts is always just a phone call or email away.”   
(www.outreach.ca)

  





toronto christian community church
jonathan chan, senior pastor

    "the efc proves to be an important kingdom partner. they help us to champion an evangelical engagement relevant to the canadian context. as our country becomes more and more secular, a vital evangelical voice that is loud and clear is much needed. the theological resource and pastoral guidelines are very helpful, and they always come out in a timely manner." (tccc.ca)
