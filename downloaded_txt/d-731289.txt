liberty oil & propanetestimonialseveryone is so nice and helpful. we recently moved into a house that was completely empty, i put in an order and they said it wouldn't be delivered until monday. i called and explained we just move in and had no hot water or heat, they squeezed me in the next day. they came out and made sure everything was good before filling the tank. i will definitely order again and again. amazing company!!!!!! - tracee m.good oil company; i think they were under rated previously because the customers were not paying attention to their oil levels, which is a customer responsibility. - john p.we switched to liberty oil a couple years ago when the company we were dealing with refused to deliver because our vent pipe was 1 1/4 inch wide and they changed their policy to 1 1/2 inch. liberty was happy to come out. they have been great to deal with very reliable. - gary f.delivery guy was very nice and respectful of property. delivered in a timely manner. the only thing i didn't like is that i should get a call half hour prior to showing up just to make sure i'm home. - cassandra o.honestly i can’t thank troy enough! in a time where a different propane company screwed me and my family with a 5 year old and 8 month old. troy and his crew are placing two tanks of propane! very good on price and willing to bend over backwards for there customer. thank you so much! - gaige a.my experience was great from the first call to the delivery. the delivery guy was very friendly. the price of oil was better then some other places. what i liked the most was the inspection of the oil tank. thanks for a job well done. - sandy l.so thankful to liberty oil!
a broken fuel gauge left me without oil on the coldest night of the year. the company i was with for 2 years refused to do anything to help me, so i called liberty and they were at my house within a few hours to deliver! the staff is super helpful , and the prices are great. i have found my new oil company for sure! - kelsey h.i've been using liberty oil for a few years now and highly recommend them. they have the best oil prices, the friendliest deliverymen, and always deliver on schedule. they have never failed me, and i'm a customer for life! thank you, liberty! - patricia c.they bend over backwards to help you when you need help and deliver quick when you need oil. the girls in the port carbon office are awesome with customer service. great job guys! - debbie z.amazing customer service!!! seamless automatic delivery. no fuss, no crazy requirements (like needing your social security number!!) and service with a smile. if' you're not happy with your current fuel delivery vendor, give troy in lehighton a call. you will not be sorry. you get what you pay for!! - kaycee g.excellent customer service and pricing. exceeded expectations by having oil delivery sooner then 7 other places. - brad t.i received my oil yesterday morning. i always know when it’s coming because someone from the office always reaches out and lets me know. that is so well appreciated. i know not to be parked in the way or have anything near the fill up location. i also appreciate when i order, that they will ask me if i can make it until the delivery! if there is a problem, i know they will come sooner. i had run out of oil accidentally one time and they came over to fill me up and prime my tank that day. that is great service. very friendly service from the office to the drivers. i am so glad i do my business with liberty oil! thank you all very much and i hope you have a great day!! - jody c.
