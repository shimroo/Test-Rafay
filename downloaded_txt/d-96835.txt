say what!
“as the track slicked up, we 
				got a little better, some of that in lapped traffic was just 
				about having a little bit of knowledge of ocala speedway, which 
				paid off. i’ve got a lot of laps around here and i’ve been 
				coming here for a lot of years. there are some things you can 
				get away with in lapped traffic, and i was able to use some of 
				that. sometimes getting to be the old guy pays off every once in 
				a while.” justin grant winning ocala fl usac sprints
“it's just chess, i’m trying 
				different stuff, and he knows i’m going to do something 
				different. he’s guessing and anticipating what i’m going to do. 
				that’s just about going against a good racecar driver who is 
				tough to defend on restarts. none of the cautions i really 
				wanted to see. i was just nervous about the tires. i could feel 
				how hard we were running on them. when you’re running on a big 
				track like that, it’s super hard on them. then to have a yellow 
				where they cool off, shrink a bunch and move all the air, 
				cautions make it even worse for tires for sure.” logan seavey 
				winning volusia fl usac sprints
“there at the beginning, the 
				car was just great, i felt like i was struggling there at the 
				end and i didn’t know where to go. a caution when you’re coming 
				to the checkered is like the most terrible thing ever, but we 
				got it done and we’re pretty excited to chalk this one up. i’ve 
				never won here before and it’s a big 1/2-mile. people say i 
				can’t run 1/2-miles. i think we proved them wrong a little bit 
				tonight.” kyle cummins winning volusia fl usac sprints
