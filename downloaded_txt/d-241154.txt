established in 1906










currently owned by lisa and jeff cirace, v. cirace & son, inc. was established in 1906 in boston’s historic north end, the oldest italian community in america. their grandparents vincenza and ernesto immigrated from salerno, italy located at the base of the amalfi coast. the business began as a wholesale, retail grocery, dry goods, and tobacco shop.












after prohibition the family business was granted the first liquor license in the city of boston. their dad ernest, a suffolk law school graduate and a world war ii vet, joined the family business and focused his attention on fine wine and spirits. in 1953, ernest established cive importing company as an importer and distributor of fine italian wine and spirits.












at an early age, jeff cirace grew up with the intention of joining his father in business and began his career in 1973. his sister lisa followed in her brother’s footsteps and joined the company in 1977. both jeff and lisa had the great fortune to work together with their dad for a period of time prior to his passing. they’ve gained the knowledge and passion of the family business but more importantly the tradition of their family, culture, and heritage.





today, jeff and lisa work together importing fine italian wine, spirits,  and specialties while continuing to represent over 119 years of family tradition.call 617-227-3193 to place your order for curbside pick up or email info@vcirace.com. we offer free delivery in the north end and waterfront for minimum orders over  $75.00. we wish all our customers, neighbors, and friends a happy and healthy holiday season. the cirace family & staff“please drink responsibly. don’t drink and drive.” life is too precious”.monday - saturday10 am. - 7 pm.
