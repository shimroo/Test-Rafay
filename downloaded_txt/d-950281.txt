hey! you’re that guy!





so, after flipping past hollywood palms, hi-life, sleep with me, kicking & screaming & other good ones, you were up late watching men at work, a ski school or two, miserable beach or summer school for the millionth time and thought  “hey. that guy – wonder what he’s doing.?
after figuring oot that i’m not a former politician in idaho a canadian record exec or a guy in australia who keeps trying to use the same gmail account as mine, you found yourself here.
enjoy. there’s new stuff. old stuff. and stuff you never knew aboot. enjoy. that’s all i aks of you.
