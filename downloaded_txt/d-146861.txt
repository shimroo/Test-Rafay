what 
														makes york products

spring steel 
															rake heads 
															are stronger, resist 
															bending and have 
															greater flexibility, 
															critical attributes 
															to performance & 
															durability.



heat treated 
															alloy steel rake 
															teeth 
															wear better and 
															resist bending or 
															breaking. yorkï¿½s own 
															proprietary, in 
															house process for 
															forging rake teeth 
															insures the utmost quality in 
															our landscape 
															equipment.



easy 
															maintenance 
															allows you to change 
															individual rake 
															teeth without 
															dismantling all or 
															part of rake. remove 
															the bolt holding the 
															tooth you want to 
															replace, loosen a 
															couple of bolts to 
															either side of it, 
															pull out the old and 
															insert the new. 
															replace and 
															retighten the bolts.



reduced set 
															up time. 
															all of our rake 
															sections are shipped 
															fully assembled, not

															frames and rakes, 
															built to last a 
															lifetime. stronger 
															also means they can 
															handle optional 
															attachments, 
															eliminating the need 
															for additional 
															pieces of equipment 
															on the job site.



add optional 
															attachments, 
															grader blade and 
															scarifier to a york 
															rake. replace your 
															other rake, rear 
															blade, spring tooth 
															harrow and box 
															scraper with a 
															single unit. a fully 
															equipped york rake 
															is like a swiss army 
															knife for 
															landscaping, the 
															most versatile 
															landscaping tool on 
															the market.
