tl; dr: follow us on bluesky and/or mastodon.  help us to build a progressive online community on platforms not beholden to trump.

these first few weeks have been intense and difficult, but we’re finding and raising our voices, and while it may not seem like it has mattered much, it will soon.   
one key battle will be over raising the debt limit.  the current debt limit has already been reached and the “extraordinary measures” the treasury department is using to avoid default will soon be exhausted.  (former treasury secretary janet yellen estimated those measures would extend the time to default to march 14, 2025.)  if we can rally our senators and representatives to stand together and stand strong, we may be able to block or roll back some of trump’s more egregious excesses.
to organize effectively we need to coordinate, and to coordinate we need to communicate.  our “ask” in this email is to follow our new accounts on bluesky and/or mastodon
for years, we’ve all used legacy social media networks, such as twitter/x and the meta platforms (e.g., facebook, instagram, more recently threads) to stay connected.  we’ve watched with concern as musk turned x into a private fiefdom where conspiracy theories and hate thrive, and more recently as zuckerberg bent the knee by gutting content moderation and calling for more “masculine” whatever in workplaces.  sad!
many progressives are leaving x and the meta platforms.  for now, our plan is to build up our connections on bluesky and mastodon as we migrate to those platforms for our primary social media presence.  we will no longer make new posts on x – find us instead on bluesky.  we will continue to post content on meta platforms as we cross post and build up a following on mastodon.  we will post less on meta and rely more on bluesky and mastodon as we are able to build our community there.
we hope not to leave anyone behind.  if you haven’t checked out bluesky or mastodon, please give them a try.  and don’t forget to follow us and to like and comment on our posts.  it’s how we build a community online.
