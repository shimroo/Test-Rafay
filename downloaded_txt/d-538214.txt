connect & proctorio: online assessment integrity









mcgraw hill partners with proctorio to provide remote proctoring and browser-locking capabilities within connect. this connect platform tool provides more control of the assessment or homework environment by enabling security options and verifying each studentâs identity.
proctorioâsâ customizable, secure exam settings, recording options, and live id verification allow institutions to set up unscheduled, on-demand proctoring specific to their assessment needs. proctorio ensures fairness for test-takers by increasing accountability, securing exam content, deterring cheating, and promoting a culture of integrity while improving learning outcomes.

aleksâ® math & chemistry remote proctoring









aleks course product integrates respondus browser-locking capabilities and respondus monitor webcam technology to ensure assessment integrity online.
browser-locking capabilities prevent students from accessing other applications, copying, printing, or visiting other websites during an aleks exam or knowledge check. respondus monitor is a "remote proctoring" companion application for browser-locking capabilities that uses webcam and video technology to record students and deter cheating when live proctoring is not an option.
