to our loyal customers:
   on may 1, 2014, the last remaining vehicles in our inventory were sold.
       
   although the car sales division of our business has come to an end, and 
we anticipate selling the property,
 it is  our plan to continue on servicing your vehicles at a new location.

glenn is now working with jack sassin 
at route 18 gas & service at 4227 acushnet ave.
 glenn brings not only his service expertise, but much of our shop diagnostic 
equipment.
 we look forward to servicing your vehicles at this new location. 
 glenn can still be reached at 508-999-3213 as it now rings at rt. 18 gas 
& service.
 hope to see you there!


   please allow us to thank each an every one of you, our customers, 
who  made our dad 'sam,'
   and the giammalvo brand, such a well known success story for over 50 years. 
       
   we could not have accomplished this without you!
