acura integra wheel lock instructions 




acura oem wheel locks are made by mcgard, but be careful, you cannot buy locks for your acura outside of the oem sku. also, the factoy acura lugs are special, and only the factory wheel locks work. wheel locks are important for any acura car because these wheels fit a wide range of honda and acura cars, older and newer and are high in demand. especially the wheels found on aspec and type-s cars. another to note is that some models of acuras do not come. withthe lug wrench, you need to buy the tool to remove the original lugnuts and install the wheel locks. what we used: lug wrench: https://amzn.to/4avrslw * wheel locks: https://amzn.to/4b5pk1c * * amazon affiliate links
