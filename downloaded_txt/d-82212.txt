        our company was founded in 1904, by martin dorrenbach in isselburg, in the lower 
        rhein valley of germany. by the 1930's, the son-in-law and horticulturist, 
        hermann holtkamp, sr.  bred his first saintpaulias on only one 
        square meter (10.76 square feet) of greenhouse space. 
         at the 
        time, mr. holtkamp said that the african violet would be the potted plant 
        of the future.
our company grew many different crops, later to be replaced, 
    one by one, by the african violet.in the 1960s we introduced the first non-dropping varieties capable of shipping while in bloom. in the 70s we expanded the color range and disease-resistance of violets, and in the 80s we partnered with nasa to send african violet seeds to space!

        
optimara products are backed by a uniquely energetic marketing and distribution program 
          that makes our plants as easy to sell as they are to grow. in the design 
          of all optimara packaging and store display materials we focus on easy 
          set-up and low maintenance. for example, our new qwick covers can extend the store-life of our plants by 2 to 4 weeks. 
   
            
            at optimara we know that our responsibility for our products does not stop 
            after the sale. we maintain extensive online resources to provide consumers 
            with valuable plant care information.
from the most popular african violet in the world, to contemporary exotics and a complete line of
             consumer plant care products, optimara has what it takes to make your plant sales grow.

                greenhouses. 



optimara's history of innovation
        one of the most exciting 
        breakthroughs in the research and development of the african violet was in 
        the early 1960's, with the introduction of the first non-dropping variety 
        called elfriede. today all of optimara varieties and most all other competitive 
        varieties available on the market have this essential genetic characteristic. 

        in 1961, the name of the company was changed from dorrenbach-holtkamp greenhouses 
        to hermann holtkamp, kg. in 1977, holtkamp greenhouses was founded in 
        nashville, tennessee, and the optimara brand name was introduced to the american 
        consumer. 

        in 1981, we started with optiflora, a plant care product line also under the optimara brand name. in 1992, the company in the usa 
        began growing miniature poinsettias. 
        over the  years, the company 
        has added elatior begonias, rex begonias, many varieties of ferns and exotic foliage 
        plants to our product line. in the future, we hope to add even more items 
        which will give the company new and exciting opportunities in delivering 
        a 
        diverse product line to the consumer into the 21st century.
