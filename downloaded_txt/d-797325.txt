     “i arrived at wca a blank page, without an established chant, or any real understand of the impressive scope of the auction industry. i left with a toolbox full of useful information and contacts with a deep passion for the industry. thank you to nick, the instructors, and my classmates for an exceptional educational experience!” glenn wiens halbrite, sk      “this has been the most humbling yet exhilarating experience of my auction career. the wealth of knowledge passed along by the world class instructors was simply amazing. it was incredible to not just simply be in the presence of some of these world class bid callers, but they instruct in a manner that lets you know they genuinely care about your success. there is not a single person in the auction profession i wouldn't recommend this course to. thank you so much for the experience.” cody peterson avon, sd.      “what a week!!  wca and its instructors were absolutely amazing!  i think my classmates along with myself were challenged to the max from day 1.  wca teaches so much more than just bid calling.  i'm leaving with the tools and knowledge to start an auction business in any industry i choose!” josh kuenster glenhaven, wi.      “wca is a great way to learn about auctions. it's hard at times, and the instructors pull your inner self-confidence out and teach you that anything is possible. ” dave leu issaquah, wa      “i've been planning on coming here since i was about 8. glad i finally did it! great school, great classmates, and great instructors!” colter klemm powell, wy      “one of the most intense but rewarding experiences of my life.” corin canen glendive, mt       “great course, i would recommend it to everyone and anyone. since i've come here i have realized that this is what i want to do and i have a strong passion for it. i told some family and friends this was hands down one of the best decisions i've ever made.” trey ulmer mobridge, sd.      “all of the instructors on the team are extremely professional. the support & kind criticism that came from everyone has been extremely helpful in making my chant strong and making my 20-year-old dream come true. these people are some of the most professional people i have had the pleasure of knowing and working with.” clinton twitchell wellington, ut       “i came to wca with no prior bid calling experience & i was not sure what to expect. i could not possibly see how i was going to be able to sell items at auction. after this course i am confident i can conduct my own auction. the instructors are knowledgeable & able to personalize the instructions as required to fit each individual.” logan hopp rosemary, ab   “each day spent at wca was jam-packed with incredible instructors, each adding their own helpful advice. our time here was well spent, each day teaching us just how far our minds could stretch.” juliana sullivan clovis, ca
