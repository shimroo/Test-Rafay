celebrating families, building traditions.... all in one place.  focusing on products that you and your family will grow with... not grow out of.  products that children can enjoy alone, parents can enjoy with their children, and grandparents can enjoy with their grandchildren.






with this note, niagara hobby & craft mart has closed its doors after nearing thirty-two years located in the town of cheektowaga, new york.
we wish to thank our employees- many of whom began with us as high school students and continued with us through, and sometimes past, their college and university years; our suppliers- manufacturers and wholesalers for ensuring that we had the products we needed; those organizations throughout western new york that permitted us to support their good work; and our customers, whose transactions made possible our journey.  perhaps, you may see us again.**
