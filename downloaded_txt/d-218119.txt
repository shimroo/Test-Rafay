        welcome to dynacorn international llc the muscle car people.



            since
            1984, dynacorn international llc has been supplying the classic muscle
            car enthusiast with quality sheet metal, bright trim and molding for
            restorations or for just plain making a ride look its best. as we
            blasted through the 80s, 90s and now the 2000s, one thing stands
            above all else.
        

            the quality and fit of our restoration quality
            parts is unsurpassed. the dynacorn parts of 2012 have no relatives from
            bygone days. our tooling is new and crisp, the steel we use is the very
            best available on the market and the craftmanship is beyond
            good...it is superior.
