welcome to sea experience, padi career development center (cdc) located in the bahia mar resort, on the beach in sunny fort lauderdale, fl. if you are serious about a career in scuba diving, there is no need to look any further.

my name is bill cole and along with several of my staff, we have been training people for careers in diving for over 35 years at the bahia mar resort location in fort lauderdale, fl.
if you are looking to have the best experience on your way to becoming an instructor, we are here for you. if you are looking for the highest quality scuba career training, you have come to the right place.
we pride ourselves on providing a true career curriculum that has launched thousands of people on their path to a life changing career in the scuba diving industry.
all our facilities are in one convenient location, on the beach and on the intracoastal waterway at the bahia mar resort location in fort lauderdale, fl.
for many years, we have been at the forefront of padi scuba career training. we are not an instructor mill that has training starting every week or two. we are focused on full careers in scuba.
our staff were first to develop and introduce the padi resort operations specialist program in the world. it is a trademarked program that has been copied many times. but there is only one original and that can only be taken at sea experience.
sea experience also offers a job placement program to get you out there and living the dream yourself. you can even start the process before you arrive!
we have been successful because we have a great staff, solid curriculum, a terrific location, and training that evolves with time and the needs of our industry.
sea experience is a padi 5 star career development center. we are licensed by the commission for independent education, through the florida department of education as required by law. this license is required for all florida dive centers conducting instructor level training and sending students to an instructor evaluation. this ensures that your training is provided by a facility that meets the strictest standards not only required by padi, but also by the state of florida. 
we are also approved for va educational benefits.
sea experience is approved and a current vendor for florida vocational rehabilitation benefits. additionally, we have worked with numerous states vocational rehab departments.
the scuba industry knowledge that you absorb along with the experience and expertise you gain from your professional scuba courses will set you on the road to a fun, fulfilling and most of all a successful career in the scuba diving industry.
come and visit us! we always welcome on-site visits. go diving, immerse yourself in the wonderful world of scuba. if you are not a diver yet, we welcome you to ride on our diving boat. meet our staff and students on board. take a tour of our facility. give us a call to set up an appointment.
