exceptional  customer service 






















			after years of using cheaper, more popular models that consistently broke and required replacement parts, we bit the bullet and got a fleet of kay’s 4 seat pedal boats. it has been the best investment we’ve made at our waterfront, ever.  the kay pedal boats are indestructible floating army tanks of fun, and they even look good!
