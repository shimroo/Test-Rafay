testimonials



“i am just going to keep this real and wonderful. we found this oasis over 20 years ago and immediately became members. from the moment we stepped on grounds we were welcomed and treated respectfully. there is so much to do; volleyball, pickleball, ping pong, pool, dancing...i don't even know the half of it. we have met lifelong friends here and can't wait for each visit. i not only recommend this gem with 5 stars, i highly recommend everyone come out and look for themselves. we love our sports and friends. that is our focus, but, it is also a sanctuary for the body, mind and soul; did i mention yoga? yes, there is yoga there too. i could continue with all the fabulous amenities offered, but the list of fun and extraordinary just goes on.”-cat m.




“wanted to play pickleball on a weekend trip and glen eden popped up on the google search. we'd never been to a nudist resort before but decided to give it a go. playing pickleball in the nude might be my new favorite way to play. we sat in the shade and enjoyed lunch from the cafe overlooking the pool. played a game of pool and swam a couple times during our stay. there was also a live band that added to the ambiance of the pool area. first time with social nudity and i was shocked how comfortable it was. everyone there is super friendly.”-landon d.
