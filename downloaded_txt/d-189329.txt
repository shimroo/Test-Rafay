experience key west
take the last exit of the florida turnpike. roll down your windows and smell the salty ocean air.there's just a special feeling once you leave the mainland in the rear view mirror and hit the overseas highway! take your time, only 42 more bridges until you see that famous mile 0 sign and get your daily dose of vitamin sea! the florida keys coral cay archipelago chain is unlike any other natural geological formation in the country.  the traffic slows down, the people get friendlier, change out that business casual attire for sandals and a tank top! youâre on "keys time"!
