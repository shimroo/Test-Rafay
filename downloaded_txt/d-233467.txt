we acknowledge that what we call alberta is the traditional and ancestral territory of many peoples, presently subject to treaties 6, 7, and 8. namely: the blackfoot confederacy – kainai, piikani, and siksika – the cree, dene, saulteaux, nakota sioux, stoney nakoda, and the tsuu t’ina nation and the métis people of alberta. this includes the métis settlements and the six regions of the métis nation of alberta within the historical northwest metis homeland. we acknowledge the many first nations, métis and inuit who have lived in and cared for these lands for generations.
