infospot transmitter operate without a license? the infospot th.5 transmitter is fcc-certified (id #dlb5ltt98) and approved for broadcasting under part 15.219 of fcc rules, which allow unlicensed operation of a certified 100mw am transmitter without a license as long as the antenna + ground does not exceed 3 meters. see: 15.219 - operation in the band 510-1705 khz.  what are the fcc rules governing use of infospot?unlicensed broadcasting:  these are the regulations that apply to operators who want to broadcast without a license on the am band. these regulations outline the technical details regarding field strength, power, and transmitter frequency accuracy, and permitted spurious emission limits. the original and full texts of these various sections are below, however, the most pertinent regulations for most part 15 broadcasters include . . . 15.209 - radiated emission limits15.219 - operation in the band 510-1705 khz15.221 - operation in the band 525-1705 khz.licensed:  part 90.242 of the rules of the federal communications commission governs the licensing and operation of travelers information stations (tis). see also tis faqs.  is there a way to broadcast with more signal coverage?yes, if you have an outdoor antenna. the same fcc rules contained in part 15.219 govern use of both indoor and outdoor antennas. but an outdoor antenna and especially one mounted high above the ground will yield more range. the new range extender provides a way for you to do this. the range extender may be purchased with a new talking house transmitter system or added to an existing talking house transmitter system. consider also the infospot system, which can include the i a.m. radio option, the range extender option and other ancillary options, such as message players and weatherproof cabinets. yes, if you are an educational institution. special provisions were enacted by the fcc in 1990 that allow unlicensed broadcasting of an am signal that remains contained within the campus or grounds of the institution. no content, antenna, or output-power restrictions are enforced, and no license is required under fcc rules part 15.221. see also extended range. yes, if you are a governmental agency and/or if you provide emergency medical response. see fcc rules part 90.242 which govern this form of broadcasting under travelers information stations. up to 10 watts of power are allowed, and a license is required. see also extended range.  when i connect my infospot transmitter to the range extender outdoor antenna and tuner, is the coaxial cable between them considered part of the ground lead? it is not. the fcc certified the infospot transmitter for operation with the interconnecting coaxial cable to its outdoor antenna and tuner as a complete system. any length of coaxial cable may connect the transmitter with the antenna and tuner, because the cable itself is not part of the antenna system. the infospot transmitter is also certified to operate on its own with a 3-meter wire (indoor) antenna. why haven't you come out with a fm version of the infospot system? the fcc rules for unlicensed fm broadcasting under fcc part 15 limit the range of fm systems to just a few feet. but under the corresponding am rules, you can produce a â¼ to â½ mile signal. that is partly because the fm rules include a signal intensity limitation that keeps the signals contained within100 feet. to make matters worse, due to the much shorter wavelength, fm signals are more easily blocked and fade more quickly. in addition, the fm band is much more congested than the am band, making an unused / quiet fm channel very difficult to find.the legal range of am non-licensed transmitter signals is not as severely restricted as fm, because am transmitters enjoy a 5000:1 power advantage over their fm counterparts. even accounting for the lower antenna efficiency, legal am transmitters have a typical range of up to 2500 feet depending on the antenna mounting height and location. see "the legal range of fm non-licensed transmitter signals," a whitepaper by paul dobosz, 2020.    aboutproductsresourcesservicessearchescontact usall products at a
