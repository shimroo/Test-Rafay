nord west drift boats









nordwest composites to close









after twenty two years in business, i am retiring.
i started nord west composites in 1997 following two campaigns of world class sailing with the french america's cup team. i brought my racing sailboat designer credentials into drift boat manufacturing and created a never seen before inward gunwale drift boat. the result was a sleek looking boat and the inward gunwale reduced the effects of the wind.
the reputation of my business is rated 5 out of 5 stars on google. i thank my customers for their support.
if you are interested, i am selling the molds and plans for this drift boat business. this would be an easy way to start your own business with a limited amount of cash.
the available inventory includes:

nordwest yellowstone model mold with outward gunwale.
nordwest yellowstone model mold with inward gunwale.
nordwest bighorn model mold with inward gunwale low profile.
all accessories molds (seats, storage, bench,etc...)
blue print for custom fit trailer.
trailer jigs.
