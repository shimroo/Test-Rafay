the 6 most popular types of carports




the 6 most popular types of carports
popular carport design options

over the years, most people have spent either from their savings or credit cards on a car. cars depreciate rather than appreciate, hence the need for good maintenance from the user. but despite the owners’ many efforts, cars get damaged all the same. high winds can damage and corrode paint. apart from this, rain, tree sap, sun, bird droppings, and debris can shatter the windshield. happily, though, a carport can provide a cost-effective way to shelter your vehicle while also keeping it cool on hot days and saving you time on icy mornings.
what is a carport?
a carport is a semi-covered structure usually supported by steel supports and has a fabric or steel roof. carports have roof coverings, but the sides are usually open, and they do not have doors like a garage. any outdoor space can benefit from the addition of a carport. interestingly, these low-maintenance open-style structures are the perfect addition to any outdoor space. some carports can be attached to a house, garage, or any other structure. according to our local carport builder, an attached carport is a great option for individuals who have a garage but need more space for other vehicles. carports are useful all year. they can withstand natural erosion as well as some of the harshest weather conditions. carports don’t only protect cars, but they can also serve other purposes, such as functioning as a patio area
most common carport types

1. gable roof
the roof of a gable carport has two slanting sides and a gable at each end. this style of carport, when properly designed and constructed, will appear to be a natural extension of your home. a gable roof carport is also called a pitched roof because of its unique blend of historic elegance and clean aesthetics. it is the most popular carport style. structure-wise, it has a triangular shape, with each corner bending downwards. it works well in locations with heavy rain or snowfall. this is the most popular type of carports and dwellings in general. some of the materials used are slate shingles, asphalt, and wood shake. the normal roof pitch is 15 degrees but can be adjusted to other degrees like 10 degrees, 20 degrees, and 26 degrees.
2. the dutch gable
this type is a regular gable roof with parapets. dutch gable carports are wonderful for heritage and colonial buildings, and they are also an excellent choice for an outdoor entertaining area. under this robust, shaded patio, you can welcome all of your family and friends while keeping them safe from the sun and rain.
3. skillion carports
skillion roof top garages are a solitary, level sheet. however, in contrast to level surfaces, they are constantly worked at a point – this takes into consideration water run-off. it is a rooftop pitch that permits you to catch the sun’s beams efficiently. the skillion rooftop is exceptionally helpful to work with because it utilizes a solitary sheet; hence, it is simple to construct. contrasted with gable roof carports and hip roofs, it additionally utilizes fewer materials, making it an efficient financial savvy choice. this carport uses just one board, so smaller ranges are conceivable than with a gable roof carport. you can likewise change the pitch and height of your parking space.
4. flat roof carports
your garage ought not just to shield your vehicle from the sun, downpour, and other destructive components. instead, it needs to likewise assist with improving the outside perspective on your home. the building allure of flat roof carports increases the value of your property. ordinarily, a flat roof carport will not require extra support outside of the standard casing. hence, it remains outwardly perfect and open. you’ll likewise observe that flat roof carports are steadier and a lot more straightforward to access than more slanted garages. since they are level, they are easier to clean. not only is a flat roof carport easy to keep up with, but it also has a calculated rooftop pitch that allows leaves and other garbage to move off and not build up on the surface. 
5. freestanding carports
freestanding carports are the cheapest, simplest, and quickest carport type. because attached carports pose significant concerns, freestanding carport is a popular choice among most homeowners. with an open-sided carport, the casing is assembled and finished off with a rooftop. this will assist with shielding your vehicle from sun harm, downpour, and hail. however, it may not shield it from extremely hazardous or savage storms. an open-sided carport is a superb choice when you need something modest and speedy that will do with next to no additional ornamentations.
6. hip roof carports
a square hip roof has a pyramid shape. however, you can use a rectangle hip roof with two triangular and two trapezoidal sides on carports. a hip roof has four faces and a flat top on a rectangular plan. they are symmetrical around the center lines since they are always the same pitch or slope. the standard pitch of a hip roof carport is 22 degrees, although it can be ‘customized’ to be steeper. a continuous level fascia is common on hip roof carports as it allows you to fit a gutter all the way around. hip roofs are intrinsically more secure than gable roofs since they don’t have big, flat, or slab-sided ends to catch the wind. in comparison to a gable roof carport, a hip roof carport is self-bracing and requires less diagonal bracing. gable roof carports are not as well adapted to strong wind or cyclonic locations as hip roof carports are. 





queensland deck building regulations




queensland deck building regulations
requirements for decks construction in brisbane

before you proceed to build the deck you have always dreamed of, you must check to make sure it complies with queensland deck building regulations. this is so that you can build according to the best practices and avoid potential future problems.
before building the deck, you must check out key facts about your property, including the lot size overlays, zoning, and neighborhood plans.
approvals 
planning approval for decks 
you don’t necessarily need the local council’s planning approval to build a deck. nonetheless, you still need planning approval. however, not necessarily from the local council. you can use the professional services of no1 decks brisbane for seamless and easy deck planning approvals. 
in case you decide to do-it-yourself, you need to send the deck plans to the certifier and wait for approval or rejection. so, yes. you need planning approval for decks. if your property is not in the character residential zone, you won’t need the council’s approval.
building approvals 
building approval is different from planning approval. according to the queensland act 1975, a building approval is required for the construction a deck, balcony, or verandah if any of the following applies:

an overall height of more than 2.4m
the floor height is greater than 1m above the natural ground surface
any side longer than 5m
a mean height of more than 2.1m
not freestanding building (attached to another building or structure)

the mean height is the total elevation area of the building divided by the horizontal length of the building. on the other hand, the natural ground surface refers to the finished surface level when the lot was created on the planned survey.

other requirements
 fire protection requirement 
the building code of australia lists the fire protection requirements applied to class 10 buildings. the objective of these requirements is to protect the deck from fire from neighboring properties. although there are various methods to meet the requirements, the commonly applied ones are:

have clearance of at least 900mm between the deck and the boundary
have clearance of at least 900mm between the deck and the house
have a 60/60 fire-rated wall between the deck and the boundary. the wall should be of masonry construction and have no openings.

 adjoining properties
if the proposed deck can potentially impact a neighbor, you must consult with your neighbor before you begin work. this way, you will avoid future conflicts.
roof water disposal 
you must dispose of associated roof water from the deck in a way that won’t create a nuisance to the buildings, structures, and land in the neighborhood. to do this, homeowners should install gutters, storm water pipes, and downpipes. you must also pipe the water to an appropriate discharge channel or drainage system. if possible, to a soakage pit located as far as practicable from the structure.
balustrading requirements
balustrades on deck serve as security from falls and as support when people ascend and descend the stairs. hence, the balustrades must be sturdy to withstand the expected forces. homeowners must install balustrades of at least one meter in height where people can fall one meter or more from the deck to the floor. the openings between the balustrade rails must also not be greater than 125mm. plus, they must be constructed to withstand reasonable force.

stair requirements 
the stair treads must have an anti-slip finish with a non-skid treatment or strip near the edge of the nosing. there should also be a barrier of at least 865mm high above the nosing of the stair tread. apart from this, the stairs must not have an opening greater than 125mm.
termite protection 
builders and homeowners must provide chemical or physical termite management systems to protect the deck from termites. not only this, but the system must be such that termites cannot bypass adjacent structures. in a situation where the deck does not have adequate termite management systems, it must be completely isolated from any adjacent structures.
conclusion 
more than building the deck, you must invest in maintenance. this is because lack of care is the primary cause of deck failure. for example, corrosion or rot, termite attack or water exposure, or poor construction techniques can all be responsible for deck failures. for the best result, let a structural engineer or a licensed builder check out your deck. 





carpet cleaning safety – are your cleaners safe on the job?




carpet cleaning safety – are your cleaners safe on the job?
safety considerations when cleaning carpets

carpet cleaning can be a tough job. however, most people don’t consider it as dangerous as many other household projects. you probably won’t express as much concern for a carpet cleaner as you would with someone climbing scaffolding to paint a tall building or a pest controller getting into tight spaces. regardless, carpet cleaning comes with its risk too. this is why it is important to consider the safety of cleaners on the job.
carpet cleaners typically utilise cleaning solutions that are commonly made from potentially toxic chemicals. some of the ingredients used in cleaning chemicals include acids and solvents. careless exposure to these toxic ingredients can cause serious skin burns and injury to the eyes and nose.
even so-called green cleaning solutions can be toxic. although they have limited environmental impact, they are not totally chemical-free. professional carpet cleaners like no1 carpet cleaning melbourne takes necessary precautions when handling these potentially hazardous chemicals. asides from this, there is also the risk of slipping and falling while working among other possible hazards.  below are legitimate concerns you should not ignore.
protective gear
carpet cleaning technicians need to understand the importance of wearing protective gears. this is because they come in close contact with chemicals when mixing and while working. every year, thousands of cleaning technicians sustain injuries from exposure to toxic chemicals and fumes during cleaning. this is why you should wear protective gears.
protective eyewear: eye injuries is common when working with chemicals without wearing proper protective eye gear. there are different types of protective eye googles designed for different applications. protecting your eyes isn’t about wearing just any googles. there are specific safety standards and regulations regarding the use of protective clothing when handling chemicals and this applies to googles too. do your research properly and select the proper eye gear to ensure your eye is properly protected while working.
generally, non-vented face gear or those with indirect ventilation are more recommended. these types of eye gear offer better protection against chemical splashes than the vented ones while you still get unobstructed view to do your work properly.
gloves & other protective clothing

another piece of protective clothing that carpet cleaning technicians should use is gloves. there are different types of gloves, but be sure to select one that is resistant to acids and solvents that technicians are likely to handle. typically, the manufacturer will specify the chemicals the gloves can efficiently protect your hands against. carpet cleaners should check the chemical resistance guide for the glove they intend to buy and compare it to the safety data sheet of the chemicals they’re likely to be working with.
sizing is another important consideration. correctly-fitted long-sleeve gloves are more recommended. these types of gloves do a better job at protecting the hands since they cover the forearm and not just the hands. you should also consider other physical characteristic of the glove such as flexibility, durability and comfort.
asides gloves, carpet cleaning technicians should also wear other safety gear when working with chemical carpet cleaning solutions. these include chest to toe apron to protect their clothing and skin, and covered foot for the feet from chemical spills.
slip hazards
asides the obvious risk of chemical exposure, there is also the potential for slip hazards to occur.  this can cause slip accidents especially when moving on smooth surfaces like tile flooring. this is a valid concern during carpet cleaning projects. carpet cleaning technicians must therefore wear work shoes. these offer high traction and efficient slip protection.
conclusion
these are some of the important safety considerations for carpet cleaning technicians. as a homeowner that requests carpet cleaning service, you should ensure your technicians follow all of these safety considerations and they have all the right gear before they begin work. professional carpet cleaning technicians are aware of these important safety considerations. if you run a carpet cleaning service, you must ensure that all your cleaners have all the gear they need to prevent injury and liability.
 






understanding building and pest conditions when buying a home




understanding building and pest conditions when buying a home
a quick guide for home buyers

buying a new house can be a daunting proposition for many people. there is so much to go through and understand. perhaps the two biggest things to wrap your head around are the building and pest inspections.
they are two of the most important things for you to understand when buying a property. in this article, we are going to go through the things to look for in your contract when it comes to building and pest inspections.
what are building and pest conditions?
as a condition of the sale of the property, a building and pest clause should exist. this clause allows you to get reports from local exterminators like pest control sydney about the property you are buying. having this report can help identify any issues with the property. they range from things like termites, leaking taps, and even structural damage.
read between the lines of your contract
keep in mind that not all problems with the property can give you the right to end your contract. most of the time it will depend on how the clause is writing and what kinds of problems the property has.
building inspection conditions
a bad example of a building inspection clause is having the wording “structurally sound”. what this means is that you must buy the property unless it has significant structural problems. most of the properties are structurally sound but have other issues like rotten windows and broken plumbing.
a good way to make sure you are properly covered is to take the contract to a conveyancer or solicitor before you sign it. they will act to make sure it protects all your interests.
if you get the inspection report back and it has signaled some defects then having the accepted as satisfactory section gives you the ability to have control over whether you have to go ahead with the purchasing of the property or not.
pest inspection conditions
the clause for pest inspections works the same way as the building inspections. this is because, in an ideal world, you do not want to be forced into buying a property that has pest issues. again you are better off taking the contract to a conveyancer or a solicitor before you sign the contract.
the most important phrase in a clause is “if the report is not to their satisfaction”. this is because this phrase gives you the ability to get out of the contract.

faq’s
when should you walk away from a house?
there is no set timeframe when you should walk away from a potential house buy. it will depend on how much you want the house. as well as how willing you are to make the necessary repairs to it.
are building inspections worth it?
this is essentially a test drive for real estate. it lets you know if the property is worth the asking price or it is it worth buying at all.
conclusion
so hopefully this article gives you a better understanding of building and pest inspections when buying a house. as with anything do your research and never jump into a contract without doing your due diligence.






local pest inspection companies struggling with demand




local pest inspection companies are struggling to keep up with demand

gold coast: in the recent months, gold coast inspection and control businesses have seen a major market boom with demand reaching a record high. local businesses have claimed that the phones have been ringing off the hook. their clients are calling constantly to request appointments all over the area for a number of services.  
 “we have never seen anything like this,” said scott dixon owner of local pest control business, pro pest control gold coast. “it seems that everyday we are making at least a half-a-dozen new appointments.” 
covid impact
 as the coronavirus pandemic rages on and affects economies all over the world, some industries have been suffering more than others. the pest control and inspection industry has actually benefited from the covid-19 crisis for a number of reasons, including: 

as more people stay home more often, they are witnessing the appearance of more pests. 
being at home more often allows residents to better keep track of the state of their property.
local real estate markets have seen an uptick in business since the pandemic began, with many people finally deciding to purchase a home after years of putting it off. this has led to more inspections for pests as new homes are being filled with families.

pest control companies can quickly eliminate any number of pests quickly and efficiently. the success rate of most pest companies is high, with repeated visits to a home rarely ever needed. as winter arrives and more families spend their days indoors. this means more pests will infest homes looking for food and shelter. so gold coast exterminators are about to see an even larger boom in popularity and demand. 
local businesses will continue to reopen as the coronavirus pandemic winds down. as they do, there will be an even stronger need for pest control companies in the gold coast region. businesses that have been shuttered for months if not an entire year will need assistance to make sure every location is as clean as can be. in the last few months, termite, rats, spiders, and other pests have made their home all over the gold coast area. business owners are returning to locations that have new, unwelcome guests that need to be done away with in record time or else it will affect business. 
termites on the rise
termites are of serious concern, especially to residents and business owners on the gold coast. they can create serious property damage in very little time. scheduling regular termite inspections is one of the smartest things a business or home owner can do. without regular inspection, a problem could arise in no time at all and a solution may be out of reach.  
cockroaches, rates, wasps, snakes, and bed bugs are some of the other larger areas of concern for the gold coast. those creatures are known to populate and reproduce quickly and can almost immediately be a serious problem. during the pandemic, all of these pests have seen their population increase greatly. moreover the demand to get rid of them has led to a pest control market boom in recent times. it is a surge in popularity that is sure to only grow in the weeks and months ahead.  
with plenty of experience leading up to this increase in demand, pest inspection businesses are meeting the moment head on and are taking calls for as many appointments as they can make. they remain reliable, punctual, and affordable and have been offering quote after quote as the calls continue to pour in. from apartment complexes to businesses to homes, the gold coast has been keeping the pest control industry busy. the future months for these companies promise to be even more fruitful and exciting.  






what to do if you have asbestos at home?




what to do if you have asbestos at home?
quick guide to asbestos for homeowners

 
as a dangerous health hazard, asbestos is no longer used  since the scientific discovery of its cancer-causing fibers.
if left alone, asbestos itself does not pose any problems. but of course, it won’t be long until you need to work it out. since the materials in your home eventually deteriorates, it will need an update sooner or later.
now, if your home happens to be built between the 1940s and 1970s, the chances of having asbestos on it are higher. and if you accidentally discover asbestos in your home and at worst, you disturb it, you should be quick to respond to avoid aggravating the problem. a professional asbestos removal company based in brisbane has shared some tips when you happen to find an acm within your property.
asbestos in insulation
asbestos is popular for its strength and thermal resistance properties. therefore, finding asbestos in your home most likely means it is in the insulation.
at some point, you will need to update your insulation, hence you need to remove the old one. when dealing with asbestos this way, it is best to inform your insulation contractor and commence proper removal.
insulation contractors will need to prep up the space first to reduce the chances of spreading the fibers further. and of course, they also need to protect themselves from exposure. in the process, you also have to leave your home for quite some time and only return when no fibers are left in the air.
more signs of asbestos
it is not easy to tell upfront if your home has asbestos unless you discover or disturb it. but, aside from being an old structure, these manifestations may tell you something:

check the pipes in your home that does not have insulation. if you see some remnants of old insulation that are gray or white, that could be asbestos.
the flooring tiles that are originally installed in your home are in 9-inch sizes. that is most likely tiles that use asbestos

disturbing asbestos

now, if ever you disturb asbestos accidentally, you have to vacate the premise as soon as you can. although studies show that the cancerous manifestations of asbestos in our bodies will only happen in 10 to 50 years after exposure, you can never be sure if some fibers are already lingering inside your home for quite some time. much like a ticking time bomb that can explode your health anytime.
as a precautionary measure, remove your clothes and seal them in a plastic bag. wash them separately to remove the fibers on the fabric.
then, wash your hair and body thoroughly to get rid of the fibers that are sticking to your skin.
vacate the premise and inform your local state authorities so they can refer your case to the proper department.
asbestos testing
you can also contact a professional insulation contractor so they can check. they will assess the space by getting swabs of different areas and test for asbestos.
after testing positive for asbestos, your insulation contractor will have to remove the remaining fibers thoroughly and clean the area. the process may take some time, or at worst, may require you to abandon the place completely.
testing for asbestos roughly costs $100 to $750, which depends on how many areas in your home you want to test. though it might be an additional cost on your end, this is significantly less than when your health is at stake.
professional asbestos treatment
your insulation contractor might also refer you to a more credible professional to do the work more safely.
there are certified professionals who can do asbestos treatment using the right methods and equipment like industry-grade hepa vacuums. they also need to work with respirators, just like what in those sci-fi movies are donning when they deal with toxic infestations in the post-apocalyptic world.
final thoughts
you see, the presence of asbestos in your home is a serious issue. and you need to act on it as soon as possible. this is to avoid getting ill yourself or spreading the hazard more.
it is best to seek professional help and not deal with the problem yourself. and even if you have not made any discoveries yet but have been living in an old home built around the 1940s and 1970s, the epa recommends testing your home for asbestos. after all, prevention remains better than cure.






queensland cockroach crisis: pest controllers issue warning as temperatures rise




queensland cockroach crisis: pest controllers issue warning as temperatures rise

australia is experiencing some extreme heatwaves, according to sciencealert.com. this reality may not be changing any time soon, and it is a reality that pest control experts fear might bring another unexpected wave: a wave of roaches.
wave of cockroaches
yes, it is true that there may be a wave of roaches approaching. the cockroach population is going to skyrocket by 30 percent according to jimmy whelan at guard pest control an australian pest management company.
the species that homeowners have to worry about are the following:

german cockroach
american cockroach
australian cockroach

the thing that all these roaches have in common is their resilience. they are able to survive through hunger and extreme temperatures, making them especially equipped to continue living through this heatwave.
why are cockroaches rising in population?
both homeowners and business owners have to fear this rise, but some are wondering why it’s even happening in the first place. it would be great to pinpoint one specific reason the roach population is growing so rapidly, but this cannot be done.
nature is a strange and complex phenomenon. experts are pointing to some of the following reasons as to why the cockroach population is growing so quickly in australia:

humid summers create the perfect environment for these creatures to procreate. this summer was especially humid for australia.
rapid breeding seasons from september to june and january through march.
australia’s rich, natural land provides nourishment to these creatures, which also contributes to their growth.


of course, these aren’t all the reasons why these insects are growing so quickly, but they are some of them.
why are cockroaches making their way into homes and businesses?
this is the million-dollar question. if the roach population was growing in australia and stayed outside, most people wouldn’t care so much. the only thing that would change is that birds, rodents, and other mammals would have more of them to hunt in the wild, but the reality is they are eyeing homes and places of businesses.
cockroaches are making their way into homes in alarming and overwhelming ways. why do you suppose this is happening? the following are some reasons that may answer that question:

australia is dealing with one of the worst fires in a long time. this fire is displacing not only people but also insects, such as roaches making their way into homes for safety.
the heatwave that the country is going through also caused a major drought, which is depleting the land of resources. this is another reason roaches are attempting to find resources, homes, and businesses.
many homeowners do not inspect their homes for leaks, holes, cracks, and other entrances that roaches can use to gain access.

 
these are just some reasons why roaches are making their way into homes through jimmy whelan from guard pest control also points out that cockroaches are like any other pest: they need water. this means homeowners and business owners need “moisture meters to assess moisture levels in walls. pests are attracted to moisture and humidity.”

what can you do to protect yourself from this rise? that is another hard question to answer. of course, there isn’t much that can be done to fix the heatwave, and hopefully, the fires are controlled soon enough, but homeowners and business owners can still take active steps to keep their properties safe.
for one, a full inspection is vital to effectively seal the property to prevent these insects from gaining access in the first place.
second of all, it is important that property owners realize that roaches might already have made their way inside. you can never be sure because roaches are excellent at hiding, so you are going to need professional help. having a full pest inspection and making sure this becomes routine should help squash infestations before they become worse.
hopefully, this information helps enlighten australians and helps keep everyone as safe as possible. cockroaches are not only a nuisance, but they also carry bacteria that can cause sicknesses, not to mention allergic reactions in those who are sensitive or have respiratory issues.






brisbane city council sprays for mosquitoes




brisbane city council sprays for mosquitoes – will it help home owners?
council targets mosquito hotspots

the brisbane city council recently set a plan in motion to manage the alarming mosquito population spike in the city and surrounding areas. some entomologists are actually describing it as an invasion with millions of mosquitoes settling in the area in such a short period of time. the plan involves spraying insecticides over the pests’ hotspots as well as their breeding sites. the importance of these drastic measures became evident as millions of mosquitoes moved into the city proving to be quite a nuisance to the residents. the health risks involved also played a major role in motivating the city authorities to commence with the eradication steps. the one question on everyone’s mind however is what this means to homeowners in the region and whether or not it will help.
when did the mosquito problem start?
in order to understand the aim of this project, it is first of all very important to understand what the problem is. brisbane is in all essence a mosquito hub. with the many water bodies, the warm temperatures and occasional heavy rains, mosquitoes have the perfect environment to survive and reproduce. the saltmarsh mosquito in particular is one of the most significant species and is especially drawn to the saltmarsh regions in brisbane after which the species is named.
the mosquito problem is usually exacerbated by changes in weather patterns. in this case, rainy seasons and occasional storms like the recent ones caused an increase in mosquito population. these favorable conditions also prompted the migration of new mosquito species into the area.
will the spraying work?
so back to our question; will the spraying work for homeowners in brisbane? the most likely answer is yes. this is not the first time that the country has waged war on the pesky pests. with their perennial presence, the authorities have had no choice but to carry out these mass eradication projects on a regular basis. therefore if the results of the previous mass sprayings are anything to go by, then this one should be just as effective and subsequently
beneficial to the area’s residents.
3 key benefits that home owners can expect
1. reduced mosquito presence
the pests are not referred to as pesky for gags and laughs with their annoying buzzing and constant presence making them a nuisance to the residents. it therefore goes without saying that one of the main improvements to look forward to is their general absence both indoors and outdoors.
2. reduced risk of mosquito-borne diseases
in addition to being annoying, mosquitoes pose a major threat to human health. many species found in the brisbane area are known biological vectors of different diseases. by getting rid of the pest, the city council will be contributing significantly to the prevention and control of the associated
diseases.
3. it will allow home owners to enjoy professional pest control services
working with professional exterminators is without a doubt a major benefit to homeowners. they possess specific skills, equipment and of course knowledge that gives them an advantage. residents can therefore look forward to more effective eradication, that what they would have handling the problem alone. the council has awarded contracts to several local pest control companies to manage the spraying in mosquito hotspots. local exterminator, nicholas favreau from pro pest control brisbane said “the spraying will definately help the local residents who live in areas prone to mosquito breeding. the humidity from recent rains has really increased the problem in low lying areas, he added.
4. reduced cost of personal pest control
finally, by handling the eradication themselves, the council is saving homeowners in brisbane a lot of money. getting rid of mosquitos at a personal level can be taxing on your financially. you have to invest in nets, window screens, insecticides, mosquito repellants and so much more. the residents therefore have a lot to look forward to with the brisbane city council doing most of the heavy lifting.

is it safe?
another question popping up in relation to this project is whether or not the mass eradication is safe for the environment.
according to the officials involved in the project, the spraying is completely safe. it is reported that since mass spraying was adopted as an eradication strategy for mosquito control, the council only uses environmentally friendly chemicals. these are meant to target both the mosquitoes as well as larva in water without affecting other organisms in the water.
key areas targeted by the spraying project
some parts in brisbane have been affected more than others by the mosquito invasion. as a result, a majority of the council’s efforts have been focused on these areas. they include: brisbane airport, wynnum north, murarrie, hemmant, fisherman island, tingalpa creek, tinchi tamba, norman park
bottom line
in conclusion, there is no denying the fact that this project could not have come at a better time for brisbane homeowners.






brisbane’s building inspection industry rides the wave of property turn over




high property turnover results in win for building inspectors
demand in the building inspection sector

the latest report released by industry analysts bis shrapnel reveal that the brisbane property market is the most lucrative in australia. the june 2014 report, dubbed residential property prospects, shows that brisbaneâ€™s median property price has risen by 8% since january. it now stands at $475,000 which is almost 10% higher than in june 2013. according to bis shrapnelâ€™s projections, this trend is set to continue, with an estimated 17% growth expected in the next three years. (source: news.com.au – read article)
these sentiments are also echoed in the national australia banks june quarter australian residential property survey. the survey report, which was released on 10th july, 2014 reveals that the brisbane residential market is set to have the fastest price growth in australia, within the next one year.
the increasingly high prices are being attributed to increased activity from local buyers in the housing market. there had been a steady decline in local investors since property prices peaked in 2010. this led to a fall in property prices from its peak in 2010 to its lowest point june 2013. around june 2013, local investors seem to realize that the prices had bottomed out. and they began returning, and spending. their spending is leading to housing price increases, and ultimately, more impressive turnover results for the property industry.
the silent heroes
the high turnover rates are resulting in increased demand of building inspection services. the building inspection industry is one of the least well known, yet most vital parts of the property market. building inspectors are the silent heroes in every property deal. no deal goes down without their participation. and at any stage during the transaction process, one word from them can send the deal sideways.
the building inspection industry is responsible for ensuring that the safety of buildings is up to standard. building inspectors are the ones entrusted with the delicate task of ensuring that a building is fit for human use. they check for presence of indicators which can compromise the safety or structural integrity of a building.
what they inspect
among the things which building inspectors look out for in a building are:

termites
wood borers
timber decay
water penetration through walls
subsidence of walls or ceilings
the structural integrity of a building

 
the presence of any of these things shows that a building is unfit for human habitation. as such, it is in the interest of buyers, sellers, contractors and property managers that none of them exists. and it is the role of building inspectors to carry out thorough checks in order to ensure that none of them exists. therefore, they are hired during different stages from a post construction or renovation phase to a sales or purchasing phase.
typical services
a typical property inspector provides a range of services, including:

pest inspection â€“ checking for the presence of pests like termites and borers
handover inspection â€“ after the completion of construction or renovation
pre-sale inspection â€“ on behalf of the seller
pre-purchase inspection â€“ on behalf of a potential buyer
pre-settlement inspection â€“ on behalf of both the buyer and seller

 
the pre-settlement inspection is carried out to ensure that both the buyer and seller agree on the condition of the building. this is to eliminate the scenario where different inspectors hired by each party deliver contradictory assessments â€“ a condition which can later lead to unwanted legal complexities.
how they do it
the way a building inspection is carried out is determined by a number of factors. the most common ones are the size of the building, the purpose of the inspection, the parameters set by the client and the personal style of the inspector. however, irrespective of how it is carried out, the client is usually given a written report detailing the findings of the inspection.
it is also quite rare that a company which offers building inspection services also offers correctional services for any problems found. most of them just carry out the inspection, and submit their findings. in some cases, they can direct a client to a reputable company which can offer fixes for any problems found.
scott mcpherson, who manages pro inspections brisbane, a local building and pest inspection company,â commented “basically, building inspectors play the critical role of verifying the safety and habitability of buildings. as such, they are an important part anyâ building or property purchase transaction. this is the reason why brisbaneâ€™s high property turnover is resulting increased demand for building inspection services.”

looking ahead
brisbaneâ€™s high property turnover is perhaps best epitomized by the june 2014 sale of a high-end property at fig tree pocket. the elegant house sold for $8.25 million in just 20 days. this made it the most expensive property sold in brisbane since 2011. and, although it attracted interest from as far as china and the uk, the property was bought by a local australian family. basically, this deal is the perfect illustration that locals are buying, and turnover is increasing. and, ultimately, the demand for the building inspection industry is also on the rise. based on reports the market will experience steady growth over the coming years which will benefit investors and local businesses servicing the industry.
 






roofing contractors at risk of skin cancer according to recent studies




roofing contractors & construction workers


 
recent studies show outdoor workers and roofing contractors are in high risk areas.
australia has one of the highest cases of skin cancer in the world. according to statistics, 2 out of 3 australians will develop a form of skin cancer before they reach 70 years old. within australia, 2,000 die from skin cancer each year, and 2,000 are being treated for it daily. outdoor workers, especially roofing contractors as they work in unprotected areas with direct sunlight, receive 5 to 10 times the amount of ultraviolet (uv) radiation compared to the average citizen. this means that a roofing contractor’s risk of developing cancer is monstrously higher compared to the average australian.
the study
a recent study done by cancer council queensland, curtin university and queensland university of technology shows that people who work in the public sectors, farming and construction industry believe that they will develop skin cancer in the future. however, the numbers could be higher for industries such as roofing asâ theyâ are among the most sun-exposed workers without any protection.
skin cancer belief
cancer statistics show that australia, especially queensland, has among the highest occurrence of skin cancer in the world. the threat is even greater for roofing contractors who toil all day working in the sun. what is even more disturbing is that at least 70% of the contractors believe that they will develop skin cancer in the future. almost half of the number believes they already have skin cancer. some have even had moles or spots removed out of such belief.
there is a need for policies
the number of building industry contractorsâ believeâ the statistics areâ shocking to say the least. itâ€™s a pragmatic view and it needs to be addressed as soon as possible. “this means that there is a need for a follow up on our workers not only for the mental health, but for actually making the workplace a safer place” quoted trevor bransden from pro build roofing brisbane.
burden of responsibility

policy makers
individual contractors
company enforcement

 
there are policies set in place to protect the roofing contractors and construction personal. however, according to a study, nearly half of those policies are not enforced. the burden of responsibility for making each contractor safe lies in the protection of policy makers, individual workers and the workplace employers. policies like readily available sunscreen, wearing of protective clothing and enough shade is important for the safety of the workers. also, contractors need to be educated that they have a responsibility becoming “sun smart”. lastly, each workplace should also be responsible enough to enforce these policies. “this is very important as the research shows that only half of the roofing contractors have sun protection workplace policies, and only half of those enforce those policies”â added mr bransden.
importance of sunscreen

when it comes to protecting tradesman from the sun, policies should be set to cover as most grounds, or skin, as possible. among the primary line of defense is putting on a sunscreen lotion. there is a belief thatâ tradespeople have little care about lotions as it is a “woman thing”. this might be true at some point and, hopefully, in the future it won’t be. according to a non-scientific research, after educating a small group of contractors, the sunscreen lotions placed at the workplace are being snatched-up and there is a demand for more. the olderâ workers were the first adopters as they have seen the evidence and heard some stories about skin cancer. to make the workplace safer for contractors, a policy should be set that sunscreen should be readily available and education in the roofing industry and other at riskâ workers should be mandatory.
shade protection
providing enough shade for roofing constructors is another good way of protecting them from the sun. however, providingâ shade may be difficult, especially if the work involves high and wide spaces. nevertheless, a policy should be set that enough shade should be provided in any way possible and as much as possible.
exposure limit
another issue that needs to be dealt isâ sun exposure times. australia receives one of the highest amounts of uv radiation. it is suggested thatâ tradesman should limit to their exposure to uv peak times of the day. it’s been said that 10 minutes exposure limit during peak times is strongly suggested. for the summer months where uv radiation is at the highest in a year, 3 minutes exposure limit is also strongly suggested.
protective clothing

long sleeves
wraparound glasses
cloth neck covers
wide brimmed hats

another line of defense that proves to significantly reduce the risk of skin cancer is clothing protection. the most important thing is that the men are wearing adequate protective clothing while working under the sun. for example, long sleeves and wraparound sunglasses should be a must. there is a newly designed cloth flap, which can be secured to a hard hat or a cap, that serves to cover and protect the back and shoulders is also strongly suggested.
companies at the sun protection forefront
according toâ mr bransden, “i have learned about the skin cancer issue from the office in the past. while i know that sun exposure is really an issue here in australia, but what shocked me is the high percentage ofâ workers believing that they will get skin cancer in the future or think they already have one. this is a cause for concern as quality work can only be achieved if the contractors put 100% of their efforts to their work and that includes physical and mental effort. we never neglected this issue and placed it as one of our priorities. now, we have company policies to ensure that our workers are only receiving safe amounts of sunlight. this is not an effort just to show that we care about our employees, it is also an effort to reduce future medical expenses that might be shouldered by the company. its a win-win situation for our company and our workers”.
summary
skin cancer is a real threat for both theâ roofingâ trade and other construction and building industriesâ as they receive 5 to 10 times the amount of uv radiation compared to the average australian. this must be addressed for the safety of everyone involved. policy makers, individuals â and companies should set policies or make an effort to reduce the risk of skin cancer. policies like mandatory sunscreen application and education, shade protection, exposure limit and protective clothing must be introduced. recognition of companies at the forefront of sun protection, should be publicly recognized as this can motivate other companies to do the same.
