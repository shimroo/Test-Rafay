saetra health solutions was established to focus on the medical rehabilitation market that was formerly done by its parent company saetra. shs will put greater emphasis on the distribution of medical rehabilitation products in the southern african market. market requirements and economic realities necessitated a more focused and inclusive vehicle which we believe we now own the key to. saetrahealth solutions has a “basket” of products to offer, amongst others, in the following fields:  orthopedic consumables   hand therapy   spinal rehab   work and vocational rehabilitation   tests and evaluation equipment   aids to daily living. although many items are imported, we choose to also look for local manufacturers of similar products so as to keep costs down and support local industries. should the quality and price not meet our standards we look elsewhere. the international suppliers whom we represent are amongst others valpar international corporation, bases of virginia, klarity medical products, alimed, fabrifoam and 3point products – all from the usa.saetrahealth solutions offers tests, workstations, splinting material and splints, related consumables such as velcro, elastonet pressure garment material, and therapeutic putty, to name but a few.  let us know where your interest lie and we will let you know if we can supply.  if we cannot provide a competitive quote we'll let you know without delay.
