industry leading 3:1 hands-on scanning



                        the scanning workshops are taught by expert physicians and registered sonographers, thus allowing the learner to obtain experience performing the ultrasound examinations under supervised conditions. the learner scans live models with no more than a 3:1 participant to instructor ratio providing a generous amount of skills training with individual attention.  inanimate phantoms and human cadaveric specimens (selected programs) are also utilized for ultrasound-guided procedural applications. gulfcoast ultrasound also uses ultrasound machines from most all equipment manufacturers within the ultrasound industry.
                        the instructors use a checklist to evaluate the learners’ ability to identify specific anatomy and their ability to perform protocols associated with various types of examinations. for selected activities a signed log of exams performed/interpreted is also provided for use in fulfilling hospital credentialing and/or certification purposes.
