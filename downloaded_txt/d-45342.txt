    how to teach a swimmer with autism by swimangelfish


 december 18, 2024

teaching the lifelong skill of swimming to students of all abilities is the best gift you can give them. when it comes to teaching swimmers who have an autism spectrum diagnosis, we understand that this can be challenging for the swimmer and their parent/caregiver, but also for the swim instructor, particularly if they don’t have experience and the right tools and strategies to complement their lesson plans.                                                                   ﻿                                                                  we will share advice and time-tested tips for your very next lesson. this will help you to address any underlying problems and overcome obstacles, allowing you to reach swim skill benchmarks faster and with more comfort, using the swim angelfish adaptive aquatic methodology.
