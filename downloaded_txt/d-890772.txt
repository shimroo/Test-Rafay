  about tim barry 

the founder of the t. barry knicker co. started his small business in california, u.s. in 1981. a native of washington, tim barry started his "love affair" with golf, its history and its fashion at an early age. he swung his first golf club at age 10. 
at 14, barry invented a board game called "professional golf," designed to help acquaint people with golf, its rules and its terminology. that same year, he found a set of knickers-a 1920s pair in a costume shop. he had a local seamstress take them apart and create a "pattern," then make him his first pair of "plus fours."
