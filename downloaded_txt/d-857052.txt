						surrounded by deep forests and rolling fields, west point lake extends 35 miles along the chattahoochee river on the alabama-georgia state line. the lake's 500 miles of shoreline provides excellent opportunities for fishing, camping, boating and other recreational activities.the construction of west point dam was authorized by the flood control act of 1962.  congress authorized the project for flood control, hydroelectric power, navigation, fish and wildlife development and general recreation. west point dam controls flooding of the river by managing seasonal variations in water flow. the project provides water storage for navigation on the apalachicola-chattahoochee-flint waterway, running 260 river miles from apalachicola, florida to columbus, georgia. the powerhouse's three generators produce enough power yearly to serve 24,000 homes.
