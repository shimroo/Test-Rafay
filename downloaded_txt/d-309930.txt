what is vacation ownership? 



									vacation ownership or timeshare means that you experience all the benefits (and more) of a second home without any of the upkeep. it’s turnkey. you have a vacation home to travel to year after year or you can exchange and discover another part of the world that you’ve been dreaming about visiting. ownership makes any of this possible.								



benefits of ownership 



									being an owner means that you have a vacation home to build memories and traditions with family and friends. many owners meet lifelong friends that they look forward to connecting with for years to come. if travelling to a different destination every year appeals to your sense of adventure, you’ll have your pick with resorts that are located around the globe.
