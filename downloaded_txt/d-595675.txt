on the northern and 
			eastern borders, with withlacoochee river presents 45 miles of 
			riverfront beauty and recreational opportunities. northeast of 
			inverness, the long, lazy withlacoochee helps refresh the tsala 
			apopka chain of lakes, a 23,000 acre bass-rich playground for 
			fishermen and a wetland home for a dozen species of bird and mammal 
			considered rare elsewhere in america.
along us 19, bisecting 
			western citrus county, a string of first and second magnitude 
			springs give birth to citrus county's other protean, crystal clear 
			rivers, including the homosassa, the chassahowitzka and the crystal. 
			flowing at a constant temperature of 72 degrees, these 
			spring-spawned streams provide the endangered west indian manatee, 
			america's largest fresh water mammal, with its favored winter home. 
			the people of citrus county take pride in assisting state and 
			federal efforts to protect this american cousin of the elephant. 
			large herds of manatees are seen from november through march.
few counties in florida 
			enjoy a more salubrious year-round climate than citrus. summer days 
			average 82 degrees, moderated by constant breezes from the lakes and 
			the gulf of mexico; while winter lows average 62 degrees, 
			encouraging the dedicated gardener to experiment with a wide variety 
			of flowers and vegetables every month of the year. rainfall averages 
			45 to 52 inches, most of it falling during the summer months.
benefiting from well 
			managed growth for the past two decades, citrus county is now home 
			to more than 119,707 people and is expected to grow to 138,953 by 
			the year 2005. with relatively inexpensive land, the cost of living 
			index ranked citrus county 52 out of florida 67 counties. quality of 
			life second to none has attracted a balanced population mix of both 
			retirees and young families. opportunities for young professionals 
			and business people in citrus county are extensive, with a 
			continued, healthy economic growth in the 21st century forecasted by 
			most florida experts.
