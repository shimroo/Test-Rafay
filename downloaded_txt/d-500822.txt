inside st. albans



		in the classroom and on the playing fields, st. albans boys take pride in working hard – knowing they have the support of their classmates and the compassion and encouragement of their teachers. laughing over lunch, singing in chapel, and catching up before class, students and teachers are constantly building a community where boys thrive. 
	







rigorous academics





championship athletics





strengthened by diversity





supporting each student’s success 





imagine, create, perform







a boys school for boys today



		jacket, ties, and bright colorful sneakers. boys laugh as they run from building to building. spikeball is played on the roof while government club members discuss the current issues of the world. st. albans is a place where boys discover who they are and thrive as themselves.
	







initial image - do not delete





finding your voice
visitors often are shocked: “the boys actually sing?” chapel services, which often feature a student speaker, are places both for boys to reflect and share with their classmates. 




a coordinate school
from the first day of school to the last, the coordinate program with the national cathedral school brings co-education to the arts, athletics, and dozens of classes. 




general tso’s chicken
family-style lunches are at the heart of our community, where students break bread and share conversations with peers in other grades. 




hasfob, sborf, tbat
hallways and stairwells free of backpacks; sam’s bar, outside, refectory for food; top button and tie. our faculty proudly bring joyful energy to school rules — creating a few goofy acronyms along the way.

st. albans by the numbers



		it’s impossible to define st. albans by a few statistics, but we think these numbers are helpful for getting to know us. come visit campus to measure the spirit of our community for yourself.
	














a day in the life of a bulldog



		hear from members of our community in their own words. at st. albans, we’re proud to be a tightly knit community that challenges and supports each other in the classroom, on the field, in chapel, and everywhere in between.

sta student
laszlo wolfe ’25
“during the school day, you’ll find me either studying in the classroom or library, or meeting with a teacher after class. if my work is done for the day, i'll pass the time hanging out with friends and grabbing a snack at sam’s bar.”

sta faculty
kyle money
“there is far more to the st. albans community - the deep care your classmates have for you, the ‘teacher-coach’ model where your math teacher is running alongside you on the track, the moments of your classmate delivering a homily in the little sanctuary, and unexpected friendships from lunch in the refectory.”

sta faculty
bharti vural
“the privilege of teaching at an all boys school is to be a stepping stone for them as they learn, cultivate, and expand on their own thinking, their own sense of agency, and develop a deeper understanding of themselves, and the world with greater empathy, care, and compassion.”

sta alum & teacher-coach
jim ehrenhaft ’83
“i was first drawn toward st. albans as a student, as i knew it inspired students and athletes to push themselves to the fullest extent. what i didn't know was that as much as it is an intense place academically and athletically, it is also intensely caring. i felt that as a student, and i continue to experience that as a teacher and coach.”
