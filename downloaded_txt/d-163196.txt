					about continuum/subspace				
meet people from all over the world... then kill them!

						we've all played asteroids, defender, or any other 2d spaceship game at some point in our lives, but have you ever played one where the enemies (or asteroids) are real people all over the world fighting back? our slogan "meet people from all over the world... then kill them!" while originally controversial, still lives up to its meaning today.while all the popular servers now are in the united states, subspace still attracts thousands of players worldwide from countries like india, australia, china, japan, estonia, sweeden, the netherlands, brazil, isreal, and canada just to name a few.download: continuum 0.40 [www.getcontinuum.com] sscu extreme games[www.extreme-games.net]sscu trench wars[www.trenchwars.org]sscx chaos / league zone svs[www.svssubspace.com]

subspace continuum discord

subspace continuum discord:https://discord.gg/zbb739uerwthere's an initiative to unite all the zones on 1 discord server, instead of having 8 servers for 7 zones (tw, eg, dsb, hs, deva, hz, pl4v4). in the long term this will have benefits such as: cross zone development projects!  greater awareness between community members (less isolation). encourages working together and fosters understanding. shows a united front to old and new players instead of a fragmented one. may lead to a verified discord server which has many benefits.  better development of the discord and maintenance. as our server grows and expands we can apply to become a verified discord server. this will grant our community the ability to appear in the discord gaming store and search database. it will also help our discord server look extremely professional through the use of new graphics/icons and channel features. a verified server would help keep the game alive and grow. by joining, you would help our game grow and get closer to that goal. please support the initiative for a united subspace!

subspace continuum as they wish to call it has officially been launched on steam.visit the page, check it out, maybe play a game or two. i've heard a lot of vets have returned and hopped on to see if anything happens. even if steam isn't giving the population a boost, i am sure that will for a short time.go play!
