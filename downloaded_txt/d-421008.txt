about s.i.t. strings



 



are you in tune? it is important to be in tune with everything, every day. as a company, it is critical that we are in tune with the continuously changing needs and demands of musicians today. that is why we are constantly striving to create a better and even more consistent product. – every day. we believe that building guitar strings is part science/part art, both of which require passion and dedication.
it is our goal that you will always be in tune if you are using any of the products on our website. s.i.t. (“stay in tune”) strings was founded on a belief that a guitar string is more than just an accessory of little importance, but rather an integral part of a musician’s sound and voice. that is why, since 1980, we have been manufacturing strings one at a time, all here at the s.i.t. strings factory in akron, ohio usa.
