welcome
under the direction of james beard award-winning chef josé andrés, zaytinya's menu reflects the rich regional diversity of classical turkish, greek, and lebanese cuisines. starting with authentic ingredients and traditional techniques, zaytinya's talented chefs create original and unexpected dishes that bring these regional cuisines to a level never before experienced. often thought of as party food, the small plates style of dining encourages socializing - a drink, a little conversation, and a few mezze shared by friends and family.book your table
