from artist to investigating the terrain of one of saturn's moons: joey pasterski, ph.d., nasa postdoctoral fellow


joey pasterski, ph.d., is not your traditional scientist. he took piano and voice and avoided science at all costs until he went back to school in his later twenties. today, pasterski is a nasa postdoctoral program fellow researching laser desorption mass spectrometry for the dragonfly mission, which will land a rotorcraft on various locations on titan, saturn's moon. during this conversation, pasterski talks to host michael holtz about why studying titan is important, how the moon is like a bizarro earth, and how the trajectory of his life changed when he discovered a love for science.
