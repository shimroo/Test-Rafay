​this is a new start.
what is this place?
it seems i’ve been away for some time, 
only now returning
home.
the last time i remember
remembering a time it was may
16th, 
five thirty six pm.
two thousand and twenty.
and someone died.
four pull-ups today
a week ago only three
two months back it’s strength i lacked
going unnoticed this man
the man of me.
strength is not an action
i’ve discovered
it’s an action when fighting dissolve.
it is just bone giving way
to the age i’m living today
my heart, however is larger than before
pushing that door further down the hall
at the age i’m living today.
i’m grateful for my wife and grateful for my life
so fortunate to be living today.
​“i listen to the wind
  to the wind of my soul
  where i’ll end up well i think
  only god really knows
  i’ve sat upon the setting sun
  but never, never, never, never
  i never wanted water once
  no, never, never, never
 
  i listen to my words but
  they fall far below
  i let my music take me where
  my heart wants to go
 i swam upon the devil’s lake
 but never, never, never, never
 i’ll never make the same mistake
 no, never, never, never.”
 cat stevens - the wind… a perfect song.
do nothing 
and problems
have a way 
of working themselves out. 
my father passed away. it has not hit me yet. 
life takes its punches. 
we determin if they have any effect but some sort of outcome  
effect is something happening 
affect is what happens to you because of it. 
i’ve been affected by my fathers  death,
but my only response is what i can effect. 
when thinking about this, i fear i’m missing  an important part an important element of being a good human. 
i would ask this kind of question to my father 
in one of our many talks we would have for hours about life. 
now i just talk about it to an unresponsive page of digital paper. 
it affects me deeply.  
i hope i was a good son. 
“we determin who we are but what we do.”
“i’m barely here.”
“this is better than anything else out there.”
if you are going to win
win this way!
cubs… win.
november 2nd, 2016
movies will be made of this game
for years to come. 
we were alive to see, my love
you and me  

“do or do not, there is no try.”
“do or do not, there is no try.”
​everything is now at zero.
what good then.
“every man got the right the choose the way he dies.”
do you want the answer,
or do you just want the question?
you can’t have someone rob you of your happiness. 
  no one is worth it
“birds got a job, shit’s got a job, seed’s got a job.”
no one has the right to call themselves an artist. 
“it ain’t suppose to be you.”
“thunder only happens when it’s raining.”
what is it about monday’s 
 taking every bit of ones’ effort and courage to simply 
 move
 forward until the joints give in and ones arches 
 relax 
 setting the pace for the race. 
 what is is about mondays not being the 
 issue on tuesdays? not being like any other day.
 you are home though so all of this silliness needs to end  
what i really wanted to say was…
i love you.  
i love you.
i love you.
i love you.
i love you.
i
love
you.
once in awhile, just when we have it all under control 
and everything is in its rightful place
if you would for me just this once, for me
look inside the person you want to be
and ask yourself what was the rush,
this life, my love, this life…
is not a race.
i don’t like starting anything with i,
but there is no other way to say this,
i’m sorry.
don’t die.
“your never wrong to do the right thing.”
“when a carpenter picks up his saw, if wood could talk… it would scream.”
- all the way
nodding the head does not row the boat. - irish proverb
​yes i want cake  
​“you have so much courage in life when it’s done it’s spent”
you need to add fiction to make is less real.
bored. who has the time. 
five bites. 
god helps  
i give my thoughts too much credit.
before you block out your humanity…
​evil suits 
not what you think it means  
​i was asked to run a relay with a friend,
 they said they needed a ringer,
 when we placed ourselves on the track
 they stepped off the track to be the singer.
 though music is such a wonderful thing,
 to help you through the race,
 when a friend agrees to hold up their end
 unfortunate when it’s in your face  
cake pop
money’s money.  
the person who’s says “it can’t be done” should not interrupt the person who is doing it”. 
sometimes it’s the tea pots time.
my kusmi can get the scarf. 
coco in uoob pool.
but my love for you, unexpectedly, arrived on time.
you are a warrior.
you are my wife.
i am forever grateful
for you.
“some things in life are predetermined.”
i love when you do nothing. 
coco buttery lips.
“everyone wants to remember a 70’s they may or may not have had.”
music walked me through my childhood  
“you better let somebody love you before it’s 
too late.”  
the eagles, the jackson five, ziggy stardust… rip 2016
if you understand this, if you lived it then you know 
are no words
to describe 
what it is like 
to grow up 
then.
i miss the innocence of it all.
coco nibbledy bits
​slightly pink.
it is exhausting resting.

it’s a new year so why not do something about this body.
so i joined a health club.
after several attempts to find a time to meet a trainer,
postponement seemed to be the only alternative.
somehow i feel physically better about myself.
the good news is…
i practically worked out.
“honestly, match the font for the love of pete.”
i won the lottery last night. 
the jackpot was over $500 million.
today, all day, i’ve avoided checking the winning numbers.
until i do, i believe, i am a winner.

it’s a circus.
you are my organic peach?

“everything was going to change today.”
  said the redwood tree to the sticky fog.
“what?”
and yet. 
  flip your fritter. 
  i can’t wait to try your brownie. 
  what gets your fire started?
  twenty sixteen. 
  if your addiction is deep breathing you are in good shape. 
 
  eat around the honey wave. 
i’m going to stop writing about food and eating it.
but i’m not going to stop thinking about it!

many bags look alike.
mountains are everywhere. 
arc-tic.
​i’ve never had a bite of her bundt.
it’s a puzzle. 
who did the nest.
are your ready, the last piece?
nice.
it’s hard to take it apart.
look at this little tip.
three cubes.
it’s almost done.
​the bottom is strong  
make it strong.
that’s an interesting shape  
you gotta push. 
something with everything.
a runaway beater.
​so, i was standing in line at chipotle with cam…
​what’s the rush.
keep the front door clear.
“competing needs.”
as it was explained to me
conflicted with my own agenda
so i respectfully declined to be amendable.  
in the end, we all want the same thing
 to be relevant in this life
 to someone, something, somewhere…
 our lives are like these words about to be erased
 permanence is not an option for anyone. it never has been.
it’s seven dollars more for buffing  
treats
big black balloon
have you ever noticed, when you attempt to create something new
  the establishment of “what is” spends so much effort to 
  warn you
  block you
  tell you in their bleak, broken words 
  by their distructive actions 
  that you are completely 
  and entirely 
  alone
  in believing it can be better
  or maybe something completely different than it is,
  how it is
  why it is
  when you know how you can make it better
  than just ok
  you can help to make it
  noteworthy 
  by simply caring more, by simply caring more, by simply caring more.
  i once thought these people were my enemies 
  and i treated them as such returning their rocks 
  with heavier rocks 
  dressed as profit,
  addressing their resistance with completion & triumph.
  and still, nothing changes, even in the face of abundance 
  and good fortune they stand resilient using silence as their response, crossed armed
  and crossed.
  my wife sent me a quote late last night from new york
  (not the quote, it’s from where she sent it)
  “if you want something you never had,
  you have to do something you’ve never done.”
  these words lay on top an image of a person with a backpack
  standing on the edge of a cliff looking out over still waters
  a mile down
  with mountains miles away and stormed clouds overhead.
 alone.
  the fact is, as unsettling as it may be, we are alone
  if we believe in something others wish to ignore 
  and pretend
  does not exist,
  because they have become so comfortable in the way it is.
  i read these words again to myself…
  “if you want something you never had,
  you have to do something you’ve never done.”
  faced down, my own reflection showing my age in the still water of my own wet mud
  for the first time in my life
  i will do something completely new 
  completely uncomfortable 
  and at the very extreme of the existence of who i am
  today
  i will, in the face of all resistance from those who stand angry
  stones in hand
  sweating from the efforts of hate
  i will for the first time in my life
  not become…
  defensive.
“i only want to do what i want to do.” comes at a price most folks would rather haggle.
i’ve rarely come across someone who is willing to pass
 up financial gain for artistic freedom, 
 though it still happens now and again
 it is not the dilemma of younger generations.
 not to say my generation has a greater artistic understanding
 it is simply, these kids worked into their creative freedom a line-item
 covering the cost of selling out.

 
constantly, artist get in their own way 
breaking thin ice below their feet as they walk 
further forward without noticing
the land behind them crumbling.
constantly, they fail to hear
someone from shore yelling to them
“i’m here!”
mildly using.
she said, immune to the gravity of it all.
i’m smell’n what you’re sell’n.
why is it, when having a bad day
  those around you like to point it out?
  do they honestly believe you are unaware?
  it is only in this instance, the phrase…
  “don’t kill the messenger.” should be questioned.
people don’t leave their families
on sunday night,
they leave them on monday morning.
​isle or window?
“coco is lean and muffin is juicy!”
call dad.
100 minute meeting.
we are creating for the one.
tomorrow, when our car comes please remind me
to say goodbye.
red tail hawks
tree trunks!
if you are not paying the bills
it is not your place
to have an opinion about the cost of things.
unless, of course, you are made to feel obliged,
because guilt is super pricey  
the least amount of  damage,
  the most amount of destruction.
 the least amount of  tragedy,
 the most amount of razed.
