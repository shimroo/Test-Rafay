 introducing the  ultra elbow shock absorber 



protection from tennis elbow – for the rest of your life 





















 







epicondylitis 
is a myth 



“itis” means inflammation and it has now been proven that elbow  tendonitis is not an inflammatory pathology – it is in fact tendinosis.  reducing inflammation robs your body of its ability to heal itself and it has no effect on mending a stretched or torn extensor tendon. anti-inflammatories can delay healing and increase the likelihood that you’ll continue aggravating your elbow.

tendons are 
shock absorbers 



if the collagen in your extensor tendon is torn, your ability to reduce the shock from sports and everyday activities is compromised.  tennis elbow braces that grab the muscle and compression sleeves that limit movement can’t protect your injured tendon from the shock. the best defense against shock while your tendon heals is to stop it at the wrist – only tenex ultra offers this protection.

items that cause tendinosis 


































 







the shocking truth 



only about 10% of tennis elbow cases are sports-related – 90% are from everyday repetitive motion activities like hammering or keyboarding.  for most people, the pain is a 24/7 experience that cannot be addressed with short-duration solutions. this is where ultra comes to the rescue.  see the plan we created for your recovery.

 introducing the  sciatica relief band 



the sciatic nerve runs closest to the surface of the skin behind the knee at acupoint ub40.wear the new srb when sitting or moving to reduce pain and enable a path to recovery. 





















 







stop sciatica
in its tracks 



running from the lower back through the hip and leg to the heel, the sciatic nerve supports the motor and sensory functions in your legs. when the nerve is pinched it causes pain-typically in one leg. tenex srb intercepts sciatica pain at an acupoint behind the knee called ub40. unlike sciatica pain relief braces, it targets the only major point along the sciatic nerve path that can alter the brain’s pain signal and allow the surrounding muscles to relax.

how they work 



 











tenex ultra 



whether you’re playing tennis or pickleball or just typing at your computer, harmful vibrations can make elbow pain unbearable. worn like a wristwatch, tenex ultra  produces a counterwave that engages the extensor tendons neutralizing these vibrations before they reach your elbow. this solution is proven to be 10x more effective than compression braces, electric shocks, or pain pills.

tenex srb 



running from the lower back through the hip and leg to the heel, the sciatic nerve supports the motor and sensory functions in your legs. when the nerve is pinched it causes pain-typically in one leg. tenex srb intercepts sciatica pain at an acupressure point behind the knee called ub40. unlike surface braces or socks, it gets deep enough to engage the nerve altering the brain’s pain signal and allowing the surrounding muscles to relax.

recommended by thousands 



 


















						fellow tennis player recommended your product. i have suffered for one and a half years. i tried physical
therapy, acupuncture, cortisone shots, oral meds and nothing has worked. everything short of surgery,
which has been recommended, until i tried your product.					


donna petrilla, raleigh nc 






						i gave one to my housekeeper who was suffering from pains in her elbow and shoulder. i use one for tennis and told her it works perfectly and gave her my spare one. in one week, her pain is gone! she even sleeps with it!					


wilma davidson, ed. d - florida 






						i am canadian. i found you because two persons who had tennis elbow conditions independently told me that this is the only reliable solution if i want to continue playing squash.					


dmitri rubisov - toronto, ontario 






						my doubles partner loaned me hers at a tournament. i tore the tendon in my elbow five months ago and the pain interfered with my game and my work (i am a writer). i was able to hit harder and serve well with the band (it really surprised me that something on my wrist could relieve elbow pain so effectively). i need this asap please!					


gina pogol - reno, nv 






						have ordered one before and am now ordering for friends - great for badminton elbow!					


sharon mendon - vt 






						a friend recommended this product as i suffer from repetitive strain injury/tennis elbow caused by many years of working at a typewriter and computer and it really helps. 					


anita ryan - ireland 






						i got tenex months ago and wear it on my arm almost everyday. little by little the pain is gone and at the moment my arm is doing much better. i promise that next time i go to the doctor, i will recommend and introduce your product. last year my doctor told me that i needed surgery, so this is a miracle. congratulations and all my best!					


vincentiu sultz - hirvensalmi, finland 






						...after i hit the ground on a swing and my hands screamed, a fellow golfer allowed me to use hers. after putting on the shock absorber, the pain stopped!					


cathy westermann - colorado springs, co 






						in a world where all too often what is represented turns out to be without substance or real value, i think it is important to acknowledge people or products that turn out to be genuine and of real worth. i would therefore like to recommend unreservedly your tenex device. two years ago i had to quit playing tennis for the season; last year i bought a tennis elbow cushion strap and soldiered on, albeit with a continuing level of discomfort. in february of this year i found the tenex strap in a tennis shop ("advantage yours") while vacationing in clearwater, florida, and have been comfortably playing about 2 hours of men singles 5-6 times a week, every week. i'm obviously (and proudly) a tennis nut and can't thank you enough for this great product!!					


michael biggins - meaford, on 






						ordered it before and swear by it! no more tennis elbow - and i owe it all to you. thanks. 					


wilma davidson - longboat key, fl 






						...the difference in comfort to my elbow is remarkable.					


sarah crippen - austin, tx 






						tenex has been brilliant and i have recommended it to several of my golfing friends. just lost mine so need to replace it.					


john roberts - uk 






						this was recommended to me for tendonitis and bought it for about six friends so far. i swear by it!					


lisa goldstein - brookville, nc 






						if you shoot a lot or you are an instructor, you might want to think seriously about getting one of these. they really do work and really do cut the vibration down that is transmitted up through the arm. same principle as the haarts recoils reducer which goes inside the firearm. violent recoil energy/vibration "shatters" the liquid inside the watch and prevents most of it from traveling further up the arm. i had one of these when they first came out. i gave mine to my niece who plays tennis. now, i think i'll buy another...maybe i'll buy 2. if you get elbow pain from prolonged big bore blasting this will help. it's a proven principle. it's not a gaff. it was originally intended to absorb impact shock for tennis players and golfers but really helps shooters out...					


excerpts from defensivecarry.com 






						it took a while to find you on the internet. i play racquetball and have pain in my elbow. i saw someone wearing it and asked about it. then i noticed many of the better players were also wearing it. really made a difference.					


randy crom - camp hill, pa 






						i had tennis elbow about 15 years ago from playing tennis. i started wearing your tenex band and the tennis elbow went away, but i religiously wear the band every time i play tennis. thanks. 					


peggy warren - carmel, ca 






						i had bad tennis elbow, my girlfriend let me borrow hers and it worked!!! please send my order by fedex.					


gabriella clifton - monterey, ca 






						i work at a golf course and found a tenex which had been in the "lost and found" for some time. i had tennis elbow and tried some of the bands one can buy at pharmacies, which didn't seem to help much, so i tried your product and within 2 weeks my elbow was fine! i believe this product is the best for my elbow problem.
