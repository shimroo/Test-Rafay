apartment hunt





i have recently been told that my apartment building is being turned into condos and we are all getting the boot.  so many condos in this town and i wonder how many are actually being sold in this economy.  i find it hard to believe but it's happening and i gotta find a new place to live.  i was super bummed but now i am trying to look at this as a new opportunity.  get rid of old stuff i don't use and build a new atmosphere i love.

last week on blogger.





hey friends.  i have decided no matter what is going on with my website, i am going to stop blogging here after this week.  i am consolidating my blog and website because that makes way more sense and will streamline my life a bit.  i will definitely keep up with blogging and all about plush you! but just there.  all there!  it is so close to being launched, even if it's not perfect it's getting there and can always be a work in progress.  anyways, once it's up and running i will announce the new link and ask that you please follow me there as well.  there will also be a new schmancy plush exclusive the day it's launched so be on the lookout friends.  thanks so much for all the love. xoxo, kristen
