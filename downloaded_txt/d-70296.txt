claude monet, the painter
                who founded the impressionist school lived in giverny
                for 43 years.
 his house and his garden, the village of giverny and its
                surroundings, were his subject matter and they still
                attract half a million visitors each year from all over the
                world, as well as painters,
                charmed by the unique light of the seine valley. 
 and this little spot in normandy has much more
                to offer. its history dates back to the paleolithic period, and
                the area abounds in archeological sites,
                prestigious castles, mysterious
                  mills, wonderful gardens and rich
                  museums. 
 the seine valley is also turned to the future
                : the rocket engines of the european launcher ariane are
                produced in vernon.
