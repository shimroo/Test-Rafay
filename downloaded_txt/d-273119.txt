						elaborative study on social media’s role in the realm of digital marketing!						




 interconnectivity! 
yes, this is the very term which has led to the upsurge of social media in the domain of digital marketing. social media sites have become crucial tools on which any business concentrates hard to gain a wider access towards its target audience. moreover, with everyone thriving in the ‘virtual’ world, it is only a matter of time that soon all will be “online”!
social media initiates to grow social signals which further leads to digital marketing campaigns. and campaigning or advertising as all know is the heart of any form of marketing endeavor.
being interconnected on a number of social media platforms like facebook, instagram, twitter, snapchat, pinterest and linkedin gives any marketeer the rightful platform to take his voice! and when this voice reaches out within seconds to millions of people, the brand of the business gains a stable foothold in the digital world! furthermore, as the brand grows, so does the business as a whole. thus, a circle of business life is created!
circle of digital marketing life – when the social media giants rule! 
you have perhaps read a thousand of articles on social media marketing, social media tools and their connection with digital marketing. however, have you ever wondered which social media giant plays what role? if not, then follow up!

facebook 

the reason, facebook can be a tough competitor to other digital marketing channels lies in its tremendous ever-expanding reach! every day with each passing moment, this giant is widening its horizon. some even say it knows no leaps and bounds! why?

smartphones & videos – there’s a rumour going around; soon when tv will slowly fade, fb will position itself as the next stage for tv ad money!

if your business is connected to mobiles and digital video, then fb is the ultimate platform for you. the fb’s video ad push provides any brand with the correct platform for his or her digital marketing campaign. in fact, marketing experts recently pointed out that fb video ad will bring more roi than you can get via tv ad campaign!
your brand’s idiosyncrasies once understood, fb with its ever-evolving model will be your digital pal for good!

facebook live – 21st century makes videos the undisputed winners for gaining more and more audience for your brand. introduced last year, fb live has taken over the net by a huge storm. as a result, businesses can provide a sneak peak of their upcoming products and services via these videos, provide a closer interactive session with the audience, promote brand events and also hold a question-answer


instagram 

with more than 300 million insta users in its bag, instagram has been cutting the chase on facebook and twitter. the new trendy social media platform, insta does have its own pluses for any digital marketer. on its official website, insta describes itself as a “simple fun platform that allows families and friends share love and happiness!”
however, nowadays the platform is all about whoever has the most instagram likes or the most instagram followers. if you do happen to be looking to purchase these, a quick google search online will give you plenty of options! you can buy instagram likes from idigic.net and purchase instagram followers from twicsy.com, so there’s plenty of options.
in short, this social media site is also stunning for any niche marketer because –

visual branding – heard about this term? well, apart from the conventional branding definition where growth and evolvement of a business’s brand are included, visual branding, especially for instagram, means presenting your brand’s online presence through numerous images and videos. with these, you can appeal much more to your target group and even raise emotions! statistics say photos along with texts increase a person’s interaction with a brand by 40%.
hashtags bump – the new 10/10/10 hashtag policy allows any user to use up to 30 whopping hashtags related to their image content. using relevant hashtags and that too so many improve your brand strength by organically generating audiences. reaching your maximum audience gets way easier when you generate your own brand-related
ads are free – advertising on instagram is completely free! creating your profile along with business account does not require a dime! instagram allows you to have business profiles and thus, your entire lead generating campaign becomes a cakewalk!
insta stories – instagram storytelling has been a rage since its inception. your brand story can get no better platform to execute its product or service story. or, you can also share some fun snippets from your brand’s behind the scenes moments. moreover, the latest update allows your insta stories to remain highlighted in your profile so that people who have missed your story in the past 24 hours can see your brand story by visiting your account.


linkedin 

meant purely for entrepreneurs, linkedin is the professional of the social media lot! strictly businesses tenured, this particular platform, if integrated with your digital marketing strategy, can keep you on the right track. covering 135 million professionals all over the world, here is how you can upgrade your marketing game –

profile follower upgrading – linking blogs to your linkedin profile drives in more traffic to your site in no time. moreover, sharing your presentations concerning new business endeavors also help to build your connections. posting and promoting events, incorporating twitter account into your linkedin account and upgrading your portfolio help you enhance your brand connections seamlessly.


youtube 

a rather unexplored not-so-much social media platform, youtube can increase your brand visibility in a much broader sense. options like “home”, “my channel”, “trending” lead any marketer to a deeper understanding of its mechanisms.

trending – videos that are taking the entire digital channel by storm! searching and watching hundreds and thousands of videos will help you gain new ideas for your brand content.
subscription – a specific tab that allows keeping your target users under your observation. make sure not to miss anything they have been doing so that you get an insight into what they like or dislike!

“when you digitally communicate with the society”….
a wild chase has started! a chase where every brand is striving towards everything “digital”! why? the reasons lie in front of you! communication has changed its very nature, smartphones and search engines have become the mouthpieces for every digital marketer! you need to keep paddling amidst this wave so that your boat lands on the right shore!
