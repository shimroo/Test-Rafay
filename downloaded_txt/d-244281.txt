testimonials 














“just wanted to give alvin, alejandro and john a huge shout-out! they were a fabulous team to work with:
– on-time
– courteous
– hardworking
– positive
– enthusiastic
– engaging with the attendees
– knowledgeable of equipment/game
– happy to accommodate adjustments

i could keep going! the football game was a huge success and attract but much of it had to do with their engagement. our booth was the hit of the show!”

sparks 


















“the event went amazing on tuesday! thank you so much! i want to thank everyone for everything they did for us, the props looked great and everyone loved the green screen booth.
john and christopher were incredible! they were very helpful, professional and so kind. i want to thank them as well, everyone loved speaking with them and getting their picture taken. they made everything a smooth and easy process. bravo to them!”

bd 


















“i wanted to reach out and let you know that alvin and his team did an exceptional job on wednesday. they were on time (a few even early) and everything looked amazing. alvin was a pleasure to work with. it’s clear that the team are great at what they do, have strong camaraderie, and get the job done correctly and on time. you may have heard we had a few other vendors on site fulfilling the same types of services and your team was the clear standout. that only makes it easier for me to push for your services in the future. i will definitely reach out the next time i have a client interested in any of the types of games and services you offer.
i hope to work with you, alvin and the rest of the ieg team again soon.”

mcveigh global 


















“i’m finally catching up on mia and wanted to thank you and your crew for this year. they were so amazing – responsive, communicative, responsible, everything!! we really appreciate the team and working with you & hope to see this team again next year. thank you!”




							erin						




roc nation 


















“i wanted to give a special thanks to alvin, as he let me know that he is not usually onsite, except outside events. he did an excellent job leading and coordinating, he was on time, and i think he enjoyed himself as well! and it was pleasure to meet him.
i also wanted to give a special thanks to mateo and nicolas! wow, they were very organized with managing the mechanical bull while people lined up to ride. they gave guests a thrill, they were interactive, they were nice and smiling, they worked with other vendors when they needed assistance, and even assisted guests who needed help getting onto the bull. their presence was much appreciated! next event, we recommend those two attendants, for sure.
again, we appreciate interactive entertainment group and hope you all have a successful rest of the year!”

stoladi 


















“i just wanted to send a big thank you for the event you just did with us with your vr flip on june 25th. it was the absolute hit of the event and was so well received.
on another more important note i can not say enough great things about nicolas. i have never worked with someone so professional, so lovely, that works that hard and i will hands down request him for any event we do in the future with you. there were some challenges with load in but he worked so well in finding solutions and making it work. he is quite frankly a great person and is such a good ambassador for your company. he made the experience so much better and far exceeded my expectations. he is cc’d on this email so nicolas thank you for everything that weekend and we can’t wait to work with you again. this event was one of the biggest the hotel has had in its history and i’m so happy that you were a part of our extended team for this!
it’s always a bit nerve wracking working with a company you have not had history with and spending so much money on a product you have never tried but this was far beyond what we imagined. what you do is so unique, you provide quality and exciting offerings, professional services and we will 100% use you in the future. we have a few large us/canadian events that i will be reaching soon to book a few things and i will be sending out several emails to our clients and other industry partners to recommend interactive entertainment group.
thank you again for giving us nicolas and for adding such value and excitement to our event. i also want to give a big thanks to kate, marty and alvin as well for assisting along the way and making me feel so comfortable.
we really look forward to working with you again in the future.”

“i wanted to take the time to express how truly impressed and appreciative my team was with the level of experience, thought, care and devotion jeff dick had while running our activation. if it was not for his dedication to our project we would not have been nearly as successful as we were. he was incredibly patient, especially understanding and most of all an active problem solver. he truly did a fantastic job.”




							lexi						




candy digital 


















“wanted to shoot you a quick note to say that alvin was absolutely stellar onsite. he was very professional, always a problem solver, positive, made sure i was in the loop with solutions, felt comfortable with decisions being made, etc.
overall, really thrilled with the onsite team, especially alvin and just wanted to let you know.”
