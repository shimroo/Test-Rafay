testimonialshear from our members
“omca is one of my favourite shows to attend. they are very well-planned, incredibly interactive, and great networking venues. the variety of suppliers from across north america has something for everyone! can’t wait to return in 2024.”ellison travel12/2023“the omca marketplace conference is truly worthwhile for those looking to make long-lasting connections with colleagues in the tourism industry and drive business to their destinations. omca members support each other’s businesses and when we gather annually, we get to conduct business while reuniting with great friends.”caesars windsor12/2023“as a buyer at the omca marketplace there is no replacement for creating real connections with all the various sellers. knowing people on a more personal level makes it so much easier when we need them.”hammond tours & travel11/2022“the omca marketplace is definitely worth attending!  quality appointments and a well-put-together show.”destination st. john’s12/2023“i truly enjoy learning about our canadian partners and the attractions offered across north america.”time to travel llc12/2022“we find that membership in the omca is an important factor for us. we love how they work with the government entities that do the lobbying for our operators in ontario and canada and that brings a lot of benefit.”prevost12/2023
