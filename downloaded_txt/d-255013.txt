where innovation meets tradition
 



 

founded by silas noble and james cooley, noble & cooley has been sustainably producing hand-crafted drums since 1854. our wood is and always has been grown in our own backyard, and harvested right here in new england. as a company with great antiquity, we have evolved and perfected our products over time while preserving the importance of legacy. continuously owned by direct descendants of james cooley, the noble & cooley of today is still operated in its original location in granville, massachusetts.
