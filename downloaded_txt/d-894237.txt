  face="arial"><font color="#000000">african slaves were
sold in lisbon as early as 1441. the european discovery and colonization
of the americas set the scene for the trans-atlantic slave trade. in the
course of three hundred years, from the sixteenth to the nineteenth
century, upwards of ten million black men, women and children arrived in
the americas as unwilling migrants. millions more died on the journey to
the atlantic coast, and at sea.</font><br>

<br>

<font color="#000000">the slaves were all african. so too were most of
those who first sold them. the buyers and shippers were europeans.</font><br>

<br>

<font color="#000000">like you and me, each of those africans must
surely have had a tale to tell. no doubt it would have been a tale of
suffering; but often, surely, also a tale of courage and solidarity.</font><br>

<br>

<font color="#000000">sadly, few acquired the skills needed to preserve
their stories for posterity; and those who did wrote with european
quills and european ink on european paper.</font><br>

<br>

<font color="#000000">what of the vast majority? what of those who never
learned to read or write and never accepted the religion of their
oppressors? &nbsp;</font><br>

<br>

<font color="#000000">their stories are lost. all but a few of the ten
million came from societies in which literature was oral, rather than
written. even when the light of history shines briefly on one of those
black faces, it is seldom an african who holds the flickering torch and
tells us what he sees. the fragments which have come down to us are
shattered images of african society, african beliefs, african
relationships, african people.</font></font></li>

color="#000000">this novel
  is an attempt to recreate the experience of
enslavement and resistance, seen from the point of view of one african
slave. &nbsp;</font><br>

<br>

<font color="#000000">in 1772, the musketeers of the army of the asante
confederacy vanquished the archers and cavalry of the kingdom of
dagomba. the victor exacted from the defeated enemy an annual tribute of
five hundred slaves.</font><br>

<br>

<font color="#000000">ama, then known by her birth-name, nandzi, is left
alone to care for her baby brother. she is captured, raped and enslaved.
her name is taken from her. she fights back; she is defeated. she
escapes; and is recaptured. from the moment when she loses her freedom,
her life oscillates between resistance to her successive owners and a
reluctant accommodation to their power. the dagomba give her to the
asante; the asante sell her to the dutch. on board an english slave
ship, she instigates a rebellion; and suffers a terrible retribution
when it fails. in brazil, where eighteen-hour work shifts send slaves to
an early death, she attempts to build a new life. sustained by ancient
beliefs, ama's spirit never wavers. enslaved she might have been, but to
herself she is never a slave.</font></font></li>
