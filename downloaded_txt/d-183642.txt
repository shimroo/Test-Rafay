east harlem scholars academies monthly family newsletter













january 2025 newslettera message from our ceodear families,this month our federal government has announced a rapid and dramatic wave of policy changes that has been confusing and honestly frightening for many members of our community. through this time of so much uncertainty, we are committed to providing safe, stable, and welcoming learning environments for all of our scholars. we will stay true to the principles of community partnership and empowerment that we were founded on, and we strive to be a resource you can lean on for information and support.  in this spirit, ehtp will be hosting "know your rights sessions" to help ehtp families and the east harlem community navigate recent changes in immigration policy. we encourage all families who may benefit to attend.session schedule:tuesday, february 4th       9 am -10:30am  (in person) at 2050 2nd ave.       5pm - 6:30pm   (virtual via zoom)      wednesday, february 5th      9 am -10:30am  (in person) at 1573 madison ave.      5pm - 6:30pm   (virtual via zoom)as we work together to navigate this challenging political climate, we must also remain focused on our core mission of ensuring every scholar receives the challenging learning experiences they deserve. with only a few months left until state testing begins, we ask you to support your child’s learning at home in a few simple ways:unless they are sick, please make sure your child attends school every day! every day is an opportunity to learn, and our scholars’ attendance is critical to their success.ask your child about their homework and review their work for completion every evening. even if you don’t have time to help with homework, you can send an important message that you expect it to be done!download the powerschool app on your phone, monitor your child’s progress, and reach out to their teachers if you have concerns. your attention to their academic progress shows your children that you care, and your partnership with their teachers makes a major difference.if we work together, i know our children will achieve great things.  we thank you for your support!warmly, marina cofield east harlem scholars academy high school boys basketball team, east harlem hawks dominate

press release, 9/19/24, media contact: jjamieson@ehtp.orgeast harlem scholars academy high school celebrates opening of first new public high school building in east harlem in over 60- yearsthe new 70,000-square-foot facility is the culmination of the campaign for east harlem, an unprecedented $100+ million initiative by the well-established educational institution ehtp. this campaign has enabled the creation of a three-facility pre-k–12 neighborhood campus, offering year-round, community-based, college-prep programming to thousands of local students and families.













east harlem, ny - today, east harlem tutorial program (ehtp) and east harlem scholars academies cut the ribbon on its highly anticipated new 70,000-square-foot public charter high school. the new 104th and first avenue facility houses east harlem scholars academy high school and ehtp’s college scholars program. in the last decade, nearly 80% of ehtp seniors have gone on to graduate college or remain on track to do so right now — the new facility aims to support the continuation and expansion of those extraordinary results for decades to come.the event was marked by a ribbon-cutting celebration, attended by students, families and teachers, elected officials, board members, business leaders, philanthropists, and east harlem community leaders.the site, originally owned by the archdiocese and projected to become luxury condos, will instead accommodate 600 east harlem students and their teachers, offering a full regulation-size basketball and volleyball court, a black box theater, cutting-edge science labs, and dedicated music and art rooms. scholars will have access to a third-floor terrace adjacent to the cafeteria, where they can plant fruits and vegetables, and enjoy outdoor meals and discussions.upon entering the building, students and guests are greeted by a 20-foot mural designed and created by local artist and activist manny vega. the tiled artwork features a collection of stunning scenes from east harlem, including visual representations of the student artists who helped vega create the piece.













this project was the second phase of the campaign for east harlem, which invested over $100 million to build two school buildings, launching the east harlem teaching residency, the college scholars program, and expanded the east harlem scholars academies network. the new east harlem scholars academy high school building was made possible in part through the generous $30+ million in challenge gifts given by marilyn simons and her late husband jim over several years. additional financing and financial support for ehtp was achieved through a partnership with goldman sachs, whose current chief financial officer denis coleman was an ehtp volunteer in the 1980s and sits on the organization's leadership council.the project was supported by the leadership and vision over many years by the school’s co-founder and ceo emeritus jeffrey ginsburg, alongside board chairs joan solotar of blackstone and billy rahm. law firm greenberg traurig was a crucial pro bono partner, as well as real estate committee co-chairs stephen rabinowitz, hope knight, and jonathan pollack.  alongside the simons, major donors lili lynton, the carson family, lori and dave schnadig (cortec), mindy and jon gray (blackstone), judy gibbons, andrew tucker, and don cornwell (dynasty) all played crucial roles. this project sets new standards in community-based design and input. ennead and design partner stephen chu personally attended design sessions where young people from the community alongside families and teachers shared input and helped co-design the spaces. 26% of the budget was spent with black and brown-owned businesses, almost tripling the average rate reported across new york city, and another 4% with women-owned businesses. 82% of workers hired for the project were people of color, including 8% who lived in the immediate neighborhood, demonstrating ehtp's commitment to ensuring that this project was built by and for the local community.













"looking around this new building, i can’t help but think about the generations of east harlem youth who will thrive in this space, which was thoughtfully designed with education and their future in mind,” said marina cofield, ceo of ehtp and east harlem scholars academies. “this campus represents not only the bright future of both ehtp and east harlem scholars academies but also our deep commitment to this community."   “after decades of witnessing the profound impact of the east harlem tutorial program on this community’s youth, i am eager to see how this new building will further expand opportunities for our high school and ost scholars,” said william d. rahm, chair, ehtp board of trustees. “ i take immense pride in the collective effort of the board, staff and broader community, which were all instrumental in bringing this vision to life."  “i am extremely proud of and grateful for the shared vision, generosity and collaborative effort that made these two new school buildings a reality for our scholars, families, and staff. ehtp now has the core values and results of its nearly 70-year history, plus the facilities required to succeed for decades to come,” said jeffrey ginsburg, ceo emeritus of ehtp and co-founder of east harlem scholars academies. “simply put, our students and teachers have always deserved classroom spaces that reflect their true potential and brilliance, and i am overjoyed they finally got them.”“having been inspired by the east harlem tutorial program’s mission and their unwavering commitment to the families of east harlem for many years, i am delighted to see our vision become a reality. i hope that generations of students will thrive academically and socially in this beautiful, state-of-the-art facility built with love and dedication,” said marilyn simons, ehtp leadership council member. “the new east harlem scholars academy high school building stands as a testament to the remarkable achievements that can be realized when we unite for a noble cause. i am so proud of the efforts undertaken by many lawyers from greenberg traurig, who contributed their time and skills to enable the development and opening of this state-of-the-art educational facility, which will serve the east harlem community and its youth,” said stephen l. rabinowitz, co-chair of the global real estate practice at greenberg traurig, llp, and a member of the ehtp board of trustees. “this project represents the successful culmination of approximately $100 million invested in two significant educational buildings within this neighborhood, and i am proud to have had the privilege of contributing to their realization. i anticipate with optimism the lasting positive impact this facility will have on the lives of young people for many years to come.”"having been around since 1958, ehtp has grown into a pillar of the east harlem community, and i am proud to see it still thriving and expanding in service of this community's youth," said diana ayala, new york city council member, district 8. "congratulations to east harlem scholars academies on this beautiful new building, which will positively serve east harlem for generations to come. the need for educational spaces like this is greater than ever, and this new facility will be a critical resource for students and families." "as a student here at east harlem scholars academy high school, stepping into this new building feels like a fresh start for all of us. the facilities here—from the science labs to the black box theater—give us the tools and space we need to pursue our passions and achieve our goals. this school is more than just a place to learn; it's where we're building our future and learning to lead," said amy seye, student at east harlem scholars academy high school. “the opening of this new campus marks the beginning of a new and exciting chapter in the story of east harlem scholars academy,” said kathryn connell-espinosa, executive director, state university of new york (suny) charter schools institute. “research shows that investing in new school facilities can improve instructional environments, drive student learning and academic performance, boost attendance, and even, lead to better health outcomes. investments like these can also help shape the future of the community, creating a nurturing home away from home for students, where teachers are supported and can encourage, guide, and inspire students to unlock their potential and make a difference in the world. we congratulate east harlem scholars academy on the opening of their new facility and thank all who helped make today possible.”  “we are delighted to welcome our scholars and teachers into this incredible new space. the state-of-the-art facility is a game-changer, and i am already seeing our students’ commitment to learning reach new heights. this environment will undoubtedly inspire greater dedication and passion for their education,” said brandon swaby, principal of east harlem scholars academy high school. “in my 30 years of living in east harlem, i am overwhelmed with joy in witnessing this state-of-the-art high school for our community’s children. grateful for the dedication and persistence of those who made this possible,” said maria medrano, ehtp board member and family leader.“ennead aims to create an uplifting environment that encourages the pursuit of higher education while also functioning as an open, welcoming space for the wider east harlem community to congregate and connect. using feedback gathered from conversations with families, students, and community members, we created a design that thoughtfully weaves the space into the fabric of the city that surrounds it. as the first new public high school opening in the community in over 60 years, we hope this serves as a model for future public schools throughout the city for years to come", said stephen chu, design partner at ennead architects.###

east harlem tutorial program statement on the passing of jim simons










photo by, béatrice de géa





earlier today, jim simons, a celebrated mathematician, investor and philanthropist, passed away in new york city at the age of 86.  marilyn simons, jim’s wife, is a longtime supporter and  board member of east harlem tutorial program and east harlem scholars academies.  in 1994, jim and marilyn established the simons foundation, which marilyn led until october 2021, and together they made historic investments in scientific research and education for underserved communities.  among their many leadership gifts were contributions to the campaigns for east harlem that funded the establishment of permanent facilities  for east harlem scholars academy and east harlem scholars academy high school. throughout his life, jim served as an inspiration to generations of mathematicians, scientists and investors.  his curiosity and probing mind led to breakthroughs in all of the fields that he touched.  although he left math behind  as a profession more than 40 years ago, the one-time chairman of the math department of stony brook university and famed code breaker from mit, brought the same analytical approach from math to everything he did and reshaped how others worked in fields of quantitative investing and basic science.  he also founded math for america to improve math education for students in schools around the country.  ehtp envisions a world where all young people access an unconditionally supportive education that offers them the freedom to embrace – and build on – their inherent power as learners.  we have known very few people more committed to the idea of lifelong learning than jim simons. ehtp served as just one example of how jim turned his efforts to philanthropy, not only through charitable giving but also through asking questions that others had not considered at education roundtables or even board holiday dinners at his home. ehtp could not have been built to its present status of serving thousands of families in east harlem without jim’s inspiration, wisdom and participation. over more than twenty years, we also witnessed the incredible partnership between jim and marilyn, both in marriage and the leadership of the simons foundation.  the entire ehtp family sends its love to marilyn today, as well as to jim’s children, grandchildren and great-grandchild.  our thoughts are with them even as we celebrate his life and impact. for more information visit, www.simonsfoundation.org
