why dance and why the dance teacher? the start of a school year brings new perspectives on the benefits of dance for learners of all ages. we are all aware that dance is beneficial for people as individuals, as well as for our entire society. at its best, dance is an extension and expression of who we are as human beings in ways that can allow us to share emotions that increase our sense of community and connection.            the desire to dance and to move your body is the beginning point of all human life. we all need to connect with each other in some physical way. the dance teacher believes we can connect with each other though dance.dance helps children to flourish because it is an outlet for their natural impulses that provides emotional and social benefits. dance for adults provides a necessary emotional outlet and helps to maintain a sense of wellbeing. it is our belief that dance for today is about friendship, caring and connection. it is because of this belief that we continue to work diligently providing a learning platform that meets our family’s needs.
