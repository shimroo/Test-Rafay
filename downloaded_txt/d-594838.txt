big miller grovemissionary baptist church 1909 ~ 2025


   welcome to big miller grove missionary baptist church! it is our shared vision, as presented to our pastor by god, by way of the holy spirit, to build a place of refuge through which the whole person (physical, spiritual, and mental), including all ages, sexes, races, creeds and colors, and all economic levels, can seek refuge, comfort, sanctuary, and deliverance, and be ministered to.

   
   
all are welcome!
