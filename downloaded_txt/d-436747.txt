the voice of labor in massachusettsthe role of the massachusetts afl-cio is to serve as the unified voice of all organized workers in the commonwealth and to be a voice for all working people, those in unions and those not yet organized. our mission is to improve the lives of working families—by working for economic, social and racial justice in the workplace, in our communities, our state and in our nation. our vision is of a fair and just society that benefits all working people, not a system that’s rigged in favor of the wealthy few.
