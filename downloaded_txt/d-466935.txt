about three rivers




the city of three rivers is located approximately 20 miles south of kalamazoo, mi.  we were founded by settlers who used the three rivers to transport goods.  the st. joseph river and the portage & rocky rivers all converge near the city center, making this area an ideal location for trading and commerce.
today, we continue to enjoy the many benefits of living in such a great location. we invite you to visit and fish our many lakes, kayak our rivers, play in our parks, and enjoy the cultural benefits of having such a richly diverse community.
