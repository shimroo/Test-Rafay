the word "calligraphy" is derived from a greek word meaning beautiful writing. unlike western cultures, chinese calligraphy ("shufa") is valued as "high art" in asian cultures. just as there are masters of painting or martial arts, there were calligraphy masters whose works were highly esteemed by the emperors of chinese dynasties. throughout the history of china, calligraphy has been practiced by national leaders, scholars, and people in all walks of life. chinese calligraphy is not only beautiful art, its practice is also an effective way to enjoy healthy life and longevity. many research reports in asia have rated practicing chinese calligraphy as the number one activity for  longevity among other twenty activities or so.
