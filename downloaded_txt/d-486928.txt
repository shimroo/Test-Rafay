				greetings! my name is wade bartlett. after 30 years of doing this work, with an eye towards the end-game, i am no longer accepting new clients. that's why there is no cv here. or sales pitch. i will leave this page up for informational purposes for at least a while. the papers and essays are mostly related to things that interested me, friction testing, motorcycle dynamics, driver and rider performance and behavior, and event data recorders.
