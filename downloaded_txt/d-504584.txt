our new name!

we opened our doors in 1959, serving the community of rhode island as a mortgage lender under the name home loan & investment association. on march 15th, 2024, we officially changed our name to shoreham bank. as the tides have come and gone, our customers, our business partners, and our company have grown significantly. with our product offerings reaching far beyond just mortgages, our name no longer reflects the products we offer to our community. welcome to shoreham bank!
