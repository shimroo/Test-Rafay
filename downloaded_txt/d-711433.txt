a miracle of nature
seaham harbour is a modern miracle of nature and of human collaboration.
seahamâs known history dates back to saxon or perhaps roman times as evidenced by
    the church of st mary the virgin.
its harbour was hewn from the cliffs in order to transport coal from neighbouring
    mines. mining dominated the landscape for almost 150 years. colliery waste disposal
    from seahamâs three deep mines, which reached out more than 3 miles under the north
    sea, seemed to have irreversibly spoiled the stunningly beautiful beaches and coastline.
    but nature was to have the last word and when the pits finally closed in 1992, the
    sea began a clean up which to many of us is a miracle. the local communities and
    councils worked their socks off to contribute to the transformation which still continues.
 seaham is now a rapidly improving seaside town to be proud of . we hope we can give
    you some  feeling for the place and its people on the  pages of this web site.

seahamâs latest cultural acquisition. located close to barclays bank in the town centre the sculpture was unveiled in a ceremony on sunday, 31 july 2011. the work is by artist brian brown and is dedicated in memory and respect to the industrial heritage of seaham that fuelled the local economy. it is dedicated to all those who worked so hard below ground and under the sea at seaham, dawdon and vane tempest collieries....to provide energy for britainâs homes and industries for so many years risking life and limb.
