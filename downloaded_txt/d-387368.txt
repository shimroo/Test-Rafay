this web page is primarily connected to labs in physics, electronics, 
and photonics. there are a few other items of general interest, such as 
tutorials in pspice, ltspice and latex, and some javascript 
applications to calculate uncertainties in physics labs, to do basic 
statistical calculations, and to measure human reaction time.

latex
		tutorial by example




		ltspice tutorial 

		diagonal components for ltspice 

        i made these to allow drawing things like bridge circuits a 
        little more normally. holding down ctrl while drawing
        lines allows you to make diagonal connections in the editor.

		circuit components library for dia
dia, 
		a drawing program, is what i use for most of my 
		figures. i've created some of my own symbols for things
		like
		
diagonal resistors
diagonal inductors
diagonal capacitors
diagonal leds
diagonal diodes
diagonal zener diodes
polarized capacitors
triacs
relays
optoisloators
triangle wave sources
ramp wave sources
ammeters (horizontal and vertical)
voltmeters (horizontal and vertical)
 
		etc. which aren't in the existing libraries. 
		(for drawing things like bridge circuits, i like to have 
		diagonal elements. also, the "circuit" library led has a 
		line through it, and there is no polarized capacitor, so 
		i've added some symbols. i've also copied the square 
		wave and sine wave sources from the "optics" library.)
	


		signals for block diagrams library for 
                dia (updated 2019)
		to make block diagrams more informative, i've created 
		some of my own symbols for signal types
		like
		
digital signals
analog signals
pulse width modulated (pwm) signals
 
		in both horizontal and vertical versions, and in 
		versions for both single and multiple signals.
		there are also symbols for common interfaces, such as
		
uart
spi
i2c
1-wire
 
		these make it easy for a block diagram to show not only
		what items are connected, but the types of 
		connections between them as well.
