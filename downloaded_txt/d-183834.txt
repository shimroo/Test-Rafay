macdraft pro is the quickest way to get started with professional cad.
macdraft pro has been a staple in our tool belt for years. with a a clean and simple interface, but expanded capabilities, it makes quick work of every job. this latest update includes more new features and interface changes than ever before. we are still discovering capabilities as we work on new projects.

fantastic!
easy of use. macdraft is so much easier to learn and use than autocad. in my work i do mostly wiring diagrams, but the occasional plan and elevation view drawings to scale. macdraft is always my go-to tool!

great intuitive 2d drafting software
i was able to quickly learn the program and start using it for my projects. better features than autocad lt, better pricing than chief architect. sketchup wasn't accurate enough for construction documents.

easy to use, versatile, stable, affordable 2d cad
i use scale drawings in my workshop, going to the print shop, getting building permits, and sharing with contractors. it's never let me down. i've been using macdraft since the late 1980's. i've used it for everything from designing simple posters to very complex buildings costing 6 figures.

nice architectural design software
it is a powerful vector drawing and illustration application for macos. it is used for various technical drawings, illustrations, and designs. the most impactful features include its powerful vector-based drawing engine, layered design structure, context-sensitive editing tools, and comprehensive selection of editing and drawing features. it is relatively easy to use macdraft professional, though users will benefit from some familiarity with basic cad principles. navigation, drawing, and other features are intuitive.

versatile drafting program
this program has created a streamlined way to design and communicate the plans to the clients. this drafting program is very easy to use and can be used across many spectrums of the drawing and design industry. i use this product for cabinet drawings, home layouts, site layouts, and project elevation drawings.

exceptional software!
 i am an architect and designer, i've been using this software for more than 10 years, and i can do from a simple drawing to a complete architectural drawings, easy to use and autocad compatible. easy to use libraries have lots of materials to choose from.

great product for interior design business.
love this product...have been using for about 10 years. run it on my imac and macbook air. i was trained on autocad back in school and before opening my own business, used autocad at the various firms i worked for. when i started my own business i needed a drawing program, but one that could easily work with an imac. i was happy to find macdraft. the transition between autocad and macdraft was pretty seamless, there are differences between the two programs, but if you understand the basics of cad drawing, there should be no issues. i use macdraft for everything design related...furniture plans, cabinetry elevations in bathrooms and kitchens, designing custom furniture, tile detail. highly recommend this program. and customer service is great...always able to connect with someone who wants to help.
