they are giving bud light away

by webmastercategories: enablerstags: beer, bud light, politicscomments: leave a comment


bud light tastes just okay-  it has to be served ice cold, and i prefer a little salt in it to open up what little flavor it has.  but since bud light has become synonymous with a female impersonator named dylan mulvaney, its sales have tanked.  and now they are giving it away, albeit with a rebate coupon.  as scott adams opines, just keep waiting and you will get a free mixer with a lotto ticket pretty soon.

wait another week and anheuser-busch will pay you to drink their beer.https://t.co/vwy9l2lpww #foxnews

80’s-licious coors light commercial

by webmastercategories: belch.comtags: no tagscomments: leave a comment


back in the 80s, nobody drank coors light outside of colorado, but it is as ubiquitous today as miller and bud light.  check out the denim jackets, mullets and hot chicks.

classic beer commercials

by webmastercategories: enablerstags: beercomments: leave a comment


these old ads feature ed mcmahon in his prime, a bunch of stroh’s ads and some fatherly advice to a son that is still living with his parents at 29.

if you want to read the rags to riches story about the stroh’s family check out this article on forbes.

saudis gonna behead this beer smuggler

by webmastercategories: enablerstags: beercomments: leave a comment


it’s just beer. but the saudi’s, who have no sense of humor, will likely make this man wish he was never born. and just who inside this kingdom of morally superior muslims would have purchased these beers?

how to toast around the world

by webmastercategories: enablerstags: beer, culture, toastscomments: leave a comment


just about every culture drinks. the ones that don’t tend to want to blow themselves up. probably because they want a beer so badly. but if you are in other countries, it is helpful to understand the drinking traditions.

iconic margarita stand in disney springs

by webmastercategories: best of the best, enablerstags: disney, margaritacomments: leave a comment


one of my favorite spots in disney is the margarita stand at downtown disney. it has been gone for about a year now as the redesign of downtown disney to make disney springs takes place. but the margarita bar will reopen soon. and this artwork for the stand is awesome.

auto company mistreats pizza man

by webmastercategories: enablerstags: pizzacomments: leave a comment


jackasses at this auto dealership sure do regret leaking this video of them mistreating a pizza delivery guy. what scumbags. pizza delivery has risks of robbery, car accidents, and they have to work in all weather.
