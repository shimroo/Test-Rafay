gym carpet - nationwide installation
many do not realize you can use this specialty carpet for regulation size basketball floors, complete with

paulette in illinois from jan 2002


i am so grateful to the people at daltoncarpet.com for the way they
                        helped us with
                        replacing our gym floor and its surrounding area! from the beginning of the project to its
                        completion, daltoncarpet.com was there to help us at every turn. maegan was not
                        only courteous,
                        professional, knowledgeable and kind but was available through email and/or phone throughout the
                        project and frequently checked in with us to see how we were doing in the planning, installation
                        and post-installation phases. whenever i had a question about anything, she would respond
                        quickly with helpful information. i highly recommend daltoncarpet.com to help
                        anyone with their
                        flooring needs.
                    
pastor bob in illinois from oct 2015


we use dalton carpet for all of our projects and highly recommend them! the service
                        always exceeds expectations, the product is top quality but keeps us within tight budgets. the
                        only place we go for carpet & carpet pad.
