we serve christ through active and engaged worship.

 

god has revealed himself in his creation, in his holy word, and most fully in the person of jesus christ. at cornerstone we strive to know god more fully and develop a personal relationship with him. as we grow deeper in the knowledge of his glory, majesty, grace and love, we seek to live lives submitted to his perfect will.
