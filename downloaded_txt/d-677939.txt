 gift from vesperes. you hotlink and steal without credit, you die in a slow and painful death.a few requirements to be friended: i'm editing this because the other rules? yeah. they looked very stupid, so...001 → no drama whatsoever. i know some of us have things to duke out with people, but i don't want drama to happen in my journal. 002 → my entries are to not to be circulated with people that don't concern them. 003 → i'm a lesbian. i'm intolerant of homophobia. if you're one of those biblethumping christians/whatever religion you are, then stay away. 004 → i'm also an atheist. i'll be tolerant of your religion and your beliefs, but don't force me to convert to your religion. 005 → please tell me a little about yourself in the comment! even if i may seem like a total bitch, i wanna know a little bit about you so that i know what you're like! 006 → if i have you added on greatestjournal, deadjournal, scribbld, lostjournal, insanejournal, or like... deviantart, youtube, last.fm or the like, go ahead and add me! i'll probably wonder who you are, but with links, i'll be able to identify you easily! 007 → i'm not as bitchy/emo/depressed/scary as i sound! i'm actually rather happy, cheerful and optimistic! i may even be childish to you, but i'm just me! 008 → i will overuse "^_^", ":d", "o.o" and other faces. i've learned to cut down on those emoticons, but they'll escape sometimes. :/ see? the emoticon escaped! 009 → i also obsess over things. some of those things are anime, h.i.m and the like. 010 → i'm taken by moedere. sorry, sweet cheeks. ♥~

....you know what really annoys me? liars and hypocrites, and so, this entry is for public eyes to see(i do not give a flying fuck if you give me flames.). for one thing, *you* are never going to read my entries. i might as well tell you that it's not all fun and games when i'm pissed off, oh no. >) now, let's see...how do i do this? lankyanimelass, for one, why did you friend me? if you read my requirements to be friened, i specifically said "+also, i don't friend everyone. do not add me to have a huge friend's list. i will not add you back." so, why should you be friended? give me a valid excuse, and i might friend you. also, the thing about friending some of my friends really does piss me off. if you thought of why people have their journals friends only is because they don't want their entries given out to the public for distribution. also, how long did it take you to credit your icons?! i guess a whole long time, considering the amount of stupidity you possess. now, i am being as sane as possible while writing this. and why did you friend my friends? -.-; that really does make me aggravated, since i'm protective of my friends. now, i think this shall get the damn point through. >/ -zooms off-
