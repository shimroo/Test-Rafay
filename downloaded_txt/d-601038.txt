every 
              generation has its special people ... its geniuses. the 20th century 
              was fortunate to have had the genius of orson welles. actor, writer, 
              director, producer, artist ... there was nothing creative that he 
              could not do and do to perfection! this page is done in an effort 
              to repay this fine talented man for sharing his genius with the 
              world.
