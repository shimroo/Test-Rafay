the freezer’s only
authentic bakery pie
every pie baker and pie lover knows the crust makes all the difference. that’s why, unlike the other pie brands in your grocer’s freezer, wick’s remains loyal to a slower, more traditional pie baking method—involving small-batch mixers and a dough-rolling process that takes the time necessary to achieve a genuine flaky crust.
