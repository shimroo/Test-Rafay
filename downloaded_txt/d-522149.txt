 we started with our oldest daughter at 5 years old. she's very spirited and physical. she fell in love immediately.
after watching for 3 years our youngest daughter who has down syndrome was able to start taking classes. she is treated just the same as the other students and given the same expectations with modifications when needed. the appreciation for special needs at this school is like no other children's activities we have been a part of.
i finally decided to try one of the mother's day specials and after taking class for a month decided i enjoyed it enough to start to practise for myself. i love seeing my body get better at kicks and punches and strive to memorise the form.
we love the school and the instructors and staff.  
          molly r.        





 this has been so great for our child. he is transforming into a more confident, dedicated, and hardworking kid. the teachers are phenomenal. they teach important values like discipline, respect, altruism and doing the right thing. we have been completely satisfied with the school and we will be enrolling our younger two daughters when they are old enough to join.  
          brent p.        





 we love master schreiber's academy and are so glad we joined. not only are they organised and professional, all the teachers are patient and kind. we take classes as a family, and it's been a great way to excercise and spend time together. even during the covid shelter in place order, we are still able to train and test, keeping us on track with our goals for becoming black belts. i highly recommend master schreiber's academy.  
          julie s.        





 this school has been a gift of community and strength, especially during these difficult times when resiliency is needed most. the structure and positive lessons have made a noticeable impact on my daughter's ability to follow direction and build self-confidence. i highly recommend master schreiber's programme.  
          michelle j.        





 the classes are great and teach the kids to be focused as well as the soft skills. i love the lessons on bully prevention and stranger danger. you guys have been great keeping everything going through the pandemic.  
          jessica h.        





 excellent in delivering lessons via zoom and in-person classes. making sure of students' safety and i love the video showing new protocols and rules before entering the room. very detailed and keeping us informed all the time. thank you!  
          bing p.        





 after two years of enrollment, i continue to be impressed! master schreiber's academy is excellent on so many levels.
my son struggled with impulse control and a very short attention span. several people suggested that martial arts might help him. so i signed him up; but the first school was not a good fit for various reasons.
this school is the exact opposite: welcoming family feel, very positive instruction, well trained engaging teachers who make personal connections with the kids, instructors learn each child's name, smaller class size for younger kids...a perfect fit for my son!
he has grown tremendously in his confidence, his focus and his discipline. he wants to practise at home! he is also maintaining positive relationship connections. he feels believed in at this academy and he now aspires to become a good leader.
master schreiber's martial arts programme continues to be a great investment into my son's self-control and character development.
master schreiber and his wonderful staff quickly adjusted to the covid-19 shelter in place restrictions and did not miss a beat! not only did they move live instruction online, they also added additional benefits like on demand video classes and exercise classes. these exercise and taekwondo classes became an essential parts of our shelter in place school schedule. seeing the familiar faces of instructors and classmates helped put my son's worries at easy and strengthened him to handle the isolation of shelter in place. his whole world drastically changed (no more school), but so much of his experience with martial arts remained the same. awesome job! very grateful!

 amazing school, i have two kids there and can't wait for my toddler to join. i can see my kids growing and building their self confidence and respectful positive attitude since they joined ata martial arts. also their focus and sharpness improved. all the team members are very professional and caring.  
          mia s.        





 my son has been attending for several years, and has made significant strides in his attitude and commitment.  
          alejandro v.        





 our daughter started tiny tigers when she was 3. by the time she entered preschool at 4, teachers were amazed by her focus, discipline, and her great manners towards everyone. she continues to develop and thrive with confidence over the years. at 7, she's one belt away from black belt. we highly recommend master schreiber's academy for kids and adults!  
          daniah b.        





 my three boys and i have been taking lessons for about 2-3 years now and we love it! they not only focus on taekwondo skills, but also respect, bully prevention and self defense. they have also adapted the school incredibly well to an online platform so we didn't miss a second of training during this self isolation period.  
          christina g.        





 it is a wonderful programme and school my daughter has learned so much and very respectful and responsible, thank you!  
          fenwick s.        





 i have seen my son go from a child that barely made it through 10 minutes of class and was very disruptive to being able to handle up to a 45 minute class. even in his virtual classes, he is able to pay attention and follow along with the moves. he handles them better than i thought a 6 year old ever would. the staff have been able to adapt to work with my child's special needs and help him become successful.  
          allison e.        





 the zoom classes have been a great way to keep our son engaged in karate during the 2 months of quarantine. he also did the parents night in and some of the morning exercises and weapons training classes. we've really appreciated how interactive the classes have been and how they continue to encourage life skills and leadership at home.  
          ashley p.        





 dedication and passion alone from this school and instructors is a prize in itself. i love the whole experience this school provides and i encourage all to try.  
          erin b.        





 we have had an amazing training experience with master schreiber's ata! the whole team is great with the kids, organized and communicate well. classes are structured and thoughtfully put together. they offer tons of extra opportunities to train and keep kids pushing towards their goals. they go above and beyond to create fun ways for the kids to stay involved and truly make it feel like a family. we feel grateful for our daughter to train with them!  
          danny d.        





 this is an outstanding martial arts school. i view the school as a comprehensive experience encompassing martial arts, leadership, life skills, and practical self-defence. i highly recommend this school to anybody.  
          joshua b.        





 i am both the parent of two students and a student myself at this school. we've been students here for about 9 months and have enjoyed it a great deal. master schreiber is a highly accomplished man who makes for an enjoyable learning environment. i've seen my kids grow while they learn valuable life skills. the staff at the ata school is also well trained and fun to work with. i myself have done things that i didn't think i could do anymore at my age so i've been very happy with my training. but probably the best aspect of this ata school is the positive attitude that is emphasized here by everyone. it is a very healthy place to be, both physically and spiritually.  
          matthew h.        





 many people are surprised that i drive in peak hour traffic for an hour to bring my son to ata for martial arts. i had researched a lot of facilities near our house, but none compared to the dedication & attention that the teachers at ata give each student. thank you for the hard work that you do with all your heart!  
          neeru d.        





 my oldest daughter has been attending for 2 and a half years. she has come out of her shell, she now has confidence to speak to others, perform her graduation form and get up on stage for her talent show performances. her goal is to be a black belt at age 9, she's almost there!
my other daughter has down syndrome and watched her sister for 2 years before being ready to start taking classes. the teachers are amazing with her. they expect the same performance, focus and outcome from her as all the other students. however, they know when to step in and provide support, extra encouragement or time. she has graduated at every chance and is keeping up with her peers.
we recommend this school to everyone.  
          molly r.        





 love how children here learn discipline, respect and gain confidence every single day! my son has shown much more confidence and willpower since joining ata. he is also paying more
attention in class at school and showing more enthusiasm all around. the instructors are very knowledgeable and spend time with each student to show them proper stance, form, and movements. it's a great place for children! not only do you learn martial arts, they also teach students about safety, fire, bullying and other important subjects that kids should learn. thank you ata and master schreiber for a job well done!  
          priscilla n.        





 master schreiber and his other employees are great to work with. everyone is understanding of everyone's learning pace and if i or anyone have trouble they take time during class to make sure you understand what was just shown.
this is my first time taking any kind of martial arts class/training and i would recommend it and have to my friends and family. they are proud of me for choosing an activity and sticking with it....i do know if it weren't for the understanding and caring instructors i wouldn't have agreed to sign up.  
          caitlin s.        





 excellent school where my son is learning self defense, confidence, respectful behavior and the importance of community service. best of all, in a fun and caring environment.  
          brenda v.        





 master schreiber's martial arts studio is such a wonderful place for my daughter to learn strength, discipline, body awareness and leadership. the studio is family friendly and has become a part of our family. i recommend this experience to everyone!  
          julie l.        





 my son has shown more confidence & discipline since joining ata. the teachers concentrate on each student & ensure they learn the forms properly.  
          neeru d.        





 my son loves class and is learning a lot, not just in terms of martial arts, but also in terms of his character. he feels like part of the community of the school, and is readily improving.
the instructors are firm, but kind, with young children, and demonstrate the moves in a way that shows an understanding of the physical development of children.  
          laura m.        





 good place for kids to learn self-esteem and self-defence.  
          vahida m.        





 the best martial arts school in the area. my son has developed his taekwondo skills and at the same time he is becoming self confident. thanks to master schreiber and all the team!  
          job g.        





 our son is really enjoying the instruction and has gained confidence and focus from attending.  
          carmella s.        





 this school offers not only self defence skills but life skills that the children will carry with them forever. highly recommend.  
          jamie s.        





 our son now looks adults in the eye and stands up straight when he talks to them, and holds himself with confidence. also he has defended himself against other kids trying to bully him with a well-placed poke he learned from joint manipulation or jujitsu. i felt so comfortable bringing him to this school because of the emphasis on the monthly values, public speaking, and the thoughtful explanations.  
          marsha p.        





 at master schreiber's ata students learn more than physical martial arts. they learn valuable skills that will carry them through life - discipline, respect, integrity, confidence, and hard work!  
          jeanne w.        





 our 5-year-old has only been taking class for a few months and already we notice major improvements in his strength and coordination. he is focused and attentive in class and that has also affected his life beyond taekwondo. it's great exercise, the teachers are really good with young kids, and our child is internalizing some of the principles discussed in class. he loves it! and so do we!  
          laura m.        





 the classes are very structured and engaging. my kids have learned a lot about self-defence in a short timeframe as well as boosting their overall confidence. thank you.  
          charissa c.        





 my daughter loves going to her martial arts class. she has been attending the school for about 3-4 years now and i have noticed her becoming more coordinated and physically stronger as well as more disciplined for her age. the instructors are all great with the kids and make learning fun. we would definitely recommend this school to anyone!  
          corinne z.        





 the school is fantastic and has helped our son immensely with self-discipline, responsibility, physical fitness and respect. we love master schreiber's!  
          vanessa p.        





 master schreiber runs a top notch school.my grandson has developed self esteem and a presence that is conducive to his excelling in life.  
          patte n.        





 love the topics covered and the way they are presented in the programs. my kids really enjoy taking taekwondo here.  
          jenn d.        





 as working parents who implement structure and discipline at home, we exceptionally value the consistency of how martial arts coincides with what has been fostered through our child's experiences. we visibly see your passion, dedication, and patience in working with our four- year-old, which reaffirms that you work & understand your students individually, taking into consideration their age and level of emotional maturity.  
          emily u.        





 my son has trained here for nearly 5 years. senior master schreiber and team show such dedication to the students. the school is run with professionalism, care and all in a fun environment. it has certainly helped improve my son's focus.

hello, i'm chief master jordan schreiber
i took my first martial arts class over 40 years ago when i was 9 years old, and that decision transformed my life. since then, i have seen thousands of students enjoy the lifelong benefits of martial arts training — including my son griffin and my daughter seraphine.
my passion for working with kids springs from my upbringing in a family of 14 children, 10 of them adopted. i have developed a self-defence, life skills, and leadership skills curriculum that draws on my martial arts experience and my education at harvard and at oxford, where i met my wife helena. she lived with me in america for 25 years, and in 2021 we returned to oxfordshire with our kids.
take advantage of our free introductory lesson offer today, and join us as we improve our fitness while building skills for safety and success!
