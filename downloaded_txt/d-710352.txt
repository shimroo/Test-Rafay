special cover update!all files have been uploaded onto yousendit.complease leave a comment when you download and let us know what you took ^.^if you absolutely love or abhor the songs, leave a comment and let us know. we cater to the masses.and don't delete the files from ysi. if you do, we'll stop this. don't ruin it for everyone else.remember: support the artists. if you like what you hear, go buy it!boris' pickssong: dreamsartist: faye wong (王菲)album: chungking express [soundtrack]genre: rock, coverlanguage: cantonesereleased: 2004 (released)official sitecomments: faye wong's this super awesome c-pop singer. this song is from the soundtrack to the 1994 movie "chong qing sen lin", better known in english-speaking countries as "chungking express". she was also one of the leads (opposite tony leung <3) and was so cute in it. i totally recommend it times one million. but anyway, this is her cover of the cranberries song "dreams". the lyrics have been changed to cantonese and it's so pretty! the instrumentation is nearly identical to the cranberries version, but her sweet voice makes it so beautiful. maybe even better than the original...downloadsong: dreamsartist: the cranberriesalbum: everybody else is doing it, so why can't we?genre: rocklanguage: englishreleased: 1993official sitecomments: the cranberries is an irish rock band that had a couple big hits in the mid-90's (my personal favourite is "zombie"). this song is from their 1993 debut album. the lead vocals (supplied by dolores o'riordan) are nearly as sweet as faye wong's, but they are a bit more gritty. one of my favourite 90's alt-rock hits (i grew up on this stuff!). downloadsong: yer bluesartist: shiina ringo (椎名林檎)album: utaite myouri (唄ひ手冥利-其ﾉ壱)genre: rock, coverlanguage: englishreleased: 2002official sitecomments: this is from shiina ringo's cover double album. this song is a cover from the infamous beatles' white album. it's a brilliant cover because she totally makes it hers. she throws together all sorts of sounds into a cacophony of drums, guitars and everything, making a distinctly shiina ringo recording. her voice is crazy gritty too. such a great song.downloadsong: yer bluesartist: the beatlesalbum: the beatles (white album)genre: rocklanguage: englishreleased: 1968official sitecomments: anyone who doesn't know who the beatles are should come on out of the cave... even though they broke up over 30 years ago and half of them are now dead, they still have had such an immense impact on virtually anything musical. seriously. i took a class on the subject. but anyway, lennon's vocals are brilliant... and screamy. so bloody passionate. the music itself is just your basic blues progression... with a whole lot of rock-and-roll mixed in. definitely a throw-back to early rock by chuck berry or something. totally awesome.downloadsong: gloomy sundayartist: jaurim (자우림)album: the youth admiration (靑春禮讚)genre: rock, coverlanguage: englishreleased: 2005official sitecomments: this song is from the jaurim cover album that came out about a week ago (i work fast when it comes to jaurim!). it's a cover of an hungarian song (szomorú  vasárnap) that countless people have sung (billie holliday, sarah mclaughlin, sarah brightman, sinéad o'connor, bjork... etc etc etc). it was written in the 1930's by rezsô seress (english lyrics are by sam m lewis) and has been come to be known as the "hungarian suicide song" because it has been linked to dozens of suicides. it was even banned in hungary! with good reason too... this may be the saddest song i have ever heard. jaurim's rendition of it is absolutely brilliant and totally captures the utter despair and melancholy. the way the guitars or the orchestra mixes with kim yoon-ah's voice is absolutely flawless.  downloadsong: gloomy sunday artist: billie hollidayalbum: lady day: the best of billie holiday genre: jazz, coverlanguage: englishreleased: 1941official sitecomments: this is the version of gloomy sunday that made it a world-wide hit. before this, its success was limited to hungary. sung by the infamous billie holliday, she conveys this incredibly sad theme in a powerful way. the instrumentation is only a small lounge band with brass and a piano, which is interesting to note the contrast between the two songs. one is like a requiem with guitars and violins while the other is like a funeral dirge. brilliant song.download-------------nicole's pickssong: hito natsu no keiken (ひと夏の経験)artist: momoe yamaguchi (山口百恵)album: 15sai no theme hito natsu no keiken (15才のテーマ ひと夏の経験)genre: poplanguage: japanesereleased: 1974official sitecomments: momoe's 5th single and one of her classics. it was the one that made her really popular and also the first one i was obsessed with. it has some rathar suggestive lyrics for 14 year old momoe to be singing, but it's a great song. a subdued song which compliment momoe's vocals wonderfully. highly reccomended.(also, this is actually from the best of album, because the album track has talking at the begining. but i like this picture better. hehe.)downloadsong: hito natsu no keiken (ひと夏の経験)artist: go!go!7188album: tora no anagenre: rocklanguage: japanesereleased: 2002official sitecomments: go!go!7188 is a 3-person rock group with yuu (vocals+guitar), akko (vocals+bass) and turkey (drums). this is off their cover album which came out in 2002. this is also one of the only songs with akko as the lead singer. they made one of my favorite songs completely rock, and a totally different song in some aspects. i love the backing guitar in the verses here.downloadsong: shuuchakueki (終着駅)artist: chiyo okumura (奥村チヨ)album: golden bestgenre: poplanguage: japanesereleased: 1971official sitecomments: chiyo okumura is a popular late '60s singer, who became big with "koi no dorei". yay, i love chiyo! this is one of her more subdued songs, but very pretty. her voice goes perfectly with the instrumentation. i love how she's able to go from subdued to strong with the same voice.downloadsong: shuuchakueki (終着駅)artist: hibari misora (美空ひばり)album: box: kizuna (絆)genre: poplanguage: japanesereleased: 1976official sitecomments: hibari misora is a huge singer in japanese pop history. she debuted in 1949 at the age of 12. her carrer spanned from her debut to 1989, when she died.i was looking over the "kizuna" listing and recognized the kanji to this song, and i found out that she covered chiyo. which came as such a suprise to me. i like chiyo's version better, but misora's voice gives it a very different style, which i still enjoy.downloadsong: furimukunai de (ふりむくないで)artist: the peanuts ( ザ・ピ－ナッツ)album: the peanuts: best ofgenre: poplanguage: japanesereleased: 1962official sitecomments: the peanuts are an identical twin duo who debuted in 1959 with "kawaii hana". they are extremely popular artists and icons in japanese pop history. this is one of their most popular songs, with a very '60s sound. it's a very upbeat and happy song, i highly reccomend it.downloadsong: furimukunai de (ふりむくないで)artist: winkalbum: wink memories 1988-1996genre: poplanguage: japanesereleased: 1992official sitecomments: wink is a popular duo who debuted in 1988 with the single "sugar baby love". they hit it big with their third single and had steady popularity until 1996 when they disbanded.this was their 15th single and a cover of the peanuts song above. keeping the same bouncy flow of the song, but updating it with a very late-'80s early-'90s sound, fitting wink's voices better than if had kepted the original sound, imo.downloadsong: tango noirartist: akina nakamori (中森明菜)album: singles 27 1982-1991genre: poplanguage: japanesereleased: 1987official sitecomments: akina nakamori was one of the heavy-weights in jpop during the '80s. every single of hers reached the first spot, and many as considered classics today.this was her 18th single and still quite popular today. a very '80s sounding, slower paced song. the slow distinct beats mixed with akina deep, beautiful voice make it a song which'll get stuck in your head. while not my favorite akina song, it certianly shows how great a typical single of hers sounds.downloadsong: tango noirartist: nana katase (片瀬那奈)album: extendedgenre: poplanguage: japanesereleased: 2004official sitecomments: nana katase was a gravure idol before she was picked up by avex. she got mild success with her singles "galaxy" and "telepathy". in 2004 she released a cover album "extended", covering various 80s songs, including this song. all of the songs have a very techno sound added to them, while using the regular '80s sounding beats, making for a very interesting mix. this is probably my favorite song i've heard off the album, i love how the slower pace of the song works with her voice and the new sound. download

to mandarin. as far as this song goes, it's interesting with the strings and the general mess and confusion of instruments in the background. her voice is distorted and sounds beautiful during the chorus. check it out and experience the awesomeness of faye wongdownloadsong: calntsye (солнце)artist: nochnyi snaipery (ночные снайперы)album: detskii lyepyet(детский лепет)genre: rocklanguage: russianreleased: 2002official sitecomments: nochnyi snaipery was originally this russian rock duo made up of diana arbyenina (vocals) and svetlana surganova (violin). since then, the band's added members and the violinist surganova has left the band. but this song is from their second album, so she's still around. i bought a post-svetlana live album and really liked it... enough to find the older albums. and the songs are made so much better with the violins. this song is beautiful and sweeping. the singer actually reminds me a lot of zemfira, but the style of the music is completely different due to the instrumentation. pretty cool.downloadsong: veter i noch (ветер и ночь)artist: nochniye snaipery (ночные снайперы)album: dyetskii lyepyet (детский лепет) genre: rocklanguage: russianreleased: 2002official sitecomments: this song is more upbeat than the previous one. the violin and the sweet vocals over the continuously repeating guitar riff is really beautiful. it's sorta repetitive, but i especially like when the singer goes into her lower register during the chorus. it has sort of a folky flavour. very pretty.downloadrequested re-uploadsjaurim - geu rae, je gil na i ruh ge sal a sserjaurim - ha ha ha songjaurim - hey guyzjaurim - keunyeoa dandulijaurim - vlad-------------nicole's pickssong: toj den (той день)artist: okean elzy (океан ельзи)album: yananebibuv (янанебiбув)genre: rocklanguage: ukrainianreleased: 2000official sitecomments: okean elzy is a ukrainian band who debuted in 2000 with this album. there are currently 5 members, though this album was created with just 4 members.i just picked up this album at a local russian store, so please forgive my lack of knowledge on the band. this is the second song on the album, and i'm currently obsessed with it. i love the vocalist's raw vocals, and i love the sound of the song. it reminds me partially of a the back horn and luna sea mix, so if you either of those bands, be sure to pick this up.downloadsong: dreaming i was dreamingartist: namie amuroalbum: 181920genre: poplanguage: japanesereleased: 1998official sitecomments: namie debuted in 1992 with the super monkeys. in 1995 she hit it big with "try me ~watashi wo shinjite~". she was picked up by super producer tetsuya komuro. she became a pop sensation through 1995 until 1998, when she released this best of album and went on ayear break to have her son, haruto. though her immense popularity waned, she has gotten popular with her recent album ("queen of hip-pop") and singles.this was a single that was released just before her haitus, and is only available on single and this best of album. at first i wasn't that fond of this song, but after watching the pv and a live peformance of it at the time, i fell in love with it. it's a very slow paced r&b infused song. it's one of my favorite namie songs ever, and i highly reccomend it.downloadsong: hum to bhai jaise hainartist: lata mangeshkar album: veer-zaaragenre: soundtracklanguage: hindireleased: 2004official sitecomments: veer-zaara is a hindi film that came out late last year to much acclaim. the soundtrack was specially made of songs composed by popular old bollywood composer madan mohan.while i'm not as awed at this soundtrack as "devdas", it's got some very pretty songs on it. this is one of them. this song strays from the general sound of the film of epic songs with duets, in that this is sung only by female single lata mangeshkar, and it's got a bit of a bounce to it. it's a nice song to listen to.download

^.^downloadsong: gourmandisesartist: alizéealbum: gourmandisesgenre: poplanguage: french released: 2000official sitecomments: alizée is a french pop princess who had a bunch of big hits. when i visited france, the tour guide turned up some french tunes and the first one was another song from this album, moi... lolita. since then, i've been an alizée fan. seriously. this song is the title track from her first of two albums and it's really brilliant. it starts out with this piano riff that plays throughout the song and slowly adds percussion and synth, then vocals and bass. and it continues like that for nearly the rest of the song. it's a simple song with a great beat and fun vocals. in my opinion, it's the best song on the album.downloadsong: 2 + 2 = 5 [live]artist: radioheadalbum: com lag: 2+2=5genre: rocklanguage: english released: 2004official sitecomments: radiohead is awesome. they've been around since 1993 and have since recorded six albums, as well as countless singles and a couple live albums. this album is their most recent live album that was made exclusively for japan. in fact, i believe that the package said "for sale in japan only"... nevertheless i bought it for an exorbidant price in new york city. this recording is live at earl's court in london and it's brilliant. the song is from their most recent album hail to the thief, but i never really paid much attention to the particular song until i heard the live. the energy that the band exudes with a live performance just makes the song so much better and infinitely more powerful. yorke's vocals are absolutely beautiful and the way the music fits together is nothing short of genius. yea. radiohead is awesome.downloadsong: re te (레테)artist: jaurim (자우림)album: 2.5 (b 定規作業)genre: rocklanguage: korean released: 1999official sitecomments: jaurim is a kick ass korean rock band. this song is from their b-sides and remixes album. it's a very beautiful, very mellow song. most of the song is just kim yoon ah's voice accompanied with a guitar - very simple. there is some light percussion and synth that shows up every once in a while and it isn't until the chorus when they bring in the bass, lead guitar and any kind of heavy drums. and even then, it's not that heavy. it's a very sweet and pretty song. check it out if you've liked the other jaurim songs that i've been so keen to post. downloadsong: travelingartist: hikaru utada (宇多田ヒカル)album: deep rivergenre: poplanguage: japanese released: 2002official sitecomments: hikaru utada was at one time the most popular singer in japan, but she's had a demi-hiatus in the past couple years. but it's not really a hiatus... she just hasn't put out a japanese album aside from a best of album. she tried to find a market in the us last year with her album exodus, which basically floundered. anyway. traveling is freaking awesome. it's got an awesome beat and i've found myself dancing like a maniac while listening to it... all while i'm driving. no wonder people look at me strangely... it also has an absolutely fabulous video (directed by her husband - the director of the movie casshern!). hopefully, i'll be able to upload the video in a future rotation because the file's a bit... lost. but yea. great song. check it out. and if you stumble on the video, check that one out too! ^.^download---------------nicole's pickssong: rinne (輪廻)artist: momoe yamaguchi (山口百恵)album: this is my trialgenre: pop/rocklanguage: japanesereleased: 1980official sitecomments: momoe is a very popular '70s soloist, and one of my favorite artists ever. check here and various other posts for more background.this is one of the first albums i pick up from her. it is her very last album to be brought out before she left the music business.this is the first track off the album, and has been a favorite of mine since i first listened to it. a slow paces yet catchy song with an addictive beat. it really showcases how deep momoe's voice was near the end of her carrer. i can't think of any other adjective to descrive this song other than completely sexy. i love this song and i love momoe. i highly reccomend this song to everyone.downloadsong: jusui negai (入水願い)artist: tokyo jihen (東京事変)album: kyokiku (教育)genre: rocklanguage: japanesereleased: 2004official sitecomments: tokyo jihen is the band formed by shiina ringo and her band for the "electric mole" live tour. they recently lost guitarist mikio hirama and pianist masayuki hiizumi.i love and adore shiina ringo, and it's only natural for me to love tokyo jihen. this is probably my favorite song on their first album "kyokiku". it's the third track and really shows the talents of all members of the band. it's a fusion rock song (like most of shiina ringo/tokyo jihen's music) with bits of jazz mixed in. and a great mix of all vocals/guitar/bass/drums/piano, and quite a catchy song to top it off. downloadsong: alone in my roomartist: ami suzuki (鈴木あみ)album: fun for fangenre: poplanguage: japanesereleased: 1998official sitecomments: ami suzuki debuted in 1997 on sony being produced by tetsuya komuro. became a very big artist and put out hits like "be together" and "all night long". she then sued sony for mismanagement, and won. however she was then blacklisted, and was out of the music indrustry for 3 years. in early 2004 she then started releasing music independently and after her 2nd independent single peaked at 20 on the oricon she for a record contract with big label avex. she'll be releasing a new album, "around the world", on october 5th.ami suzuki, also known as amigo, is one of my favorite artists. and "alone in my room" is quite possibly my favorite amigo song. though the opening often confuses me with namie amuro's very dancey "you're my sunshine", (another of my favorite songs) it soon shanges into a totally different kind of song. a very laid back and happy sound song, ami's vocals give it a very unique sound. i highly reccomend this song.downloadsong: imitationartist: luna seaalbum: imagegenre: rocklanguage: japanesereleased: 1992official sitecomments: luna sea is a band made up of ryuichi, sugizo, j, inoran, and shinya. they debuted in 1989 with their indie album "luna sea", under the x. they then got picked up by rca and released 6 albums under them under them before disbanding in 2000.this is from their 2nd original album, first major record album, and my favorite by them "image". this is also my favorite song by them. it's very much like the entire album soundwise, but quite a different song. it has such a lovely beat and awesome background guitar. and ryuichi's vocals are not quite as refined as they are in their later songs, and that makes it completely perfect for this sound. it's just an awesome song which i completely love. so get it and love it too!downloadsong: mannatsu no tremolo (真夏のトレモロ)artist: winkalbum: memories 88-96genre: poplanguage: japanesereleased: 1996 (original in 1991)official sitecomments: i haven't posted a wink song since the very first update! i think i'm quite due.wink is a popular duo who deuted in 1988 with the single "sugar baby love". though it wasn't until their 3rd single, and a kylie minogue cover "ai ga tomaranai -turn it into love-" that they really gained popularity. they conuinued with hits like "samishii nettaigyou" and "sakihokore itoshisayo" until 1996 when they disbanded.this is one of my favorite wink songs. a great loud and fast dance song that reeks of early 90s pop sounds. mixed with sachiko and aida's light vocals, it's really a fun song to sing to.downloadsong: ballad of a thin manartist: bob dylanalbum: highway 61 revisitedgenre: rocklanguage: englishreleased: 1965official sitecomments: bob dylan is one of the most influential artists in music history. and he's awesome. that's all you really need to know. hehe.however much criticism dylan gets for his vocals, i can never seem to have the same views. and this song is one of the songs that really prove how much his vocals match. his vocals here are very bitter sounding, and it does nothing but match and compliment the overall sound of the song. this is one of my favorite dylan songs, interesting/random lyrics and all.download
