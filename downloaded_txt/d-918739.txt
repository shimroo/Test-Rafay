why is mzone megapain therapy so much more effective than the competition? take a look at one of the more popular brands which has 30% methyl salicylate ( synthetic wintergreen ) and 10% menthol. the rest is just water and some waxes to make a cream. mzone megapain therapy has 38% methyl salicylate, 16% menthol, and 3% camphor. and what are our 'inactive' ingredients? eucalyptus oil, lavender oil, tea tree oil,  anise oil, kukui nut oil, jojoba oil, and of course canyon river pure premium emu oil™. we also add a little bit of benzyl alcohol, a popular ingredient in calamine lotions. it has some good anti bacterial and anti itch characteristics.
canyon river pure premium emu oil™ is a very effective deep penetrating, moisturizing and therapeutic product from canyon river naturals. this pharmaceutical grade emu oil is the world's highest quality pure emu oil. emu oil is an extraordinary emollient used for thousands of years by native australians for its remarkable anti-inflammatory and healing properties. the beneficial healing, penetrating, and anti-inflammatory properties of premuflo™ processed emu oil form the basis of our patented crn transdermal delivery system™.
the original philosophy of canyon river naturals™ was to create the ultimate delivery system to ensure that essential healing, rejuvenating, and super anti-oxidant nutrients are reaching the areas that need them most, not decomposing on the skin's surface.â proven delivery technology.â the highest quality ingredients. a very powerful combination!

featured product - premugest™
 premugest™ natural progesterone cream is the culmination of years of research, using a synergistic combination of emu oil and natural progesterone so effective it has been awarded it's own patent. canyon river naturals' philosophy is to create the ultimate delivery system to help ensure that the natural progesterone, essential healing, rejuvenating, and super anti-oxidant nutrients reach the areas that need them most and don't just sit there decomposing on the skin's surface. no blue food coloring or other non-essential items are added to premugest™ natural progesterone cream. no other natural progesterone cream penetrates as deeply and effectively as premugest™ natural progesterone cream. no perfumes are added to try and mask odors ... no 'filler' ingredients are added to make the ingredient list longer. and to make things even better, premugest™ natural progesterone cream costs less per ounce than any of its competitors.

one of our more popular products is premugest natural progesterone cream™.
natural progesterone is a hormone produced by both women and men, although to a lesser extent in men, and is an important precursor in the biosynthesis of other hormones in the human body. the use of natural progesterone has been linked to the relief of hot flashes, mood swings, bloating, loss of libido, vaginal dryness, and other uncomfortable symptoms associated with menopause and pre-menstrual syndrome (pms). it is also useful in counteracting the damaging effects of estrogen dominance. natural progesterone attaches to and blocks the receptors for estrogen molecules and estrogen-like compounds, causing them to travel through the body and eventually to be metabolized and excreted in urine. natural progesterone also has been shown to alleviate, prevent, or even actually reverse osteoporosis.
