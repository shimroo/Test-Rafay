the peace gallery began in 1997 to support the third goal of the peace corps - "to strengthen americans' understanding about the world and its peoples."  with hundreds of photos with descriptions by returned peace corps volunteers, the peace gallery provides a view of the world rarely seen outside of the peace corps experience.
