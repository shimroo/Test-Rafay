we had a family vacation in wawa in summer 2019. the chalet was terrific and well cared for. two adults and three kids stayed with room to spare.maureen was kind enough to show us through a little trail they have on their property and shared some moments feeding birds and squirrels. my kids got to feed birds right out of there hands. lasting impression!of course lake superior was amazing. everything is pretty close by to get you through an extended vacation here, including groceries and restaurants. please consider a stay here if wawa is in your sights.

stopped in wawa on our way back home this motel was perfect! owners were super responsible in maintaining the distancing and our room during covid19 - ice was left in our room as requested in my online reservation thanks so much! spotlessly clean and had all the amenities for a very comfortable stay. what motel has double sinks?? the room was exactly as presented on line - very cozy. thank you again maureen and john, we will be back to explore the area!

such a warm, inviting room! so many little touches that made our stay “homey”. also spotlessly clean- so important during covid times- we didn’t even use our own bedding which i had with us. easy check in- just grabbed our envelope on the door & backed our pick up right to the room door. would definitely stay there again

very clean, very comfortable and very accommodating hosts! we recently stayed here on our way west, after a harrowing drive/detour due to highway closure. we stayed in one of the rooms and smiled at the friendly touches in the room. a much welcomed break after a difficult day on the road. it's a little out the way, so make sure you stock up in nearby wawa before stopping for the day. we'll certainly stay again if we're in the area.
