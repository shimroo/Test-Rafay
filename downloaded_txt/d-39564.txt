moving out of family home to live with roomate

strategies to improve your e-commerce store

   


the ecommerce store owner’s guide to improving business you have finally opened your e-commerce store and are ready to take on the world. before you do anything, it is important that you evaluate how well your store is doing in terms of conversion rates and revenue. if these numbers are not where they need to be, then now is the time to make some changes so that everything can run smoother. if you’re looking for ways to improve your store, then check out the following: · – evaluate your current conversion rates and revenue. these will help you identify any problems with how visitors are finding or interacting with your products. if there is something that needs to be fixed, it’s important that you address these issues as soon as possible because they could lead to a decrease in traffic on your site overall. · – create a streamlined checkout process so that people don’t get tired of trying to complete their orders and leave before completing them successfully. you can also go with a third party processor like bluesnap that would make this easy for you. this means reducing wait times by processing payments more quickly, providing links for social media accounts where customers can find answers about shipping policies without having to go back through the entire purchase process again, and creating an easy return policy (or at least letting customers know that there is a return policy in place). · – make sure your product descriptions are clear and concise. use all the features of html to make them attractive while still being easy for visitors to read. · · keep each page focused on one particular aspect, so it’s easier for people browsing through your site to find what they want without getting distracted by everything else you have available. include links with titles at the top of every page that lets visitors get back if they accidentally click off or go down another tab halfway through checking out an item (or anything else you offer). and consider using “quick view” buttons next to products on longer pages where viewers can easily scroll through pictures or other illustrations instead of having to go to the bottom of a page and click on each one individually. · · add more pictures of products, so people can see what they’re buying before they buy it. include multiple angles in every photo you post: front shots from different distances and close-ups for things that are important like stitching or buttons; side views to give shoppers an idea about how something will fit them; backside images for when someone is considering whether to purchase clothing online rather than trying it on first. be sure your photos are clear enough that customers can zoom in without pixelation or fuzzy images ruining the quality (and accompanying their shopping experience). and don’t forget non-product photography too! if your blog posts regularly include activities with friends, such as camping trips and skiing jaunts, be sure to include pictures of your friends. customers are much more likely to buy something they can visualize themselves enjoying with a group of their own peers or children, than alone at home. your marketing efforts should also focus on conversion optimization: making it as easy as possible for customers to make purchases in the store without any confusion about what you’re selling or how much an item costs. make sure that there’s clear pricing information both within individual posts and in general across all pages so that shoppers don’t have to do math just because their purchase wasn’t instantaneously finalized after entering credit card numbers (which may not always happen). one way this is currently done is by including price tags on each product image–though some e-commerce stores like amazon have taken the further step of including prices on each page.

renting equipment for your business: how to optimize your spend

   


why is renting business equipment a smart decision? if you’re just getting started with your business, you might be considering whether it is better to lease or buy equipment. while this decision can be tough to make, there are a few things that will help you decide which option is best for your company. in this blog post, we will explore the following: -what type of equipment do i need? -which lease payment options are available? -how much does leasing cost? -what are some benefits of leasing? we’ll explore these questions in more depth below. first up, let’s take a look at what type of equipment you’re looking to use before deciding whether or not this can be leased. not every piece of equipment can be rented – only certain types are eligible such as office furniture, tools (non power) etc. if your company needs heavy duty machinery that will last many years then it is probably best that you buy rather than rent so you know how much money your budget will cover over time. however if you need something that is short term, such as a laptop or office chair then it may be worth leasing so you can avoid buying the equipment. benefits of leasing: -you don’t have to make an expensive upfront payment which could leave your budget low after other costs are factored in. this means you won’t need outside funding from an investor or business loan provider -the contract period for most leases ranges between 12 – 36 months and at the end of this time frame there is typically no obligation on either side meaning if something goes wrong, one party isn’t stuck with any leftover debt attached to it do i have to sign a long term contract with my lease provider? in some instances yes but increasingly lease providers are now offering more flexible terms. the hire guys balcatta have outstanding deals on all equipment you can rent from them. benefits of renting: -you can try out the equipment first, for example if you’re renting a car then you could rent it on an hourly basis to see how much usage there would be before committing to buying one -renting has no upfront cost meaning this is another way to control your budget -there are no ownership responsibilities or worries about depreciation like you would have with buying a product we recommend that businesses rent equipment from companies that offer flexible terms, more than one lease provider to choose from and competitive rates. this way you can create the best possible solution for your specific business needs.
