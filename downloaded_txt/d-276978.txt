journeying in virtue

		a high school career at jesuit is lived out in a vibrant community, where all of us hear god’s call to become a better version of ourselves. all strake jesuit students are invited daily to pray, reflect on each day, and participate in the sacraments. the retreats students experience every year at our 50 acre retreat & leadership center in leona, tx call each of them to participate in one of the hallmarks of jesuit spirituality: reflection.

men of action

		in over 75 student clubs and activities, students reach for a more abundant life — school is more than book learning, and necessarily includes meaningful experiences in developing one’s interests, sharing those with friends, growing as a leader, and bettering the life of the school. student growth is encouraged and supported by a student services staff who live out cura personalis, the ignatian charism of caring for others in an individualized way, attending to their unique needs and circumstances.

qualities of an sj graduate

high school is a brief yet impactful time in life, which is why it’s so important to have a plan for what one hopes to accomplish during those four years. we know that our graduates have a call to holiness and service in their lives after graduation. a strake jesuit graduate is expected to have the following qualities. click the images below to learn more about each one.








open to growth
openness to growth is essential to becoming a better version of oneself every day, and is a part of our call to constant conversion. 




intellectually competent
the understanding of self and the world that surrounds us is dependent on intellectual competence. we prepare students to be successful at the next level of their academic careers and beyond. 




religious
our care for the entirety of each person in our classrooms and on our teams drives us to joyfully share the gospel of christ with our students. 




loving
a strake jesuit graduate should be a bridge-builder, caring for his neighbor as he cares for himself. 




committed to doing justice
st. ignatius, founder of the jesuit order, preached that "love ought to show itself in deeds more than in words." our school calls students to live by that sentiment.
