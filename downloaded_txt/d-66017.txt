						i can attest to the amazing job the bousquet tuning team did on our skis. my wife and i have had our skis tuned several times over the years and… they were ok. we brought our skis to bousquet and they came out as if they were totally redone! the edges were sharp and precise and the bottoms of the skis were amazingly smooth! i recommend this service highly! well worth the cost.					


tim b. 






						under new ownership. huge difference since we last went to bousquet a couple years ago...the staff seems excited and proud to work there and made our experience a pleasant one from start to finish. trails were incredibly well lit and well groomed. highest of recommendations!					


mike s. 






						we came tubing this morning. we had so much fun! hats off to the staff manning the tubing hill! the gentleman working the top happily pushed my son down every single run, and the ladies were kind and helpful. great experience and great employees who exemplify family friendly fun! please pass along our gratitude. i wish i knew their names!					


allison l. 






						wow…just amazing. thank you for saving our little ski hill. it has meant so much for so many previously and will mean so much for those yet to come!

						my family and i haven't been skiing 🎿 in years. we changed that this week by visiting this awesome spot. club house is beautiful and new. everything was very clean and employees extremely friendly/helpful. if you haven't been in awhile. they offer lessons, quick eats at the cafeteria, or restaurant/bar. very reasonably priced for rentals/skiing/tubing... 5 🌟
