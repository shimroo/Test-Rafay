no georgia licensing means you need gahi credentials


increasingly clients, like real estate agents, will only work with a gahi inspector

let gahi.com help you find our r5/code certified inspectors - r5/cci's which are the gold standard for the highest qualified and leading professional home inspectors in georgia.
gahi inspectors are encouraged to become icc code certified and to maintain that certification. some inspectors advertise that they are icc members. this is not the same as being an icc r5 code certified combination inspector. anyone can become an icc member by paying a fee. you should confirm that the inspector you are considering is indeed an icc r5 code certified combination inspector and his/her credentials are up-to-date. this can be done by clicking the blue "find" link above. just enter the inspectors last name and county and then click go.
