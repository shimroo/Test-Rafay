credit report tips
when it comes to credit report, we've been there, done that, now serving 248 tips in 15 categories ranging from about credit reports to uses of credit reports.











finding identity theft information
becoming the victim of identity theft fraud is highly traumatic. victims must spend extensive time and money correcting their credit reports and proving that fraudulent accounts do not belong to them. the process of removing identity theft information from your records can take months or years.
one of the best ways to protect yourself from this possibility is to regularly examine your credit report to look for identity theft information. you are entitled to a free credit report once a year from each of the three credit reporting bureaus. check these reports every year to make sure that there are no entries on your credit record that do not belong. if you see accounts that you did not sign up for, you may be the victim of identity theft fraud. also ensure that you are getting monthly statements for any accounts that you know you have. if you are not getting statements, make sure that they are not being mailed to a different address. if they are, this could be another sign of identity theft fraud.
regular vigilance of your financial records for identity theft information can help protect you from identity theft fraud.

credit monitoring tips
one free credit report is allowed per consumer per year by the three major credit bureaus, experian, equifax and transunion. credit reports are often accessed by outside parties when applying for loans, apartments and even insurance. the accuracy of your credit report is essential to companies making accurate decisions based on your credit. a credit score that is not correct based on fraud or other inaccuracies can be expensive in both time and money. 
credit monitoring is a valuable resource to protect your credit score and identity. credit monitoring services will notify you if your credit information is accessed, an account is added or personal information is changed. identity theft can be time consuming to resolve with various credit agencies and credit bureaus. credit monitoring allows you to find out quickly that your information has been changed without your authorization so that you can take appropriate action before further damage is done. with online credit monitoring services, an email is sent out to the individual to notify them of any changes. 
credit monitoring services typically bill either month-by-month or annually. the cost of a credit monitoring service is minimal in comparison to what errors may cost in interest rates, insurance rates and security deposits.

identity theft?  no thanks!
have you been a victim of identity theft? if not, you’re lucky, since identity theft is one of the fastest growing crimes in america. however, some good news is that you are not totally vulnerable to a crime such as this. 
 there are some popular identity theft services which were developed to help people guard themselves against privacy invasion. some of the leading ones are: lifelock, trustedid, id watchdog, and guard dog. any of these identity theft services will provide protection against your most valuable information.
 using identity theft services provides you with the peace of mind that your most treasured and personal information is protected, all at a monthly price that most people can afford. the protection you get from these identity theft services is well worth the cost. 
 like any other available service, the best way to start is to do some “comparison shopping” among various identity theft services. see which ones are a “good fit” for you based on exactly they are offering for the price they are asking. make your own comparisons to see which ones will give you the most for your money.
 protect yourself and your family. after all, you don’t want to find yourself thumbing through the telephone book under “identity theft lawyers” after you have been a victim.

identity protection
the world has become a place in which identity theft is all too common. now many people are looking for identity protection and ways to prevent identity theft. avoiding identity theft completely would mean not giving out any kind of personal information. however, there is an easy way in which you can reduce your chances of becoming a victim of identity theft. identity protection starts in the form of refraining from giving out your personal information online.
furthermore, the internet has become a place where information is collected and stored. hackers and identity theives are waiting for people like you to enter all of your credit card information so that they can take it. if you find yourself in a position in which you have to use your credit card online only enter that information into trusted sites. you can tell which sites these are by the padlock that can be seen in the url box or the lower righthand side of your screen. taking these steps for identity protection can help prevent identity theft.

anyone can become a victim of credit card fraud
it is important to always know where your credit cards are at all times. it is very easy for someone to steal your cards to commit credit card fraud. many stores do not check the name of the person using the card when doing a transaction. this means that anyone can forge your name to make a purchase. credit card fraud can happen very quickly. someone can steal thousands from your account in just hours. if you notice that your card is missing is important to call and immediately inform your credit card company. if you do not notice that your card is missing but notice that there are transactions that you did not make on your bill you need to call the company. if unauthorized transactions have been made by someone using your card then you have become a victim of credit card fraud. by calling the credit card company you will be able to have a credit card investigation take place. during the credit card investigation the company will look back at records and see where the credit card fraud took place. the credit card investigation will show where transactions were made, how much they were made for, and possibly who made the transactions. the person may or may not be found.
