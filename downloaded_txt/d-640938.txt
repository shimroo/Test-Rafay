single-cell profiling of ebola virus disease in vivo reveals viral and host dynamics


ebola virus (ebov) causes epidemics with high mortality yet remains understudied due to the challenge of experimentation in high-containment and outbreak settings. here, we used single-cell transcriptomics and cytof-based single-cell protein quantification to characterize peripheral immune cells during ebov infection in rhesus monkeys. we obtained 100,000 transcriptomes and 15,000,000 protein profiles, finding that immature, proliferative […]

a novel lamprey antibody sequence to multimerize and increase the immunogenicity of recombinant viral and bacterial vaccine antigens


emagglutinin, the main floor protein of influenza viruses, was recombinantly expressed in eukaryotic cells as a monomer as a substitute of its native trimer, and was solely immunogenic when administered with an adjuvant [pion et al. 2014]. with the intention to multimerize this antigen to extend its immunogenicity, a cysteine-rich peptide sequence discovered on the […]

[ocular manifestations of viral diseases]


viral infections may involve all ocular tissues and may have short and long-term sight-threatening consequences. among them, ocular infections caused by herpesviruses are the most frequent. hsv-1 keratitis and kerato-uveitis affect approximately are the leading cause of infectious blindness in the western world, mainly because of corneal opacification caused by recurrences. for this reason, they […]

monkeypox virus in nigeria: infection biology, epidemiology, and evolution


monkeypox is a zoonotic disease caused by monkeypox virus (mpxv), which is a member of orthopoxvirus genus. the reemergence of mpxv in 2017 (at bayelsa state) after 39 years of no reported case in nigeria, and the export of travelers’ monkeypox (mpx) from nigeria to other parts of the world, in 2018 and 2019, respectively, […]

the diverse roles and dynamic rearrangement of vimentin during viral infection


epidemics brought on by viral infections pose a big international menace. cytoskeletal vimentin is a significant intermediate filament (if) protein, and is concerned in quite a few capabilities, together with cell signaling, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, intracellular group and cell migration. vimentin has essential roles for the life cycle of specific viruses; it might probably act as […]
