called to co-responsibility: strengthening our parish together 










the parish pastoral council and finance council play a vital role in supporting our community in faith, mission, and stewardship. working together, they assist the pastor in discerning the parish's needs and planning for its spiritual growth and financial sustainability. we are looking for parishioners with a sincere commitment to actively engage in parish life, uphold catholic teachings, and embody a spirit of collaboration, promoting unity and contributing to the parish’s mission. please prayerfully consider and nominate one person for each council who embodies these values and has a sincere commitment to serving our parish.to nominate, please click here
