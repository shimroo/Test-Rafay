          here's 7 different tactics to help improve your cpm on youtube...

aka how to improve your total ad revenue

a thread🧵👇🏼

1. geographic location listed on your channel

- where are your viewers (or your economic spending of your viewers) based in? different locations produce different spending habits of advertisers.

2. age of audience

how much buying power does your audience have? how much spending power do they have? know your audience and view them through the lens of the advertiser. would they want to advertise on your channel?

3. niche or industry

are you in a profitable niche on youtube? there is plenty of opportunity on youtube, but is there anything out there to show you that your niche is profitable in this space?

4. seasonal change in certain niches

if you're wondering why your cpm goes up and down, maybe something you are looking at are seasonal changes within your niche. example: maybe your a gym channel where january 1 roles around and you'll see higher cpm due to new year, new me type of season.

5. types of ads placed on video

when you're monetized on youtube, you're able to select what type of ads placed on your videos. we check them all because not every ad is pushed in total. more ads are more opportunity, let youtube figure it out

6. made for kids content

if your content is for kids. check the box. plain as that. if you have a kids channel, you'll make less ad revenue due to the nature of child privacy laws. don't sweat it though. if you can put out great kids content, you still have the opportunity to create income.

7. videos safe for viewing

the content of your videos can drive your cpm down. if you have questionable content in your videos, ads may not even be able to put in your videos. examples are inappropriate language, adult content, violence, shocking content, harmful ads, recreational drugs, controversial issues, demeaning content, etc.

here's the bottom line and hopefully some encouragement. ad revenue is important. there

          most dtc ad accounts aren't even doing the bare minimum to improve performance.

what do i mean?

there's one thing meta recommends doing to both:

a) prevent roi dropoff
b) keep cac steady

creative refreshes.

our recommendation is heavy — 1x per week, or ~4x per month.

meta's recommendation is moderate — 2x per month.

most dtc brands aren't hitting even half of this — maybe 1x a month.

this simple rule is one of the most neglected in ad strategy for ecommerce brands. why? usually from a lack of creative inbound — there's not enough creative to supplement the number of refreshes needed.

i won't get into creative volume, but here's why creative refreshes are critical.

creative fatigue: it builds up when audiences are overexposed to the same creatives. it can drive up your cpa and make your ads less sticky, leading to higher ad spend for desired performance (or no spend if you're using cost controls).

meta prioritizes the "best" experience for users — this means new, new, new.

you don't immediately have to jump to 1x a week for creative refreshes, but if you're not at least hitting meta's recommended rate (bi-weekly), you're leaving easy results on the table.

          📨 not landing in the primary inbox?

cold email deliverability is everything. if you’re not landing in primary, it’s time to rethink:

✅ use multiple inboxes (warmed for 2 weeks).

✅ diversify with generic domains. example: cleaningpros dot com.

✅ split-test offers, not just subject lines.

combine cold email with facebook retargeting. 

prospects who don’t reply to your email may respond to an ad. 

dual-channel = higher conversions.

          google's anti-spam updates are here to stay, but they don't spell doom for your campaigns.

if your sales team relies on email outreach, here are a few things to know:

1) google is "on" your side

these changes aren’t meant to start a witch hunt against salespeople.

the goal is to improve user experience by weeding out spammers and phishers.

you're already miles ahead of the bad guys and in a great position to shine.

2) play by the rules

familiarize yourself with the key elements of a spam-free email.

ensure your unsubscribe process is seamless, your targeting is focused, and your content is valuable to your audience.

this way, you'll avoid raising any red flags and deliver emails that your recipients will want to open.

3) stay informed

keep your sales team in the loop about other minor changes or updates that google rolls out.

compliance with fresh updates will determine outreach success in the months to come.


bottom line?

these changes will improve your outreach if you target effectively, create relevant messages, and follow good email practices.

there's no need to panic if you're doing things right.


i joined ollie whitfield and taylor haren on vanillasoft tempo podcast to discuss how these updates have changed email and the best automation to leverage for success.

          lessons from kanye west - words i never thought i’d say in #seniorlivingmarketing. 

chris long highlights an seo case study about a brand / company transition that google didn’t capture appropriately and how it negatively affects kanye’s business. 

here are senior living takeaways being mindful of the recent m&a trends:

1. don’t lose the value of a community’s previous name and visibility. make sure to address it within tags and potential back linking even if you’d rather not call out the old name on the page. 

2. if you’re company is instigating a rebrand, lean on redirects to capture any old backlink traffic and keep the organic ranking build. 

3. update the google business profile appropriately as quickly as you can. this will help affiliate the new name with the address. 

seo experts, did i miss anything? larry williams; katie holt ✨?

          you are leaving ton of money on the table if you are not getting optimal reply rate.

the industry standard is 5-10% minimum.

anything less that than 5-10% means there is deliverability issue.

what you should be aiming for is 20%.

reply rate depends on below factors primarily:
1. deliverability (did your email even landed in their inbox ?)
2. subject line (ogs know what always works ;) haha)
3. offer (is what youre offering really in demand for that specific niche or are you just flinging it in the air)
4. case study/value prop (did you sent them either of those ?)
5. cta (did you gave any call to action in the end?)

in a nutshell, you have to have an offer that resonates with your specific audience on a spiritual level. a case study/value prop that forces them to reply to your email.

now if you are doing a campaign diagnostic as to why there is low reply rate, it could be any of the reasons mentioned above.

but how do you pin point it ?

to check if its deliverability issue:
- check your domain health.
- go to glockapps and see if your email is landing is spam or inbox.
- // quick tip, glock check your email on both, personal emails (with gmail/outlook personal domain) and business emails (custom domains), you only need to see if it lands in inbox for business emails because you are only cold emailing on business emails, if you are doing it otherwise, congrats on your toasted domains //-
- if your emails are landing in inbox (for business emails), congrats, deliverability is not the issue.

now, as for the all of others, you will have too a/b test them. change one aspect and leave everything else the same, that way you can pin point as to what the issue would.

for subject line:
- under 15 words
- intriguing or question posing
- to the point
- mentioning their company/name works well
- example, thoughts {company name}

for offer:
- it would depend from campaign to campaign
- there has to be some demand as to what you are offering to the said niche.
- offer should revolve around the leads actual wants
- offering them pens would be worthless if they dont have something to write on with it (poor example, but an example nonetheless)

for case study/value prop:
- rule of thumb is to only mention or refer to it in the first message like ( we recently helped xx company boost their mmr to xx with only xx (method). do you mind if i send more info on it ?)
- then send the case study once they reply and they will reply if the offer pressed all their buttons.
- as for value prop, try to pose it as a free stuff
- example, i made xx automations for free for you that could save you xx time from xx tasks.

as for call to action:
- there isent a specific blueprint as to what works, usually any would work but it has to be there
- take an example from above, {do you mind if i send more info on it ?}

split test all of those with only 1 change per test. if you change multiple things, then you wont be able pin point the issue.

          a/b tests like “making the button 3px bigger” are useless unless you do $1m/mo from email alone 

instead, you should split test:

- subject lines
- preview texts
- offers
- ctas
- flow length (how many emails are sent in the flow)

          how to calculate the *real* roi from your q4 sales.

(meaning, whether you're "winning" or not.)

it's always a good practice to analyze how customers behave after bfcm in previous years.

what's the best way to do that on shopify?

the customer cohort analysis.

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗶𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁?

it's a chart that shows how your customers have behaved over time since their first order.

you can see:
💰 how much they spent on previous holiday seasons and in the following months
📈 customer retention rate over time
👨‍👨‍👦 number of customers over time
💲 net and gross sales
💴 aov

𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗵𝗲𝗹𝗽 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗯𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗱𝗲𝗰𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀?

well, with the above-mentioned information, you can:
🔮 predict how your customers will behave in this bfcm if you offer similar deals
🎯 you can filter the data by channel and product name, among other options
📈 brainstorm ideas to improve last year's performance

understanding these metrics will help you make better decisions.

such as: 
⏳ working on decreasing the time between purchases
💲 spending a certain % of your estimated revenue
➕ and many more.

btw, there are many insights shopify doesn't give brands that could unlock the next level of growth for many of them.

if you'd like to know how to get this info, comment "tool" and i'll send you the name + a mini-guide i've put together on how to use it.

tl;dr:
👉 look at shopify's customer cohort analysis report
👉 check how your customers have behaved since the last bfcm
👉 identify winning strategies & goals for this bfcm

nowadays, having a "paid ads agency" is not enough. brands need a growth partner that helps them with things like the ones mentioned in this post and more.

          adam robinson has been very transparent on linkedin about the customer churn at rb2b. it may be related to their customer acquisition strategy like kyle asay commented. as kyle mentioned adam attracts a lot of customers with his content that he often intentionally makes controversial or clickbait to earn more eyeballs. the customers that will swipe a credit card to pay a little bit of money because they like his style probably aren’t serious buyers that will try to build value with his product. 

it can be an #icp problem as churn often = the customers weren't the right customers in the first place. 

but, i believe that there's an overpromise in the market by #intentdata of any kind. it's not enough to uncover intent -- as it's not predictive of accounts actually closing at a high acv and growing with you. 

it's not enough to know "who" may be showing intent. we need to understand the account story and "why" there is intent in the first place. 

teams need to add on icp signals, business problem profile signals, buyer personality based signals and account insights on top of intent as intent is not the silver bullet that many platforms try to sell. it's only 1 small piece of the puzzle but teams rely on intent data for account selection. they rely on intent data to show how #gtm teams should engage with buyers but that has teams all engaging in the same way.

 if rb2b wants to cut churn, they should:

1. partner with service firms like personal abm: an account-based gtm firm that will mix the intent data with other signals and account insights to help teams focus on the right accounts and then enable them to deliver the right account experience. 

2. focus on customer education and enabling customers to effectively use intent data vs. just increase efficiency. it's not just about taking the data from rb2b and running automations through clay. teams need to know how they should be interacting and engaging with buyers that may be in-market,  #rb2b needs to help customers move the intent qualified leads to revenue, otherwise teams will not see value and they will still see churn.

in our webinar in the coming year, we'll share how teams can get the greatest returns from their investments in rb2b, 6sense and other intent data platforms. you can sign up for the webinar at:

          one question that comes up when we're helping agencies implement outbound:

"should the outreach come from the owner [or some other senior person]?" 

it depends. 

will the owner get more and better prospect meetings?  

yes.  

but that reason alone is not good enough since leading sales is important and takes a lot of time and energy. 

here is a checklist we use to identify the right person and ensure they're set up to be successful: 

[ ] ownership. 

is the stakeholder excited to be leading sales efforts or is it a chore?  did they step up or are they being conscripted?

[ ] bandwidth. 

can the stakeholder devote a significant portion of their time to new business efforts, regardless of ops and fulfillment pressures (even if the sales role is not full time)?  as the "face" of outbound campaigns, this person will be on lots of calls and will continue to be involved in the sales process, even if others assist. 

[ ] value. 

can the stakeholder teach and offer insights to a prospect?  after glancing at their linkedin profile, would a skeptical brand-side decision maker want to talk to them? (this one reason the traditional bdr model often falls flat for selling complex services).  

[ ] incentives. 

if the stakeholder is not an owner or partner, is there an incentive structure in place when they close deals?   

often an owner or partner checks all of these boxes, but not always.

          i audited the email marketing strategy of a $150k/month brand recently.

here are the 18 worst mistakes they were making (that you should avoid): 
 
1. using a generic 10% discount code pop-up
2. not collecting any zero-party data
3. not running a/b tests on the pop-up

4. generic emails in the welcome flow, with no strategy
5. not enough emails in the foundational flow
6. no split-tests in flow emails
 
7. missing cross-sell emails in the post-purchase flow
8. no review/ugc collection emails
9. generic emails, that don’t address objections or questions 
10. no added to cart metric setup + flow
 
11. inconsistent campaigns (only 2-4 per month)
12. not capitalizing on suitable events
13. no campaign calendar/strategy in place

14. no mix of promo, product launch, survey, and educational emails
15. mass blasting campaign; no segmentation
16. email designs not optimised for mobile
 
17. high unsubscribe rate & bounce rates on campaigns
18. not cleaning the list regularly. 
 
dtc brands, avoid these mistakes in 2024.

you’ll be on your way to 30-35% revenue in no time.

          i've generated over $500m in email & sms revenue

how?

by optimizing every single flow to maximize revenue

but there's one flow that stands above the rest:

the abandoned cart sequence.

it's mind-blowing how many brands neglect this goldmine.

i've personally generated millions with this flow alone.

want to turn cart abandoners into loyal customers?

follow this simple structure for your abandoned cart emails:

          psa: turn off your standard welcome offer popups during bfcm.

no one wants to sign up for email to get an offer lower than what you already have on the site. 

conversion rate *should* be higher during this time. worry about getting the sale (and their marketing opt-in) at checkout. 

bonus: if you’re a klaviyo user, you can now schedule sign up forms to turn on/off on the days and times you want ✅

          i’ve been speaking with tons of marketers and lead generators about tcpa 1:1 consent. here's one thing that has become super obvious to me...

most crm tools, form builders, and landing page builders are completely ignoring this issue. 

it’s either not a big enough deal for them to fix or it’s just too tricky to figure out. 

or, they're completely ignorant to what's happening.

this means a lot of lead generators are going to be left hanging. 

don't get me wrong, there are some good ones out there that have their act together. 

on my end, i've got three things cooking-up to tackle this!

1) a new tcpa 1:1 consent system with legally approved consent text and tagging

2) a system for querying any database and returning a company or buyer name and dynamically inserting it into the lead capture flow in

3) and a few other things up my sleeve

          there’s one metric that can make or break your growth… and it’s probably one you’re neglecting.

it’s not just revenue. 

it’s not churn. 

it’s the ltv to cac ratio — lifetime value to customer acquisition cost. and it’s the single most important metric for your growth. 🤯

why does it matter?

ltv shows you exactly how much value you’re creating for every dollar you spend. it’s the ultimate test of whether your business is efficient or bleeding cash.

🤑 spend $100 to acquire a customer who brings in $1000 over their lifetime? you’ve nailed a 10:1 ratio. that’s what growth looks like.

here’s the kicker:

most businesses aren’t even tracking this. they’re flying blind, chasing vanity metrics that make them feel good but hide the real story.

in our latest growth team radio episode, i share why ltv is the true north star for sustainable growth. ⭐

bottom line: you need to know your numbers. not just the flashy ones, but the metrics that actually move the needle for your business.

check out the full episode now to get the details of what you need to track to grow your business!
