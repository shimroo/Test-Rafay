lisa greenough – director “direct this!!” she yells, as she takes off a shoe to throw it at the risers. we all try to duck, bumping shoulders with each other and stifling fits of laughter, which only fuels her to take off her *other* shoe and aim for another unsuspecting…sole (see what we did there?!)of course, the shoe never leaves her hand (well, there was *one* time – she said it was an accident), and when our eyes are finally wiped from tears of laughter, we get back to the task at hand – becoming accomplished performers who thrive within a community of love and laughter. lisa’s philosophy is that learning without laughing is like eating without tasting – what’s the point? we are so much more than half-tos and must-dos. we are dedicated women who choose to show up on the risers and allow ourselves to flourish under the direction of lisa greenough.  you are probably thinking “this is supposed to be a blurb about the director, not the chorus!”  if you click the learn more button below you can see all of lisa’s accomplishments. there are a lot of them. she is very accomplished within this organization – of that there is no doubt.  but ask lisa what she accomplishes without the women who show up every week, and her response is simply: “nothing.”
