jack & joanne's guide to food, wine, cheese, & living





fork & bottle focuses on our love of food, especially wine and cheese. we are picky about where our food comes from, how it tastes and how sustainable it is. we’re always hunting for great, real food – not the stuff found in big supermarkets and chain restaurants. we care about what we eat.fork & bottle also covers organic gardening, cooking with kids and our explorations of napa valley/sonoma county wine country. we welcome your feedback.– jack & joanneresource categories
