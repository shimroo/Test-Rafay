the goal is simple – to help members prosper, thus uplifting our community.
your membership and investment allows you to interface with a variety of business leaders, their hard working and dedicated teams, public policy influencers and economic development contributors in this market. economic development initiatives and programs continue to bring new jobs, more firms and an expanded customer base to the buffalo niagara region. the continued pledge of being a suburban chamber with a regional vision (servicing 75+ zip codes), resonates with policy makers and collaborative partners. membership fees are an investment in your community, not a donation to the organization. join today, attend events and get to know your peers!
