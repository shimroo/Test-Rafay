there were many times when the conversation i had with a professor truly made a difference and allowed me to achieve success. this openness also allowed me to form the kind of connections that have...

what do you like most about your program?
what i liked most was the diversity of experiences offered by the many different areas of sociology taught by the department. i was able to tailor my learning to the areas of sociology which were of the most interest to me, while still being confident that the core courses of the program would provide me with the theoretical and practical foundations of the discipline. on top of that, the sociology program provided me with enough room to round out my learning through elective courses, again providing a great amount of diversity.
what do you find beneficial about your program?
what i found most beneficial was how open both professors and teaching assistants were to discussions to both further my learning and ensure that i was being as effective as i could be during evaluations. there were many times when the conversation i had with a professor truly made a difference and allowed me to achieve success. this openness also allowed me to form the kind of connections that have been beneficial as i move into the next phases of my academic career.
in your opinion, what is the value of a social science degree?
i think the value of a social science degree can only be measured by what you are willing to put into it. by engaging with material, the learning process itself, and with peers and faculty, you are able to really set yourself up for future success. not only can you learn the skills needed in so many areas – skills such as research, effective written and oral communication, and approaching problems from different points of view – but you can also develop a network of experts and academics who might one day become colleagues.
what advice would you give to a current student interested in career options?
my biggest piece of advice would be to engage with your professors. many people in the sociology department are involved in all kinds of different projects, both directly related to the university or more involved with community organizations. you might be surprised at just how much conversations with individuals in the department about your career interests can lead to opportunities, or even just a perspective you hadn’t considered before on how you might be able to leverage your education.
what advice would you give a future student interested in the department or programs?
sociology provides a path to learn about so many aspects of society, from healthcare to the judicial system. it is also a discipline that has been derived from so many different viewpoints, allowing students to tackle issues using their own lived experiences, as well as learn how others might take on the same problems. once you’re in the program, just as with any program, do your best to always be engaged. sociology is best learned through discussion and taking part in that discussion instead of interacting with it passively will go a long way in your learning and help develop relationships with peers and faculty.

what do you like most about your program?
my favourite part about the anthropology program was the experiential education opportunities. through the programs at mcmaster, i was able to work directly with professors and their labs to learn the ins and outs of research, while getting my own hands-on experience. this took my learning outside of the classroom and encouraged me to consider the different types of careers i could pursue following my degree.
what do you find beneficial about your program?
anthropology allowed me to explore a wide variety of topics and research interests. as someone who felt drawn towards biological anthropology and archaeology, i felt like i could combine these interests to really get the most out of my degree in terms of information and experience.
in your opinion, what is the value of a social science degree?
social science allows students to receive a more holistic form of education which centres the wide variety of human perspectives and experiences within our communities. throughout my degree, i felt like i was gaining valuable information which could benefit me in any career i chose to pursue. social science focused so closely on the human experience that it taught me the value of community, allyship, and the pursuit of making a world more safe and accessible for all.
what advice would you give to a current student interested in career options?
i would say, try as many opportunities?as possible! there is no telling what career in social sciences may interest you. and don’t feel limited by what program you are in – the career you’re interested in could be within your field or could be connected to it in a cool way.?i personally used my degree in anthropology and indigenous studies to pursue a work focused on cultural retention within afrocentric communities. if there is not a career, lab, or research that you feel properly suits your passion, don’t worry – there is always the potential for you to be the one to bring your passion to life!
what advice would you give a future student interested in the department or programs?
if you are interested in topics like science, history, health, community, and culture (especially your own), you will feel at home in the anthropology program! it truly allows you to flex your own interests while gaining valuable information that will benefit you in any career. anthropology is so much more than the limited scope we often see portrayed in the media (ex. indiana jones) – it is an opportunity for you to experiment with a wide range of ideas?and to work alongside students who are all passionate about widely different topics.

what i liked most about the economic policy program at mcmaster university is how well it prepares you to enter the job market ... the focus is teaching you skills.

what i liked most about the economic policy program at mcmaster university is how well it prepares you to enter the job market ... the focus is teaching you skills.

what do you like most about your program?
what i liked most about the economic policy program at mcmaster university is how well it prepares you to enter the job market. you still go over important micro/macroeconomic models and maximization problems, but most of the focus is teaching you skills that you will implement in your future career. the professors in the program are very knowledgeable and always willing to put in some extra time to help you out with your studies and career. one of my professors (professor sweetman) even helped me update my resume and regularly sent me job opportunities that he thought would fit my skillset.
what do you find beneficial about your program?
there are many benefits to taking the masters in economic policy program, the first one is the length it takes to complete your degree. you gain so much important knowledge in a short amount of time and in just 12 short months you are a master’s graduate; the opportunity cost is definitely worth it. being around like-minded people with similar goals is also very beneficial. i have learned almost as much from my peers and their various backgrounds as i did from the policy program.
in your opinion, what is the value of a economics degree?
in today’s climate, an economics degree is invaluable. it can lead you to so many different career paths in the public or private fields: economist, financial/data analyst, researcher, accountant, consultant, etc. furthermore, it can help you understand and analyze everyday policy changes that are occurring in your city/province/country. having a basic understanding of economics can help you develop better spending habits, gain important knowledge and skills that employers want, and enable you to contribute to the greater good of society.
what advice would you give to a current student interested in career options?
you have to be passionate about what you’re doing if you want to make it your career. go out of your way to get involved on campus, go to your department events and get to know your professors. seek internship opportunities early on, the more work experience you can get early on in your degree the better equipped you will be when you’re on the job hunt after graduating. find a balance with your social life, burnout is a real problem! if you can find a healthy balance between your social life and your schooling/work, you’re going to be set up well for a good future.
what advice would you give a future student interested in the department or programs?
ask lots of questions! you will quickly learn that people love talking about the things they are passionate about. ask about what the student life on campus is like, what you can do with this type of degree, how many students typically get jobs after graduating. don’t be afraid to ask the tough questions that you think are important, this is your future and you deserve to have the best opportunities.
