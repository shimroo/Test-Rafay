faith & justice

as a jesuit school, brophy adheres to the vision and philosophy of st. ignatius of loyola and the society of jesus, the catholic order that ignatius and his followers founded in 1534 and which was officially approved by the pope in 1540.
brophy’s office of faith and justice plays a central role in forming jesuit-educated young men through liturgies, retreats, service opportunities, immersion experiences and the annual summit on human dignity. brophy welcomes students of all faith traditions and recognizes that every human being is entitled to love, acceptance and dignity.

giving

when st. ignatius and his followers founded the first jesuit schools almost 500 years ago, they challenged the prevailing norms that offered a top-tier education only to those who could afford it. instead, the society of jesus mandated that jesuit institutions be open to all qualified students, regardless of socio-economic circumstances.
as a 501(c)3 nonprofit which receives no diocesan funds, brophy depends on fundraising to support the school’s annual financial aid expenditure — almost $6 million in 2021-22, and to grow the endowment to ensure future financial aid needs can be met.
