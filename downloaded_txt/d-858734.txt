medical assistants - review your pharmacology questions here
you want to be the best medical assistant you can be but drug names, medical terms, roman numerals and
abbreviations on prescription pads and medicine bottle labels won't always stick to your
      memory.   

what you need to know about
medications... right
now!!!
medications and controlled substances in a medical office are subject to certain laws and must be safeguarded at
all times. as a medical assistant you are legally responsible for adhering to these regulations associated with
handling, administering, disposal and safe-keeping of medications within their scope of practice. start our
free pharmacology review for medical
   assistants right now, right here.
if would like to reinforce or check your understanding of the basic principles of pharmacology and review how
medications are prescribed, calculated, administered, handled and stored then you have arrived at the right
place.
true or false?
do medical assistants need to know drugs?
do medical assistants really have to know the forms of drugs, their uses,
     strength and how they are prescribed? isn't that the doctor's job?
true. prescribing medications is the doctor's job; however, medical assistants are expected
     to be familiar with the most common forms of medications. generally, this means basic knowledge
     of     
      brand and generic name and usual dosages typically ordered in the medical
office where they work.
what you don't know might lead to errors...
 remember: those who
      dispense and administer medications must be able to read and understand written
   prescription and medication orders and possess a solid understanding of the conditions under which certain drugs
   may, or may not be prescribed (i.e. pregnancy, breast-feeding, allergies, side-effects, age and
   weight risks). a good medical assistant training program includes pharmacology classes, since it is
   essential to the job. most doctors require it as a prerequisite when they fill positions within their
   practice.

1. define sub-sciences of pharmacology and their specific fields of study

8. identify the classification and primary body system affected by the most common medications prescribed
9. recognize the most commonly prescribed medications by both their brand and generic names
10. describe how medications should be disposed
11. cite guidelines for proper documentation of medication administration
12. summarize the dea’s classification (schedules of drugs)
13. provide examples from each class of drugs
14. compare and contrast the uses for various forms of medications
15. differentiate between suspensions, emulsions, elixirs, syrups, and solutions
16. differentiate between ampule and vial forms of medications

consumer
      alert 
buying drugs online may be illegal! federal law prohibits buying
     controlled substances such as narcotic pain relievers (e.g., oxycontin®, vicodin ®), sedatives (e.g., valium®,
     xanax®, ambien®), stimulants (e.g., phentermine, phendimetrazine, adderall®, ritalin®) and anabolic steroids
     (e.g., winstrol®, equipoise®) without a valid prescription from a doctor.
this means there must be a bona fide doctor-patient relationship, which by most state laws requires a physical
examination to receive a prescription. prescriptions written by "cyber doctors" relying on online questionnaires
are not legitimate under the law.
buying controlled substances online without a valid prescription may be punishable by imprisonment under federal
law. it is a felony to import drugs into the united states and ship to a non-dea registrant. to report illegal
prescription drug sales and/or rogue pharmacies operating on the internet call the anonymous pharmaceutical
drug abuse hotline: 1-877-rxabuse (1-877-792-2873). more info at: dea website
