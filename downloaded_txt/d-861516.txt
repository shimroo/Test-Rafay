    philosophy works
  …and can transform your life.

the goal of practical philosophy is to help us discover our inner happiness, wisdom and freedom. practical philosophers enjoy a clear mind, a forgiving and generous heart, and become change-makers in their communities.
based on the classic philosophies of east and west, the course invites students to treat life as a place to put wisdom into practice and observe
some students, beginning to realize the truth about themselves, wish to continue the journey of self discovery. for them, practical philosophy courses continue with weekly meetings, introduction to the practice of meditation and an opportunity to participate and serve the needs of the school.
