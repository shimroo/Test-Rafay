	 bala sai's birthday beauties
    


the latest gossip confirms that bhagawan sri bala sai baba of kurnool is just an opportunistic bhagawan sri sathya sai baba impersonator with a view to enjoy adoration and flattery from gullible people. the andhra herald reports that bala sai baba's birthday celebrations may be attended by several film stars this year - all girls of course. it's a wonder he can even afford hiring these celebrities when he cannot even stump up the cash to pay back the generous donation of an innocent (but gullible) disciple. and whatever happened to the drinking water project? what? don't be so silly enough to expect these trivial issues getting in the way of inviting some hot chicks to your birthday party!isn't he quite the ladies man though? ‘bala sathya sai baba’, who has established an ashram in kurnool, likes very much to get into the public eyes with film stars around him. he is like a xerox copy to ‘puttaparthi sai baba’ and also has thousands of devotional societies and also receives devotees from the foreign countries by which his turnover runs into crores of rupees.now he is planning to invest in educational field also.last year on his birthday actress nagma, suman, laya, babu mohan, venu madhav participated for which they compensated in lakhs of rupees. and the news is that for this birthday he is planning to bring in ‘trisha’, genelia, sindhu tolani are also being consulted.    we expect that sathya sai baba is seething with jealousy at the bare-faced cheek of this upstart who dares to steal his thunder. after all, he usually only gets a few shrivelled-up old women and a lot of pre-school kids to sing for him at his own parties!and just for your viewing pleasure, here's some pictures of the delightful beauties (read: pretty leggy girls) all getting ready to tease and tantalise mr. bala sai with their sexy dance steps and come-hither looks. looks like he'll be seriously hot under the collar and may even have his hands full (literally) when this event comes to pass. remember to click on the images to see enlarged versions. enjoy. ;-)photo credits to whoever owns them.laya:genelia:trisha:sindhu tolani:and last - but definitely not the least - the ultra-gorgeous suman ranganathan:

	 premananda conviction upheld by supreme court
    


the indian skeptic reports a story by the deccan herald about the indian supreme court upholding the life-sentence judgement on swami premananda for rape of minors and a murder. the supreme court on tuesday upheld the conviction and life sentence for two terms awarded to swamy premananda of tiruchirapally ashram in tamil nadu for raping 13 women and murdering one man, all inmates of his ashram.a division bench comprising justice b n agarwal and justice h k sema confirmed the judgement of the madras high court affirming the conviction and sentence awarded to swamy premananda by the trial court.in view of the gravity of the offence and the deleterious effect it had not only on the victims but also on the society at large, any remission of sentence announced either by the central or the state government would not apply to swamy premananda, said the apex court in an order.advertisementthe prosecution’s story was that the convict, hailing from sri lanka, had established an ashram near tiruchirapally and used to entice women inmates, 13 of the whom were raped in 1994. he also murdered ravi, another inmate.“we do not find any infirmity in the order passed by the high court and it does not call for any interference,” the bench said, adding that both the trial court and the high court were correct in convicting him.in august 1997 the trial court had convicted and awarded two life terms and imposed a fine of rs 66 lakh on swamy premananda. during the pendency of the appeal before the high court, he had paid the amount of fine imposed on him.the high court had confirmed the conviction and sentence in december 2002.

	 high court stays auction of premananda property
    


  madurai, march 23: the madurai bench of the madras high court today stayed the auctioning of the property of the premananda trust, part of premananda ashram in pudukottai district, by the income tax department for two weeks. justice jothimani, staying the auction, issued notice to the respondents including the chief commissioner of i-t, chennai, commissioner (it-i), tiruchirappalli, and the tax recovery officer-iii. the auction was scheduled to be held on march 29 to recover the tax arrears due from godman swami premananda, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1997 for rape and murder. the petitioner, dhamayanthi mathaji, the present managing trustee of the sri premananda trust, submitted that the trust was formed in 1994 to take care of the affairs of the ashram. after the arrest of premananda, some of the trustees left the ashram and a new trust board was formed. now the ashram premises have been developed at a cost of rs 97.35 lakh. more than 900 students were studying in the ashram school with 20 teaching staff. as many 630 students were staying in the ashram hostel and 50 persons were employed in the ashram. the activities of these service-oriented people would be thrown out of gear and the ashram children would be affected if the auction was allowed, the petitioner said. "when both premananda and his associate divya devi had relinquished their rights pertaining to both movable and immovable properties and given them to the trust, how could the income tax officials auction the properties for the dues of the swami?" the petitioner asked. besides, the donations had been made to the ashram for certain purpose and the trust was obliged to implement the purpose. "it is not income", the petitioner said. the income tax department had failed to note that premananda was a 'sanyasi' and did not hold any property on his own. the funds were used for orphanage homes, rehabilitation of old people etc.the petitioner also submitted that the court should direct the income tax department to quash the auction order and assess the tax in the name of the 'petitioner trust'.

	 premananda youth raise unnecessary expectations
    

the activities of the premananda youth deserve some special mention. the day before the shivaratri event they marauded on the streets of tooting to bring attention to their jailbird guru's cause by threatening the british public with.. having their car windscreens cleaned.yep, if you didn't get that the first time, the youth glorify their rapist leader by cleaning britain's dirty windscreens.in their own words: operation clear vision / justice for premananda (on saturday afternoon)* we go to tooting, a tamil area of london and clean windows of cars to clear the people’s vision... at the same time we distribute pamphlets with explanation about swamiji and explain about justice for premananda to clear their vision on swamiji’s situation.* we sing bhajans in the street to get people’s attention. they will be surprised that europeans are singing bhajans in a tamil area. we can distribute the same pamphlets and invite everyone to the shivaratri programme on the next day.* we all wear a fabric armband with ‘justice for premananda’ on it.i don't even know where to start. it's not enough to celebrate the night of shiva with lectures from "distinguished guests", not to mention the all-auspicious presence of prema's pink lingam, not to mention the presence of mr. invisible himself, but you spend the day before washing car windscreens and copying the hare krishnas. singing songs in a public area and wearing the same piece of clothing, why not go the whole hog by having their heads shaved and go out selling books? if you want a book or their jfp pamphlets, no fear, you may just get your windscreen cleaned for free.but yes, there is more! how to support:the organisation of this public relations project will bring about substantial costs. if you are unable to come to the weekend, but if you want to support, your donation is strongly welcomed:iban be52 7775 9314 8309bic gkccbebbto ‘premananda youth belgium’address of the bank: dexia, ieperstraat, 8970 poperinge - belgiumwith mention ‘donation shivaratri london’yes, even if you're unable to attend this event, you're "strongly welcomed" to dig into your pockets to alleviate your consciences and break free of the guilt trip. it makes you wonder, where does all this money go anyway?

	 mr. invisible deputes guru duties to pink lingam
    

youth followers of jailbird guru, swami premananda, recently held a shivarathri celebration in london. you cannot expect them to spend the night of shiva just singing bhajans and having abhishekhams galore without mentioning a word (or two) about the guru's current prison status.the event was part of the 'justice for premananda' campaign that hopes to "change the public opinion ([about premananda] of the tamil community in london, as this has an influence in india as well." all the premananda devotees, tamil journalists and other press, dr. w.j. wall (author of “the dna detectives”), the global human rights defense organisation, influential tamil people and devotees of other spiritual missions were invited to discuss this possibility.gee whiz, the guy has been sent to prison for murdering an ashram inmate when wasn't busy raping thirteen girls. what's there to change?but anyhow, this programme received the swami's blessings. this is what he is reported to have said:“it is a very good plan and you should do it. i will definitely support you ...  i will send someone from the ashram with the pink lingam to attend this programme and this person should give lingam blessings with it during the shivaratri night. i will also be there.”er, if he's coming then why doesn't he bring the pink lingam himself? according to the announcement: "the 'pink lingam’ is a very special lingam who has been with swami continually since it was born. swami used to keep it in his room on his personal shrine and he did puja on it for many years." and for all of that, it couldn't keep him out of jail. nevertheless, the pink lingam and it's powers were sent on a special mission to bless the london devotees on the night of shiva, along with the invisible presence of premananda himself. since nobody saw him arrive or leave it's kinda impossible to verify his attendance there. never mind, the pink lingam stood in for him very well. i hear it clapped loudly when the invited guests finished their speeches, before being invited to give a talk about it's daily routine.

	 vishwananda on "california dreaming" us tour
    

the "young yogi" has been gallivanting all over the usa as part of his world tour for the "spiritual upliftment of people of all religions and cultures in order to bring them to self-realisation". or so he says. his spring 2006 tour lasts from march 4th till april 26th, where he will hopefully generate enough of a spiritual revolution to "awaken the divinity within".on the us webpage, it is listed that visham will be hitting los angeles, santa cruz, san francisco, encinitas, palm desert, riverside - good areas of california - to top up his suntan. after that, he'll head to hawaii, colorado, kansas, toronto, boston, new york, and wind it all up with a glittering finale in washington d.c. a meeting with president bush hasn't been announced but you never know with this boy's charisma.while we praise the young yogi's ambitious plans to spark a major change in the collective consciousness, the disadvantages of his material age means that he has attained realisaiton before his time. he never had the guidance of a guru to school him in the ways of gurudom, and so his world tour in america may bring him temptations galore. having already had to deal with rumours of flirting around with the ladies and possibly fathering a child, we wish him all success which he is sure to get thanks to his pro-active fundraising techniques.

	 what's going on with bala sai?
    

a recent newspaper reports strange happenings all over bala sai's spooky lil ghost town. eye camp inauguratedkurnool: the postal department and balasai baba trust jointly sponsored an eye camp for postal employees at p and t colony here on sunday.the postal superintendent, mahabub basha, formally inaugurated the camp. all very well and dandy, but on the other side of town...man kills 3-year-old son?kurnool: a three-year-old boy was stoned to death allegedly by his father at palamarri village, under the pagidyala police station limits in kurnool district, on sunday. according to reports, in a fit of emotion, b. ramana, murdered his son, srikant, who died on the spot. the police are investigating.why fear when bala sai is busy avoiding court appearances instead of tending to the concerns of residents of his own home town?what kind of headline is that, by the way, as if the reporter is somewhat unsure of the facts? how would that look if we applied the standards equally; "eye camp inaugurated?" "bala sai avoids court?" "bala sai shameless sathya sai copycat?"

	 new baba on the block! getcha gun!
    

dedicated readers of this blog will have seen the updated photo that i've included in my profile. i think that 'sai look' suits me, don't you? :-) no telling when it'll be in fashion though.  i should consider dedicating a page to myself on sai copycat watch. after all if swami vishwananda can do the guru business at the same age as me, why can't i? i should start practising that trick with the golden eggs. failing that, i can always stick fake jewellery up my armpit.and in case you were wondering, the image was the kind contribution of my favourite critic. by virtue of my spiritual powers, i have transformed an act of malice into a testament of my glory!
