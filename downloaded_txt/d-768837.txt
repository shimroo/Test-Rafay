st. petersburg, florida, usa -  high winds forced an early end to the 19th annual 24 mile tampa bay marathon swim.  after battling for almost 3 1/2 hours on an alternate, sheltered course, organizers halted the marathon swim due to safety concerns for the swimmers, boaters and kayakers.
at the time of the race abandonment, all of the swimmers and relays that started the race were still negotiating the moderate chop off tampa bay's pinellas point.  the leader was the pre-race favorite, a 25 year old that was a distance swimmer at penn.  stephen carroll was able to swim 8 miles by the time race was called off, shortly before 11:30am.
 
 
 
 
 
 
stephen carroll's support kayaker, jason malick, was impressed by the leader, saying, "right out of the gate, stephen opened a huge gap on the rest of the field. he has a flawless stroke...if i only had half of his technique in my swimming days!"  at the time of the stoppage, carroll was more than 1/2 mile ahead of the next competitor.
gps trackers were aboard each of the support boats while they shadowed the swimmers.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
there were five solo swimmers and the 6 relay teams that were forced to withdraw from the event, at 3 hours and 23 minutes:
