insurance


how do i insure my fur? 



bring it to a professional furrier such as estate furs for a written appraisal. give this appraisal to your insurance company so that the fur can be listed on a separate rider of your home owner’s insurance policy. ask your insurance agent for advice and details.






storage


can i store my fur at home since i have air conditioning?



no. homes cannot duplicate the carefully regulated air exchange & temperatures kept below 50 degrees. a constant humidity level of 50% is optimal to help keep your garment soft and supple and prolong its wearability. homes with air conditioning generally have too much humidity which can dry out the pelts.






conditioning


how often should my fur be conditioned?


your fur needs to be conditioned, cleaned and glazed at least once a year to prevent it from drying out.
for more info on cleaning visit our https://www.estatefurs.com/fur-cleaning-and-conditioning/ page





fur care


how do i care for my fur?


store your fur with a professional furrier in the spring each year. have the furrier condition: clean and glaze it while it is in storage each year.
for more info on fur care visit our fur care page https://www.estatefurs.com/fur-cleaning-and-conditioning/ 





inherited fur


what can i do with a fur coat i have inherited? 


the fur can be updated into a more modern style. there are many options that include adding fabrics such as leather, microfiber, knit or used to trim a sweater or cloth coat.
for more info on restyling visit our www.estatefurs.com/fur-restyling/ page





furs


what is shearling?


shearling is natural lamb skin with the fur worn on the inside and the leather side sueded and worn on the outside. many of today's designers are designing sporty styles that fit well with today's casual lifestyle.
for more info on shearlings visit our shearling center




will rain ruin a fur?


a mild rain will not ruin your fur. just hang the garment up to dry in a well-ventilated room away from direct heat. after it is dry, give the fur a vigorous shake. if your fur gets thoroughly soaked, bring it to a professional furrier for proper treatment.




does dyeing a fur affect its quality? 


no. a fur that has been dyed will keep its softness and luster. dyeing a fur is an option that many of today's designers use to achieve a look that can only be gotten by dying the pelts.




is a sheared fur as warm as an unsheared fur? 


yes. the warmth of the fur is determined by the underfur, which acts as an insulation. whether or not the longer guard hairs are sheared off, the underfur remains intact and therefore provides the same warmth.




how do i tell quality of a fur? 


the quality of a fur is determined by the quality of the design, the pelts and the workmanship. the design must cause a proper fit and reflect a certain look or lifestyle. the pelts must be well matched, light weight, supple and even in sheen. the workmanship must create even sewed seams and good fur matching.




what is the difference between female and male mink pelts? 


female mink pelts are generally smaller and lighter in weight than male mink pelts. additionally, female pelts have a high luster and are very silky and soft while male mink pelts are more dense. each garment, whether male or female, has to be judged individually based on its own quality.
