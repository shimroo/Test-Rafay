 before we start...


 got pictures from your
years at cdd that you think would be of general interest? wanna put 'em up
on this site so your friends and campmates can see them? simply scan your
favorite photos and e-mail me at 
 ajbbklyn@aol.com be sure to include relevant information - names,
dates, activities  and maybe a funny anecdote to accompany the photo.
there's nothing cooler than sharing memories...



 camp diana-dalmaqua was
a summer sleepaway camp ("holiday camp", for those of you overseas) located
in glen spey, ny in the catskill region of new york state. founded in the
1920's as two separate camps, diana-dalmaqua was typical of the numerous
camps which served (and still serve) the children of the new york city
metropolitan area. this is a photo retrospective which covers the late 50's
onward...nostalgia for former campers, counselors and staff...
