harmonyware provides nurbs-based geometry translator tools
handling the
step,
iges,
vdafs,
stl,
sat (acis (tm)),
parasolid xt, and
opennurbs (rhino (tm)) file formats.
we have libraries to provide interfaces for these
formats to the
nlib,
tslib,
poplib,
solids++,
tsnlib, and
smlib geometry engines.
we also offer an interface to datakit's 
crosscad/ware sdk
which allows you to import from catia v4-v6, ug, parasolid, solidworks, solidedge, jut, proe, and more.


(finally starting the major revamp this web page has needed for at least a decade!)



recent news
 



 july 25th, 2024: the sale of nlib and smlib to nvidia created a number of legal and logistical challenges that have prevented us from releasing a new version of hwlibs since 2022.  we are hard at work on hwlibs 3.0, with the goal of eliminating the low-level code and translators from any dependence on nlib or smlib, as well as updating the source code to work well with c++14 and beyond.  the current goal is to have an "alpha" version of this ready for release in the fall.

     november 8th, 2022: 2.1.9 release. e-mails announcing this went out yesterday and today, if you think you should
         get one and did not, please check your spam mail folder and then contact us. this release includes support for the
         latest version of solids++, basic step export to aps 214 and 242, and the usual batch of small enhancements and bug
         fixes. see the changelog for details.

     june 15th, 2022: harmonyware now directly handles hwlibs support for the various geometry 
         engines formerly marketed by solid modeling solutions.  this page finally starts to get an update.

     december 15th, 2021: 2.1.8 release. includes support for datakit v2021.4 and smlib 8.12.0 and the
         usual batch of small enhancements and bug fixes. see the changelog
         for details.

     april 14th, 2021: 2.1.7 release. includes support for parasolid v33, datakit v2021.1/2021.2, and m1
         acs, plus preliminary support for smlib 8.12 and the usual batch of small enhancements and bug fixes.
         see the changelog for details.
