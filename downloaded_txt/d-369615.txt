            welcome from sharon james and tim saunders, co-chairs





welcome to the tappahannock-essex county rivahfes, a fun community festival that will be held in downtown tappahannock  prince street. rivahfest will be even better than last year, when more than 12,000 visitors got a first-hand look at our communitys most outstanding featuresand had fun doing it.  dozens of volunteers have been working for months to prepare for the june 18 event. and the best news of all is that entry to the rivahfest 2016 area is free - only a small charge for children's rides, and of course for food and drinks.

 tappahannock deserves a great festival, said 2016 steering committee co-chair tim saunders its not only a source of community pride, it also promotes tourism and economic development.


back by popular demand this year are a huge arts & crafts section now located on st. margaret's campus, childrens activities area, and an expanded merchants' market. two entertainment stages will feature a wide variety of performers, headlined by the legendary musical style of virginia's own mystic soul bubbas. opening the day on stage one will be wrar's revamped rivahfest idol with up to ten finalists followed by the cedarcreek band a past rivahfest favorite.

 theres also a maritime area with boat displays and other nautical activities, an even bigger antique car display bringing car clubs from the northern neck and from the richmond area, and the taste of tappahannock food area, featuring local seafood and festival favorites.



one of the newer activities with an ever popular following is the cornhole tournament now relocated adjacent to the beer garden at water and prince street intersection. up to 32 teams will battle throughout the afternoon for the championship and prize money - online registration is available!


theres something for everyone--country, gospel, bluegrass, rock and soul. "this year's lineup offers as always talented acts to entertain all afternoon at tappahannock rivahfest!" according to chris quann, in charge of main stage entertainment.

 from 3:30 until 7:30 pm, steve bassett and the mystic soul bubbas - the main stage will be rocking and grooving to the sounds of the the famed steve bassett, ammon tharpe with the mystic soul bubbas from richmond. steve bassett is the legendary southern rock and roll/blue eyed soul singer/songwriter, hammond b-3 player, and independent recording artist. his accomplishments include being the co-author of "sweet virginia breeze", southern soul music chart-topper. . 

check out the main stage lineup..... from 12:30 pm until 3:30 pm, cedar creek is a country music association group that has been wowing the crowd for many years. original country, top 40 country and classic rock stream the airwaves at each performance. voted top country band for numerous years in maryland and virginia, they have had 4 singles spun on small market radio, medium market radio, internet radio and overseas radio in the past 7 years which are "wind me up", "here's to you", "the jerk" and "defenseless" and each has won various awards for writing and/or air play.
