monday, may 02, 2005




the good people syndicating 'love is..' comics recently ran a contest where fans of the long-running strip could submit their own takes on this time-honored classic. this was taken by some to mean that there was an interest in changing or at least shifting the sensibility of the comic, one of the great one-panel strips in cartooning history.this notion was mistaken. in fact, contained herein are some stabs that very narrowly skirted legal action.
