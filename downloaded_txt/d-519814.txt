						hello!					


if you’ve found your way here, you are probably looking for some more information about me. this site is in a bit of a transition. above, please find links to everything you might need, as well as places to buy & hire music, get in touch, read about past projects, and read something which used to be a blog. about that: i used to be good at it, and would write things every few weeks. somehow, the air went out of it a bit, and so now it’s a slightly chaotic archive without a system. eventually, the plan is to cull some of the better ones and put them all together. in the meantime, you might like this post about mental health, this post about style, a thing i wrote about process, and a thing i wrote about beyoncé’s self-titled album. more soon.
