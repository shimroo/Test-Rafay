living
                    in idaho, we've lived with and loved our miniature schnauzers
                     since 1974. our dogs were and are first and foremost
                    our family pets who enjoyed being showdogs  on
                    a few weekends throughout the year. (successfully, i might
                    add - 41 akc champions)
                    if
            you are looking for a great companion, it really does make a difference
             to find a happy,  healthy puppy
            from happy, healthy, well bred parents. wonderful pet puppies come
                    from the same litter as show puppies, with our best care
                    and thought
            invested in every single one.
            we've retired from breeding and showing now, and wyoma is spending
            more time judging. but we still want to share information about
            miniature schnauzers and
            what
            great
            dogs
            they are. read on!

  there
            is a  book coming out about miniature schnauzers  from
          the akc "meet the breed" series. i've read it 
  -- it is very well done, presents lots of great information 
  about miniature schnauzers.  
  i recommend it highly!
  


  

we were
          very honored to be invited to judge
in china at a miniature schnauzer specialty in 
beijing and a dog show in shanghai. it was a 
wonderful experience, and so exciting to see 
how well they are doing with their dogs.
