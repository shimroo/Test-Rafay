raising sheep and marketing wool is challenging!

here at montana wool growers, we’ve got the experience, community and resources to help you succeed!

						legislative advocacy					

						you need a voice protecting your best interests on the legislative level. our advocacy helps protect your business and keeps you up-to-date on relevant statewide issues. we have your back so you can focus on doing what you love.					


						view recent news					












						wool pools					

						need a better way to sell your montana grown wool? producers with smaller quantities of wool can see benefits from “pooling” wool with other producers to sell as a larger lot. these are immensely beneficial for wool growers across the state!

we're here to help each other succeed!

						“i became a member of the montana wool growers association because it allows me to have a stake in state and national policy that affects my business. i enjoy learning from other wool growers and my membership allows me to connect with other producers to discuss challenges on our operations.”					
dave scottmontana highland lambwhitehall, mt 











						“i look forward to receiving the montana wool grower magazine and the sheep industry news through our membership because it allows me to keep up to date on the state and national sheep industry. with my mwga membership, i feel like i have representation and a voice in state and federal government.”					
ben lehfeldtlehfeldt rambouilletslavina, mt 











						“i joined mwga for the opportunity to meet other producers with similar interests. i think the biggest benefit of being a member is the work that is done at the state legislature and nationally on our behalf as producers on issues affecting the sheep industry."
