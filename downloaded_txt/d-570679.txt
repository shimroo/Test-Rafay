                                  comprehensive plan & rezoning 
the city of rockville will establish their vision
for the future and put in place strategic plans 
and a map to reach that vision.
comprehensive planning is an important tool for cities to guide future development of land to 
ensure a safe, pleasant, and economical environment for residential, commercia, industrial, and public activities. 
                  in addition, planning can help:                   
*preserve important natural resources, and agricultural land.
*create opportunity for residents to participate in guiding
our community's future.
*identify issues, stay ahead of trends, and accommodate change.
*ensure that growth makes the community better, not just bigger.
*foster sustainable economic development.
