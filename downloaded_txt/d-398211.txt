acaâ€™s mission
the aca is a not-for-profit virtual professional association with actual presence in the world of communication scholars and practitioners.
aca is committed to enabling the effective use of new and evolving technologies to facilitate communication instruction, research and criticism, and to offering a technologically supportive venue for all who study the ways in which humans communicate. while the association is based in the united states, it is a virtual organization that welcomes participation from academics and professionals throughout the world.
