"welcome to blackhillsrentals.com"
         

        john & pat

        hello and welcome to our collection of delightful vacation home rentals! 
        this grouping
        of private family mountain residences is unique to the black hills, if 
        not the nation. most are
        full sized, year round homes and we have some smaller fully equipped 
        cabins for smaller families. 
        each home or cabin has it's own lot that range 
        from almost one to six acres!  (some are
		"pet" friendly - ask for details.)
we take immense pride in these properties (and it shows). you'll see. 
        
        but, for us to continue to make
        them available for family vacations, we need your help. 
these properties may not suit some people or groups. if you are 
        looking for a "party place", or
        have adults or children in your group that are destructive or hard to 
        manage - 
        then these properties are definitely not for you.  
no non-registered visitors or vehicles 
		are permitted.

		note: we are unable to accommodate 
		 atv's or utv's at any of our properties for the 2023
		season.


our other guests, and our many return guests, come here not just for 
        the privilege of staying in one of our 
        mountain homes...they come for 
        the peace, solitude, and relaxation that our homes and the surrounding 
        forest and mountains offer.
        while at our homes you can observe deer, turkey, endless variety of 
        birds, fox, coyote, wood chucks, squirrels, chipmunks, whistle pigs, and more.  
        
        this is why our homes are a "quiet zone". 
we have pledged to our past guests that we will maintain these 
        properties in the same condition as they found during their last visit. 
        
        that means that all guests must love, cherish and protect these homes as 
        much as we do (and we do).
our rules do not restrict a normal family vacation...they enhance and 
        expand your family vacation experience.
we have been proudly serving the vacationing public since 1994, and we hope you are able to become part of our growing group of very 
        loyal guests.


                                          
        your hosts,
                                                    
        john and patricia


        *******************************
introducing the...

the gold star ranch! 


 
a very special place in the black 
hills where vacationing families are the only residents -
it is located a few miles outside of 
custer on a gravel road.  might be a little tough to find at first, but we 
like it that way! (you will too!)  
the gold star ranch! consists of a 
private group of solid log homes that await you at the end of a turn or two and 
just over a small hill and after you turn right where you should have turned 
left right where we stacked the three rocks next to the pine tree with a crooked 
branch☺!

these homes are located at the end of a dead end road in the woods and have 
forest service wilderness on two sides.  they are in a secluded and 
forested location.  there is no through traffic other than deer.  all 
homes are reserved exclusively for our guests.   each 
home sits on a one or two acre + parcel 
of black hills forest!  each home is a private residence with it's own 
driveway.
 

the gold star ranch! 
is reserved for registered guests only and the vehicles shown on the 
contract-
no non-registered visitors or vehicles are 
permitted.
(we think that you will want to keep 
the gold star ranch! a 

secret, anyway!)
if you want to reserve one of the homes in 
the gold star ranch! 
you should 
book it well in advance.  

yes, we are quite protective of these 
(and all of our) properties...and you'll understand why...
                  
when you spend your vacation at any of our homes at the...

        the gold star ranch!
                                             
          
shines like no other!
 


the following 
        properties are located in 

the gold star 
		ranch! 
         (just 
        outside of custer,sd)

"...from this place you can hear the 
        earth speak"

        rare cedar log cabin.  1 bedroom, 1 bath, can sleep 4.  full kitchen. 
        a true frontier location that is only 25' from the usfs wilderness.
        don't worry, there are plenty of wide open spaces around the 
renegade! 
        


        large spruce logs were used to build this authentic, frontier log cabin.  
        it is delightfully warm and cozy.
        it is difficult to describe...but it gives you an unusual kind 
        of...secure... feeling.  it takes you back to a simpler time...
        back when justice was truly swift and dealt by the sound of metal 
        clearing leather.
         sleeps a family of four (2 adults & 2 buckaroos).  
        a premium quality, queen bed in the bedroom.  bedroom has it's own 
        access door to the bathroom.  
        futon (full size with inner-spring mattress) in living room. fully 
        equipped kitchen with dishwasher.  
        12'x20' deck faces usfs wilderness that is just a few steps away.

another 8'x8' deck faces to the east at the entrance 
        door - a great place for your morning cup of coffee.

        this is a memorable location for special occasions, such as honeymoons 
        & anniversaries!
