life dynamicsamerica's most innovative pro-life organization since 1992.

this real-life coverup is every parent’s worst nightmare.





for several years, life dynamics investigated america’s epidemic of teen pregnancy. what we found is that this is not the result of children having sex with children. it is being driven by adult males sexually exploiting young girls. our investigation has uncovered irrefutable evidence that both planned parenthood and the national abortion federation – often operating on taxpayer dollars – knowingly conceal these crimes while aiding and abetting the sexual predators who commit them.
we have uncovered an overwhelming body of statistical evidence showing that the rate at which these two organizations fail to comply with mandatory reporting laws is in excess of 90 percent.
read the full report




listen to the tapesin 2002, we conducted an undercover phone survey of planned parenthood and national abortion federation facilities. we called 813  facilities around the country. our caller portrayed a 13-year-old girl who was pregnant by a 22-year-old man, wanting an abortion in order to conceal this illegal sexual activity from her parents and the authorities. this is a mandatory reporting situation in every jurisdiction, yet over 90 percent of the counselors from these two groups agreed to ignore the law.listen now


read actual casesthis report will show that the abortion industry’s refusal to comply with mandatory reporting laws is having profound, real-world consequences for the victims of child sexual abuse. the cases in this report are a representative sample of the total number of criminal prosecutions we found against men who have been caught having illegal sexual relationships with minor girls, where no report was ever made by the abortion providers.read now
