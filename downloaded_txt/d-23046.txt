heat exchanger integrity testing systems
for global markets, our world-first, patented, validated and innovative heist system puts control of heat exchanger integrity testing in the hands of manufacturers by allowing them to test their plate and tubular heat exchangers daily before going into production. the magic of heist gives liquid processing companies the power to prevent contamination, ensure product quality, improve productivity and reduce downtime and costs across all industries.
pastest+ is a non-destructive integrity and holding time test system for pasteurisers and plate heat exchangers. this efficient and reliable test is carried out on site in irish markets by our expert engineers. pastest+ is transforming process equipment testing worldwide, resulting in substantial cost and time savings. pastest+ is the only system on the market that can do an integrity test and holding time verification test simultaneously.

tank test+
jacketed tanks are notoriously prone to cracks and defects which can lead to serious contamination with your product being exposed to fluids or gasses.
 
our tanktest+ system, the world’s first automatic testing system for jacketed tanks, enables users to carry out an internal and external test for cracks and defects daily (or whenever the tank is full). following the test the result will be sent to via email or text to a designated recipient. it can also be integrated with your scada system.

heist – the world’s first
automatic heat exchanger testing system
our patented, innovative, and cost-effective system that puts control of integrity testing in the hands of manufacturers. heist stands for heat exchanger integrity self test.
the integrated system automatically tests pasteurizers, plate and tubular heat exchangers daily for cracks or other defects, with minimum downtime and maximum accuracy. for pasteurizers, heist also carries out an automatic holding time test and diversion valve check daily.
the magic of heist is that it gives liquid processing companies the power to prevent contamination, ensure product quality, improve productivity and reduce downtime and costs.

testimonials





arrabawn dairies have been using unison to service our pasteurizers, homogenisers and storage tanks for the past 14 years. unison does an excellent job, they are always punctual, professional and offer the most competitive rates in the industry. they provide 24hr support and can be onsite within an hour – this is critical to us, and why we use them, they are extremely dependent.
maintenance manager, arrabawn dairies



on purchasing the cheese milk pasteurizer, i found it to be very user-friendly. the touch screen simplifies its use for operators. prior and aftersales contact i have had with unison and their staff has always been handled in a professional and courteous manner. i would have no hesitations recommending unison process solutions for any future similar installations.
ballylisk dairies



we are new to milk pasteurizing and would highly recommend unison as a part of your dairy team. the pasteurizing unit is fantastic, highly efficient and easy to use. excellent and trustworthy customer service and availability even during these tough pandemic restrictions. nothing was too much trouble and we really appreciate all of the support.
