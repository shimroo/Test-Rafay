santa clara depot
the south bay historical railroad society (sbhrs) was incorporated in 1985 to preserve the local area railroad heritage while running a working museum to benefit the community. our members are volunteers and work on the renovation and preservation of the santa clara railroad depot, the santa clara tower and the two maintenance-of-way buildings.
a large and varied collection of historic railroad artifacts are on display in the edward peterman museum of railroad history located in the depot. this now includes the oregon-washington railroad & navigation business car #184 which was loaned to us and placed on our siding on june 26, 2009.
within the depot are two operational ho and n scale model railroad layout displays depicting various railroad eras and operations venues. constant work by our members on these layouts provide an ever changing panorama, giving our visitors and members a better understanding of the different aspects of model railroading.
the society is located in the historic santa clara (caltrain) depot in santa clara, california built in 1863.
