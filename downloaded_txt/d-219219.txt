airbus nine-month (9m) 2024 financial results


at a glance



we saw strong demand across our product range in the first nine months of the year. the nine-month earnings reflect the level of commercial aircraft deliveries, a solid performance in helicopters and the charges in our space business recorded in the first half. we are constantly adapting to a complex and fast-changing operating environment marked by geopolitical uncertainties and specific supply chain challenges that have materialised in the course of 2024. we remain focused on our priorities, including ramping up commercial aircraft deliveries and transforming our defence and space division.guillaume fauryairbus ceo
