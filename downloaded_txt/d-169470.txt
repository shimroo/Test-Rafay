toledo newborn photographer


you have waited nine months for your little bundle of joy to arrive and you can't wait to share him or her with the world.  having professional photographs of the newest member of your family makes the wait well worth it.  kurt has recently acquired new props and built new sets with newborn photography in mind.  kurt knows how difficult it is to travel with a newborn and also provides on location photography services in your own home (or location of your choice).  kurt suggests that you have  your newborn photo shoot within the first two weeks of your baby's birth, so it is very important that you schedule your portrait session as soon as possible once your baby is born.  if it is a scheduled delivery, you may want to call to schedule your appointment with kurt before you give birth so that you have one less thing to worry about.

toledo baby photographer


you will be amazed at how much your baby will change during his or her first year of life.  from smiling for the first time, to go from cooing and babbling to saying their first word, rolling over then learning to crawl and then walk, cutting their first tooth, sleeping through the night; all of these firsts are so very precious.  their appearance changes from month to month during their first year of life as well.  that's why photographs of your child are so important to document all of these stages and changes your baby experiences.  almost every photographer suggests you document these changes by having baby portraits every 3 months during the first year (at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and their first birthday).  kurt very much agrees with this theory.  however, kurt's creativity and resourcefulness is what sets him apart from all other photographers and what makes every portrait session unique.  kurt's patience and diligence, along with his desire to capture those perfect photos that every mother will love makes the whole kurt nielsen photography experience incomparable to any other portrait studio.
	to help capture those special moments of your baby's first year, kurt offers his "baby my baby" photography plan.  the plan includes photo sessions for your baby at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months.  one of the sessions (your choice) is also a family session which is great for any growing family.  after you have had all four sessions, you will receive a custom story board print that includes your favorite photo from each portrait session (valued at $84.95).  plus you will receive a commemorative cd slideshow set to music of all of the images taken for each photo session, and 10% off all of your print orders.  yes, there's more!  if you purchase your baby my baby plan before you give birth, your maternity photo session is free!  kurt's baby my baby plan makes a great gift for any mother-to-be!  be sure to check out kurt's  baby gallery for a peek at some of the great baby images kurt has created.

toledo family photographer


"kurt nielsen is absolutely the best photographer for any event from private special moments to huge corporate events. he is prompt, dependable, gives every client the most amazing customer service, and you walk away with the most amazing pictures. be warned - it is impossible to choose favorites because you will want them all." ~ julie s.

when was the last time you had your family portrait taken?  family photos document your growing family, just as baby pictures document the changes in your baby's development, and should be taken (at the very least) yearly.  kurt knows with everyone's busy lifestyles that this isn't always an easy thing to coordinate.  that is why he offers several options for you to choose from.  you can come into the studio, meet at the park or favorite location, or he can come to your house.  he also offers special sessions at wildwood preserve metro park and his annual "day at the bay" photo sessions at maumee bay state park.  no family is too small or too large for family portraits and many people include their family pets and extended families in their photos.  kurt can also custom make your family christmas cards or other announcement cards using images from your family photo sessions.  you can view some of kurt's recent family portraits on his  families gallery  page.

toledo senior photographer


kurt loves photographing high school seniors because this is where he can be his most creative.  your senior photos should represent your style and personality, so kurt highly recommends you bring in whatever makes you, you.  bring in your sports gear, musical instrument, pet, friends, motorized vehicle, or family; anything that will show your individuality.  of course, you have to bring in one nice outfit for the yearbook photos and your mom.  kurt will customize your senior portrait session especially for you and create artistic and traditional images from the photos he takes.  be sure to view kurt's  seniors gallery  to see which of your friends have also had kurt do their senior pics. 

toledo wedding photographer


"kurt is easy to talk to and definitely made us feel comfortable.  he did a great job of getting posed and candid photos at the wedding. he didn't get in our way and we didn't even realize he took several of the photos that he did." ~ jackie r.
traditional and classic (vintage), photojournalistic and candid, modern and edgy, romantic and fun; whatever your style preference, kurt does it all.  kurt creates beautiful wedding images tailored to each individual bride and groom's needs and wants.  kurt does all the photographing and editing himself so you never have to wonder who will show up on your wedding day or if the finished images will be as good as the ones you have seen from other weddings.  with his full day coverage, it is just that the full day.  he doesn't limit the hours to 6 or 8 or even 10 hours.  he is there from the time you want him to arrive until the party is over, however long that may take.  he doesn't bring an entourage of people that tend to get into everyone's way just so they can take more photos and charge more to do so, and then only show you a set amount of the final images.  kurt will show you all of the images that he has taken (with the exception of the blurry ones...yes, even some of his will be blurry for various reasons) on a dvd slideshow set to music.  kurt also posts all of the images in an on-line gallery so every one of your family and friends can see them, and order prints if they wish.  not getting married in toledo or the surrounding area?  kurt also does destination weddings! 
	besides being an award winning wedding photographer, kurt also offers engagement photography, trash the dress photography and even boudoir photography which makes a great wedding present for your husband to be.  if you need kurt to photograph the wedding rehearsal and dinner, or a next day brunch, depending on his availability, he could also do that and the service is priced by quote depending on your needs.  make sure you view kurt's  wedding gallery  to check out some of the amazing wedding photographs from some of kurt's recent weddings.  still think you need a second shooter because everyone else has had one or are telling you that you need one?  take a peek at his  wedding blog   and read some of the blog posts from some of the weddings he has photographed.  many of the more recent ones show an actual timeline and images he has taken without the need of a second photographer.  be sure to read the reviews his past brides and grooms have written about him.

unique toledo photo booth


"having the photo booth at our reception was the best idea! our guests had a blast and could not believe all of the background options and the amount of pictures they received ( not just one per group!) . the scrapbook we received and the end of the night is such a great keepsake that never fails to make us smile!" ~ felicty s.
are you getting married or planning an event or party?  photo booths are all the rage all across the country, and toledo is no exception.  you have seen the traditional or retro photo booths where you can only fit 2 or 3 people in each picture.  kurt's kustom keepsakes green screen photo booth is like none you have ever seen.  kurt uses a 10 foot wide green screen similar to what the weathermen and movie makers use.  because of how big the screen is, you can easily fit up to 15 adults in each photo.  then with the magic of hollywood style technology, your guests are then "dropped" into which ever background photo that they choose. kurt brings lots of props for your guests to wear and can print a 4x6 print within seconds for them to take home.  plus, kurt can also make a scrapbook for your guests to sign and you to take home.  for pricing details, please visit the  photo booth  pricing page.  to see how it works and view past events, please visit  kurt's kustom keepsakes.
