restarting on bluesky





i've started posting on bluesky -- see https://bsky.app/profile/pbokelly.bsky.socialyou can add my feed to your preferred rss reader using the same url. bluesky's rss feed capabilities are a bit of a mess as i type this, but hopefully they'll be improved soon...

our world in data: more people care about climate change than you think





 excerpt from a hannah ritchie climate perception reality check (her latest book, not the end of the world, is also a timely reality check):people across the world, and the political spectrum, underestimate levels of support for climate action.this “perception gap” matters. governments will change policy if they think they have strong public backing. companies need to know that consumers want to see low-carbon products and changes in business practices. we’re all more likely to make changes if we think others will do the same.if governments, companies, innovators, and our neighbors know that most people are worried about the climate and want to see change, they’ll be more willing to drive it.on the flip side, if we systematically underestimate widespread support, we’ll keep quiet for fear of “rocking the boat”.this matters not only within each country but also in how we cooperate internationally. no country can solve climate change on its own. if we think that people in other countries don’t care and won’t act, we’re more likely to sit back as we consider our efforts hopeless.

third act + some personal updates





 hey, is this thing still on?...a few quick personal updates:i recently retired -- had some great opportunities to apply conceptual and logical data modeling over the last ~4.5 years at bose and cargurus, but decided it was time for a new chapteri'm revisiting blogging and other info resource sharing options -- restarting this blog, my medium quasi-blog, and/or other optionsi'm kinda drowning in high-quality info resources and trying to get into a new routine for reading, harvesting, and sharingin the meantime, here's a good restart post to consider: third act endorses joe biden for president; excerpt:"in some ways, it’s almost pro forma for third act to endorse joe biden for another term as president. our tens of thousands of supporters, organized in chapters across the u.s., campaign to protect the climate, and to protect our democracy, the two issues where biden may present the greatest contrast with his opponent.donald trump pulled america out of the paris climate accords; joe biden not only put us back into the international talks but instructed every agency to consider the climate in its work, passed the inflation reduction act to build clean energy across the nation, and just weeks ago ignored the shrieks from big oil and paused the granting of new permits for liquefied natural gas, as big a blow as any president has ever delivered to dirty energy. on the democracy front, donald trump attempted a coup to overturn the results of the 2020 election; joe biden has tried throughout his career to expand voting rights and to protect the civil rights of every american. a vote is not a valentine, it’s a chess move.– rebecca solniteven in the places where we want biden to pursue different policies––gaza, mountain valley pipeline, willow project––we think his opponent would be far worse. and our members find dozens of other places—from a woman’s right to control her own body to a teacher’s right to pick books for his classroom—where we favor biden’s leadership. we bear constantly in mind our board member rebecca solnit’s advice that “a vote is not a valentine, it’s a chess move.” and in 2024 that move for us is obvious: four more years for joe biden, to advance the work he’s already done to heal our planet, our economy, and our polity. so we’ll not just vote for joe; we’ll work hard to see that trumpism is defeated."

about this blog: some updates







after nearly 20
years of weekday morning tech news scans and blogging1, i've decided it's time to change my daily routine. i've been
dedicating 1 - 2 hours most weekday mornings to tech-related news foraging, and
i've enjoyed sharing resources i've considered noteworthy (and/or snark-worthy)2, but i'm increasing my
focus on conceptual data modeling3
and climate/political activism, and reducing my daily news-foraging time
allocation4. 



as a result, the
frequency of posts on this blog will remain low for the foreseeable future. for
now, here are some other resources (most available via email newsletters) you may find useful for daily news updates:

     newsletter

numlock news

 https://numlock.substack.com/






i'll post occasional
updates as i run across other useful resources.



for now: thanks for reading over the years -- more to
follow, but with fewer than 7 +/- 2 posts per weekday…



notes:

1: my first reality
check post was 19991027, but i changed hosting service providers a couple times
before ending up on blogspot in early 2002.



2: i may increase
the post frequency again if i run across a browser extension or ios/macos
sharing extension that significantly streamlines the posting process; blogger
has frankly been a bit of a nuisance since google broke its blogthis browser
extension many months ago (without such an extension, every post requires
several [error-prone…] copy/paste/format actions). windows live writer (created
by jj allaire and his onfolio team) was by far the best blogging tool i've run
across, but alas microsoft acquired, eventually open-sourced, and effectively
killed wlw many years ago. 



3: i started a
second blog on medium several months ago -- https://medium.com/infoslob -- with a
focus on everyday conceptual data models, but the response thus far has been
less than encouraging (i would like to thank both
of the readers who made it all the way through my apple
podcasts post, for example; this blog has typically had 15 - 20k page views per month, but i've always assumed a lot of those were from russian bots etc.). i'm going to resume model-related posts on medium and
will post links here as well, when i do.



4: the overall shift
to social media (especially facebook and twitter) and apps/services such as
medium have also changed my news-foraging modus operandi over the years. i've
also been mindful of the increasingly common use of paywalls, since i can't
assume all readers have access to all sources (or to aggregators such as apple
news+).
