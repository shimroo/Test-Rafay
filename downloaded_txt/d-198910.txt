"on the nautilus
                                                        men's hearts never fail them, no defects to be afraid of, for the double shell is
                                                        as firm as iron, no rigging to attend to; no sails for the wind to carry away; no
                                                        boilers to burst; no fire to fear , for the vessel is made of iron, not of wood;
                                                        no coal to run short, for electricity is the only power; no collision to fear, for
                                                        it alone swims in deep water; no tempest to brave, for when it dives below the water,
                                                        it reaches absolute tranquility. that is the perfection of vessels."
