about us



			 brazilian jiujitsu - self defense - fitness
		


		 highly influential in the development of gracie jiu jitsu was helio gracie. all the gracie were slight of frame, but helio was particularly small and frail. because of his small stature, helio could not use many of the japanese moves that were based on power and speed, so he developed new leverages and new ways of doing moves. helio turned out to be a brilliant innovator, and the style he developed proved to be victorious against all others, regardless of size. for the next seventy-five years the gracie family dedicated themselves to the preservation and dissemination of this great fighting style - gracie jiu jitsu. 

our owner and head instructor professor jw wright has been training with helio's son, master royler gracie and master david adiv since 1999. he earned his black belt in 2008 and has been teaching the art of gracie jiujitsu in this area since 2002. his passion for teaching good people great jiujitsu is demonstrated across the nation in his seminars and lessons on self defense, training of law enforcement, and the many pan american and world champions who have trained with him through the years.

at our academy you are welcomed as family and as part of a team mentality that supports and furthers the development of skills in one another. "no one person is greater than the other on the mat. with this ideology, we together as a group are unstoppable."
