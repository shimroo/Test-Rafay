rivers to success
the rivers to success (r2s) program, with its unique three streams and customized cultural resources, will provide a strong support system to ensure the sustained success of indigenous students as they graduate and go on to become the leaders of tomorrow.
in r2s, students will have access to elders, indigenous mentors, indigenous laureates, and indigenous building brighter futures alumni. connecting with these resources will enable students to prioritize their own development, seek out exciting opportunities, and ultimately achieve success in their chosen fields – all while maintaining essential connections to their cultures and communities.
