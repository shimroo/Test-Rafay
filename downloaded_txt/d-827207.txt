flavors of the maghreb & southern italy 
recipes from the land of the setting sun

 the arabic word maghreb means âland where the sun sets.â the maghreb is a multicultural mediterranean region of north africa which includes tunisia, algeria, morocco, mauritania, and libya. it is bordered by the beautiful mediterranean sea, and in ancient times, the maghreb included spain, sicily, and malta. the history of this region is completely different from that of the rest of africa, and todayâs cuisine reflects those differences. 

           before the arab conquest, the phoenicians, greeks, romans, byzantines, and later the italians and french, colonized the maghreb. each new culture that entered the region left unique influences and together they created a multicultural cuisine using aromatic spices, fresh herbs, citrus, dried fruits, nuts, fresh fish, lamb, chicken, pasta, rice, and copious fresh vegetables. ancient civilizations such as phoenicians and romans spread the cultivation of wheat. the moors brought citrus and olives from spain. the berbers gave birth to couscous. fennel, peas, and artichokes arrived with the italian settlement, and the baguette, salad niã§oise, and mayonnaise were brought by the french when they colonized the area. thus, the food of maghreb became a mã©lange of sicilian, french, spanish, arabic, and berber cuisine.
