moon rise





whenever there is news of a big full moon i run around town looking for the best place to see it rise.nine times out of ten.  i do not see it.  it's uncanny.  our house is surrounded by pine trees.they make a glorious sound when it is windy.however they make my sunrise and moonrise viewingfrustrating.anyway, i'm not just here to complain.i want to tell you my sweet delight yesterday upon leaving physical therapy at ten to five.i looked to my left to make my right hand turnand there, rising above our main street was the big beautiful full moon.i smiled and scanned the horizon the whole way home; not seeing it most of the time,but a getting a thrilling glimpse every so often.most things i can capture satisfactory with my camera,but not the moon.  this image is from the lovely picture book, owl moon by jane yolken.it's the quietest of books you will read. "when you go owling you don’t need words or
warm or anything but hope. that’s what pa
says.
the kind of hope that flies on silent wings under
a shining owl moon."seeing the moon on my drive home made me feel these kind of feels.it's just that way for me.encourage one another,donna

skating with harley and katie's birthday.





the ghosts of winter pastonce upon a time i lived in hilly, pine tree covered wausau, wisconsin.every day at noon i would head over to the ice rink at the fair grounds to skate.typically four or five skaters would be there; a mother and a child, a young man skating figures, an elderly gentleman and me.the young man showed me how to skate a figure eight. i learned to use the edges on my skates.harley, the elderly man, taught me to skate the waltz. the waltz is skated much faster than you would imagine and very close to your partner.stroke, swing, inside edge, loop.stroke, turn, outside edge, glide.i was nervous and scared and worked very hard to keep up with harley's speed and steps.i loved it so much.it was possibly the coolest thing i have ever done.(post from quiet life 2005)did you know my blog is twenty years old?my first profile picture.christmas pictures thru the years.....katie turns twenty-five tomorrow.she was four when i started blogging.we continue to  enjoy one another's company and make one another giggle.she and her boyfriend will come over for chicken and dumplings tomorrow.we might put together a puzzle and make the last of the rolo turtles.we will live that quiet life when we are not laughing out loud.happy birthday honey.i love you.mom

december: all bundled up





welcome december!with such a late thanksgiving, december took us by surprise.well.  me at least! heh.decemberby john updikefirst snow! the flakes,so few, so light,remake the worldin solid white.all bundled up,we feel as ifwe were fat penguins,warm and stiff.the toy-packed shopshalf split their sides,and mother brings homethings she hides.old carols peal.the dusk is densethere is a moodof sweet suspense.the shepherds wait,the kings, the treeall wait for somethingyet to be.some miracle.and then it's here,wrapped up in hope-another year!******december memories....last year katie and karen decorated for me.  i think i really liked that tradition!!!i am slowly switching the decorations over from fall to winter.  slowly.yoohoo.  katie and karen!!!encourage one another,donna

constants





happy one year anniversary!lumpectomy done. check.as you can see i was loved and supported by my lovely family.cindy came to the hospital and was there for me and patrick.the above picture is from the day after my surgery.  you can see i was feeling just fine.for me surgery is no big deal. wound care (bad care)chemo side effects.er visits.big deal.i did have great results from my surgery so for that i am very grateful.(clear margins and no cancer in lymph nodes)but most of all i think of all my loved ones.my constants.and i feel so very thankful and blessed.love you. mean it.donna elsie*******still herebeen scared and battered.my hopes the wind done scattered.snow has friz me,sun has baked me,looks like between 'em they donetried to make mestop laughin', stop lovin', stop livin'--but i don't care!i'm still here! ~langston hughes

hair growth after chemo. month eight





 i once ran a brush through my hair and i couldn't believe it!this is what my hair looked like. and while i love prue and think she looks great...she is 84 after all.i'm not ready to look 20 years older than i am.chemo curls are very common.they go every which way.i bought a product called love ur curls.this helps my hair not be so bouffant.just making a record here.i imagine next month to be about the same.we shall see.my son patrick said,"how often do you get to grow a totally new hair style?"my son, who is not an encourager in general, really encouraged me.so there you have month eight, chemo grow out.a few more days and i will celebrate the lumpectomy anniversary.what a year.  what a year.encourage one another,donna

november comes





 novemberthe stripped and shapelymaple grievesthe ghosts of herdeparted leaves.the ground is hard,as hard as stone.the year is old,the birds have flown.and yet the world,in its distress,displays a certain loveiness--the beauty of the bone.  tall godmust see our soulsthis way, and nod.give thanks: we do,each in his placearound the tableduring grace. by john updikei find this poem to be so beautiful and surprisingly profound for a children's poem.don't you?***indian summer came and went. the gusty winds finally blew the leaves from the trees.  the spring training, that had begun so long ago had ended, and summer ball had taken its place,and a fall, and shohei ohtani had won a world series.congrats dodgerscongrats shohei.thanks for a wonderful season!encourage one another,donnaht:harper lee
