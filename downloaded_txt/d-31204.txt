"helping woodworkers online for 20 years"




welcome to
                  sawdustmaking 101, it is my hope that this site will
                  help novices better understand the fundamentals of
                  woodworking.
it is not necessary to
                  spend a fortune on tools to enjoy this hobby, many
                  projects can be done with a minimum investment. 
i have included links
                  to two valuable resources, a glossary
                  with basic definitions of the terms commonly used in
                  woodworking and an online reprint of carpentry for boys, a book
                  written for woodworking apprentices in 1914.

try to select projects you feel
                    capable of doing but will also offer a bit of a
                    challenge so you continue to gain additional skills,
                    many simple plans can be found on the projects
                    page. softwoods such as pine or spruce are good
                    woods to practice with, when you become more
                    confident move on to the more exotic woods.
making shop fixtures and jigs is a
                    great way to hone your skills, many of them can be
                    made from used or recycled material, our shop jigs
                      and fixtures page has a lot of handy ideas.
add tools as you need them, always
                    buy the best tool you can afford. there is usually
                    more than one way to accomplish the same result,
                    tools are often a matter of preference than
                    necessity. consider buying used tools, the build
                    quality of older tools is often superior to many of
                    the new tools on today's market.
i have
                      included sections on hand
                        tools and power tools
                      with basic information on using them along with
                      links to suppliers that can supply you with
                      further information on specific brands. any
                      purchase from those links helps keep this site
                      online.
never forget how dangerous a power
                    tool can be, if you have any hesitation as to the
                    safety of a situation stop and check out your
                    options.
if it doesn't
                      feel good don't do it.

 work area


whether your work area is
                        a dedicated shop or a temporary cleared space in
                        the basement or garage safety has to be the
                        number one concern. a clean shop is a safe shop,
                        spend a few minutes at the end of the day
                        picking up and sweeping the floor. this not
                      only cleans your surroundings, it also
                      clears your mind, the solution to that problem you
                      had earlier may suddenly appear.
if you must use an extension
                      cord try to run it overhead and drop it down at
                      the machine so you are not tripping over it. plan
                      to have a place for everything and everything in
                      it's place.
organize your time so you are
                      doing the complicated parts of the project at the
                      beginning of your work session while your mind is
                      fresh. if you work all day at your job and then
                      spend several hours in your shop you will get
                      "silly tired", this is when mistakes are made and
                      accidents happen. 
most importantly enjoy your shop
                      time, often it is the journey, not the destination that
                        gives you the most satisfaction.

 about me
i have
                        been involved one way or another with
                        woodworking for the last six decades, it began
                        when i was about ten years old, my father built me
                        a jigsaw by modifying an old briggs and stratton
                        engine. looking back i don't believe it cost him
                        anything more than the price of a few welding
                        rods to give me hours of entertainment cutting
                        doodads out of apple

                        box wood. the last three have been limited due
                        to health reasons but i still do small projects
                        when necessary. 
i was
                        lucky enough to grow up on a farm so i learned
                        from a very young age how to improvise to get a
                        job done. i have owned several businesses over
                        the years ranging from making toys to custom
                        fireplace mantels for luxury home builders.
