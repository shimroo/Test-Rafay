moonie.ca







 
welcome to moonie.ca!*



*an esoteric niche activity that is well outside the mainstream data 
 service


unlike moonie.com,
moonie.org, (both previously owned 
by jeff bowman in north carolina), and 
moonie.net  (previously owned by 
gary moonie in british columbia) (now both owned by domain squaters 
monitizing with unrelated ads) 
moonie.ca actually has content. ^_-
server owned and operated by: 
glen a. pearce

want this



users with content hosted on the www.moonie.ca server include:


me ^_^
autobahn access users group
    (if you are a current or former autobahn access customer please read this.)

hosts that i currently have defined under moonie.ca 
are:

http://www.moonie.ca
        this machine. ^_^
ftp://ftp.moonie.ca
        also this machine. ^_^
http://web21.moonie.ca
        my ftp as a http link incase you want to post a link
        to something in my ftp site on a message board that won't 
        let you post links that don't start with http. 

     http://geocities.moonie.ca
        re-director that i will point at one of the geocities
        archives listed below, which one may be changed from 
        time to time.  (to save me time updating links in my 
        own web pages. ^_-)
http://status.moonie.ca
        server status messages on my tapatalk message board. 
        (previously yuku, previous to that it was easyboard.)
http://autobahn.moonie.ca
        the autobahn access web server, this one was defined for
        some of my own pages that were on autobahn's server.  this 
        is no longer of use as they shut their members server down.  
http://wac.moonie.ca
        this hostname was previously used by the winnipeg anime club,
        it now has a re-direction link to wac's own domain name, 
        www.wpganime.ca.  wpganime.ca
        was hosted on wac's own server box (donated by braeden keys 
        except for the hard drive, power supply, and network card 
        which are on long term loan from me) which was co-located at
        the moonie.ca data center. (aka my livingroom. ^_-)  comstock
        has since moved the site to a hosting account he has elsewhere.
ftp://carlene.moonie.ca
        carlene's ftp server
http://carleyweb.moonie.ca
        redirector on this web server to carlene's ftp server.  
        (some places won't take an ftp site as "your web site")


if you would like a hostname under the moonie.ca domain pointed at
your ip address contact me
for details.

hosts discontinued under moonie.ca:

http://marco.moonie.ca now has it's own domain name, now go to
    http://www.reimeika.ca.

moonie.ca e-mail

there is no mail server for thie moonie.ca domain at this time however
i do have e-mail forwarding through easydns (see banner at the bottom 
of this page).  i have extra e-mail forwarding ailiases that i'm 
willing to re-sell for $1 cdn (or $1 u.s.) per year.  there is an 
additional $1 cdn (or $1 u.s.) fee for each time you have me change 
the e-mail address that the ailias forwards to in order to discourage
frequent change requests. ^_-  
contact me for details. 
(i respond faster to icq messages than e-mail. ^_-)

certain persons such as fansubbers, qualified fansub distros, personal
friends of mine, and anyone else i choose to favour can get moonie.ca 
ailiases at no charge. ^_^

moonie.homeip.net

the free name provied by dyndns.org 
(moonie.homeip.net) will be kept
but now points to the server status page for moonie.ca.  this is to 
encourage people to update their links as i have more control over the
moonie.ca name than over moonie.homeip.net. ^_-


www.moonie.ca is a cookies free server
(as opposed to a free cookies server. ^_-)

haven't you ever wondered about all these cookies other sites give 
you?  i mean you are probably thinking that these sites are run by
a bunch of nice guys giving out free cookies but have you ever 
noticed they never give you any milk to go with them?  i think this 
overuse of cookies is just a sceme to sell more milk. ^_-

if you are looking for a t-shirt or poster with the picture that
appears on the left you can buy one from 
gotmilk.com.

note: gotmilk.com gives out cookies so that proves my theory. ^_-
they give out weird flavours like 
aspsessionidgqqggqfs=mfbcghkbohnghhjbennhcmeh, personally i'd perfer 
chocolate chip. ^_-

dummies guide to setting up a nt based web server.




this section has been revised as it was originally a guide based on 
pws and moonie.ca has stopped using pws as of sept. 19/2001 after the 
nimda virus
exposed a serious security flaw in pws.  (as well as in newer versions
of internet explorer, i would now recommend that you switch to firefox,
mozilla or opera browsers instead. ^_-)

the moonie.ca web server now runs using 
xitami (info on legacy version)
which is much less fussy about the order of installation 
than pws and is much easier to figure out so a detailed installation
guide is no longer needed for those getting set up.  also xitami has 
you select the administration username and password while the installer
is running so it's easy to configure.

although xitami also includes ftp service this was de-activated and 
i'm still using serve-u ftp from 
catsoft as the ftp server due to some better features that it 
offers.


for those of you who want a domain name pointed at your server i
recommend easydns who provide the domain registration and dns service 
for moonie.ca.  (they
no longer offer a referal bonus but i still recommend them. ^_-)
'a dns service i can bank on' 
-some guy in argentina (paraphrased ^_-)

they also offer support for 
dns security extensions,
encryption on mail forwarding,
and an
imap migration tool
for those who want those features.


see 
pricing by tld.



also check out their 
domain help
(incorporating easy whois lookup).

coming soon is their 
easycrypto payment gateway.
