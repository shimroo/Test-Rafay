				welcome to topiaryhire					





established in 2003, we initially specialised in the supply of a whole host of topiary plants. over the years, we have expanded our services to offer and supply a comprehensive range of real and synthetic trees, plants, greenery, floral, planters, props and led trees for any manner of television productions, films and events. 

















we cater for both the uk and international market. our highly skilled team are able to cater for short notice or same day bookings, to long term hires, custom projects and outright purchases.every booking is important to us, large or small, and we acknowledge that no one job is ever the same. 











as qualified and experienced plantsmen / horticulturalists, we pride ourselves on being able to offer a quick response to your enquiry along with the finest service and attention to detail.we push boundaries with concepts that start on paper, majestically brought to fruition as real living designs and installations. 











we offer every conceivable type of tree, plant, shrub or simple floral arrangement to full scale branded installations. if its green and it grows, we can supply it. *   
* sometimes subject of course to mother natures’ availability and lead times!

sustainability and recyclable products are extremely important to us (our main stock site is operated on 80% solar & wind power) and where possible, we will always use eco friendly 100% biodegradable products. we also aim to recycle all the products we use, even if that means repurposing them for use in another way, we would rather do this than have to discard product.
