try flyfone voip before buying





so you like the concept of 'cutting' your phone service in favour of flyfone voip but are hesitant to take the plunge and abandon your 'line" without trying it out for yourself first. perhaps the advertised features and rates all sound a little 'too-good-to-be-true'. the terrific news is that you can make flyfone voip calls using your computer to virtually any telephone or computer in the world with little more than an internet connection and a flyfone usb phone.firstly, let's look at the 'free' way of taking flyfone voip for a test drive. so what's a 'flyfone usb ' i hear you ask? a 'flyfone usb' is merely a usb phone that enables you to use your computer like you would a telephone.flyfone usb enable you to call other 'internet-connected' devices (free pc to pc voip), or conventional telephones for a small fee (pc to phone voip). the reason that 'pc to phone voip' calls (i.e., to conventional phones) are not free is that in order to call normal telephones, your call needs to route partially through the heavily regulated, heavily taxed public switched telephone network (pstn). as long as the person you're calling is also connected to the internet, you can talk for as long as you like across the neighborhood or on the other side of the world for free. furthermore with pc to pc voip, there aren't any contracts to sign or commitments to make. just use the flyfone usb, and start talking.

flyfone calling plan right for my home?





if you watch tv read magazines, or drive through and cities with billboards chances are you’ve come across advertisements for voip calling plans. many of these advertisements try to sell their services on how much less expensive their services are compared to traditional calling plans. they also talk about quality and clarity of calls. you’ve probably wondered how much of this is true and how much is hype.voip or voice over internet protocol is probably one of the most revolutionary advances in the telecommunications industry. it allows you to talk to another person across the globe using digital network connection exactly the same as way you receive email or visit websites. because you voice is converted into a digital signal it can be sent across the street, across the country, or across the globe for exactly the same cost. for voip calls the concept of long distance doesn’t exist.voip calling packages come in two flavors, bulk rate pricing and unlimited calling. bulk rate pricing allows you to have a monthly allotment of minutes to call who ever you want (just like your cell phone service). if you go over your monthly allotment you will have overage charges. unlimited calling is exactly just like it sounds you have no limit on the amount of calls you can make. unlimited calling plans range from $35 to $90 per month depending on the voip service provider and the additional features included with your plan. unless you are making a lot of calls or the unlimited calling plan is very inexpensive bulk rate pricing is usually a better option.just like cellular phones voip service providers allow you to “port” or move switch your existing phone number into their service. this is really convenient as you won’t have to notify your friends and family you’ve changed your number. currently there is no legislation that voip providers have to allow you to port your number out if you are unhappy or want to change providers. some of them will, others will charge you a fee, and some will refuse to accommodate your request, be sure to check this before you sign any contracts.if the voip company you are using “piggybacks” on your existing broadband cable connection your phone service is dependant on your cable connection. if your cable connection goes out or you drop your cable company your voip phone service won’t work. additionally if you lose power in your house unless you have a backup generator your phone won’t work.lastly many voip service providers don’t interface well with emergency services (911). on traditional phone lines your address information is automatically sent when you make a call, this isn’t true for voip.

what is a flyfone voip router?





voice over internet protocol is a new way to talk on your phone through your broadband internet connection. a flyfone voip router is needed to help you use the same phone you have been using before your voip connection. if you have voice over internet protocol available to you, youll need a flyfone router to sort of make it all happen. it's a small device that will take a little time to get used to, but once you've used it just a couple times you'll be able to use the whole system without a second thought.without a flyfone voip router your phone will not be able to figure out where datagrams should go from source to destination, so information will be lost. routers will help control phone traffic, controls and maintains bandwidth, and ensures a good voice quality for each and every phone call. basically, router is responsible for routing all the information in and out of your home so that you can get the services you are supposed to get.it's said that because of ever expanding technology that flyfone voip routers won't be needed for much longer. with the invention of digital telephones the need for a separate router won't be necessary. but, until this newer technology becomes more widespread and cost efficient, the majority of flyfone voip users will need a flyfone router to use the voice over internet protocol features. because of this newer technology, having voip service will become easier and more accessible to everyone in the very near future. but, don't let the idea of a routing device scare you off, as flyfone voip is very easy to use!

a guide to information on internet phone or voip





voip came about in 1995 when some computer programmers made voice connections between computers. later that year, a software package was developed, and using the modem, speakers, microphone and sound card, one computer user was able to speak to another.the process used involves converting the analog voice to digitized form. that involves breaking the voice down into steps that are then assigned numeric values. then the data is compressed. after compression, the data is divided into packets that are transmitted over the internet. identifying information such as origin, destination, etc., are added that allows for reconstruction at the receiving end. at this point the packets are converted back to analog and the person on the other end of the line can hear the caller"s voice.as internet phone technology improved, by 1998, gateways had been established allowing a pc to connect to a phone. later that year, it was possible to make phone-to-phone connections using the internet. phone-to-phone connections still required a computer to initiate the call, but once the connection was established, callers could use a standard phone set. today, the computer is no longer needed. all one needs is a telephone (your regular telephone will do), an adapter, and an internet connection either broadband or dsl, and a service provider. the telephone is connected to the adapter, which is connected to the internet connection without the need to connect to a computer. for the best quality and to get normal phone company features such as call waiting, etc., you need a voip service provider. there are a number of them competing for your business so you need to do some research to find one that is best for you.if you sign up with an internet phone service provider you can get unlimited calls within the country for a small monthly fee! international calls can also be made for a lot less than the cost of regular service. features like call forwarding, call waiting, voicemail, caller id and 3way-calling, are included with internet phone at no extra charge. while you"re talking on the phone, you can send pictures and documents at the same time.like all new technologies, voip had some problems at first, but is now becoming more reliable and receiving wider acceptance. one thing it has done for you already is that phone companies are beginning to use the technology to provide cheaper long distance rates.at this time there are several disadvantages to using internet phone. unlike telephone company service, you will lose your connection during a power outage. the solution to this problem is to have battery backups installed.there is also a problem calling 911. but, there is a system in development to overcome this problem. there are also call quality and reliability problems with voip. the two biggest issues that affect call quality are the distance of the call and the speed of the internet connection. however, as the system matures, these are becoming less and less of a problem.in the future, voip will probably become the standard for telephone service. so, go out and get hooked up with internet phone and save yourself some money.
