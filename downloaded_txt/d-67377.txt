testimonial from john bradley of boucherville, quebec, canada



date: 16 may 2012 2012 22:17
from: john.bradley @ canam.ws
subject: a few comments and photos
to: mgreen @ ireland-information.com

good evening michael,

just a few words to say that st. patrick's day 2012 was one 
that i will not forget. first my son built a small irish pub 
at the house and it was our grand opening with family and 
friends. then it was our pride to show everyone the irish 
flag with our family crest and the magnificent plaque that 
we ordered from irishnation. 



i have included a few photos so that you may see how your quality 
products fit in with the pub and pool room that has now became my 
pride and joy for my retirement days to come. 



thank you for the good service and making sure that my orders 
would arrive in time for st. patrick's day. more photos to follow. 

john bradley
