steam flow form

 the sleek and functional design of the steam flow form presents the nostalgic charm of early industrial design as well as providing a dramatic twist to modern design. it is ideal for use in lofts, studios and galleries, or rooms where a deliberate design statement is to be made. fins arranged in a spiral around the heating tube radiate heat efficiently throughout the room in a highly pleasing way. the steam flow form is for two-pipe steam systems only.

mounting





mounting tips:

lay out the desired position of the radiator on the wall. determine the locations of solid wall members (wall studs, bracing, etc.). mark the positions for the mounting brackets, noting that each bracket should fit in the center of the space between adjacent radiator tubes. note: all of the brackets supplied with the radiator should be used, half as top supports and half as bottom supports.
attach all of the bracket sleeves (a) to solid wall members, using the appropriate mounting fastener (b) (by others)
position mounting bracket cylinders (c) between adjacent radiator (d) tubes, so that the cylinders (c) will line up with the bracket sleeves (a), mounted on the wall.
rotate cylinder (c) to tighten and clamp the cylinder’s end piece between the radiator’s tubes.
slide the cylinders (c) into the mounting sleeves (a), making final adjustments by loosening cylinder (c), sliding it into final alignment, and re-tightening it. secure cylinder (c) to sleeve (a) by tightening up allen head screw (e). note: the radiator should tilt towards the condensate return at a rate of 1/16” per foot of radiator length.

general installation tips




2-pipe steam system

a 1″ npt tapping is included on each corner of the radiator.two 1″ plugs are provided to plug the two unused radiator tappings.use a 5/8″ allen wrench to tighten these plugs. a third plug with a 1/8″ vent tapping is also included.pipe dope should be applied to the plugs.
the installer should supply and install the proper size reducing bushing.
the mounting brackets must be secured to a load-bearing wall member (like a wall stud or solid backing) capable of handling the radiator’s weight.
the radiator should be tilted a minimum of 1/16” per foot toward the condensate return.

mounting




mounting tips:

lay out the desired position of the radiator on the wall. determine the locations of solid wall members (wall studs, bracing, etc.). mark the positions for the wall mounting brackets (a), noting that each bracket should fit in the center of the space between adjacent radiator tubes. fasten all part a wall brackets securely to the wall using appropriate mounting fasteners (by others). note: all of the brackets supplied should be used, half as top supports and half as bottom supports.
rotate part c at a 90° angle to part b, and insert part c between two adjacent rear tubes of the radiator so that the bracket assembly b-c will line up with it’s corresponding slot on part a.
rotate part c back 90° in the opposite direction, so that the bracket assembly b-c “captures” the two adjacent rear tubes of the radiator (see figure #2).
tighten the screw on part c (see figure #3), so that the bracket assembly b-c tightly clamps the radiator’s rear tubes. repeat steps 2, 3, and 4 for all remaining bracket assemblies.
mount the radiator to the wall by placing parts b into the mounting slots of parts a, check to make sure that the radiator tilts at least 1/16″ per foot towards the condensate return. if necessary, loosen all parts c slightly and adjust the radiator to get the proper radiator tilt.

mounting




mounting tips:

this radiator may only be installed horizontally and affixed to the floor as shown with two screws in each pedestal.
the radiator may be rotated depending on which sides the supply and return are desired.
the radiator should be tilted a minimum of 1/16″ per foot toward the condensate return. this can be accomplished by turning the center tube from the bottom of the radiator as well as the pedestal base to adjust the pedestals.
accurately mark the holes to mount the pedestal bases as shown under specifications.
drill holes to suit screws
fix radiator to the floor with screws.
a control valve should be installed on the supply side and a steam trap on the return side. use pipe dope to seal connections.
