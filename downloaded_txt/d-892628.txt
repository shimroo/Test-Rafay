public outreach



the challenge
the public’s perception of bioscience research too often is misinformed.
our solution
ncabr provides free training and materials to k–12 educators by bringing them into research facilities to learn directly from scientists through our rx for science literacy free workshop series. we also offer online courses, curricula and other publications about research and present outreach programs for the general public, including k–12 students.






researcher support



the challenge
researchers need professional development opportunities and resources about how to better communicate with the public.
our solution
ncabr presents programs on topics such as iacucs, biosafety and bioethics that help meet the needs of researchers throughout the state and nation. we offer deeply discounted or free admission to employees of ncabr member organizations. we also provide tips on how to talk more easily about research with lay audiences.






crisis assistance



the challenge
research organizations periodically face crisis situations related to anti-science activity and opposition to animal research.
our solution
ncabr provides strategic guidance to member organizations in crisis situations. we monitor press coverage and are available to interact with the media and draft opinion pieces on our members’ behalf. members also have access to our detailed crisis and communications manual.
