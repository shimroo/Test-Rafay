church of christ news
posted by chuck on january 31, 2012 under resources, stone-campbell restoration | be the first to comment 
not too long ago, there were only a few sources that we could access with news among the churches of christ.  most of the sources were products of our colleges and universities.
of course, long time publications like the christian chronicle and the gospel advocate always had information, but since it was printed monthly, the news wasn’t very “new”.
today both the chronicle and advocate have web sites, but only the chronicle posts current news items.  i recently came across brotherhood news and i am simply amazed at the wealth of content.

articles for edification
posted by chuck on january 28, 2012 under ministry, resources, teaching | be the first to comment 
i came across an excellent web site with a diverse collection of well-written articles simply called: church of christ articles  – here is what their “about” says at the site:
this objective of this site is to enable you the reader to discover what preachers from the churches of christ are teaching.  the preachers study and come to their conclusions by studying the bible.  each of the men on who post on this site are all in agreement on what constitutes “biblical authority” and “god’s plan of salvation” and strive to teach accordingly.
i have found the articles useful, informative, educational, and uplifting.  i pray that you find them beneficial as well!

vbs 2011
posted by chuck on august 9, 2011 under resources, teaching | be the first to comment 
it seems as though i failed to note my vbs choice for 2011.  after looking through a dozen or so vbs kits we opted for group’s pandamania!  the five day vbs focused on god’s presence in our lives based upon psalm 139.  day 1 is god made you; day 2 is god listens to you; day 3 is god watches over you; day 4 is god loves you; day 5 is god gives good gifts.
the vbs rotates among stations and works well.  the thing that made this vbs different for our teachers is that this is the first vbs we did with groups of kids with mixed ages.  i was skeptical at first, but it worked out really well.  the key is to get the older kids to help the younger ones.  having mixed ages also affords splitting up some kids who are (for a better lack of words) troublemakers.  it also allows for siblings to be together.
