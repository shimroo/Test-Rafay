astonishing perfection





 astonishing perfection is
familiar to me from japanese culture, but there is, among us jews, one custom
in which it appears proudly: whoever wants to finance a torah scroll turns to a
torah copying expert, pays him a respectable sum of money, and waits many
months to his finished copy. but if there was one wrong letter in the book no
one should read this book, and all the tremendous effort was in vain. this
custom express respect for the torah, for the book, for the word.
and i'm telling you all this
so that you'll understand correctly the magnitude of the disgrace of google's
global library project that has negligently copied millions of books using
sophisticated scanners, and their many errors are accessible for free, to
anyone who wants them, at any time,  on
the internet. to fix them require more resources than google allocated to upload
them so that most likely humanity will have to live with these errors until the
sun goes out, if at all. see: http://firstmonday.org/article/view/1972/1847

what's wrong with google's results page?









"he that hates
gifts shall live" (proverbs 15:27)





google collected the best of the world's
computer engineers, and they are working night and day, for many years, slowly
and methodically, using the most advanced methods, in order to increase
google's revenues . every element on the results page is a masterpiece of deception
that  passed the test of billions of
people. [1]



at the top of the results page, under
the search words, in bright black letters, 
appear the number of results.



to its right, in brackets, in smaller
dark black font - an indication of the duration of the search.



every results page has ten results.



every result has a blue title



green link beneath it,



date beneath it,



followed by a snippet, which is a
summary of the proposed document. the snippet has usually two lines.



inside the snippet in bold letters show
the keywords the user typed.



google's results page is full of
deliberate diversions, elements which are wasting the user's time, obstacles
placed on his way to the answer he is looking for.



the number of the results and the
duration of the search are interesting for the engineers at google
but not for the surfer.



the title is not meant to be
relevant. it is designed to allow the surfer to reach the document from which
the snippet was taken. after exiting from any document the title changes color,
in order to prevent the user from re-entering the document he already visited.
the title of the sponsored links and of the organic links look identical
(there's a tiny square with the word ad in front of the sponsored links). it is
designed as a trap that forces the user to click on the sponsored link, which
is less relevant, but is placed before the organic link2]]. 



the colored link is irrelevant -
it is not designed to be read.



the date is irrelevant - it
certainly is not that important to be placed at the top of the snippet.



the number of results does not
help the surfer to understand the answers. the hundreds, thousands and millions
of results that are waiting for him on the following pages just confuse and
frighten him [3]. a typical surfer sees only the first screen, and not even the
entire results page, ie, the first five results [4].



each result has colorful letters and
black letters on a white background. as we know, colorful letters attract more
attention than black and white letters [5]. if 
the snippets were colorful and all the rest of the text was in black on
white, we could understand that the main thing is the information, while the
title and the link are less important, but the color is dedicated to the title
and the link, and the impression is that they are meant to separate the
results, and that the purpose of the result it to navigate outside by clicking
the title.



 even the result that google ranks first,
because it is the most relevant, leads to a document that has, generally, many
paragraphs, but only few of them are relevant and contain the keywords typed by
the user.



google's snippet is too short [6] and
fragmentary, and it does not allow the surfer to best decide whether he should
surf to the proposed document.

yolink







yolink,
at first glance, looks very similar to qtsaver.

they
both extract relevant paragraphs from several internet documents into one
results' page. 



qtsaver
started in 2005. 

yolink
- in 2008 (under the name chunkit! until 2009). 



yolink,
was developed by tigerlogic, a company from portland, or.

but
while qtsaver was standing alone using results from google, yahoo and wikipedia,
yolink is an add-on to browsers like google chrome, firefox, safari and a
widget for blog tools like wordpress and typepad. 

you
can see a few nice presentations of yolink in action on: 
https://www.youtube.com/channel/uc6cnkoqdos4d-nqlpc2zmnw



yolink
is based on a patent
"systems and methods of displaying document chunks in response to a search
request us 20090216736 a1" by             jeffrey
matthew dexter and robert smik.



qtsaver
was closed on 2006. 



yolink
is still running, and i hope that it will succeed more and more, since the
current google-like search engine results page serves the giant money makers more
than the knowledge seekers, and "money blinds the eyes of the wise and twists
the words of the innocent" (deuteronomy 16:19 ).

synonyms for the term search engine







the term search engine is a simile which can mislead us. it makes us
think that there's a machine that makes answers. actually the computer does not
search answers - it searches matches between the words we typed and the words
in its index, which had been prepared in advance. if there is a match the match
becomes the answer.



search and find are opposites, but the term search engine has no
antonym, no opposite. 



the unity of the opposites search and find is information. sometimes we
type the information (words) "prime minister of israel" and we get
the result: "benjamin "bibi" netanyahu is the current prime
minister of israel". the same words (prime minister of israel) appear in
the question and in the answer. when prophet isaiah said: "for the
earth will be filled with the knowledge of the lord as the
waters cover the sea" (11:9) he prophesized about the unity of the
opposites, since the sea is made of water which is both the content of the sea
and its coverage.



the academic synonym for search engine is information retrieval (ir). the term information
retrieval is not a simile. it seems more accurate and down to earth, but its
premise is that the information is there and we only have to find it. and what
if there's no answer to our question? search may end up with no result, but for
retrieval there must be some result, since no result means that this piece of
information can not be retrieved. 



searchers can get answers from browsing. researchers noticed already at
the first years of the www the need to differniate searching from browsing
since "web search aids are variously referred to as catalogs, directories, indexes, search engines,
or web databases...
[but] a search engine should at least allow users to compose their own search
queries rather than simply follow pre-specified search paths or hierarchy as in
the case of... yahoo directory" [1]



there are many synonyms for the term search. a group of  such synonyms includes chase pursuit hunt
and fishing. these are similes directing our attention to the work and hassle
frustration enthusiasm and satisfaction involved in finding needed information.
frustration and satisfaction are very important tests for the relevancy of the
results of a search engine. 



the word question is actually a synonym for the term search.
interestingly the word question comes from the word quest which was used in the
romanic period  to denote adventures of
knights such as the search for the holy grail.



synonyms for question are ask and seek. 
some synonyms for question and answer appear densly in  matthew/7-7: "ask and it will be given
to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you".



a research involves searching again and again, more and more, entering a
query and refining it. it is a long adventure which ends after all the
questions were answered, all possible places were checked, and there are no
stones unturned.



gesenius suggests that chapes, the hebrew word for search, is similar
perhaps to chafar, digged. synonyms for chapes, the hebrew word for search, are
charash (ploughed) and tar (looked for) from which stems tayar which maybe
influenced the english word tourist.

capricorn symbol





following is a demonstration of the power of qtsaver micro content search engine to grab relevant info from multiple sources and present it on one page. http://www. tattoosymbol.      com/zodiac/capricorn. html capricorn | tattoosymbol. com capricorn tattoo symbol       - capricorn (21 december - 19 january) is the       tenth sign of the zodiac and it begins the winter solstice. it is a       symbolic representation of the goat's body and fish’s tail and reflects       the ambivalent nature of those born under the influence of this sign.  in the far east, it is the first sign       of the zodiac.  http://www. elore.      com/astrology/study/capricorn. htm capricorn astrology - earthlore explorations      - lore of astrology . . .  capricorn, whose constellation is known as       capricornus, is one of the oldest of the astrological interpretations. ruled       by saturn, its symbol is the goat. this is       sometimes depicted as a sea borne hybrid or dolphin.  the image is often an animal with the       body of a goat and the tail of a fish.  capricorn sea-goat symbol,       within shell, fifteenth century, french manuscript.  capricorn symbol within       the zodiac, seventeenth century european manuscript.  http://answers.      yahoo. com/question/index?qid=20070304042227aakl75g capricorn sun and      moon rising sign gemini? block       user capricorn the goat - the sign of       consistency capricorn's symbol       is the sea goat, rather than the mountain goat and this represents a sure       footedness but also an ability to be a lot more fluid and flexible than       their reputations suggest. often having a superbly dry sense of humour       capricorns are instinctively knowledgeable about timing and will know       when to make the most of opportunities.  tending to be quite career orientated, they will focus on       making a name for themselves or finding their life's purpose.  http://www. geocities.      com/capricorn_horoscope capricorn horoscope,compatibility, full      description of the personality ambitious,       pragmatic, and goal-oriented, they learn how to get things done.  the mountain goat is an appropriate       astrological symbol for this sign since a       sure-footed, methodical climb to the top is the main goal of capricorn individuals. they aspire to positions of       power and authority, and they admire others who attain such positions.  initiative and willingness to accept       responsibilities are keys to their success.  http://www. skyscript. co.      uk/capricorn. html skyscript: capricorn the goatfish the       fire that animates the capricorn's spirits is gestating and self-contained,       but not to be taken lightly. the romans celebrated the sun's ingress into       capricorn as saturnalia, a festival which       welcomed back the return of the sun's power after the shortest day of the       year. the emphasis was on renewal of strength, fertility, and power that       originates from the depths of being.  as the cardinal earth sign capricorn       portrays the enduring and irrepressible spirit of nature. there is a       productive fecundity inherent in the symbolism of the goat-fish that is       dismissed too lightly if we fail to explore the deeper meanings of this       complex ancient symbol.  they       can suffer through shyness and are seldom at ease displaying affection.  yet capricorn       is a strongly sexual sign - the goat's horn is a symbol       of male virility - and their fixed emotions can cause them to remain       locked in grief and disappointment if they fail to win the object of       their affection. within relationships they have a strong sense of duty       and commitment.  this will be       highly satisfactory to some but others may perceive it as unnecessarily       restrictive and oppressive.  see also:scorpio symbolpisces symbol

widget





following is a demonstration of the power of qtsaver micro content search engine to grab relevant info from multiple sources and present it on one page.     1. http://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/widget widget - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia o gui widget, a component of a graphical user interface with which a user interacts o widget toolkit, a software library containing a collection of gui widgets that collaborate when used in the construction of applications o web widget, a physically-inspired applet on the web o widget engine, a software system for running applets on the web, desktop or mobile phone 2. http://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/web_widget web widget - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia o a web widget is a portable chunk of code that can be installed and executed within any separate html-based web page by an end user without requiring additional compilation. they are derived from the idea of code reuse. other terms used to describe web widgets include: gadget, badge, module, capsule, snippet, mini and flake. o a widget is anything that can be embedded within a page of html, i. e. a web page. a widget adds some content to that page that is not static. generally widgets are third party originated, though they can be home made. widgets are also known as modules, snippets, and plug-ins. o the first widely syndicated web widget, trivia blitz, was introduced in 1997. it was a java game applet offered by uproar.com embedded on 15,200 websites as of december 31, 1998 and 36,100 websites as of december 31, 1999. it spread virally through an "add this game to your website" button. 3. http://widget. dilbert. com the official dilbert daily comic strip widget: the official dilbert . . . o grab your very own dilbert widget for your facebook, myspace, igoogle page or any other place you may be feeling a void and let the icon of office workers make each day a little more brilliant and carefree. o even the boss will appreciate the daily joy it will bring. just choose the size widget you need and in the time it would take you to grab that 10th cup of coffee you can be sharing dilbert with all your fellow cubies! 4. http://widgets. yahoo. com yahoo! widgets: useful, fun, beautiful little apps for mac and windows o this is a highly addictive puzzle. to learn more about the puzzle, install the widget, right-click on it and select "help. . . ". o this widget will countdown the number of days, hours, minutes, seconds until the start of the 2008 olympics in beijing. o this widget gives you information on indices, stocks and funds. its resizable window can also show charts and news for the items you're tracking. 5. http://code. google. com/webtoolkit/documentation/com. google. gwt. doc. developerguide. userinterface. html building user interfaces - google web toolkit - google code o while it is possible to manipulate the browser's dom directly using the dom interface, it is far easier to use classes from the widget hierarchy. you should rarely, if ever, need to access the dom directly. using widgets makes it much easier to quickly build interfaces that will work correctly on all browsers. 6. http://widgets. opera. com opera widgets o widget to search and display webcams all over the world. o advanced painting widget with many tools: pencils, charcoal, paint brushes, calligraphy pen and much more - draw, paint, paste photos, have fun! o this little widget allows you to keep an eye on things that need to be done. o a customizable calendar widget with events and reminders. o opera has released more tools and documentation for widget developers. 7. http://automattic. com/code/widgets wordpress widgets « automattic o widgets have come to wordpress! by installing the widgets plugin by automattic and using a widget-ready theme, you can bring the popular customization feature from wordpress.com to your very own, hosted wordpress installation. 8. http://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/dashboard_(software) dashboard (software) - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia o when dashboard is activated, the user's desktop is dimmed and widgets appear in the foreground. like application windows, they can be moved around, rearranged, deleted, and recreated (so that more than one of the same widget is open at the same time, possibly with different settings). new widgets can be opened, via an icon bar on the bottom of the layer, by dragging a widget icon out into the layer. after loading, the widget is ready for use. o when a dashboard widget is built, it usually consists of six files: o the widget's html file, which is the actual file that will be displayed in the dashboard layer o the widget's css file, which is used for styling the widget (but is called on from the html file) o the widget's javascript file, although it may be implemented directly within the html file if the developer desires o the widget's property list (called “info. plist”), which is what dashboard uses to load the widget’s properties (i. e. : name, version, html file, etc. ) o the background image of the widget, in png format o once all of these files are in the root of a directory, it is given a name and the extension ". wdgt", and then it can be opened up in dashboard as a widget. more complex widgets may also include a cocoa widget plugin (for platform-specific functionality), one or more javascript files (for text scrolling, preferences, etc. ) or multiple images (for personalized select menus or buttons). o dashboard widgets, like web pages, are capable of many different things, often to perform tasks that would be tedious or complicated for the user to access manually. one example is the google search widget, which simply opens up the user's browser and performs a google search. other widgets, like wikipedia, grab the contents of webpages and display them within dashboard. some widgets can also serve as games, using adobe flash (or another multimedia authoring program) to create games just as if they were in a browser.
