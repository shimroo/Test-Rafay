the hagerstown town & country almanack

t
he hagerstown town and country almanack, first published in 1797, is the second oldest almanac in the united states. it began in a modest print shop on south potomac street in hagerstown, maryland and was the creation of colonial printer, john gruber and his partner and son-in-law daniel may. gruber is considered by many to be one of hagerstown's "favorite sons" right along with jonathan hager, the town's founder and namesake. gruber's almanac has been published continuously for 227 years and is the only almanac in the united states that is still published by direct descendants of its founder!
throughout its long history, the almanack has been recognized countless times for its contributions to the development of early american agrarian society (see maryland traditions' 2012 alta award for tradition),  as well as for making a significant cntibution to our national pride (see hagerstown celebrates star spangled banner's 200th annivrersary!). gruber's hagerstown town and country almanack company has been recognized by wikipedia as the 53rd oldest company in the united  states (the full list) and 1493rd oldest in the world (the full list).
