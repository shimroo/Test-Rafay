unknitting



    knitting and reknitting and unknitting and making a general knitting nuisance in an attempt to make one darn hat - while the kids swim. i made one whole hat but it was too big but too short and too bunchy- not at all like the   pattern. so i half ripped it and was trying to modify the crown before giving up because it was still too large around. ripped completely. recast on with smaller needles and smallest cast on numbers and after the whole twisted rubbing was done, it's now too   small. ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ so i'm putting this crown on waste yarn to maybe finish for my son while i cast on again. should i use smaller needles and medium cast on number or called for needles and smallest cast on or smaller needles and largest cast on ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”?   ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¥´

inky



    i wasn't sure i liked the contrast border color i picked for my inky shawl by @sosuknits susanne sommer when i was blocking it - the color contrast is pretty severe even though the @malabrigoyarn pink i choose was in both skeins   of @hedgehogfibres i had for the brioche section. but wearing it scrunched up, it looks great.Â      colors: hedgehog fibres sock in villain and monarch  malabrigo in pop rocks

finished a thing! (sort of)



poor planning: i grabbed a to-go project that only had 20 minutes of knitting left on it for a 30 minute wait time. so now i'm instagramming. but some daughter tube socks are done now! (except for grafting the toe. and weaving in the ends. and logging it in ravelry. and taking a finished product picture. but yeah, it's done ðŸ˜‚)

(almost) yearâ€™s end



inspired by @wrappedinwool post, i made a #makenine2018 collage. all items in my queue. i thought this was a challenging list but i have yarn for all but the last two sweaters. even though i have yarn for the first two garments, i really ðŸ’— the fade cardi and the jelly roll sweater and might attempt them first, if i can afford that much yarn ðŸ˜…to list the patterns starting top left and reading down like a paragraph:https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/antler-cardiganhttps://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/goodalehttps://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/hermiones-everyday-sockshttps://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/bricklesshttps://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/loop-teufelszwirnhttps://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/jelly-rollshttps://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/rheinlusthttps://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/comfort-fade-cardihttps://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/jelly-roll-sweater i did an audit of finished products and made 24 things this year (if i don't finish anything else in the next few days). my fos are steadily declining- 32 in 2016, 34 in 2015, and 40 in 2014. but i think the quality is improving. maybe. definitely more knits and less crochet which is faster.here's the break down of finished items each year:Â 2017Â 1 adult garment (long bolero)1 shawl2 child or baby sweaters3 child or baby vests7 socks (5 ankle, 2 kid)4 hats5 edged baby blankets20163 adult sweaters1 blanket4 shawls5 child or babyÂ sweaters1 cowl2 socks (1 ankle)6 hats8 edged baby blankets2 sets of ornaments20151 blanket4 shawls6 child or baby sweaters1 scarf6 socks (3 ankle, 2 child)4 child leg warmers8 hats3 edged baby blanketsi set baby sandals2014 (40)1 adult sweater5 child sweaters or dresses2 scarves2 socks (1 adult, 1 baby)4 child leg warmers14 hats7 edged baby blankets5 flowers or toysone can tell from the number of edged baby blankets how many friends of mine had children each year ðŸ˜‚

about me




yarn crazy girl


after i listed my interests, it sure seems as if my life must be pretty scattered. i'm not sure how i have time to do any of those things after work, after cleaning, after making dinner, after unpacking boxes (just moved into my first house!)... but then again, i always set aside some time to sit down and watch some law & order, some csi and do a little crochet while i watch...
