on-site pecan shelling plant to reduce transportation emissions

ceasing the use of herbicides completely
reduced use of insecticides to minimum levels
reintroducing infill compost from the trees back into the soil
constantly evolving techniques & education

a purpose rooted in innovation
when we planted our first pecan tree back in 1932, we had no idea how our dream would take root, as we were in relatively untouched territory. through our new dream, we became the first irrigated pecan farm and the first planted pecan farm in the world, but our attention was always focused on delivering the highest quality estate-grown pecans possible. with a lasting commitment built on our core values of quality, integrity, honesty, and continual improvement, we’ve become a respected name in the wholesale pecan world, and a beloved destination for locals and out-of-towners. today, we’re not only proud to supply tasty pecans to budding businesses and leading brands, but also to represent our tight-knit community and provide a scenic view for all to enjoy. 






our values












 



quality
when it comes to bulk pecans, stahmanns is proud to deliver the highest quality available on the market using a combination of cold water conditioning, constant irrigation, on-site shelling, diligent maintenance, and devoted team members.











 



integrity
we stand behind our reputation as one of the most trusted names in the bulk pecan business, with 90 years of trusted service and product for top grocery stores, food and snack brands, bakeries, restaurants, and rebagging companies. 











 



honesty
in the words of sally stahmann-solis, the third-generation owner of our time-tested business, “we do what we say we’re going to do.” year in and year out, we deliver the highest quality of pecans that our customers can depend on. 











 



continual improvement
we wouldn’t be operating 90 years strong if we haven’t learned a thing or two. each year, we’re evolving our irrigation methods, eco-friendly processes, and customer service techniques to deliver a better experience for all.
