 montego 
                          bay, or mo bay as it is popularly known, is deservedly 
                          one of the most famous tourist destinations in the world. 
                          over the years it has attracted the rich and the famous 
                          and has been the haunt of royalty.
















ocho 
                          rios, or "ochee" as it is known locally, is the second 
                          major tourist town on the north coast with a wide range 
                          of accomodation, excellent beaches, airstrip and modern 
                          cruise facilities. each year it attracts more than 700,000 
                          tourists.
















negril 
                          was 'discovered' by the hippies who set up a colony 
                          in the 1960s. this town has a laid back attitude, which 
                          is complemented by some of the world's most beautiful 
                          beaches. its waters offer world-class diving and a wealth 
                          of watersports.
















mandeville 
                          is the chief town of manchester parish, jamaica's mountain 
                          resort, the island's largest hill town and the fifth 
                          largest urban centre. only 64 miles away from kingston, 
                          mandeville has a charm - and a climate - all of its 
                          own, as if it has been sheltered against all developments 
                          in the capital.
















kingston 
                          is the capital and the commercial, administrative and 
                          cultural heart of the island. it is the largest english 
                          speaking city in the caribbean, has the seventh largest 
                          natural harbour in the world, and lies on a wide plain 
                          with the sea to the south and the st. andrew mountain 
                          as it backdrop to the north.














 
                          port antonio is on the the island's northcoast and is 
                          a charming blend of old and new. it was jamaica's first 
                          tourist resort, and is a favourite resort for writers 
                          and artists. robin moore is said to have written the 
                          'french connection' while sitting under a mango tree 
                          in his yard. 









on 
                        the quiet side of jamaica, st. elizabeth boasts an incredibly 
                        diverse terrain. there are deserted beaches all along 
                        the southern coastline with picturesque fishing villages 
                        and small sandy coves hidden among the rocks.
