willow creek company candles?


willow creek candles don't give off the black soot and fumes that paraffin candles do. paraffin is a petroleum by-product. no more nasty black jars and soot on you walls and ceilings.

non-allergenic for those who have experienced allergenic reactions to petroleum based paraffin candles - now you can enjoy that wonderful soothing relaxing candle lit evening without difficulty!

willow creek candles burn more slowly and longer, on average 30% longer than most quality paraffin candles.

soy wax burns cooler, which allows us to use a natural cotton wick instead of potentially dangerous metal-based wicks. it also means no burns from hot wax.  the liquid wax can actually be touched!

willow creek candles have a rich wonderfully strong fragrance when burned and with just the lid off!

soybeans are a renewable resource & are biodegradable. because this wax is water soluble, container clean up is easy!

our candles are carefully tested before being sold. our special 100% soybean wax candle process produces far superior fragrances and scents than our competitors, especially those who produce paraffin and competitive soy candles with added paraffin. we test hundreds of samples to find only the very best and strongest.

we strive to use the best quality fragrances and colors in all of our hand-poured candles.
once you try them, you will be hooked!
