featured farm: ayrshires: not just for show, hardy farm, farmington, maine: owned and operated by the hardy family

by tamara scully, nodpa news contributing writer
hardy farm has been proud of their registered ayrshire dairy herd, established in the 1940s. while the ayrshires rule the roost, the herd also has registered holsteins. but the ayrshire genetics are the farm’s “strong point,” henry hardy said, and “we are well known for the genetics now, and we sell quite a bit.” just don’t tell that to the 18 current holsteins, which are “about 20 too many,’ joked his wife, teresa. the holsteins were acquired “due to a 4-h project gone awry.”

cost of production on grass-fed dairy farms in the northeast in 2023

by heather darby, sara ziegler & sarah flack
since 2018 our research team has been collecting and analyzing financial data from 100% grass-fed dairy producers in the northeast with the goal to better understand the cost of producing milk in this production system. with several years of data, we have been able to create a useful benchmark for northeast grass-fed dairy producers. this article will summarize the 2023 dataset and begin to explore management system and production practice impacts on cost of production and profitability.

grass-fed dairy production practices and farmer perceptions results from a survey of grass-fed dairy producers in the us

by heather darby and sara zeigler, university of vermont
over the last decade, organic grass-fed dairy production has grown rapidly in the us. since 2016, we estimate that the number of grass-fed organic dairy farmers in the us has expanded by over 400% and, for the first time since 2018, new markets for both organic and organic grass-fed milk are now open. in 2019, the first national survey of grass-fed dairy producers provided an initial overview of farm demographics, production practices, and research and technical assistance needs of this group of producers. while this and other research has produced valuable insights into this unique production system, with more farms looking to enter this market, more in-depth knowledge is required for all aspects of the production system (i.e., soil, forage, herd management, economics, milk quality, etc.).

to all certified producers, dairies and other commodities. we need your opinion on your certifier’s inspection requirements. please help!

we have been hearing from many certified producers that their certifier’s requirements have increased dramatically in 2024, along with the cost. the requirements, from certifier to certifier, have varied in format, content, and detail. we support strengthening organic enforcement and origin of livestock but the implementation can be problematic, with increased burden for small to mid-size operations. wodpa and nodpa are collecting information regarding certification as well as ool & soe implementation. please complete the form or follow the link as soon as possible to help us advocate with policy makers, stakeholders and the nop. to complete the survey online, please click here.

ask the vet: what precautions should i take with my calves when it is cold out?

by dayna locitzer, dvm
last issue we talked about the basics of calf care. i think this is a great follow-up question on the quest to take the best care of our calves, especially as we get into the coldest months of the year. in previous issues i have talked about the thermoneutral zone (tnz) of cows related to heat stress (and how my personal zone is similar to cows). adult cows have a tnz of about 32-70 degrees and are quite cold tolerant. pre-weaned calves have a tnz of 50-77 degrees. once the temperature is below 50 degrees, calves will need to expend extra energy to keep their vital functions working properly. it is important to keep this fact in mind in how you prepare for calf care in the winter months. knowing that calves are less cold tolerant than cows, there are some basic additions to their care.

organic dairy news, january 2025

by ed maltby, nodpa executive director
there is continued movement of producers to different buyers, mostly under grass fed organic certification but also those that do not have the add-on certification. transparency on pay price and market conditions from the milk buyer serves the farmers and the organic dairy market far better than rumors spread from farmer to farmer or by the milk truck drivers. more shared information allows producers to make clear choices for their operation and future security. buyers and producers: please share information with nodpa, a trusted source for independent information over the last 24 years, either by email or on odairy.

the leatherstocking cattle exchange: the inaugural public auction dedicated to the nurturing and advancement of grass-based dairy cow genetics, canastota, ny, friday, november 15, 2024

robert yoder, contributing writer
this article originally appeared in small farmer's journal, sister's oregon, and is reprinted with the author’s permission. due to space constraints, this article has been edited for length. here, in central new york, from the finger lakes to the west, to the hudson on the east, the catskills south, and the adirondacks north, is the land known as leather stocking country--named for the leatherstocking tales, five novels of his frontier hero, natty bumppo, written by james fenimore cooper.
