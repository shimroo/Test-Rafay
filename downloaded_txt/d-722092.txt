father george ratzmann, 
pastor

  greetings from fr. george
 welcome, we hope you find st. william to be a parish in which you can thrive!st. william is part of the diocese of venice, which is a growing diocese, so there is always something new and plenty to do.
our architecture is traditional just like our parish. we strive to be in the middle as there is where most folks are. we are united in our common faith in jesus christ. we revere the past and our traditions, while at the same time are open to new ideas that are inspired by the holy spirit.we welcome you whether you are a visitor, seasonal or with us all year round. we hope you find our parish a place where you can flourish and grow, feel welcomed and be inspired to take part in the building up of jesus christ's ministry!
