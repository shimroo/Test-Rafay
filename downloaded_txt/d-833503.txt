welcome to the department of medicine at alpert medical schoolthe department of medicine at alpert medical school is comprised of eleven distinct divisions. these divisions, working in conjunction with the community doctors who comprise our primary care offerings, provide patients with an outstanding level of care both within the brown affiliated hospitals and throughout several community-based clinical locations. in addition to patient services, several of our divisions offer exceptional programs for residents and fellows within their designated areas of expertise.
the department strives to interact with the community and works to heighten community involvement through several avenues. whether recruiting new employees from across the globe or searching locally for participants in our many clinical trials, we are continually reaching out to the community around us. as a whole our department employees over five hundred faculty members, both full-time and part-time.
