welcome to brake systems inc.
brake systems inc. was founded in 1973 as a warehouse distributor, with a considerable background in curtisswright/williams controls , bendix, and midland. bsi has grown from just a distributor to a full fleged, iso 9001:2015 certified and itar registered manufacturer, remanufacturer and engineer of quality brakes, valves, compressors and much more.
in 1973 bsi began remanufacturing air products including compressors and vacuum boosters. in the the 1990’s bsi began it’s own manufacturing operation. the williams controls air cylinder line was acquired first, and a few years later the blue ox exhaust brake line was added. in order to better serve our customers, bsi began manufacturing idle validation switches, and remote throttle controls as well. in 2007 bsi added air valves to the variety of parts manufactured.
we are continually adding to our product line and make custom products available upon request so please contact us and find out what’s new!
