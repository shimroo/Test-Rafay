welcome!january 16, 2021welcome to the new shoreconferencefootball.com!we have converted thousands of 16mm and 8mm reels of football film, vhs tapes, 8mm tape and mini dv cassettes from the schools in the shore conference, dating as far back as the 1950’s. we have also taken over 1 million game day action photos from all the schools between the 1999 - 2005 seasons.it is our goal to place all this media online…and it is our major goal to place every game from every school in the history of the shore conference online, free for all to view and enjoy, and preserve the rich football history that exists in this conference.every year, games recorded on video tape degrade. 16mm football films get thrown out. 8mm cassettes get filled with mold and break, rendering them useless.we have decided to step in and stop this process - to digitize and archive every last bit of video that exists, and to preserve the memories and moments from the past.but we need you help.we are asking individuals and businesses to sponsor one or more games.once a game is sponsored, it will be preserved forever in file format. it will be placed online for all to view. the person(s) sponsoring the game gets the game file so they can have it and share it with anyone they like. the school also gets a copy, so that they can start building out their digital historical portfolio - and best of all, it is not lost to history like so many other games have been.



as of january 16, 2021, we have confirmed and listed over 1500 games, and have thousands more in our possession to add to the list. we will continue to add these games to the master list on a regular basis, and will continue to add games to the pages on this website as well. if you want to be notified when that happens, subscribe to our email list at the bottom of the page and we will keep you informed… and please be aware that this website is a work in progress, so please be patient!to sponsor a gamethe one time cost to sponsor a game that is on video tape (vhs, mini dv, 8mm cassette) is $25the one time cost to sponsor a game on film (16mm or 8mm) is $100.95% of the time, games after 1990 are on video tape and games before 1990 are on film.if you sponsor a game and there are multiple versions (sideline view/end zone view/tv game) you get all versions of them.if you sponsor a game and there is only one half of it (a missing reel), if the other half is found, we convert that as well at no charge.(we all know players that “borrowed” reels of film back in the day… this will entice them to dig them out and get it converted!)the current master list of game films is below. take a look to see if we have your game. if we don’t, stay tuned because one day we will - if it exists. and if you have game films at home you want converted, let us know and you will be watching them in only a few days.if you are interested in sponsoring a game on this list, or have existing game films to convert, reach out to me at(908) 461-5249 or email at: recruitingtape@gmail.com - patrick toland



we have very specialized equipment to convert 16mm film to digital format. we digitize the image, frame by frame, right to a hard drive and it is flicker free and crystal clear. we add color, brightness and contrast filters to the final image, so it is actually better than the original. below are two examples of old 16mm film digitized and processed:
