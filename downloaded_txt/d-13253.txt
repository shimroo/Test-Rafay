pistachio milk mousse

pistachios bring a delicate and unique flavor to many dishes, and if you're as big a fan as we are, then this light and creamy mousse is definitely going to be your next dessert sensation. not too sweet but full of flavor, serve it with shaved white chocolate and raspberries for a pop of added flavor and freshness.
