sun damage in winter





many of us in europe now that we are heading towards winter will forget about sun damage to our skin until next summer. however, don't forget to use your sun screen when you go up into the mountains for skiing this season. the combination of bright winter sun, high altitude and reflections off all that white snow can threaten your skin. so stay safe when you ski.

japanese beauty secrets





japanese women are famous for their beauty and in the way that they age gracefully. modern science is now analysing the factors that contribute to this. generally, the japanese do not seek sun tans in the way that we do in the west. whilst we know we need to protect our skins from the sun many still want to acquire a tan. but it is hard to avoid the long term damage caused by the sun which can accelerate the development of wrinkles. the pale, white face of the geisha still influences japanese ideas of beauty.other factors being examined are diet. it is generally accepted that the japanese diet is healthier than the modern western diet with its high quantities of fat and sugar. green tea with its anti oxidant properties is thought to play a part.to lose your wrinkles using japanese wisdom  < click here >

what skin tells us





we often form our opinions of someone who we have never met by the few cells that we can see. not by viewing their living cells but by the outer layer of dead cells we can see. even though these cells are dead they are able to communicate so much.in an instant, we make multiple decisions about a person we have just seen for the first time. we decide how old they look and how healthy they look. we form an opinion as to whether they are attractive, friendly, angry, happy or sad. sometimes people decide that they have met the person they want to spend the rest of their life with by falling in love at first sight.
