â€¦you say â€œuse the foooorceâ€ in completely serious situations.
â€¦you tell people your hunk-of-junk car can make the kessel run in less than 12 parsecs.
â€¦you donâ€™t care that a parsec is not a measurement of time.

 we are not the most updated star wars site on the net. we are not the cnn of star wars news. we do not even try to be. we do not spend our time telling other people how much we hate other fan sites. 
we are nice people. we love star wars. what we do here is to bring you a complete and fun star wars experience. look around. if this site helps you stay in touch with why you fell in love with star wars in the first place, we will have succeeded. if we have, let us know. 
when will star wars stop being about the latest prequel news?
