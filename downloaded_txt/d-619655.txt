welcome to city of edgeley
                        city of edgeley… a great place to live!
						
in the city of edgeley, we are defined less by boundaries on a map than by the sense of shared values our residents hold dear. small town values, guided growth, preservation of historical, cultural, and natural heritage are just a few of the core principles that makes city of edgeley a wonderful place to call home.





"where we make it happen"
