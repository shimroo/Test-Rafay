mcdowell county coal 
	and rail 
	by jay chatman 
book description: coal was discovered in mcdowell county, located in 
	the billion dollar coalfield of southern west virginia, in 1748, but it was 
	not explored or mined until the early 1800s. mill creek coal & coke company 
	shipped the first railroad car of coal in march 1883 via the norfolk & 
	western railway. by the early 1900s, hundreds of mining companies dotted the 
	countyâs landscape. the coal from mcdowell county fueled the nationâs home 
	heating and steelmaking businesses and both world wars. as the coal industry 
	developed, the local population grew; by 1950, the county had grown from a 
	few hundred people to more than 100,000. the postcard images in this book 
	show early coal mining and how it progressed throughout the years. 
author bio: jay chatman, a lifelong resident of mcdowell county, was 
	born at home in a coal company house owned by the lake superior coal company 
	in superior, west virginia. he is the current mcdowell county historical 
	society president, kimball rotary club president, and a us navy veteran. 
	this book features a portion of chatmanâs 40-year collection of coal and 
	railroad artifacts.
order from: 

	arcadia publishing,
	
	amazon or
	
	bn. 

	note: coalwood references on pages 43 and 74
	olga references on pages 77, 78 and 104
	caretta references on page 76
 
 


	this is the west virginia 150th-anniversary-of-statehood stamp.   the 
	photo was taken by roger spencer, a lifelong west virginia native, in 
	october 2008.  it shows a hazy sunrise scene of mountains in pocahontas 
	county.  (click photo to enlarge.) 
 
 


space quilt
	did you know that one of the most famous quilts in the world contains a 
	"rocket boys" block?  it does!  the space quilt by sue nickels and 
	pat holly is part of the permanent collection of the national quilt museum 
	in paducah, kentucky.  please click here

project icarus
you might enjoy the story of the mit students who mounted a camera in an ice 
chest, attached it to a weather balloon, and launched the entire thing into near 
space.  the entire cost of the project was under us$150.00, and the balloon 
made it to an altitude of 93,000 feet [28,346 meters] before it popped.  
the balloon, ice chest and camera made it safely back to earth, and the mit 
students now have some amazing photos (like the one above)!

a flaming rock!
      this is a very interesting dvd produced by some folks in mcdowell county.  
	  (we purchased a copy at the 2007 october sky festival.)  the dvd is full 
	  of vintage photos and motion pictures from the area.  we particularly 
	  enjoyed one of the bonus features that showed the different kinds of 
	  mining equipment joy manufactures.

this site's webmasters are certainly not experts on coalwood.  we just 
thought that coalwood needed a web site where people around the country and the 
world can see coalwood and share their own thoughts.
we welcome all the fans of coalwood, west virginia, to
share 
photographs, stories and memories with us.  not only does this include 
coalwood itself, it also includes photos, stories and memories of the filming of
october sky in east tennessee.
coalwood has made a positive difference in all of our lives.  we hope, 
with your contributions, this web site will be able to capture some of these 
feelings.

coalwood forever
"i have been amazed at the people from around the world that have been 
	  touched by coalwood and homer's books. i see people come to coalwood, and 
	  what we took for granted, the people who visit just can't get enough.  
	  and all the attention that has come from the books and movie only prove 
	  that coalwood was, and is, a special place with special people. some day, 
	  coalwood will be no more than a few houses with a new generation of 
	  people, but i believe that the coalwood way of life -- what it was and 
	  what it is -- will be passed on as long as people like yourselves and 
	  myself put the web sites together and keep the history alive for future 
	  generations. like homer and the people of coalwood say coalwood 
	  forever."
