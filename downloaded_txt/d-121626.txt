fanduel dfs
fanduel has to be included in any list of the best daily fantasy sports websites. they are uniquely known for their guaranteed prize pool games where dfs players can compete for tens of thousands of dollars within each league. one of our favorite features is that of the head-to-head option, where you can take on friends or strangers in a 1v1 match-up. between the excellent bonus offer and their recent move into online sports betting adds another string to their bow, this operator is a complete package.

there was a big change in the daily fantasy landscape on the day yahoo! launched their dfs service. the operator would change how we played the dfs game, launching their head-to-head contests with an innovative side bets system. a great aspect of yahoo! sports fantasy is the guaranteed prize pools. plus there’s 50/50s, and head-to-head options which are a lot of fun.

prizepicks
the prizepicks app needs to be mentioned in any conversation about the top daily fantasy sports apps. it must be said that prizepicks is definitely not your typical dfs provider. the focus of the competitions found on the app are based upon predicting whether an offered player’s score will go over or under. basically, players are not competing against other players, rather betting against the house. this does sound a lot like sports betting rather than fantasy sports. but we can assure you that prizepicks falls into the dfs category.

jock mkt
the jock mkt platform merged daily fantasy sports with stock exchanges. contestants wouldn’t build lineups based on filling certain positions. instead, contestants buy shares in players which they can later sell. these are to be bought during an initial public offering (ipo), and depending on where players rank, shareholders can earn payouts on their picks. it should be noted that jock mkt was taken over by splash sports.

sneak-peak review of bethard.
overview of the current daily fantasy sports u.s. landscape
the daily fantasy sports industry in the united states isn’t entirely straightforward or linear. each state is responsible for their own legislation, making it difficult for those wanting clarity of whether or not they can sign up and play. we also recommend you check out this expert guide to the best daily fantasy sites found here for futher details.
the most important thing to note is that dfs is not considered gambling. any product that is chance-based is deemed as gambling. dfs is considered to be a game of skill. although fantasy sports is not considered as gambling, it remains illegal in a handful of states.
states where fantasy sports is illegal

hawaii

idaho

louisiana

montana

nevada

washington


certain states are lagging behind due to certain gambling laws. the professional and amateur sports protection act of 1992, known as the bradley act, prohibited sports betting nationwide, excluding the state of nevada as well as state-run sports lotteries. had dfs been classified as a form of gambling, it’s likely that it would have initially been flagged by this legislation. 
however, the state of new jersey officially challenged the bradley act in 2009 and was overturned and determined unconstitutional in 2018. meanwhile, when the uniform internet gambling enforcement act was introduced in 2006, it was assumed that dfs might suffer along with the rest of the online gambling sector. although luckily this was not the case.
how to choose the best dfs app
game modes and contests
this might be a an obvious point, but many dfs apps provide limited options for players when it comes to daily fantasy contests. if you’re serious about your dfs, you’ll want a platform that can keep you on your toes with unique competitions throughout the year. 
available sports
what raises the bar for us is the sports selection. basically, there should be no down-periods when it comes to playing daily fantasy sports throughout the year. the good news is that most platforms are dedicated to bringing contests from popular and niche sports. even esports are becoming well represented. 
app experience
not every app is created equal, and this is especially true when it comes to the daily fantasy sports providers. simply put, you’ll want an app that can function when the contest are at their most intense. our reviews all cover the user experience when it comes to playing on the mobile versions of each platform. 
security and privacy
this almost goes without saying, but for a platform to be considered for our rankings they neeed to take security seriously. our top-pick always adhere to strict security standards. high digital security is a non-negotiable. 
final verdict
from our latest play tests, we currently consider ownersbox to be the best choice available in the u.s. market at this point in time. it scores highly for reliability and unique contest modes. though it should be noted that every dfs app on this page has earned its spot, with each offering a unique product.
