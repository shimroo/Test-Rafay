davis bike club annual events













join our group rides

photo credit – terry nathan

we have regular rides nearly every day of the week. often we have a faster / farther ride and a slower shorter route that regroup at various points. most rides include a social / coffee stop. see our ride calendar for more information on each ride. non-members are welcome to ride with dbc for one ride (per our general club insurance contract.) after that we ask that you join the davis bike club to continue to ride with the club. and of course, all participants are required to ride legally and safely, and helmets are required. anyone taking part in a dbc ride releases dbc from any liability. by riding on a dbc group ride, you acknowledge that you have read and understand this
