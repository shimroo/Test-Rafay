the indisc tournament series™ is four full days of open competitive pinball play welcoming players of all ages and skill levels. indisc™ hosts a total of 7 tournaments over the course of the 4 day event including the open ifpa world championship™—one of the largest pinball tournaments in the world and an ifpa recognized major. in addition, there are divisions for classics, high stakes, women’s, youth, and seniors. we also host the classics target match play championship, currently the only tournament of it’s kind.
the open ifpa world championship™ along with classics championship, women’s championship, and youth are open to all eligible players at indisc with a valid event pass. the high stakes and classics target match play championship tournaments require a separate entry fee in addition to an event pass.
