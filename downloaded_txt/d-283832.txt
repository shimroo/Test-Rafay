freebsd handbook
the freebsd newcomer will find that the first section of this book guides the user through the freebsd installation process and gently introduces the concepts and conventions that underpin unix. working through this section requires little more than the desire to explore, and the ability to take on board new concepts as they are introduced. once you have traveled this far, the second, far larger, section of the handbook is a comprehensive reference to all manner of topics of interest to freebsd system administrators. some of these chapters may recommend that you do some prior reading, and this is noted in the synopsis at the beginning of each chapter.
creating xpcom components
creating xpcom components is about gecko and about creating xpcom components for gecko-based applications. the book is principally a long tutorial that describes the steps you take to make your c++ code into a component that can be used in gecko, but it also discusses all of the tools, techniques, and technologies that make up xpcom.
the xpcom components book is arranged so that you can follow along and create your own components or learn about different xpcom topics individually.as in a reference work.
      for example, the introduction includes a discussion of components and what they are.
the first chapter-in which you compile the basic code and register it with mozilla-prompts a discussion of the relationship between components and modules, of xpcom interfaces, and of the registration process in general. xpcom abreviation stands for the cross platform component object model. ref: c++  programming, online c++ book
web-teaching, 2nd edition
web courses and web-based course supplements have popped up all over the world. no central force has yet emerged which dominates the field. indeed, nearly every college, from the large to the small, has become a player. tremendous, broad-based web-delivery activity has characterized the last few years of the 20th century. elementary students publish web-sites. teachers use web-pages to communicate with parents. web-commerce has flourished. the wave of web-commerce has paled that of web-teaching. the infrastructure that is emerging to support web-commerce ultimately will permit piggybacking of web-teaching. we can expect fast web access to be available in students' homes.
xforms - xml powered web forms
from the users perspective, xforms revolutionizes the way business critical information is collected and published on the web. a key consequence of this evolution is that information technologists can continue to model business data using abstract structures that are amenable to machine processing; xforms binds a user-friendly web browser interface to such abstract xml models, thereby empowering the end-user to edit and update these abstract structures. in this sense, xforms enables a standard web browser to associate editable views to the underlying xml models. this ability to view and edit xml documents from within a standard web browser is likely to prove a key empowering technology.
structure and interpretation of computer programs
the material in this book has been the basis of mit's entry-level computer science subject since 1980.




we had been teaching this material for four years when the first edition was published, and twelve more years have elapsed until the appearance of this second edition.
we are pleased that our work has been widely adopted and incorporated into other texts. we have seen our students take the ideas and programs in this book and build them in as the core of new computer systems and languages. 
        in literal realization of an ancient talmudic pun, our students have become our builders.
we are lucky to have such capable students and such accomplished builders.

advanced programming language design
this book stems in part from courses taught at the university of kentucky and at the university of wisconsinmadison on programming language design. there are many good books that deal with the subject at an undergraduate level, but there are few that are suitable for a one-semester graduate level course. this book is my attempt to fill that gap. the goal of this course, and hence of this book, is to expose first-year graduate students to a wide range of programming language paradigms and issues, so that they can understand the literature on programming languages.

an introduction to programming in emacs lisp- most of the gnu emacs integrated environment is written in the programming language called emacs lisp. the code written in this programming language is the software--the sets of instructions--that tell the computer what to do when you give it commands. emacs is designed so that you can write new code in emacs lisp and easily install it as an extension to the editor. gnu emacs is sometimes called an "extensible editor", but it does much more than provide editing capabilities. it is better to refer to emacs as an "extensible computing environment". however, that phrase is quite a mouthful. it is easier to refer to emacs simply as an editor.


open source development with cvs
if you've never used cvs (or any version control system) before, it's easy to get tripped up by some of its underlying assumptions. what seems to cause the most initial confusion about cvs is that it is used

for two apparently unrelated purposes: record keeping and collaboration. it turns out, however, that these two functions are closely connected. record keeping became necessary because people wanted to compare a

program's current state with how it was at some point in the past. for example, in the normal course of implementing a new feature, a developer may bring the program into a thoroughly broken state, where

it will probably remain until the feature is mostly finished. unfortunately, this is just the time when someone usually calls to report a bug in the last publicly released version. to debug the

problem (which may also exist in the current version of the sources), the program has to be brought back to a useable state.
