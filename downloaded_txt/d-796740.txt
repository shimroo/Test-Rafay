	 salsa picante
	 
    


ingredients:2 c tomatoes, canned, with juice1 sm onion2 chile serrano1 pn sugarsalt, to tasteinstructions:now are we talking about the mild, old el paso-type green chiles (which are a mild sort of chile poblano), or are we talking about jalapenos and serranos? it makes a buncha difference. salsa picante (which is what we mean when we talk about "salsa" down here) is made with one or both of the last two. acting on the presumption that it's salsa picante that you mean, here's a recipe. one serrano equals two jalapenos. if you use jalapenos, removing the veins from the inside will make it less hot.

	 green poblano rice
	 
    


1 2/3 cups chicken broth or water2 fresh poblano chiles, stems and seeds removed, and roughly chopped12 sprigs cilantro, plus extra for garnishsalt, about 1/2 teaspoon if using salted broth, 1 teaspoon if using unsalted or water1 tablespoon vegetable or olive oil1 cup rice, preferably medium grain1 small white onion, cut into 1/4-inch dice5 garlic cloves, peeled and finely choppedthe flavoring: in a 2-quart saucepan, combine the broth and chiles, bring to a boil, then partially cover and simmer gently over medium to medium-low heat for about 10 minutes, until the chiles are very soft. pour the chile mixture into a food processor, add the cilantro (stems and all), and process to a smooth puree. press through a medium-mesh strainer into a bowl and stir in the salt.the rice: wipe the pan clean, add the oil and heat over medium. add the rice and onion, and cook, stirring regularly, until the rice is chalky looking and the onion is soft, about 5 minutes. stir in the garlic and cook a minute longer.add the warm (or reheated) chile liquid to the hot rice pan, stir once, scrape down any rice kernels clinging to the side of the pan, cover, and cook over medium-low heat for 15 minutes. uncover and check a grain of rice: it should be nearly cooked through. if the rice is just about ready, turn off the heat, re-cover and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes longer to complete the cooking. if the rice seems far from done, continue cooking for 5 minutes or so, retest, then turn off the heat and let stand a few minutes longer. fluff with a fork, scoop into a warm serving dish, decorate with cilantro sprigs and it's ready to serve.advance preparation: the rice can be made several days ahead; turn out the fluffed rice onto a baking sheet to cool, transfer to a storage container, then cover and refrigerate. reheat the rice in a steamer basket set over boiling water.variations and improvisations: an obvious variation is to use 3 or 4 long green (anaheim) chiles, or to mix poblanos and long greens with hotter chiles like jalapeño, manzano or habanero. grilled corn cut from 1 cob or 1 large grilled zucchini (cubed) are tasty vegetable add-ins. about 1 cup coarsely shredded roast (or barbecued) pork or smoked salmon, mixed in toward the end of cooking, will make green rice a full meal.makes 4 servings.

	 poblano pepper chilequiles
	 
    


preparation time: 15 minutesmakes 4 servingscooking time: 10 minutes    * 2 tablespoons olive oil    * 2 slices bacon, chopped    * 6 corn tortillas, cut into triangles    * 1 small yellow onion, coarsely chopped    * 1 poblano pepper, finely chopped    * 1 clove garlic, chopped    * 1 (12-ounce) can stewed tomatoes, drained and cut up; or 2 very ripe fresh tomatoes, chopped    * 1/2 teaspoon salt    * 4 eggs    * 1 cup grated monterey jack or mild longhorn cheese    * sour cream, for garnish   1.      preheat a heavy skillet, preferably cast-iron, on medium-high for 1 minute. add the olive oil and bacon. cook just until the bacon is limp. remove it from the oil with a slotted spoon. add the tortilla triangles and cook for 1 to 2 minutes per side. remove the tortillas and drain all but 1 tablespoon of the grease from the pan. add the onion and poblano pepper to the pan and cook for 3 minutes. add the garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes more. over the vegetables in the pan, layer the corn tortillas, then the bacon bits, the tomatoes, then the 4 eggs broken individually, like fried eggs. season with the salt. reduce heat and cook, covered, for 2 to 3 more minutes. cover with the cheese and let stand until the cheese has melted. serve with a dollop of sour cream, taking care to give each person an egg.    all the trimmings    arrange the avocado, grapefruit, and pomegranate seeds on a platter in a pinwheel design. this not only looks good, but it allows people to take what they want. we love the drama of bringing the chilequiles to the table in the black skillet. serve the refried beans in a nice bowl. we usually open a can of refried beans and microwave them in the serving bowl. to spruce them up, add 1/4 cup of salsa. we love pace mild pan dulce, or mexican bread pastries, which are usually beautifully colored, unworldly pinks, blues, and yellows, can be purchased at any mexican grocery store. warm and serve them on a big platter. we like to cut them in half so that people can taste the pink ones and the blue ones!    this hot and spicy meal is best complemented by a good mexican beer

	 roasted poblano guacamole
	 
    


roasted poblano guacamole with garlic and parsley 2 medium (about 6 ounces total) fresh poblano chiles 6 ounces (1 medium round or 2 plum) ripe tomatoes 2 garlic cloves, unpeeled 3 tablespoons chopped flatleaf parsley 3 medium-large ripe avocados salt to taste 1 to 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 2 tablespoons finely crumbled mexican queso anejo, or other dry grating cheese like romano or parmesan radish slices for garnish preheat the broiler. place the poblanos, tomatoes and garlic on a baking sheet. set the sheet 4 inches below a very hot broiler. roast, turning every couple of minutes, until the chiles and tomatoes are soft, blistered and blackened in spots and the garlic is soft, 12 to 13 minutes total. place the chiles in a bowl, cover them with a towel, and let them stand 5 minutes, then wipe off the blackened skin. pull or cut out the stems, seed pods and seeds; rinse quickly to remove any stray seeds and bits of char. when the tomatoes are cool, peel off and discard their skins. slip the papery skins off the garlic. in a mortar or with a food processor, make a coarse puree of the roasted garlic and poblanos (with both mortar and processor, it's best to start with the garlic, then add the poblanos); place the puree in a large bowl. chop the roasted tomatoes (for this recipe it's best not to use any of the juice from the baking sheet) and add to the poblano mixture along with the parsley. cut the avocados in half lengthwise around the pit, twist the halves apart, and remove the pits. scoop out the flesh into the bowl with the flavorings. using a potato masher or the back of a large spoon, coarsely mash everything together. taste and season with salt, usually a scant teaspoon, then add enough lime juice to enliven all the flavors. cover the mixture with plastic wrap, placing it directly on the surface, and refrigerate until you're ready to eat. to serve, scoop the guacamole into a decorative bowl or mexican mortar, sprinkle with the queso anejo and stud it with radish slices. cook's note: the roasted poblanos, tomatoes and garlic can be made a day or so in advance, but don't puree them until you are ready to make guacamole. the guacamole is best finished about 30 minutes before you need it, so the flavors can mingle. it will keep several hours tightly covered in the refrigerator; add the cheese and radish slices at the last moment. from rick bayless, chef and owner of topolobambo and frontera grill, chicago
