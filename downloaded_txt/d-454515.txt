               welcome to the website of the vaad harabonim of queens                  





the vaad harabonim of queens was founded over fifty years ago by rabbis who shared a common vision. seeking to unite the growing orthodox jewish community under the banner of mitzvah observance, they envisioned an organization that would pool their efforts to create and maintain the institutions of a torah community.
