coaching for startup founders and executives 














what is coaching?



coaching is a unique, dedicated opportunity to step outside of your day-to-day routine to discuss, contemplate, plan, and accomplish what deeply matters to you in order to lead the richest, fullest, healthiest life and business you can imagine. we work together to grow your business or career, and in the process grow yourself.














how can coaching help you?are you starting, growing, running, and/or saving a company? we work with startup founders and execs at any stage, from the early days where you are building your first team, iterating on your product, and finding product-market fit; to growth phase, where you are raising rounds, defining culture, rapidly expanding your team and customers, and dealing with problems of scale; to late-stage and public companies, where you are experiencing being an exec in a public company and navigating the tricky political waters of large organizations. i can also help in times of particular importance or even crisis, so that you show up in the best possible way when it matters the most.are you contemplating an exit?what is your exit strategy? how will you successfully transition from being an individual entrepreneur to an executive inside a larger organization? what will it be like to have a boss? what is the best way to protect, grow, and spend all of your newfound money and time in an intelligent way? will you retire into an idyllic future of semi-retirement and long vacations, or start another company, or some combination of the two? we can help you chart the next chapter(s) in your career and life.is your business partner also your life partner?cofounder relationships can be intense and tricky. so can romantic relationships. mix the two, and you often have a recipe for incredible success, and sometimes massive problems. we help cofounders-in-love navigate the tricky world of power dynamics, responsibility, communication, and work/life boundaries.are you an lgbt founder or exec?though being an lgbt founder has gotten dramatically easier in the recent past, it is still presents its own distinct challenges. we work with lgbt founders and execs to address their unique experiences.are you thinking of starting a company? making the leap from having a boss to being your own boss is a huge, challenging, risky, and rewarding one. there are lots of places for you to get caught up. we help you get clear on goals and help you create accountability as you move forward.
