welcome to gunter family ministries (gfme)
as i have served in christian ministry over several decades, i have used the internet to reach out to serve people, to encourage, offer guidance, etc. this site is an entry point to the many sites that have been developed over the years. some are not as active as others, but all hold great content.
here is a brief summary of each of the sites:

this is currently the flagship site of the ministry. for decades i have become known as “commander bill” because of my service in a ministry entitled awana. through the website and other means, commander bill has become a well respected, and trusted, voice in the awana and children’s ministry communities. the site shares my thoughts regarding children’s ministry with an emphasis on awana.


this site deals specifically with serving in children’s ministry in a small church. the goal is to provide encouragement, resources and support to those serving in children’s ministry in the small church


the site was born when my season of ministry was over in a small church. it is the more pastoral side of ministry.


a website that i encouraged my wife to establish several years ago. it was “re-born” when she facilitated a small group study. it was initiated as a devotional site for women. some of the devotional thoughts are re-posted to encourage others to spend time out with god.

formally known as…

hfc kids is the web site for the children’s ministry in a local church where i serve. for a few years, this site was branded as pb&j kidzone. it was called pb&j because at summer camps i was called “pb” (pastor bill) which led children to think of pb&j. the “j” stands for jesus, pastor bill & jesus because i want to lead children to him. this site contains my current ministry, as well as things to connect the gospel to children, like using lessons from minecraft.
