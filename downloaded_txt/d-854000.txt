your duty to take reasonable care
when applying for hcf life protect insurance we’ll ask you some questions about your health, lifestyle and other factors. when answering these questions, please remember you have a duty to take reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation. a misrepresentation includes a statement that is false, partially false, or which doesn’t fairly reflect the truth. it’s not a misrepresentation if you don’t answer a question or if your answer is obviously incomplete or irrelevant to the question asked. so it’s important that you answer any questions in the application process honestly and correctly, and to the best of your knowledge. the duty applies until we issue your cover and extends to making changes to your policy and reinstatements.
this insurance cover is provided under a consumer insurance contract. your answers to these questions affect the terms and conditions of your cover. if you don’t comply with this duty, we may change the terms of your policy or treat your policy as if it never existed. this may result in your benefit being reduced or denied.
