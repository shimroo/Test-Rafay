american manufacturing
since 1857, klein tools has been manufacturing tools in america, and it’s as important for the klein family to keep that tradition now, as it was more than 150 years ago. you see, klein isn’t just the name of our company; it’s also our family name, so we have to be proud of everything we make.
klein tools continues to invest in u.s. manufacturing and is committed to maintaining its place as the favorite among electricians. klein is the only major tool manufacturer worldwide focused on electrical and utility applications. no other manufacturer of hand tools and related products used in electrical applications makes more items in america than klein tools.

the klein story
since 1857, the company operated by mathias klein and his descendants to the fifth generation, has grown and developed along with the telecommunications and electrical industries where klein pliers first found major usages.
today, klein tools, inc. represents much more than klein pliers. the company's product line has broadened to include virtually every major type of hand tool used in construction, electronics, mining, and general industry in addition to the electrical and telecommunications fields.
