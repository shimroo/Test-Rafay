welcome the blackwood singers to the god and country theater
the blackwoods are known throughout gospel music circles for their pure family harmony, excellent musicianship, and first class entertainment. with an 80 year track record of hits, the blackwoods bring hand-clapping, high energy entertainment to the stage. to quote a recent fan, “the show is american, family, loyalty and excellence all rolled into two hours that will leave you spellbound!”the show is a stroll down memory lane with history and video of the original blackwood brothers and the blackwood singers and the songs that made them a household name. a rousing veteran’s tribute is always a part of the show as is that feeling of family that audience members experience this great performance.
a new addition to the show this year is a younger generation of blackwoods who will be performing throughout the summer months and of course the blackwoods end their performance with a fabulous tribute to our country in their patriotic finale! this high energy show will captivate every audience!









see the blackwood singers live at jerry presley’s god and country theater!
