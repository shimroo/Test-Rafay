the year of the windows tablets





via palmdoc.net


when the ipad first came out, it was the best thing since sliced bread for doctors. now a tablet sized device can be a boon during ward rounds for accessing medical information and in some cases even an emr on a device with a large enough screen yet maintaining portability, being able to fit in a large lab coat pocket, especially if you have one custom made like my elab coat.it’s been almost 5 years since the ipad was first introduced (on april 3, 2010) and while it still is a great device, i find it difficult to do “real work” on it, particularly when it comes to creating content as opposed to consuming content e.g. making slides and full fledged “office type” applications.windows is coming of age to the touch screen era. while windows 8.1 has still a way to go, i believe the recently announced windows 10 looks very promising.but what about the hardware? in recent times we have been seeing a slew of cheap tablets coming out of china. these 8 to 10 inch devices are really affordable, costing less than $250 in many cases. this price point is way below what you would have to pay for a surface pro 3 though admittedly these cheaper tablets have lower end specs. but being cheap does not mean these things can’t do a decent job for every day tasks.my twitter buddy @mikecane has been doing a great job of reviewing the deluge of windows tabletswith various brands like teclast, onda, chuwi etc. there are so many to choose from but the price point is so tempting i succumbed and decided to get a chuwi v89 windows 8.1 tablet. this is an 8.9 inch light weight device (weighing only 370g) yet running full windows 8.1



the tech specs:

 chuwi v89 windows 8.1 tablet
 cpu intel z3735f quad core x86 1.83ghz
 system 7th generration intel graphincs 646mhz
 ram 2gb
 capacity 64gb
 screen 8.9 inch 10-points capacitive touch screen
 resolution1920 x 1200

 extend  card support,up to 32gb
 camera front is 2.0megapixels,rear is 5.0megapixels

 wifi support wifi 802.11b/g/n
 bluetooth built in bluetooth 4.0
 gravitysensor support
 3g gsm:900+1800
 wcdma:900+2100

 audio ogg,aac,m4a,flac,amr etc
 picture jpg, jpeg, gif, bmp, png
 video avi,mkv,mp4,m4v,webm,3gp,mpeg4, etc
 language multiple languages

 microphone built in
 speaker built in
 i/o port 1 x micro usb port
 1 x tf card slot
 1 x sim card slot
 1 x 3.5mm earphone port
 battery 3.7v/6400mah
 weight 369g
 size 233.2*148.2*8mm


my impression after using it for a few days is it’s a decent windows tablet. it is quite well built and has a reasonable battery life – i can get through a whole day’s work without any problem. the retina display is very nice and even though the default font on the chrome browser is rather tiny, you can still make it out. it is hard to tap with one’s finger for the desktop applications so for those it would be better in some cases to use a bluetooth mouse. i paired my bluetooth keyboard with it (made for the ipad 2) and it works fine too.the main drawback is that one has to be careful how many applications are open at the same time since with the limited 2gb ram things can slow down if you are too enthusiastic with multi-tasking. that being said, it generally is sprightly and has fast boot up times should you need to restart.the 64gb emmc is decent (more than the usual 32gb you see with many other models) and if you throw in a 32 gb sd card that should be plenty of storage for most people. a point to note in case you are not aware is that  you cannot install the downloaded windows touch screen apps from the store onto the external sd card but you can install regular windows applications onto the external card.  for additional storage access, the set comes with a micro usb to standard usb host adaptor so you could plugin a thumb drive which the tablet reads without any problem.

things which i plan to do:

1) install duos so that i can have android os running side by side

2) test out windows 10 technical preview 

in conclusion i give the chuwi v89 windows 8.1 tablet two thumbs up. it’s cheap yet a decent performer.2015 will be the year of the windows tablets as microsoft makes a strong come back with windows 10, and the market will be saturated with many windows tablets or convertibles to choose from.

medical #webapp discussion on facebook






if you are interested in medical web app development do join the medwebapp facebook group. it's a group for both coders and users, to exchange ideas on what you'd like to see developed as a medical web app. the emphasis is on mobiles and the web apps should be able to run well on a mobile device.i have been thinking of forming such a discussion group for some time now, but this tweet:


@palmdoc hello there! could u recommend any good medcalc web apps? i'm stuck on wp8 and need medcalc alternatives. thanks!

- bulls96 (@bulls96) october 31, 2013




really prompted me to get going. as a platform, windows phone 8 is somewhat reminiscent of webos. as a challenger to the mighty two mobile oses - android and ios - it lacks the necessary apps which medical professionals might need. web apps can fill the need and the best part is when the web app is sufficiently mature, can be easily compiled into native apps for any platform (android, ios, windows phone, bb etc).

the medwebapp group is an open one so come on over and join us!

icis pocketpacs





press release: global care quest announces icis pocketpacs(via medgadget )icis pocketpacs, the newest member of healthcare software developer global care quest, inc.’s integrated clinical information system (icis) line up, is an advanced viewing application that can take images from virtually any picture archiving and communication systems (pacs) and send it to a handheld device or mobile smartphone via wireless internet or high-speed cellular phone network. the system displays and manipulates chest x-rays, bone x-rays, ct scans, mri scans, and most other medical imaging modalities.icis pocketpacsbeyond simple image display, icis pocketpacs offers a number of advanced viewing functions including zoom, pan, multi-slice scrolling, cine mode, window-level contrast adjustments, and image inversion and rotation. the system will display all pacs images at the maximum screen size and image resolution of which the handheld device is capable. in most situations icis pocketpacs displays diagnostic quality images suitable for assessment and patient triaging.nice to see them use the treo as an example. even with the treo's 320x320 screen, i really don't know how sharp the x-ray images will turn out. still, interesting use of technology but i suspect this will evolve as the hardware gets better and better.

superb palm service





thought i'd digress from the usual medical software news and give credit where it's due. my treo650 gave trouble - the keyboard became unresponsive at several sections. i called up palm asia and without much trouble, got an sro number for an exchange with a refurbished unit (the usual practice). i was expecting a downtime of 72 hours or thereabouts and i switched to my dell axim x50v for synchronizing outlook data between my work and home pcs, and for a phone my backup was my old trusty set68i. needless to say, the dell made a mess of the sync and i ended up with numerous duplicates. luckily i also have mapilab outlook duplicate remover installed and this removed the dupes like grease lightning. anyway the happy story is when i sent my treo650 to the palm drop zone which happened to be fairly near where i work, i got an immediate swop!. so the down-time was really minimal, less than 24 hours. kudos to palm. great service once again, thank you.

in search of more ram for my treo  - palm are you listening?





now that the cdma version of the treo 700p is out, the rest of  us on gsm networks can only look on in envy. now from the news that we hear on the grapevine, palm is to release 4 new treo models this year. 2 have been revealed: the treo700w, and the treo700p (wm and palmos respectively). the speculation is that the next two models will be "hollywood" (possibly a gsm wm powered model without an external antenna) and "lowrider" whatever this may be).i think palm will be making a big mistake if they don't release a palmos gsm treo700p. forget about 3g (there is talk that palmos garnet cannot support 3g). i just need the ram!!  gprs/edge will do!! there are 2 billion gsm users palm. neglect us and you shoot yourself in the foot (again). we don't want wm5 in treos. we want a gsm treo700p with more memory and nvfs issues fixed. period.

rss tutorial and bloglines





bloglines is my favorite rss reader at the moment. it is browser based so you don't have to install a separate app. the best part for pda users is, there is a mobile version which works well with mobile browsers like palm's blazer and opera mini (version 2.04, the current one is quite stable and works very well with the treo 650, especially supporting the treo's navigation dpad).when i mention rss to my colleagues, i usually get blank looks. many people still haven't heard of rss!i have written a couple of simple rss tutorials which might help some on the way:using rss feedsmedical rss feedsin the second link i mention how easy it is to generate journal rss feeds using pubmed's sendto rss facility.here's how:   1. run a search in pubmed limiting the search only to the journal of interest. for instance in the case of blood journal, you would put "blood[jour]" in the search box.   2. choose rss feed from the send to pull-down menu (this is at the bottom of the pubmed page)   3. on the rss feed page you may edit the name of the feed and limit the number of items to be displayed, click create feed. if the number of citations retrieved is greater than your “limit” number you will have the option to link to pubmed to display the entire retrieval.   4. click the xml icon to display the xml and copy and paste the url into the subscribe form in your rss reader.for haemonc folks, here are the rss feeds i have created:bloodblood reviewsbone marrow transplantcurrent op haematologyhaematologicatransfusionthrombosis haemostbr j haemeur j haemacta haematolj clin oncolhere's a screenshot from my treo650 running opera mini and viewing one of the feeds using mobile bloglines:happy feeding!

neuroplasticity stroke recovery system





spotted the northstar stroke recovery system in medgadget. the theory is that "cortical stimulation of the healthy brain tissue adjacent to the “stroke,” in combination with rehabilitation, enhances motor recovery and suggests that cortical stimulation for stroke patients may facilitate neuroplasticity"don't know how true this is, but i was interested to read that the system uses a pda (pocketpc)-- programming system - a handheld computer attached to a programming device which allows communication with the implanted ipg device. this system allows the clinician to turn the device on/off and to set/modify stimulation parameters

david nagel joins epocrates





read from 1src that former palmsource ceo david nagel joins epocrates board. from the epocrates news room:“the enthusiasm of epocrates’ customer base is contagious. at palmsource, i saw the ‘epocrates phenomenon’ firsthand – clinicians purchasing mobile devices primarily to use epocrates’ products. i am honored to be affiliated with a company that develops such valuable and reliable clinical solutions for healthcare professionals,” said nagel.well david, first thing you gotta do at epocrates is to tell them to support that sd card!! my "enthusiasm for epocrates" will jump up many times more if the good folk at epocrates realise the problems we treo650 users face with the paltry memory palm has given us...

dr. o, that's why you need a pda....





just back from a three day scientific meeting. had a chance to meet up with dr. o. from arkansas and in his talk on myeloma, he mentioned the difficulties of dealing with complicated diagnostic criteria and how problematic it was to have to keep looking them up.well later on i found out that he also has a treo650 and obviously, dr. o, you  don't use it to it's maximum potential! this is indeed something i find quite in common with other doctors who use pdas and smartphones. they treat them like little electronic diaries.people, it's like using only 5% of your brain's potential!!anyway, as dr. o had not heard of haemoncrules, i offered to email him a copy - so it's been sent off to you, dr. o. hope you like it!

umass nursing students gain confidence





umass nursing students gain confidence, experience with skyscape medical references for pdas lowell, mass. & marlborough, mass. – april 26, 2006 - umass nursing students at boston and lowell campuses are trading literally thousands of pages of medical reference texts for a state-of-the-art digital solution that puts the information, and more, right into the palms of their hands.umass faculty and librarians observed that nursing students relied on medical reference books, many of which were bulky and heavy and not easily carried into the clinical setting. umass boston systems librarian apurva mehta and umass lowell systems librarian john callahan and assistant professor patrick scollin got together to see if there was a better way to utilize technology to make this information available at the point-of-care.“nursing is a hands-on discipline and learning shouldn’t be restricted to a library. so patrick and i put our heads together with apurva, and set out in search of a way to help the students better access the material,” said john callahan.“our goal,” said patrick scollin, “is to allow students to access information inside and outside of the classroom – as well as in a learning environment like their clinical rotations – where they really need the information on-hand.” while researching the options, the team at umass applied for and received a state grant for $18,000, and so began the pda loan program at the campus library.  once word spread students quickly began signing up to borrow and use pdas while on clinical rotations.now in the second year there are 35 pdas for loan at both umass lowell and boston campus libraries. five pdas are held by professors instructing nursing clinical classes and 30 are available for loan to students at each library.  there are 17 skyscape medical references that were purchased for use on the palm pdas, some of those include: evidence based diagnosisgriffith’s 5-minute clinical consultnurse’s pocket guide: diagnosis, intervention, and rationales. umass chose skyscape medical references for pdas because of the patented smartlink™ technology. with this system - offered only by skyscape - when a topic of interest is selected, the smartlink™ technology searches all other skyscape applications on the pda to cross reference the material and provide instant access to all information on that topic. this enables nursing students and professors to quickly access information on diseases, symptoms, and prescription drugs at the tap of a stylus – which is not physically possible with print text.the benefits of using the pdas are seen by student and registered nurses alike – especially when the students use them while in clinical at the hospital. “we’ve heard of situations where students are on rounds using their pdas and the nurses are so curious that they rush over to borrow the students’ pda to check out the applications,” said john. “it’s really amazing; we never dreamed that we’d see such an overwhelming response.”and the students rave about the features constantly, added patrick, “with easy access to reference material, students are smarter when with patients and able to provide better quality care, plus the reduction of possible errors by utilizing smartlink, the students go on and on.”according to john callahan, “the pdas loaded with skyscape references satisfy a professional goal for the students, similar to a stethoscope or medical book. and they don’t want to give them up, so skyscape instituted a discount program for students who want the references on their own pdas.”with the loan program at the library, and with teachers using the pdas with skyscape references to teach classes, the students’ use of the technology is being reinforced on all fronts.“we couldn’t be happier with the program, it has really become a resource that students expect,” said patrick scollin.  “but most importantly, is that they are becoming confident with the tools that ultimately will enable them to become successful nurse professionals.  we’re looking forward to continuing the program into 2007 and beyond.”

not long more till the rumoured may 15 announcement of the treo700p..but i spotted treo today's blog on another rumour: next treo 650 firmware update coming?the features which excite me the most:- fat32 support (allows use of the new 4gb sd cards)- updated bluetooth support. (new handsfree devices)- pocket tunes will replace realplayer- wifi drivers for palm’s wifi cardi've got an unused palm sd wifi card - unused ever since i moved on to the treo650 from my tungsten t5.i was recently at a gcp course in a beautiful tropical resort (hence the blogging silence the past 5 days).. see pic below taken with my treo650:the hotel had free wifi, wonderful i thought as i had brought along my dell axim x50v. although i neglected to take along the dell charger, i had a charged spare battery. as fate would have it, the wretched ppc crashed while i was on the second battery and sucked all the juice out of it. my treo650 with it's gprs internet connection was used the most as with it i could maintain contact using my email and im. now if it only had wifi too. i hope the rumours of the update are true!
