seafood, steaks & chopsan exceptional dining experience


don’s pomeroy house is a beautifully restored, mid-19th century mansion and architectural gem located just south of cleveland in strongsville, ohio. this classic american grille overlooks town square and is now legendary for serving the freshest seafood, steaks and chops in northeast ohio.

 


the service at don’s pomeroy house is attentive and truly friendly. we curate an approachable, well-rounded wine list, and the pub serves classic cocktails and a deep selection of rare bourbons in a more casual setting.

 


we look forward to seeing you!
