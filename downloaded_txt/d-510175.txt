welcome to sugar tree golf club




built in 1988 by course designer phil lumsden, sugar tree is well known as a shot-maker’s course. tree-lined fairways provide a challenging layout which requires well thought out shots both off the tees and into greens. add in elevation changes and receptive greens and golfers of all abilities will enjoy our scenic layout. four sets of tees boxes, ranging from 5,305 to 6,810 yards, ensures a fair test of golf for all.
