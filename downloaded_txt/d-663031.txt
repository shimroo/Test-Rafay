8:16pm - bunny in my bed
bunny in my beda rabbit crawled into my bed this morning told me that his life was boringeating lettuce chasing micerunning from the farmers wifedigging holesand drinking waterpicking bugs from his hindquarterpacing up and down the garden fencestacking carrots in his residenceteasing the dog talking to molesjumping over logsand sniffing marigoldsthis he saidmade his life a borehe said it made him feel like he was doing choresi stared at the bunny and thought of the words he had spokenand took a moment to drinki found it quite funnyits not often you get woken by a bunny whose asking you to think.in my most serious tone trying to sound super toughmister bunny, your tale has shown me that life can be rough but have no fear, for i have the solution i can give you a resolutioni will pluck off your fur and hold it in tuftsi will glue it to headphones and make me earmuffsi will boil some water and cook you for dinneri will cut you in half and make you look thinneri will dash you with pepper and all kinds of stuffi will tenderize you gently so your meats not to toughi grinned a great grin and inhaled deepthe bunny stared back, not making a peepi could see that his bunny brain was making a leaphis hide i could tell now he wanted to keepi grinned an evil grin and he started to runi said hold on bunny, i'm just making funyou should enjoy your lifeand all the things in itfor nothing could be worse than to end on a turnspitthe bunny, he stopped and turned towards his righthis eyes looked like he had just seen the lightthanks for the insight he said as he loped cross the floori will see my life now as not such a borewith that he was gone, that white herbivorei guess that's what you get for not locking the door.

sonnet #2would you mind if i loved you in this life?to take on the same air as you might doto cause you pleasure and lessen your strifethe heady smoke of kindness like surtoutevenings together and the lightningrain pouring down, crisp wind through the net blowsmy heart has taken a deep breath on wingthe smile i thought long lost to me now glowshow often i dreamed of feeling wantedto kiss your lips and tarry longer theremy arms feel hungry now, for them you fedwhat once was drab, you see now bayaderewould you mind if i loved you in this life?to keep you close to me in my wakerife
