located in the heart of washington, dc for over 240 years, gpc strives to be a sanctuary in the city. we are a presbyterian church (usa) congregation.inspired by the reformed tradition, our church lives at the intersection of centuries of tradition and energetic, current engagement with our city and the world. we gather, young and old, across the political spectrum, and from throughout the dc metro area, in the hope of worshiping god together and being a community of faith and witness.
