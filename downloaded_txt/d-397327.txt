about the club
the pgc was formed in 1982 to protect the interests and improve the status of pygmy goats in great britain. membership offers the opportunity to:

obtain and exchange information via the quarterly magazine “pygmy goat notes", the pgc website and social media forums
register a herd name, enter qualifying goats in the herd book and non-qualifying goats in the pet record;
attend pgc meetings and exhibit at shows.
have a voice in the affairs of the pgc and take an active part in protecting and promoting pygmy goats in the united kingdom. 

 pgc code of conduct
as a member of the pygmy goat club, i agree:

to abide by the rules of the club.
to always behave ethically and present a positive image of the club.
to consider the welfare of my goats and the best interests of the breed above any personal gain or profit.
to be honest in advertising and record keeping/registration of stock.
to familiarize myself with the pygmy goat breed standard and to use it as a guide in breeding and evaluating pygmy goats.
important notice
the new pygmy goat society that has been recently set up has no connection whatsoever with the pygmy goat club which remains, as it always has been since its foundation in 1982, the official body for the breed in great britain. the club manages the only recognized registration system for pedigree pygmy goats.
