i have known alijandra for several years and can testify that she is continually updating us with new channelings and information about these remarkable rays and how to utilize them for our greatest and highest good – as well as that of the planet. her grasp of how the rays and energy works in this dimension, as well as others is phenomenal. ~ teri van horn, crystal author, healer and teacher, texas

"there  are a number of teachers who provide good information about  color  healing, but in my experience, no one comes close to alijandra in the  depth and breadth of her knowledge. studying with her has  opened up for  me a vast range of possibilities in healing, my own and in  my work  with others. her webinars awaken and recharge me, and connect  me with  my deepest faculties.  "as  a teacher, alijandra is a guiding light, who  allows each of her  students to grow and develop according to the best of  his/her  abilities. she is open to requests in exploring any aspect of  color  healing even in the webinar format. you cannot stump her -- her  range  of knowledge and experience is so vast. you want to know? sure,  she'll  do it! because she makes us feel so at ease, we flourish in leaps  and  bounds! studying with allie is a privilege i will always be  grateful  for." ~ rohana wolf; chicago, il












"your tremendous knowledge, patience, intuitive understanding and teaching experience made for a great class with lots of techniques which were easy to understand and do. we had a lot of practice which was really good as it allowed us to integrate better the information that we received. i look forward to practicing what i learned. way to go – thanks a mil for coming so far!" (greer palloo ~ toronto, canada)

"the sessions have greatly accelerated the process of manifesting, including the youthening process. i am having an increasing amount of 5th dimensional experiences with my god-self. phenomenal energies!" (george t. ~ california, usa)










“alijandra is a true color pioneer. she wrote the first book i ever read on color--“healing with the rainbow rays”--and even though i've read many books since, i remain convinced that no one understands the power of color like alijandra! her book should be required reading in all color therapy practitioner curriculum.” (eleyne-mari, certified color therapist ~ rhode island, usa)   










"wonderful  class! i feel this will help expand my healing work as well as  accelerate my spiritual growth and healing. color energy therapy is a  very gentle, soft loving energy, but it is also a very powerful strong  energy. a neat balance. " ~ michelle w., los angeles
