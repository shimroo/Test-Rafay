our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion 
at doubleknot, we acknowledge and honor the fundamental value and dignity of all individuals. we are committed to creating and maintaining an environment that respects diverse traditions, heritages and experiences.
in our daily work, we seek to be conscious of and address the deeply entrenched practices, cultural norms, and decision making structures that perpetuate inequities and continue to learn and act to combat institutional racism and unconscious bias. we approach our work on diversity, equity, and inclusion with thoughtful optimism and sustained commitment. when we fall short, we will examine our practices and continue to learn.
