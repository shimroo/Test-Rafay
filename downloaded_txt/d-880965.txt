welcome to first presbyterian church belmont! it is our prayer that we will be to you and to our community “a visible sign of god’s invisible grace” made known to the world through our lord and savior jesus christ. we at fpc belmont believe that the body of christ, however, is not a building or campus, but a community of people brought together by god through the power of the holy spirit. it is because of the holy spirit that we are able to reach out and touch one another with the love and grace of the christian gospel. the primary way this church accomplishes such a singular mission is through a variety of programs and ministries designed for all ages and all conditions in life. we are a multigenerational church; with our oldest member over 90 years old and our youngest being newborns. we believe that having a wide range of ages gives us the energy and imagination of youth and the strong faith of maturity that encourages and enriches our congregation and community.whether you are looking for a new home church or hoping to learn more about first presbyterian, we invite you to join us at one of our sunday services, a bible study, prayer group, or other community event! we also encourage you to explore our website for a more in-depth look at our beliefs, ministries we are connected with, and how we strive to further the kingdom of god each day.
