mother we supported towards family reunification 



a boost of parental confidence 



a mother was court-ordered to attend our epic parenting classes as a condition of reuniting with her two children in foster care. she was cautious in the beginning and kept her guard up because she experienced judgment from other agencies because her children were in foster care. over time, she began to open up and share more of her story and struggles. by the time she successfully completed epic, she had a completely different attitude and had made progress on two major goals: finding a job and a place to live. she said succeeding in epic boosted her confidence in providing a safe and happy home for her children.
