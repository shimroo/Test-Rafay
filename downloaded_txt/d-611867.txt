legionella testing and control
the bacterium legionella is responsible for causing a harmful lung infection known as legionnaires’ disease. this is a major concern for any industrial or commercial facility that utilizes a cooling tower for its processes. the bacteria grow best in warm water conditions, such as the environment of a cooling tower. 
legionella is of great concern to any industrial or commercial facility that utilizes a cooling tower for its processes. this bacteria is spread through droplet transmission, which means water vapor or mist containing the bacteria is inhaled. it is not spread from person to person. the infection causes pneumonia that can be very serious to those with a weakened immune system due to old age, smoking habits or chronic lung disease (copd or emphysema). learn more about our legionella testing and control services.
