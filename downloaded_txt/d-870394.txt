history: handbook of texas online: "archeologists
                
                have found evidence of paleo-indians in the canyon. spanish explorers
                
                made several excursions into the area to take careful inventory of
                
                tribes, to note the flora and fauna of the area, and to name the
                
                rivers, mountains, and streams. they called the sabinal river arroyo de
                
                la soledad. in 1790 juan de ugalde united comanches, taovayas, and
                
                tawakonis and led a decisive victory over the apaches at the site of
                
                future utopia. the spaniards also found silver and dug a shaft on the
                
                east side of sugarloaf mountain, five miles south of utopia. this mine
                
                was seen by john c. duval in 1836. on june 10, 1839, a party under john
                
                c. (jack) hays and juan n. seguin pursued a band of comanches into
                
                sabinal canyon, where they destroyed newly deserted villages. hays
                
                encountered the comanches again on june 24, 1841, when eight comanches
                
                were killed and two taken prisoner. capt. william ware, a soldier in
                
                the texas revolution, moved to the canyon with his son and six slaves
                
                in 1852, thus fulfilling a resolution he had made in 1835, when he
                
                first saw the place. with 600 head of cattle and two ox-drawn wagons
                
                full of seeds, fruit trees, food, and tools, they had to move large
                
                boulders to get the wagons through the pass into the canyon. gideon
                
                thompson, aaron anglin, john and james davenport, lee sanders, henry
                
                robinson, and chris kelley soon arrived. more settlers arrived in 1853,
                
                and by 1856, a store-post office was built by charles durbon, who
                
                became the first postmaster of waresville. in 1856 victor p.
                
                considerant purchased 47,000 acres of land in the canyon from the
                
                canâon de ugalde land company. this purchase was financed by the
                
                european and american colonization society. considerant's plan to
                
                establish a fourierist phalanx in the canyon did not materialize
                
                because the failure of la reunion, near dallas, had made potential
                
                colonists too wary. 

settlers
                    
                    had friendly contact with tonkawa indians who had come to plant crops
                    
                    for their people, who were due to come later. the kickapoos raided many
                    
                    times during the early years. lipan apaches captured frank buckelew in
                    
                    1866 and held him captive for eleven months. they also raided mr.
                    
                    kincheloe's home that same year while he was away. his wife, sarah,
                    
                    captain ware's daughter, was lanced seventeen times, and mrs. ann
                    
                    bowlin was killed. warfare continued until 1876. kincheloe moved his
                    
                    family to land a mile north of waresville, where he built a two-story
                    
                    home in 1873, marked off and sold lots, and donated land for churches,
                    
                    a park, and a school. in 1884 a survey for the town of montana was
                    
                    filed in uvalde county, and the post office was moved from waresville
                    
                    to montana. when they learned that another place in texas was named
                    
                    montana, residents renamed the place utopia. by 1880 a stage stopped
                    
                    weekly at the community, where 150 citizens supported two gristmills, a
                    
                    cotton gin, a blacksmith shop, a store, and three churches. 

methodist
                    
                    services were first held in waresville by andrew jackson potter in
                    
                    1854. the church of christ was established in 1859; john c. ware and
                    
                    his sister eliza finley were the first two to be baptized. a christian
                    
                    church also moved to the canyon. andrew jackson sowell, his wife, mary
                    
                    lillian, and ten other charter members established the utopia
                    
                    missionary baptist church in 1886. a man named barker taught the first
                    
                    three school terms in the methodist church. in 1880 a schoolhouse was
                    
                    built; this structure was torn down in 1906, and a two-story building
                    
                    took its place. this building was burned in 1926; the present
                    
                    structure, built in 1927, has had several additions. 

by
                    
                    1904 the population of utopia was 147. the town had telephone service
                    
                    by 1914. annual rodeos have brought thousands of people since 1929. by
                    
                    1946 the town had seven businesses, three churches, a post office, and
                    
                    a population of 150. in 1952, when utopia celebrated the centennial of
                    
                    ware's arrival, governor allan shivers spoke to a crowd of 3,000 people
                    
                    in the park. on june 19 and 20, 1952, 9,000 people came to celebrate.
                    
                    in 1956 the sabinal river was dammed to impound a small municipal lake.
                    
                    many residents moved away in the drought-plagued 1950s. the population
                    
                    reached a low of sixty in the early 1960s, but by 1965 prosperity had
                    
                    returned. ranches leased land to hunters, beef prices rose, and the
                    
                    population grew. a cedar mill was constructed, the memorial library was
                    
                    established, civic clubs flourished, the town started a museum, and
                    
                    real estate establishments came into being. the utopia spring water
                    
                    plant was chartered in march 1984. tourism flourished after lost maples
                    
                    state natural area officially opened in september 1979. in 1990 the
                    
                    population of utopia was 360. the population was 241 in 2000."
