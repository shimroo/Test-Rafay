        is simple. any organization is only as good as its employees, and
        were sure you will agree that our employees are the best. while other
        consultants struggle to stay current with industry-specific policies,

        those standards.
mr. zehring has created, developed and is teaching what have become the
        national standards regarding safety, security and preventative maintenance procedures in
        rental housing and apartment communities, manufactured housing communities, overnight
        lodging properties, self-storage facilities and other businesses, including businesses that sell liquor.
        he has a comprehensive understanding in all facets of these industries including a working
        knowledge of the risks associated with each one.
mr. zehring has more than 20 years of experience as a crime
        prevention expert employed in a law enforcement capacity. mr.
        zehring is also the founder and executive director of the arizona-based 
        international crime free association.

litigation
        involving premises liability is one of the fastest growing types of
        personal injury lawsuits. a recent study suggests that in the past
        couple decades, verdicts ranged from $1 million to $2.1 million, in
        favor of the plaintiff in such cases. the average settlement is now over
        $500,000.00.

        of mr. zehring's expertise is on the internal, day-to-day operations of

        reasonable and consistent with the current standards of that specific
        industry.
after this
        process is completed, we can assist with determining if the business
        operated within the accepted customs and practices of the industry. this

        attributed.

        effective and appropriate control measures that are
        commensurate with the risks to which an organization is exposed.
risk management services

        
 - 

        risk management is similar to crisis management in a lot of ways. to
        illustrate this, consider the fact that there is a substantial
        difference between crisis management and management by crisis.
        crisis management is a systematic approach using proven strategies to
        avoid a potential crisis. management by crisis usually involves an unprepared, panicked response to
        unforeseen tragedies as they occur. often split second decisions are
        made that provide only temporary solutions until the next crisis arises,
        and the risk of litigation is always present.
  risk management is also a systematic approach using proven strategies to
        avoid potential losses. simply put, risk management is how you manage
        the risk of a loss. a loss can arise from many different areas,
        such as internal theft, the criminal acts of others, lawsuits and on the
        job injuries, to name a few. risk management is fundamental to the security and stability of any
        organization.
