some of the bizarre things you see in dreams



may 10, 2022






perhaps one of the most interesting and unknown things about dreaming is that we don’t know what we are dreaming most of the time. we dream in an abstract way, which makes it difficult to recall what we dream about after we wake up. the human brain cannot decipher the difference between what is real and what is unreal, so instead, it repeats things, imagines, and creates situations.  

some of the bizarre things you see in dreams
whether you’re asleep or awake, your mind is constantly processing and creating thoughts. it’s no different when you’re asleep. dreams can be some of the most bizarre experiences of our lives—you can see things that no one else has, and the things you see in your dreams are often very different from your daily life. sometimes, though, your dreams can be downright surreal. this can range from bizarre creatures and creatures from fictional worlds to yourself in your underwear or a petite teen nude girl. here are a few bizarre things you see in dreams. 
dreaming of being suffocated or smothered may imply some respiratory problems.
if you’re someone that wakes up feeling hot and bothered, it may be because your dream was about smothering someone. dreaming about being smothered often means feeling restrained or trapped, and there may be an underlying physical issue. the suffocating feeling can reflect the feeling that your lungs aren’t working well. it can mean that something in your life, such as work or relationships, is making you feel suffocated. it could even relate to a recent physical ailment, like an infection, which can produce a similar sensation. your breathing may be restricted, making it difficult to get a full night’s sleep. this could relate to respiratory problems, including sleep apnea. 
sleep paralysis is connected to ‘waking dreams’
have you ever dreamed of falling, but you don’t move when you hit the ground? this is called falling awake or sleep paralysis. it is sometimes known as “waking dreams” because, when the dream ends, you feel like you’re awake, even though you’ve physically been asleep. a sleep paralysis episode can feel like you are fully awake and conscious of the surroundings—but unable to move. with sleep paralysis, you experience hypnagogic hallucinations—video-like images that occur while falling asleep or dreaming. normally such images aren’t scary or harmful, but in sleep paralysis, they become terrifying.
if in your dreams your teeth fall out, that might be dental-related problems.
one of the bizarre things you see in dreams is when your teeth fall out which might be connected to a dental problem. another explanation is that dreams usually follow dreams about teeth falling out. these dreams occur when something is removed (often teeth) and are often associated with fear. other explanation dreams include removal of a tumor, spotting of a lump, removal of a body part, and removal of a garment. 
your dreams might be a real-life fright rehearsal
remember your dreams? most people tend to forget them within a few minutes, and if you go longer than a week, you probably don’t remember what you dreamed about either. but, there is a good reason why we forget our dreams—dreams are a form of learning. dreams allow us to experience events without actually being there. if you’ve ever had a dream where you were being chased by a giant snake, it probably wasn’t a hallucination. 
conclusion 
dreaming is a neurological process, so certain neurological processes will activate when we sleep. one of those processes is rem sleep which occurs when people dream. we have all experienced dreams on some sort of level throughout our lives.

the life of a modern day photographer


by

october 10, 2019



living
the life of a modern day photographer requires many sacrifices and hard work.
being a photographer is much more than just taking quality photos. the way
their day looks depends a lot on whether they are wedding photographers,
landscape photographers, studio photographers, and whether they are part of a
team of photographers or work alone. 

how day of
a photographer looks like
            modern day photographers do not have a typical working time. their job is not standard job that requires working from 9 to 5. their photo shoots can be longer or shorter than that and every photoshoot is different. every photography session is unique and requires a lot of work. they have busy lives and often don’t find themselves in a long term relationship. they use dating apps and hookup apps to find a relationship with no strings attached.  if you are thinking about becoming a professional photographer then you need to be very disciplined, committed, flexible and motivated to succeed. 
photoshoot day         
            photographers have to make and fix
different things before starting their shoots. first they think about the
lighting and how to properly adjust it, depending on whether they are working
indoors or outdoors. they always carry spare batteries and memory cards because
high quality photos usually take a lot of space on their cameras.
            after picking up the location for
the photoshoot, photographers then have to properly set up their equipment and
take all important things into consideration like the aperture and light before
proceeding towards taking pictures. sometimes photoshoots can last for many
hours and that is not everything that is involved.
            when the photoshoot is over,
photographers must backup everything in order not to accidentally lose
something important. the post-production
is also very demanding because photographers spend a lot of time to perfect the
pictures, edit them and make them the best they can possibly be. 
busy life of modern day photographers 
         photographers
that work on their own have a lot of things to think about during their working
days. they need to constantly check, read and answer emails and phone calls
from potential and existing clients. they must handle reservations and
schedules for different photoshoots and often have to plan things many weeks in
advance. issuing invoices, reminding clients for unpaid invoices and chasing
new clients is also a part of their everyday life. besides all that,
photographers must constantly maintain their expensive photography equipment,
properly clean it and service it when necessary. 
            as
we can conclude, the life of a modern day photographer is very busy and
demanding. however, rewards can be great when they make excellent photoshoots
and when they receive positive feedback from their satisfied clients. it can
really pay off long-term, but in order to be a successful photographer you must
be very persistent and keep trying until you reach perfection.

the life of an instagram influencer


by

october 10, 2019



some
people see instagram simply as social media platform while others see it as a
real job of which they can make significant amounts of money. however, becoming
an influencer on instagram and mixing pleasure with business requires doing
some important things first. not only things influencers post on the platform have
to be fresh, but it also need to be authentic. authentic things are very rare
today as millions of people have already covered pretty much everything there
is to cover online. today more and more instagrammers are going professional,
but algorithms also change so they need to constantly adapt to the new and
improved environment. 

how popular instagram influencers live
their lives 
            instagram
influencers regularly populate their accounts with glamorous photos of
expensive outfits, exclusive vacations and their fulfilling lives. however,
they also live with a lot of pressure on their shoulders as they have to
maintain that perfect image 24/7 which can take significant psychological toll.
creating and maintaining such image was hard for many who have burned out in
their desire to become influential. 
            instagram influencers always present their lives as beautiful, which is a strategy to attract brands that will be willing to sponsor them.  you can view many influencers easily on the snapchat forum board called teen usernames. influencers sometimes have to conceal and suppress their real feelings and thoughts about different brands if they want to strike a deal with them and promote them to their followers. although most popular instagram influencers usually align with those products and brands with which they share same values, some of them promote products they do not really like, but they do it anyways in exchange for money.  do not believe everything that you see at first. 
            one
thing that most instagram influencers fear the most is being exposed as a
fraud. usually the accounts of influencers are overwhelmed with positive
messages and comments, but sometimes there are discrediting comments made by
people who open anonymous accounts just to damage them. this is something many
instagram influencers have to battle against on daily basis. 
            what makes instagram influencers so
popular today is the fact that they do not limit themselves just to this
specific social platform. they also branch out to other mediums where they put
in just as many hours, hard work and effort to attract new followers. younger
influencers mostly rely on blogs and websites where they promote brands, while
established and more experienced influencers partner up with magazines and
fashion brands in order to broaden their followers.

is a beautiful small town located in barnstable county in massachusetts, us. it
sits on the south-eastern top part of cape cod and has been historically known
for its fishing community. town of chatham was first settled by the english in
1664 and was first named monomoit. chatham got its status of a town in 1712
when it became popular place for spending summer vacations. chatham has

in the summer period when many people come to the place. chatham is made of
four villages that comprise the town – chatham, north chatham, south chatham
and west chatham. 
chatham`s
old history
            the
lands where initially native americans lived were called monomoit, hence that
is why the initial name of the town was monomoit. first explorer to set the
foot to chatham was samuel de champlain in 1606. many other europeans came and
go from the place in the following years, but the english settlers were the

of them got lost due to bad erosion. however, in 1877 the chatham lighthouse
has been rebuilt and it stands to this day. 
            what
makes chatham different town from others in the cape
cod is that it still has
the same old charm since forever. the walkable main street is full of nice old
buildings and home of many family-owned businesses and shops. the main street
is also popular shopping place where you can find some nice shops selling all

their summer retreat. interesting fact is that in the summer months the

tourists. beaches are very crowded then, especially the most popular beach in
town – the lighthouse beach.
