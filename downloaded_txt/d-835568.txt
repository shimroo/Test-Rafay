the 3d line shown 
		  above is from the wayne county 
		  area of southeast mississippi, an area where numerous deep salt ridges 
		  and turtleback anticlines dominate the jurassic structural setting.  
		  hydrocarbons have been discovered and produced from both crestal and 
		  flank traps developed along the ridges and "turtles".  data 
		  courtesy seismic exchange.

pre-loess porphyritic 
                rhyolite cobble clast exhibiting typical 
                flow-banding structures.  the phenochrysts visible in this 
                specimen have been badly weathered resulting in pitting on the 
                outer surfaces .  the presence of unusual clasts like this can 
                help differentiate the  pre-loess terrace deposits of the 
                ancestral mississippi river from the  citronelle formation 
                in southwest mississippi.  this specimen is from clear creek, a 
                tributary of the big black river in warren county, near the town 
                of bovina.
