we're located at desoto marina along the peace river. enjoy a bite to eat inside, outside, or on-the-go before you head out on your adventure: airboat tours, kayak rentals, and more!
the marina caters to fishers, pilots, boaters, and nature lovers. boat fuel, bait shop, overnight and monthly docking - our marina has a lot to offer.











we're much more than just a restaurant. besides great food we have the marina, live music, and games!
