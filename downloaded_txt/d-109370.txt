piping technology & products, inc. (pt&p) was founded as a pipe stress engineering firm in 1975. our founder got his start by designing a thick-walled expansion joint for dow plaquemine. dow was so pleased, they placed a large scale order to roll out the solution across all dow plants, which allowed our founder to quit his job, and start pt&p. over the last 45+ years, we've expanded and are now best known for manufactured products. however, our roots in engineering are core to our dna and how we approach all aspects of the business. today, pt&p is the only major global manufacturer of engineered pipe supports and expansion joints. we have approximately 480 employees including 400+ production employees, 50+ design engineers, and 10 industrial engineers at our houston headquarters and other facilities. we have performed field service work in 41 countries, conducted over 1,000 plant audits, and worked with almost every major epc, petrochem, chemical, and power company. when you work with pt&p, you can be assured that no other company has seen and solved more issues around piping systems than we have.
