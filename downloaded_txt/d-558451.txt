our mission 
american farmland trust launched the conservation agriculture movement and has been bringing agriculture and the environment together since 1980. we take a holistic approach to farmland and ranchland, protecting it from development, promoting environmentally sound farming practices, and keeping farmers on it. agriculture offers the most promising solutions in our fight against climate change—but only when we support farming can it fulfill its promise to feed us and heal our planet.
