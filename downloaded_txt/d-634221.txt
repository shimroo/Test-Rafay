formula 4 success



if we each had a sign to describe ourselves, cj huestonâs would be a checkered flag.
 
the president and ceo of corporate dimensions, cjâs competitive spirit, ambition and drive developed at a young age around her passion for race cars.
 
she lived just a short drive from the indianapolis motor speedway where her first experiences and fondest memories came from visiting the indy 500 track with her dad.
 
a childhood facination turned into a reality when she acquired a race car and then qualified in the top five at her very first race. and she has been on the fast track ever since.

fast forward



in 1998, cj founded corporate dimensions to provide companies with the recruitment services that she, herself, had envisioned needing when she was in the corporate world.
 
harnessing her considerable reserves of energy, cj has grown the company into two distinct divisions: executive search & recruitment and career planning & development.
 
with a strong focus on executive search and recruitment, corporate dimensions strategically partners with clients to identify, search, source, recruit and deliver key leadership talent to ensure outstanding performance and fit.
 
while executive search and recruitment is the cornerstone of the business, establishing a career planning division was a natural off-shoot that fulfills cjâs passion for helping professionals develop career strategies to reach their goals and maximize their potential.
 
her formula 4 success? âwe embrace both sides of the equation: corporate dimensions is the most valuable source for those businesses who seek exceptional leaders and for those professionals who seek new opportunities.â
