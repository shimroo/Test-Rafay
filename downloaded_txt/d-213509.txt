what our members say












when going through my divorce and transitioning to one income, the y stepped in with a scholarship for my son to play baseball. with support like that, everything feels a little bit easier.


                        — mayela, ymca parent
                      










because of (the y) i found my blood pressure was in the danger zone. i had my medication modified...my outcome could have been very different. thank you, ymca staff for caring.


                        — shirley, blood pressure self-monitoring program participant
