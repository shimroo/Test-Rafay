  dr. hauschka skin care allows your skin to tap into its own, natural ability to stay healthy and beautiful. unique formulations with botanical ingredients help to invigorate, calm or fortify your skin —according to its individual needs. this keeps your skin beautifully radiant at any stage of life. we have independent institutes confirm the efficacy of our skin care through clinical studies. our nighttime skin care products support your skin’s nightly self-renewal processes by leaving it free to breathe. they work exclusively with revitalizing botanicals and lightweight textures. specially designed for mature skin, our regenerating and regenerating intensive lines offer highly efficient formulations. they help reduce the appearance of fine lines and indulge your skin with nourishing, creamy textures.       how gentle and non-irritating are your products?   since our establishment in 1967, dr. hauschka skin care has put our trust in the power of nature: we draw exclusively on natural raw materials for our formulations, including plant extracts, botanical oils and waxes, and essential oils. before we launch new skin care products on the market, we have independent institutes carry out dermatological tests on volunteers to confirm that our skin care is gentle and non-irritating.        what is the quality of dr. hauschka skin care?   dr. hauschka stands for certified natural skin care of the highest quality: more than 90% of our botanical ingredients are grown using organic farming, preferably from our own biodynamic herb garden, the fields on our demeter-certified biodynamic farm or from ethical wild harvesting in the nearby swabian alps. from harvesting to bottling, all production stages are closely coordinated and delivery routes short to help protect the climate and ensure the best, freshest quality of our products. when we buy plants that don't grow in our climate, we choose partners who share our values and with whom we have worked closely for years. if we cannot source an ingredient from organic farming, we purposefully initiate biodynamic cultivation projects around the world and help our partners by providing advice and support. we do not use synthetic additives. we guarantee the high quality and microbial safety of our products through a whole range of further measures: our raw materials undergo thorough microbiological tests prior to processing under strict hygienic conditions that meet pharmaceutical standards. we then formulate our ingredients carefully to ensure they interact well for great product stability.       what ingredients do you use?   dr. hauschka is certified natural skin care. that means our ingredients don't come from chemistry sets, but from nature, such as nurturing plants, botanical oils and waxes, and real essential oils. we also use minerals, certain metals and animal-derived substances. all in all, we draw on a pool of 500 natural raw ingredients, which are primarily organic. the ingredients in our products are mostly of botanical or mineral origin. depending on the desired effect of the skin care and the skin’s needs, we decide whether or not to use animal-derived raw materials for each individual product. for example, beeswax is a valuable substance for natural skin care. a gift from nature that we use with the utmost care. but we do offer vegan skin care too. dr. hauschka skin care is free from mineral oils, microplastics and liquid synthetic polymers. we also do not use any petroleum-derived substances produced by synthetic chemical means. we obtain our glycerin and oil-based constituents exclusively from plants.       do you test on animals?   looking for skin care that doesn't use animal testing? we have never tested on animals. since dr. hauschka was established in 1967, we have never carried out or outsourced animal testing. in the european union, animal testing has been completely banned for cosmetic products and their raw ingredients since 11 march 2013 under the cosmetics directive. it is a mandatory ban that all cosmetics manufacturers in the eu must respect. dr. hauschka skin care is not always vegan. depending on the desired effect of the skin care and the skin’s needs, we decide whether or not to use animal ingredients for each individual product. we are aware that whenever we take something from nature, we are responsible for the environment and the quality of the substance we have taken away. however, we do offer vegan skin care too.                       about us   company   sustainability   expertise   ingredients   values   loyalty program   dr. hauschka international     customer care       faqs   contact us   order & shipping information   return policy   my account   gift cards     resources   shop local   ingredient library     news   subscribe       dr. hauschka skin care is 100% certified natural by natrue and made with organic, biodynamic and ethically sourced ingredients. follow our story on social media.       facebook   instagram   instagram   pinterest   youtube       cookie declaration   privacy policy   terms & conditions   loyalty terms & conditions
