maybe you’ve heard about the boys and girls club. for over a century we’ve worked to support our children: those future leaders with curious minds and hungry hearts. in hawthorne, nj, we continue that mission every day. here, we give kids a safe place to learn and grow. through the relationships they build with our staff and volunteers, they discover new opportunities, while developing the skills needed to pursue them.
whoever you are, whatever you do, thank you for taking the time to visit our page. we welcome you to contribute to the paths we’re forging for our young ones, or learn more about what we do and why it makes such an enormous difference.
