 our verdict on lunarpages web hosting
lunarpages has been around for 10 years and in this time has proved themselves to be a web hosting company who pride themselves on customer satisfaction. although lunarpages pricing is on par with most leading web hosting company's their customer support far outdoes any other web host. for most people the lunarpages standard plan would fulfill their needs and we believe that this plan provides excellent value for money. however if you are planning to setup an extremely resource intensive website then we would recommend the premium plan. in conclusion we highly recommend lunarpages web hosting. visit http://www.lunarpages.com or keep reading our full lunarpages review below.
