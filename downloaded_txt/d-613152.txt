coco33

            valuation and risk management service
          
coco33 is a pricing and risk management framework for regulatory capital securities issued by banks and insurance companies. it relies on a powerful reduced form regime switching model with stochastic bail-in intensities and stochastic credit, jointly calibrated on the market quotes of the subordinated instruments of the issuer. it analyses the extension risk by assessing the propensity of an issuer to call a security early in a suboptimal way.

volatility management

            the equity derivatives pricing expert
          
the variance swap is an equity derivative with payoff the realized variance of the underlying equity or index. equity-to-credit is the new form of volatility arbitrage. credit risk (through the probability of the underlying equity jumping to zero) adds a component to option premium that cannot be financed by the usual rebalancing of the delta hedge issuing from the black-scholes-merton model

paris, february 23, 2023 -  the coco33 valuation and risk management model introduces several new risk outputs related to the extension risk of regulatory capital securities
most notably:

suboptimal call probability: the probability that an issuer will respect the gentleman agreement and call a bond at its next call date even when the value of the bond is lower than the call price.
suboptimal call value:  the value given to investors as a result of a possible suboptimal call policy.
extension probability: the probability that a security will be extended (not called) at the next call date, taking into account the possible suboptimal call policy of the issuer.
