are you ready to build?


since 1990, the r. messner team has had the privilege to assist hundreds of pastors, churches and ministries throughout the united states with masterplanning, design consulting, architectural and engineering services, and full-service construction delivery. our experience has enabled us to develop the simplest, most relevant and comprehensive building process available today - to help pastors and building committees practically and economically approach and realize their building dreams, from start to finish.


as you look through these pages, we hope that you receive inspiration and vision for the growth plan of your facilities. we would be glad to help your church establish a creative and logical masterplan for expansion, design innovative promotional materials for communicating the vision, develop the important architectural documents that will be required, and help your church construct the facility god has called you to build â the house of the lord your god.
