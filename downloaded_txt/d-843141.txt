our trip was wonderful, and we thought your interpretation of our needs was the best.
our northern vietnam piece was great. ha long bay and that overnight boat was special (as was the trip down the mekong). laos was wonderful, if not too short a visit.
obviously, we’ll have to do it again – but maybe for a shorter time- and see both what we missed and what we especially enjoyed. wonderful guides, especially ta napat in bangkok and ha in hanoi. the service was impeccable, everywhere, and the hotels excellent.
again, thanks.

dear anne,
thanks very much for all the arrangements you completed for my recent trip to southern india. i appreciate your personal and professional advice — freely given as i contemplated the trip — as well as your responsiveness, frankness and good nature.
everything went as i was told it would. there were no surprises. everybody showed up on time and delivered what was promised. i believe that i got good value for my money and am especially grateful for the pace of travel…something i’d never be able to foresee.
i am glad to have become a repeat customer, and glad to have referred my friends to your care.
be well,
archie harders

hi anne,
still recovering from jet lag, but want to let you know how trip to india went. pam and i would say it was a complete success. pam absolutely loved every minute and i can say it was a life experience like no other. it was incredible and exhausting. the itinerary we put together was perfect. we saw a great deal of india yet scheduled enough ‘down time’ to stay healthy. our weather was ideal, the drivers and guides very good, and all our arrangements excellent. pam loved the food, tom found plenty to eat. the hotels were outstanding. the trip over on queen mary 2 was a bonus as was extra days in dubai. emirates airline outstanding. internal air travel just barely ok. good weather, november best time to go.
most memorable sights: varanasi and ceremonies on the ganges, taj majhal, jain temple in calcutta, amber fort in jaipur. and house boat in backwaters. the people in india are beautiful, so friendly and so eager to be of service. never once felt uncomfortable, despite such a large population.
the negatives: quality of air everywhere especially new delhi. caution anyone with respiratory problems. traffic is simply unbelievable, word cannot describe what its like.
so anne, you and i did a good job..thanks for all you did to make it a true life experience. take care and we send our very best
tom & pam
