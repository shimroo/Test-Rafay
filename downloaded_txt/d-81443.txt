the mission of the national information center for higher education policymaking and
      analysis is to provide state policymakers and analysts timely and accurate data and information that are useful in
      making sound higher education policy decisions.
by navigating the links on the left, you'll find comparative data for states and counties, and useful contextual
      information.
thanks to lumina foundation for education, the ford foundation, and the national postsecondary education
      cooperative for supporting the development of this website.
note: nchems is currently undergoing a review of higheredinfo.org, during which time updated datasets may
        not be available on the website. we hope to launch a new and improved resource for state higher education data
        soon. in the meantime, nchems staff may be able to share updated data with you directly. if there is a
        particular set of data you are looking for, please contact zac koch at zac@nchems.org.
        thank you.
