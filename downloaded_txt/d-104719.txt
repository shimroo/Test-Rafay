frequently asked questions








            do you have to be 21+ to enter?
          










we are an all ages venue. admission tickets are required for entry.








            how do reservations/tickets work through opentable?
          










your seat reservations through opentable will serve as your tickets. each reservation booked through opentable will be guaranteed a seat at a table according to your party size. when you come in through the door, we will ask for your name and then charge your tickets and give you them. 








            where can i find parking? 
          










aside from street parking, and parking garages around union square, we have a special deal with mason/o'farrell (325 mason st.) parking garage: flat rate of $10 for up to 3 hours, or $15 for 5 hours. show the parking attendant your show ticket stub before you pay upon exiting the garage.








            what's the cancellation policy?
          










your tickets are not refundable and not cancellable. you may cancel but you will still be charged the day of the original reservation. we are happy to offer a one time reschedule for a show of equal or less value within 60 days. 








            is your facility wheelchair accessible? 
          










biscuits and blues is fully wheelchair accessible. for any special requests please call us at (415) 292-2583.








            does buying one ticket grant me access to both shows?
          










no. when you purchase a ticket for a show it grants you access only to the scheduled show on that day; however, on certain occasions based on space availability and artist permission, you may ask to stay for the later show with 1st show tickets. we reserve the right to rescind this offer at moment's notice.








            are walk-ins welcome?
          










yes, walk-ins are welcome but reservations are encouraged to help our staff plan seating arrangements. buying tickets the day of the show is an extra $5 service fee.








            do we have to eat or drink at the venue?
          










we encourage the early shows, typically 6:30pm, to be dinner shows. the later shows, typically 8:30pm, are cocktail shows: there is a two drink minimum. please note however that we do serve dinner and drinks throughout both shows.
