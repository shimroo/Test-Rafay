the mangrove forests are in great peril and its destruction is the biggest threat to the proboscis monkeys. 

 

our mission is to provide a sanctuary for the proboscis monkeys and to educate people on sustainable ways of co-existing with nature and its inhabitants.












 

a taste of a day in  labuk baythe mangroves of labuk bay are home to more than just the proboscis monkeys! silvered leaf monkeys, otters, slow lorises, and hornbills are just some of the many species you can spot on a day at the sanctuary.
