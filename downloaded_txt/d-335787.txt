i have found these trainings to be exceptionally effective because they are spread out over time. people try out new skills, come back with new successes and deeper questions and the program is the equivalent of  a “full-day” training, all in digestible bites over time.   i am blown away how good this works!one 3 hour session and a 1 hour follow-up two weeks latertwo 3 hour sessions, 1-3 weeks apart according to your schedulefour 1 hour sessions over the course of 4-6 weeksthree 90 minute sessions over 6 weeks. whatever fits your scheduling and goals!
