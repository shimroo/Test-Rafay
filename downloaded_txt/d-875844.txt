welcome to camp yamhill



winter retreat weather update
the weather forecast shows warming temperatures and possible light rain for the weekend. there is still snow on the ground at camp, but it is melting with the increase in temperature.
we will still hold winter retreat, but out of an abundance of caution we will change the start time. in order to give more time for the snow to melt and to keep people from having to drive out to camp in the dark, we will postpone the beginning of winter retreat until 10:00am saturday morning (2/15/25).
camp yamhill will make a refund of $20 for each paid camper to cover the revised schedule.
