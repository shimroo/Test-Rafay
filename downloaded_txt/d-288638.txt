certificates of authenticity

		as the author of  

		two
		books on louis icart, one on maxfield parrish & one 
		on tiffany, the advisor to schroeders antiques price 
		guide for 17 years and a contributor to various antiques 
		magazines, i offer you my certificate of authenticity as an expert in 
		these fields. any person or mysterious gallery can offer 
		a certificate attesting to an items authenticity and/or value. the key 
		is getting a certificate from someone who is a recognized authority. otherwise it may be worthless.

need an appraisal?
information and appraisals:
    i have found that information obtained for free is usually worth what you paid for it: nothing. many times you'll only get
    information that is self-serving to the dealer.  accurate information based on years
    of knowledge is valuable. an item that you think is worth $500 may be worth $5000.
    conversely, you may be asking $1000 for a $25 repro. if you
    really want to know, pay an expert to appraise or evaluate it.  disseminating
    information takes time and you must be willing to pay the expert for his time. my fees are
    very reasonable, starting at $50. email your specific request and i will quote the fee
    involved.~~~

email problems:  
		i have a spam blocker which flags some words, especially from hotmail & 
		aol.  please don't leave the subject line blank. this created 
		problems.  i respond to every email 
		within 48 hours. if you don't receive a reply, try again or try sending 
		from a different address.

*my mailing
and shipping address is a ups store, for now. all packages will be 
signed for upon delivery. the address is somewhat complicated. 3642 savannah 
highway is the address for the shopping center, with the ups store 
being suite 116 in the center. my box is #207 in the store. the 
city is johns island, sc and the zip code is 29455.  johns island is part 
	of charleston.


regarding the condition of the desk pieces: all desk pieces are
		85-120 years old. collectors vary widely as to what signs of age they are willing to accept.
		most pieces will show some signs of use--maybe an ink stain or some minor
wear to the patina. currently there is no standardized grading system used by dealers,
		and ebay sellers confuse the issue further
by describing almost every item as "breathtaking", "stunning" & "fabulous".
		i rarely offer pieces that i would not proudly show in my own collection.
		and, unlike many sellers, if you are unhappy for any reason, you may return the item for a full refund.
