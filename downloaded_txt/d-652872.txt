about the natural resource information system
established in 1985 by the montana legislature, the montana natural resource information system (nris) was designed to simplify the task of identifying and acquiring natural resource information. as a program of the montana state library, nris’s mission is to make information on montana’s natural resources easily and readily accessible. serving government agencies, business and industry, and private citizens, nris operates a clearinghouse and referral service to link users with the best sources of information and service.
the montana state library houses the nris program for two reasons: the state library is a neutral agency with no bias in providing information, and the state library has the mission of providing access to information.
for additional information visit the nris advisory committee page.
