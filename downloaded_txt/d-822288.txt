treasure  of the r.m.s republic










the knowledge that a secret exists is half of the secret. --

noticethe rms republic website contains information and research as it existed in the 1980s, and is provided here in its near-original content; the material here is not current and is made available to you only for historical and research-development tracing purposes.

since this site has not been updated, a good number of links that reference other sites which are included here are no longer valid. the topics, however, can be easily googled. 

therefore, the research contained herein provides only initial clues to the definitive research contained within my 2013 book the tsar's treasure, publisher: barnburner books, llc (august 1, 2013) ,  isbn-10: 0988876000 , isbn-13: 978-0988876002, available at amazon and other book retailers worldwide.

you can find substantial research updates within the research section of the lords of fortune website.
