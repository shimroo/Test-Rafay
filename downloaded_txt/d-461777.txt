blue coyote bar & grill








we want to thank you for this opportunity to introduce you to the blue coyote bar & grill, a southwestern restaurant located right in downtown palm springs with easy access from all major hotels.
established in 1992 we have gained a local, national and international reputation for quality southwestern and authentic mexican cuisine. in addition, we have become famous





worldwide for our signature “wild coyote margarita“. this is a margarita you will not forget.
to enhance your dining experience, the blue coyote has created expansive patios that invite leisurely dining under our beautiful desert sky. we also have numerous casitas for those who prefer inside dining. lets not forget the lively music that inspires our guests to just linger a while. it’s no wonder that the palm springs hotel and hospitality association named the blue coyote the “most highly recommended restaurant.”
we welcome the opportunity for you to try our restaurant during your visit to palm springs. when planning dining away from your hotel, we can meet your needs regardless of how small or large they might be. we can easily accommodate groups of 20 to 75 people. we can also provide a private dining room with patio for your larger parties.
put the blue coyote bar & grill on your “must do list” when you are in palm springs, ca!
