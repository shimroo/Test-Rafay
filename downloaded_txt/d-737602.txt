searching for count dante



following the mental processes of an obsessed filmmaker producing a documentary film with short funding, a lotta heart and a highly unusual subject he once met when he was 11 years old.

the search for count dante, headed towards completion, nov. 10, 2021


i got approached by a production compamny in march of this year, after a decade and a half of struggle. after going to federal court with some knuckleheads in boston who wanted to stop the project. the project would not go away, this story is going to be told. the tale is as much the jounety as it is the life of johh keehan count dante. i'll give more information as we begin production.  we've designed a new shoe  to promote the film. there will be more products coming. there's still a lot of cost to cover and i know a lot of you guys love swag, so we have some more ideas in the works.    the shoes are actually great quality. i'm going to do a giveaway of a pair very soon. so watch for it.
