pre-employment testing

have you ever thought you had a perfect candidate-job fit only to find that the candidate couldn't perform on the job? observing people work is the best way to identify top performers. ergometrics' simulations measure critical skills and abilities within realistic work situations.


video employment tests

video is the most effective way to create realistic human interaction situations. video creates an environment that allows organizations to see how personality, cognitive ability, judgment, integrity and other factors actually impact job performance.


online selection testing

using computers and the internet in employment testing can save time and money for organizations. ergometrics makes implementing sophisticated web-based applications simple. we can turn your paper tests into computer tests or you can use one of our many proctored and unproctored testing applications.
