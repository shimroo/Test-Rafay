measure of gold revival ministries  
 thank you for visiting my site. i
        pray that it will be a blessing for you and help you grow in your faith.
        i have many resources here for the christian interested in what god has
        done and what he is currently doing. 
i have also started my own faith based
        ministry which can be reached through the links on the upper left.

	of the baby god raised from the dead!! open 
	heavens over kenya full story...text,

        in august - september i will be back in cambodia and vietnam to do more 
	ministry there.

        measure of gold site after each trip that you may see on the bottom left
        of this page.. 
measure of gold revival ministries
        is a 501.3c non-profit corporation registered in the state of washington. 
this ministry is totally
        independent of any denomination or other ministry. i get no funding other
        than what god will bring. it is expensive to go and share the gospel
        in third world countries. i live in a 20 year old house in a nice neighborhood.
        it is all paid off. i drive a 2000 jeep cherokee with a dented front
        bumper, my wife a public school teacher drives a 1997 nissan maxima.
        the are both paid for. i own no debts to any man, but to share the gospel.
      
i also regularly give to other
      ministries of indigenous evangelists, etc in third world countries to help
      them further the work of our lord. many of these depend on my giving to
      sustain them, feed orphans, feed the poor. 
i need your financial help to get the gospel
      and the power of god that he has invested in me to where he wants me to
      go. go to my donation page and you can give via credit card,
      check or electronic wire.
 
thanks and god bless each of you.
evan wiggs "the happy
        wanderer for jesus"
