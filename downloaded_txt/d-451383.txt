as a installer/contractor with over 10 years of experience in the commercial workspace industry, i cannot recommend panel systems highly enough. they are able to provide high-end, quality used workspace systems.

panel systems did a fantastic job. they created an excellent plan and provided cost effective options for our office move. their staff were on time and installed everything perfectly. they came back to correct anything we asked for. they are extremely professional and we would recommend them to anyone looking for office furniture, cubicles or moving.

this company saved me from a nightmare! i contacted panel systems and they had me a design and quote within hours. they installed my stations 2 weeks later and had us ready to roll for enrollment season. pricing was identical to the other company but panel systems added 3 stations within the price point so definitely a better deal! i will use this company from here on out.
