canada’s national river conservation program
    
from coast to coast to coast, canadian heritage rivers offer visitors a chance to experience great waterways, learn about their rich history, and share in their stewardship. the canadian heritage rivers system helps recognize and conserve these outstanding rivers that are an enduring part of our national heritage and identity.
    
 
    
 



      the canadian heritage river system acknowledges that canadian heritage rivers flow through the traditional territories of first nation, inuit, and métis peoples from coast to coast to coast. to learn more about the indigenous territories in canada, view the comprehensive map here.
