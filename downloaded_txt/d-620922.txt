mary’s guard of honor through the perpetual rosary














free for god alone



called by god, like mary, to sit at the feet of jesus and listen to his word, we are united to him in a life of prayer and penance for the salvation of souls.the daily practices of our monastic life, especially enclosure and silence, free our hearts for god alone so that his word may dwell more abundantly in our monastery.  at the heart of the church, our life of consecration is mysteriously fruitful for the growth of the people of god.















at the heart of the holy preachingst. dominic founded the cloistered dominican nuns to be at the heart of the holy preaching of his order for the salvation of souls.























traditional latin chant

in the solemn celebration of the liturgy, we chant god’s praises in english and in latin using our traditional dominican chant.











fervent marian devotion

as mary’s guards of honor, in our eucharistic adoration and perpetual rosary we intercede for the needs of the world.











joyful community life

in our community life, prayer, study, and work, we give ourselves totally to jesus through mary for the salvation of souls.



















    our community
  




    our daily life
  
















“one thing i ask of the lord, this i seek: to dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life.”





    pursuing a cloistered vocation
  














share in our life of prayerwhether by joining us in our monastery chapel for holy mass or eucharistic adoration, sending prayer intentions, or praying with our rosary meditations, we invite you to share the fruits of our life of contemplation.
