groupon reviewgrouponthe instructor is amazing! was told on multiple occasions that area is where to go. actually everyone literally said "area" and i'm here to confirm.
michael j.yelp!i love how convenient they make it here for you. they give you a calandar detailing which subjects are taught on which days, allowing you to choose which classes you'd like to attend in order to complete all 6 subjects at your own speeed. you can also sit in on any of the classes to review the chapters even after you complete them. the instructor,  alicia, is fantastic. she seems like such a good person and she teaches in a way that keeps you interested and focused. i've gone through real estate school at coldwell banker in the past and the hours spent in class were seriously brutal. hoping area is the key to finally passing the exam!
