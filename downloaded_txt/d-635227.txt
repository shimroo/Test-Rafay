what people are saying:


this was our first auction, and we were very impressed with how well the auction was organized. ira is a true professional at auctioneering, and we were pleased with the results.marshall & diana leei should probably start out by saying i was very resistant to any discussion about an auction when it came to selling my parents’ farm/land/property. my thoughts were more towards a private sale. when time and energy from our family ran out, it was pretty clear that an auction was what was needed to make the sale of the farm a reality. my brother had purchased his home through smith & co and he was extremely pleased. but again, i was just not convinced. however, as time went by it was very apparent that smith & co – headed by ira smith – absolutely knew what they needed to do to market then sell our property. we were very impressed with ira’s expertise and reputation in the area. buck hutchens was an invaluable asset – ready to answer questions and help in any way he could. we were so happy with the outcome of the first auction, that we scheduled a second one to complete the liquidation of our parents’ farm. at the end of the day, we feel that ira and his team have put forward every effort to make sure we had the best results from our two auctions. i would highly recommend smith & co to anyone that has property to sell.pamela downira,you and your staff need to be commended for the job recently performed for me.  i would not know how to ask for better service or results.i suppose every transaction has its own peculiarities but this one was challenging in many respects.  it was your dogged determination that achieved the result i sought.  you are a stand up kind of guy that i am very happy to have done business with.you and your staff were kind and courteous in every encounter.  everyone was timely and thorough in the tasks presented.the entire process from listing to closing and all points in between were about as enjoyable as business can be.  i hope this ordeal has made for a favorable lasting acquaintance.  you have all made it so from my point of view.thank you for a job very well done.sincerely,dwight freemandwight freemansmith & co is extremely professional and efficient. our auction went off without a hitch and we are happy with the results.scott clinei thought it was going to be a real pain selling the farms.  but you guys made it easy from start to finish.  your knowledge and service is second to none.  great job!dennis mathewsyou guys were great.  since i live in texas, i was worried about doing everything long distance.  but it has gone off smooth and easy.  ira made me feel at ease with the auction. i had been told by my good friend that lives there he was the way to go, and she was right!  thank you!judith crystal
