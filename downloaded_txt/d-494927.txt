rachel cohen gerrol | ceo & co-founder nexus
“marc pollick has been a valued mentor to me in the field of philanthropy and has taught me the true meaning of giving back.  his vision and leadership have carried the giving back fund to great heights over the past quarter century and their work has significantly impacted the lives of people across the globe.”











liam elkind | co-founder invisible hands
“the giving back fund has been absolutely integral to invisible hands' success. marc and his team work so hard on behalf of each of their clients. gbf has helped connect us to funding, interns, and so much more to advance and develop our mission. gbf will be a partner and a friend at every step of your journey, from nascent to non-profit!”











jamie-lynn sigler | actress
“the giving back fund found me the perfect corporate partner to help spread my message of healthy lifestyles and the dangers of eating disorders. my foundation partnered with claire’s to create a bracelet initiative that helped put life-saving information into the hands of young girls.”











ben roethlisberger | pittsburgh steelers, super bowl champion qb
“when i am in season i am completely focused on football. my mind is at ease knowing that my foundation is being professionally managed by the giving back fund. my charitable work is important to me, and it has to be done right. my reputation depends on it.”











tony rokita | manager of community events, chicago bulls
“the bulls have worked with the giving back fund for several years now. our players, jalen rose, donyell marshall, and elton brand all have foundations with gbf. i’ve been so impressed with them. it’s clear they care about the players and about really having a positive impact on the community. i’ve seen them scramble to get things done, and they think big, which is, of course, a bulls’ trait!”
