											what is the best diamond quality jewelry to choose for my money?
									 	

beware of "promotional quality" diamond jewelry
if you are looking for a great deal without sacrificing the diamond quality, you may want to think twice about buying "promotional quality" diamond jewelry. promotional quality diamonds are the bottom of the barrel when it comes to diamond quality. they are usually i3 which stands for "heavily included". a better choice for your money is si2-i1. the inclusions are less visible to the eye and look more presentable.

											how can i be reassured about making a jewelry purchase online?    
									 	

using the bbb for a safe jewelry purchase 
making a large jewelry purchase online can be somewhat nerve wrecking. you first may want to check to see that the company is a bbb member. whether they are or aren't, search their name at bbb.org to see if they have had many unresolved past complaints. if their name doesn't appear you may want to research further. checking their background should ease any doubt about your purchase.

											platinum is expensive, but is it worth the investment?
									 	

platinum: converting "expensive" into "value"
platinum's true value is defined by the pure, rare and eternal qualities that are unique to the noblest of precious metals. and these values can be used to romance the meaning behind the purchase of this expensive item. after taking the time and care to choose the perfect diamond, how can the setting be less than the very best. no other metal complements a diamond quite like platinum so don't let the setting be an afterthought. the average wedding in the us today costs $23,000, most of which is spent on disposable items (flowers, cake etc). wedding rings are something that will be worn everyday, forever. given a cost per day of wear from something so pure, rare and eternal, platinum represents one of the best values out there. (article by huw daniel, president of platinum guild international usa.)

											how do i choose a diamond on a budget?
									 	

buying a diamond on a budget
if you are looking to get a nice diamond for your loved one and you have a certain budget in mind, a good choice is si1-si2 in clarity, and h-i in color. si1-si2 stands for slight inclusions. usually these inclusions can not be seen with the visible eye, but can be seen through a loupe. h-i color stands for near colorless. it's not quite white but it's also not yellow. to view a color and clarity diamond chart please go to http://www.annharringtonjewelry.com under the diamond education section.
