summer 2024:
(updated every so 
          often!) 
what's new? 
          we now have... a 
          special gifts section!

all new - 
          we now sell empty milk bottles (the ones we 
          use for our bath salts), with or without the cork.
also 
          - we have a variety of pure essential oils for all 
          your aromatherapy purposes! check them out!


 

pure 
          & natural! 
we make only natural 
          products! we don't use synthetic fragrances - we don't use synthetic 
          colors - we don't use animal products - and we don't compromise on quality!

pay 
          attention to the labels on the products you buy - often times you'll 
          see "tallow" or "sodium tallowate" listed in the 
          ingredients on other soaps... that means they're using animal fat - 
          not vegetable oil! 
if 
          they list "fragrance" or "perfume" in their ingredients 
          (on anything - not just soap) it means they're probably using synthetics. 
          we use only pure & natural essential oils to give our products their 
          aroma.
