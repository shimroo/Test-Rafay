i emailed david yesterday morning about what i thought was going to be a major problem with my bath. despite being very busy, he replied quickly and assured me he would call at a specific time—and he did. david was such a pleasant and understanding person, introducing himself kindly.he assessed the issue and confirmed he could fix it the same day. true to his word, he kept in touch via email and text. he arrived on time today as promised, had a friendly chat, and resolved the issue quickly and efficiently, all for a very reasonable price.highly recommended!

we couldn't be happier with our new bathroom and we can't recommend david highly enough. there was minimum disruption and meticulous attention to detail which is evident in the finished room. nothing was too much trouble for david and he was a pleasure to meet and have in our home. if you are thinking about a refurbishment we would strongly recommend you entrust the work to david.
