the wood you need.sustainably harvested and expertly milled.










douglas fir

consider douglas fir’s rating as one of the hardest, heaviest softwoods and it’s easy to see why it can’t be beat for construction purposes like 2” lumber, and timbers. our premium exposed products are particularly popular.douglas fir offerings →











port orford cedar

port orford cedar is truly special. it features spectacular strength-to-weight ratio, and natural oils make it resistant to decay. we’re one of the few to be able to reliably offer this coveted lumber as decking, 2” lumber, and timbers.port orford cedar offerings →











incense cedar

satin smooth, aromatic, and with incredible dimensional stability and extreme durability, there’s a reason demand for incense cedar is so high — particularly for decking, timbers, 2” lumber, and pecky landscape timbers.incense cedar offerings →
