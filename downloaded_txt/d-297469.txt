less than 
            20 minutes after a friend said "be careful or you will break your 
            phone" i dropped said iphone7 onto the sidewalk. the screen 
            shattered. so too did my world. perhaps that is a bit hyperbolic, 
            however not having my phone numbers accessible was disheartening. i 
            lost everybody, almost. a lessons was learned.



             


            baby had gifted me the phone years ago. 
            below is the first picture 
            taken with the iphone.



my skipper was such an amazing 
            pup. she was 5 pounds of fluffy
 fur that she left all over seaweed. 
            my bilges still have skipper's fur.
 

            but i digress...
            almost immediately after being told to be careful i 
            managed to drop the phone. the screen shattered. because of that i 
            was unable to open the phone, retrieve phone numbers, answer calls, 
            make phone calls, live my life!!! it is amazing how much information 
            i had on that little phone.
 


i 
            should have had a written list of my friends, associates and the 
            businesses i call. because i did not, i was lost. additionally, due to not 
            having a replacement phone for quite some time folks who normally 
            called me did not receive an answer. i was able to send letters to a 
            couple of friends which was good.
 





 





                  the 
            technology of telephones has changed the world far more than i ever 
            could have imagined years ago. the star trek communicators of 
            decades ago has been supplanted by the now common cell phone.


 







                    having the 
            ability to make and receive phone calls while boating has made a 
            tremendous difference in my life.
            








            after a couple of flip phones (both dropped overboard) my newer 
            phone has a hotspot. baby has me on her verizon plan. here in my 
            area the coverage is spectacular.  




 






                  oliver's mom enjoyed using her cell phone while aboard lutin:


m/v lutin is a 46' grand banks based in france. 
                  she's a beauty.


 








 
phone coverage 
              varies by area. what works where i am may be a terrible choice in 
              your location. it is important to determine which company 
              provides the best service where you are located. 


cell phone  providers are similar to bottom 
                paint options. for boaters, every area has different needs. fresh water, 
                brackish, and salt water all have distinct requirements. 
                choosing the bottom paint for your boat may indeed differ from 
                my preference. quite frankly, opting for what the boatyard 
                suggests is most likely your best choice. more on that and a 
                new-to-me boatyard in an 
                upcoming article...


after shattering the screen on my old iphone, baby sent 
          
          me a new one. 
            now i have a spiffy iphone11. (whoo-hoo!) 



the iphone11 in a lilac (pale purple) case is much 
          larger than the one i broke. baby even bought me a brand new cell 
          phone case. i am blessed.

i am grateful more than i can say for 
          the spiffy new phone. because i knew baby's number, i was able to 
          contact her after shattering my original iphone7. unlike decades ago 
          however, i had not memorized anyone else's number. therefore, once i 
          had the new phone in hand i wrote the numbers that remained into my 
          address book. i did lose many numbers however...
 


lesson 
          learned: have a hard copy of important phone numbers. 



          but this is just one lesson, and there was another... that tale will 
          be posted tomorrow. thank you for reading.

      oh, a wondrous bird is the pelican!
      his bill holds more than his belican.
      he can take in his beak enough food for a week.
      but i'm darned if i know how the helican.

the writer's block
it's my belief that other folks who 
        boat are some of the most interesting in the world. inside every boater 
        is a story. let yours out! i'd love to post short stories, vignettes, or 
        even longer articles that focus on some aspect of our life on or near 
        the water. suggested topics include:

1. i remember when...
          2. my first boat
          3. who inspired you to be a boater?
          4. fishing trips or tricks
          5. or another subject of your choosing
for the novice, here's how to write: simply pretend 
          you're sending a letter to a friend. tell about an event or a memory 
          from years ago that you still recall.

life has changed so much on the 
        water since i was born aboard. personally i'd love to hear your memories 
        of life when you were younger. boats were smaller, narrower, and much 
        slower. kids were kids and our families often shaped the adult we have 
        become. here are my two aboard the tow boat my dad ran for a time:
 



        your pictures would be wonderful too. i posted one of
        
        boot key harbor taken in 2001 that has gotten quite a few downloads 
        and really, that's not so terribly long ago... do you have any photos to 
        share? 
        
        email me.
 

do you want to help 
        out?
 
often an article for the website 
        will be completely written yet lack photographs. i like pictures and am 
        looking for some for up-coming pieces: 


pets afloat (include pet and boat 
        name please)


any picture of boats underway or at 
        anchor


photos of people enjoying life in 
        or on the water


size: a minimum of 1000 pixels 
        across please. if that doesn't make sense think bigger versus resized 
        for emailing. i prefer the full-size version. also, the name you'd 
        like me to use when i add the copyright stuff to your picture. and 
        thanks bunches! 
my email address is

thanks for visiting. if you happen to see my boat along the 
      waterways, 
      give a call on channel 16. i'm always listening.

my home is not fancy by any means, however you cannot imagine how 
        wonderful it is to come back to her after an expedition on shore.  

if i can live this life, why not you too?

      extraordinaire




aphorism alert: begin doing what you want to now. we 
      have only this moment, sparkling like a star in our
      hand, and melting like a snowflake. marie beyon ray.
