artist karen latham
exploring nature has always been a big part of my life. hiking, camping, canoeing, fishing, and sometimes just taking jaunts through natural areas by myself to explore are my most treasured memories. being given the ability as an artist to capture it all and bring it to life in paint is just icing on the cake.
