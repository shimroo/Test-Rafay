the old year as died, sent off to the heavens in an explosion of world-wide fire, color, and noise.
those same celebrations brought forth a new year for us to enjoy.
may this one be filled with mirth and joy, a wealth of cheer, and good times for all.



mod db announces mod of the year 2018
posted by terikel706 on december 28, 2018
december 29th, 2018 – this year saw many compelling entries however in the end it was fallout: new california that took out 1st place, followed closely by the popular warsword conquest and half-life: echoes taking out 2nd and 3rd respectively.
we believe that modding is going to play an increasingly important role in shaping the future of gaming, as new content and creativity is key to engaged and happy players. this is evidenced by the winners below, who have pushed boundaries and made something amazing on top of the games that they modded. the final top 10 includes:
10. total chaos
9. s.t.a.l.k.e.r anomaly
8. battlefront ultimate commander
7. awakening of the rebellion
6. contra
5. prophesy of pendor
4. thrawn’s revenge: imperial civil war
3. half-life: echoes
2. warsword conquest
1. fallout: new california
huge thanks to all modders and supporters of the awards who recognize the work these developers dedicate to their craft, read the full results, the editors choice and best upcoming.
so, none for our beloved game. maybe there is hope next year.
a wonderful 2019 to all.



happy 2018!

thanks to hannibal for the new article.



rome in multiplayer
posted by terikel706 on march 27, 2016
kimjongli writes here a solid article on how to get the most out of the roman factions online, playing multi-player. what units work best, which do not work at all, which are wastes of denarii and which provide value above and beyond. also how to set up your armies to take advantage of these strengths, minimize your weaknesses, and kick ass all voer the grassy flats.
you can leave your comments and praise on the  discussion thread.
