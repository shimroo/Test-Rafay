 levitation 
                          is a phenomenon of psychokinesis (pk) in which objects, 
                          people, and animals are lifted into the air without any 
                          visibly physical means and float or fly about. the phenomenon 
                          has been said to have occurred in mediumship, shamanism, 
                            trances, mystical rapture, and demonic 
                              possession. 
                                some cases of levitation appear to be spontaneous, while 
                                spiritual or magical adepts are said to be able to control 
                                it consciously.

there 
                                    are two methods to levitate. the first is to attempt to 
                                    really levitate... generally you sit cross-legged and meditate and this causes you to levitate (supposedly). the second method is to create the illusion 
                              that you are levitating... this is what we are going to 
                              deal with
