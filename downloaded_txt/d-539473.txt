                    music is an ancient way to alter our consciousness and communicate
                    with all our relations. it is used for meditation, healing, and
                    therapy. the flute is always a spiritual experience for both
                    me, the maker, and you the player. the flute is more than a wooden
                    musical instrument. to play the flute, you must breathe with
                    the flute. i've had people say it's just like yoga. i am honored
                    that my path has led me to be a maker of these wonderful instruments.
                    i would love the opportunity to create a flute for you. 

about my introduction
                    to making flutes

i am
                    a native virginian. i was adopted at birth.i always felt like
                    i didn't quite fit in. i turned to music at an early age. i began
                    playing bass, guitar, and harmonica. i played on the road, nationally
                    throughout the us during the 70's. i have always had a passion
                    for working with wood. i've built custom cabinets, collapsible
                    drum stages and speaker cabinets.
in the late 1990's-2000,
                    my wife and i had a band here in missouri. my oldest son, (jeremy),
                    joined our band and we were ready to go back on the road again
                    with our music. then tragedy struck , jeremy's son, lucas, was
                    diagnosed with leukemia. life stopped. we put everything on hold
                    and waited. we were blessed with a miracle. we found out that
                    jeremy's second son, andrew, was a perfect match, as a bone marrow
                    donor. because of that, lucas is living a normal life today.
during this time,
                    jeremy quite the band and we still had band contracts to fill.
                    numerous personnel changes in the band led us to a guitar player
                    by the name of steve bartha. the second band practice, he brought
                    his native american flutes with him. for me, it was love at first
                    sound. i knew this was my calling. it was a perfect match between
                    my musical gift and my wood working gift. this changed our life
                    course, forever. i became consumed with the passion to build
                    these amazing instruments. i would come home from work, every
                    night and build flutes in our garage. by september of 2001, i
                    quite my day job and we have been making flutes full-time ever
                    since. from our home and workshop in the peaceful woods by the
                    spectacular stockton lake in missouri, we make and sell flutes
                    all over the world."
this week, april
                    2017, our friend steve bartha, passed away (way too young, in
                    my opinion). below are links to steve's song. he created it,
                    he played, and he traded it to us for a flute. the title is:
                    "the forest dance".

                        is playing a large drone
                        flute
                        made from zebrawood. drones are flutes that have two voices.
                        you play your melody and the second voice accompanies you producing
                        a surreal experience.

                    greetings from lisa fretwell

my two greatest
                        joys are: teaching someone to play flute and knowing that my
                        music has touched someone.

                        whether you play native american flute or listen to the flute,
                        my goal is to have you experience flying. for me, playing the
                        flute lets me fly. listen to our recent cd entitled glidin'
                        in the updraft and you'll feel what i mean by flying. 

                        music has played a tremendous role all throughout my life. all
                        of my memories are attached to whatever song i was listening
                        to at the time. the songs i write are inspired by my personal
                        experiences. for instance: myanmar terra, off of our 3rd cd was
                        written because of the way i felt when viewing the video's of
                        the devastation in myanmar(burma).

                        my grandfather was adopted into the assiniboin tribe, but i am
                        not a member of a federally-recognized tribe. 

                        dream big, live fully,

the native american
            flute is the only melodic wind instrument belonging to the people
            of this continent and the only instrument indigenous exclusively
            to the united states.
the native american
            flute, while not common among all nations, did indeed stretch
            from the west to the east. “indian love flutes” have
            always been an important part of native american culture. 

            indian flutes are known for being made from aromatic cedar and
            other woods indigenous to the area that they were made in.
