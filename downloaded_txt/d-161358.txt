cwda 2025 state budget

update #1 - governor’s proposed 2025-26 budget




  overall budget picture


  california’s overall economic picture has performed better than
  projected compared to the 2024 budget act. the
  stronger-than-anticipated performance of the economy, stock
  market, and cash receipts, combined with an improved economic
  outlook, have all contributed to an upgraded revenue forecast,
  with general fund (gf) revenues coming in higher by approximately
  $16.5 billion in the three-year period of 2023-24, 2024-25, and
  2025-26, and with the state having a modest surplus of $363
  million.

california needs to step up its support of our most vulnerable kids & families




  in california, at any given time, about 55,000 children are
  living in foster care – young people for whom the state of
  california has legally taken on parental
  responsibility. child welfare services, including foster
  care, is run by counties in california, with state oversight.
  though counties run the system on the ground, state leadership is
  essential to ensuring children and families have access to
  resources and supportive services to help them avoid abuse and
  neglect, overcome trauma, and move forward in a healthy
  way.
