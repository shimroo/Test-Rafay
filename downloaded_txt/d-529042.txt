rust belt of america and the global automotive industrial movement



i hope to get tier suppliers candid input on this blog. this is your place to vent openly yet remain hidden.

i will try to keep up with the news and keep adding new links and information. i hope to create a center for automotive suppliers to find and post ideas comments and suggestions.

i would like to ask visitors to post feelings on supplier containment and inspection, i wonder how the tier's react to high bills and extended containment activities.

automakers embrace fuel deal





by justin hyde • free press washington staff • may 19, 2009 washington – president barack obama announced a historic compromise on tough fuel economy rules among automakers, environmentalists and government agencies, saying a standard of 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016 was a “harbinger of a change in the way business is done in washington.”advertisementthe pact, hammered out just last weekend, was embraced by detroit and foreign automakers for granting them national targets for the next eight years, rather than setting short-term goals. california, the nation’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, will defer its rules through 2016 in return for federal rules that match its goals.

lower tier auto suppliers lobby for federal aid





metals casting and forgings plants may be shut without governments helpby tom stundza -- purchasing, 5/14/2009 11:32:00 amlower-tier automotive suppliers are saying the $5 billion in federal aid promised to the tier one suppliers won’t find its way down to them and are in washington this week requesting their own aid package.the tier two and three auto suppliers say aid from the existing federal program, reported in march by purchasing.com,  is going to top suppliers and hasn't filtered through to them--the firms that make carburetors, tire rubber, hinges, fasteners and metal and plastics components. and with the financial troubles at chrysler and general motors continuing, more of these lower-tier suppliers are in jeopardy of closing, which could put additional stress on the u.s. automotive supply chain.

bankruptcy boom skips detroit





detroit court trying hard to competeby brent snavely • free press business writer • may 18, 2009 detroit can't even realize the economic benefits to be had from the bankruptcies of its largest companies.advertisementthe headquarters for chrysler and general motors might be in michigan, but when chrysler filed for bankruptcy, it did so in new york.if gm files -- as is expected -- the automaker likely will follow chrysler's lead, despite state attorney general mike cox having asked both gm and chrysler to file here. gm's lawyers are based in new york, and the court there is moving chrysler's case along quickly.that means detroit's law firms, hotels and restaurants would lose out on millions of dollars again. large bankruptcy cases generate huge fees for legal and advisory firms; that money often finds its way to hotels, restaurants and legal support firms.
