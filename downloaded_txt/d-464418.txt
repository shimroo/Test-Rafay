about flowers on the vineyard
flowers on the vineyard has over 30 years of experience growing and arranging flowers that flatter, charm, and inspire on the island of martha's vineyard.  louise sweet, both owner and designer, knows the power and poetry of fresh flowers.  she and her team strive to create a special ambiance for any occasion, in any season, making sure each and every event is uniquely styled and reflects each client's taste, aesthetic and circumstance - from barefoot on the beach, to farm & field casual, to gown & tux over the top elegance.



the experience


the flower barn
our flowers come from louise's own gardens or from local growers on the vineyard and at the weekly farmer's markets, or are shipped in from larger farms and growers elsewhere. we prefer to work in season and in harmony with the vineyard's natural beauty and find it endlessly inspirational! our favorite blooms include island wild flowers, heirloom roses, hydrangeas, garden roses, peonies, dahlias, lilies, larkspurs, freesias, phlox, trellis roses, tulips, delphiniums, lysiaâ¬â¬â¬nthas, cosmos, herbs, grasses, clematis, seasonal berries, budding branches and just about anything else that can be gathered to add just the right texture and color to your own personal flower list, coloâ¬r pallet & style menu.
please check out our flower menu to browse some of our collection.

louise sweet
no one understands the mysterious allure of flowers better than louise. she oversees every aspect of flowers on the vineyard from the styling studio in her home and the flower barn just a few steps away.  her beautiful property is situated in lower makonikey and is fully surrounded by gardens that she lovingly designs and tends.  she meets with you and then conjures up and creates your vision with an attention to detail that moves beyond floral design and into crafting a look for each vineyard setting or place.  louise is not, as she likes to put it, just a florist. she is a facilitator of style and ambiance in any given space.  she lets your event reflect who you are and what you love most about this amazing & beautiful island.
please check out our photo galleries for a variety of examples, either by featured events we've worked on or by flower arrangement.
