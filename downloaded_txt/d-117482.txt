community
you are not alone.we are the largest organization of pro-life obstetricians and gynecologists in the world. we know what it is like to practice good medicine in a hostile academic environment. we understand the need for absolutely accurate and scientifically irrefutable information. we are committed to serving you.we strive to provide you with a network of prolife physicians for mentoring and support and communication, and within that network to be able to mentor the next generation of pro-life physicians.we want to make available to you the most accurate, up to date information on the effects of abortion on women, so that you will have an evidence-based response to the pressures to endorse abortion.students & residentscheck out our mission statement.and join us.
education
evidence based education.in the published medical literature, there is ample evidence of the effects of abortion on women. abortion increases preterm birth in subsequent pregnancies, increases a woman’s risk of suicide, substance abuse, major depression and all cause mortality, and increases a woman’s risk of breast cancer if aborting prior to her first full term pregnancy. yet, many medical organizations are so politically invested in the abortion agenda that this information is not readily available to physicians or patients.aaplog works to make available to physicians and patients the effects of abortion on women as evidenced in the peer-reviewed medical literature. the aaplog annual matthew bulfin educational meeting provides a forum for pro-life medical experts to discuss the latest and most important information on prolife topics, and has offered 8 credits of cme. these lectures are archived and available to members on the aaplog website.members can also avail themselves of prepared cme lectures on a variety of prolife topics, to equip members to be able to speak out professionally on a variety of topics including abortion complications, maternal mortality, abortion and preterm birth etc.check out our mission statement.and join us.
politics
a voice for the silentas hippocratic physicians, we are responsible to protect both the mother and her unborn child from fertilization until natural death. as hippocratic physicians we have a unique professional responsibility to publically speak for the weakest and most defenseless of the human race: the unborn child. aaplog takes that professional responsibility seriously.as a non-profit educational organization, aaplog members participate in the public defense of human life from fertilization until natural death, by supplying accurate information from the peer-reviewed medical literature, especially in public forums where accurate information is often grossly lacking. aaplog is frequently called on by lawmakers and the media to give a professional pro-life perspective on current legislation, new research or breaking events.come join us.
law
a defense for the helpless.the current laws in our nation do not defend the most helpless of human beings. aaplog works with many local, state and national legislators, legal organizations and policy makers in the united states who work to defend these tiniest of humans in law. aaplog members provide the professional pro-life expert opinions needed to defend these laws.aaplog also networks with pro-life medical colleagues internationally to equip them to provide the evidence-based expert testimony required to defend human life.join us.
