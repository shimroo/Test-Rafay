discover how to build naturally

 



freedom off the grid!








taking you to the front lines
pick your area of interest.






 build your dream home
we focus on building homes as close to entirely out of renewable materials as possible. making it affordable is also critical. so from tiny, to small and medium homes you can build yourself out of natural materials is what we are all about.




 experience nature
getting back in touch with nature, learning about regenerative techniques for growing, and much more, we incorporate nature into everything we do every day as much as possible.




 going places
lots of options exist for how we get around. of course the best way is to walk. but, if you need to travel far, then other options like bikes, skateboards, evehicles, and ev’s are all other options that we consider.
