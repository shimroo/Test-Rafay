geni 
  — linking renewable energy resources around the world
the 
    geni initiative focuses on linking renewable energy resources around the world 
    using international electricity transmission. decades ago, visionary engineer 
    dr. r. buckminster fuller developed the world game simulation, posing the question:how 
      do we make the world work for 100% of humanity in the shortest possible time through 
      spontaneous cooperation without ecological damage or disadvantage to anyone?research 
        shows that the premier global strategy is the interconnection of electric power 
        networks between regions and continents into a global energy grid, with an emphasis 
        on tapping abundant renewable energy resources — a world wide web of electricity.
