old town madrid tapas & wine tour






join a member of the spanish wine tasting association and other english speakers (mainly couples👫) on a tour of madrid’s oldest neighborhood. we will visit my favorite establishments, taste their specialties and drink unique wines from my own cellar🍾

• tv appeareances:

 
• 80€ all included, enough food for dinner☑️ • small groups, not touristy at all☑️
• reviews:  tripadvisor☑️
this is what my tour looks like (if you are not too keen on any of the dishes, i always have a plan b):
1) tour begins in the most popular tavern in old madrid sipping on the aperitif of the city, vermouth on tap🍸 which we will pair with olives and breathtaking croquetas.
2) next, i’ll whisk you off to madrid’s most beautiful wine bar where we will drink spain’s finest white wine: albariño. we will take advantage of the opportunity to taste a special type of tapas called “tostas”.
3) it is now time to go deeper into old madrid through its narrow cobblestone streets and make our way to the highest rated restaurant in the neigborhood.
we will sit down to cook the famous presa iberica on ceramic red hot plates.





4) now it is perfect time to begin with the reds🍷 i ll uncork different wines from my own cellar. i open outstanding wines such as viña arana gran reserva 2015 (rioja). write to me if you want to know exactly what wines i will open on a particular day.
5) to round off the night we will taste the king of all spanish dessert wines: pedro ximenez. the wine will perform a miracle by turning vanilla ice-cream into rum & raisins with a caramel note and a toffee finish. i cannot tell you the brand we will have because it has taken me 20 years to find it.
