from the headmaster
breaking down stereotypes
an all-boys education provides the opportunity to cast away community stereotypes, foster creativity and build a culture of respect. at st peter’s college we aim to normalise all the right behaviours allowing the 'strong and lovely' to shine through in all endeavours.
- tim browning, headmaster

i wouldn’t be who i am today without spsc
i started at spsc in year 5 shortly after being diagnosed with dyslexia. i struggled with my school work and interpreting people’s expectations of me. with academic and social support from my teachers and mentors, i overcame these obstacles and graduated with an atar of 94. spsc helped me lay the foundations to be the best version of myself, and for this, i am forever grateful.
 - sebastian (hwd 2023)









the community is so passionate and engaged
it is a genuine privilege for our family to be a part of the spsc community. everyone is so passionate and engaged with helping our boys to learn, grow and develop to the best of their ability. within this warm, vibrant community there are many opportunities for interaction with other families, many of whom have become wonderful friends.
- annie, mother of oliver, jack, tommy and edward









the house system helps me feel like i belong
one of the great things about spsc is the house and mentor system. it helps me feel like i belong. we form a meaningful relationship with our mentor over a number of years and create bonds with boys from other year levels in our house. i’ve found this helpful when i have questions about the years ahead, but what i like most about it is that it makes me feel connected across the whole school and not just my year level.
 - lenny, year 10 2024









a warm, welcoming environment
the boarding house provides a warm, welcoming environment where you live with your mates and meet people you may not typically encounter otherwise. i have boarded for the past two years;  during this time the supportive staff have helped me push myself to grow academically and personally by becoming more independent and self-disciplined.

- henry, year 11 2024
