mandarin immersion


maryknoll’s mandarin immersion program, the first in hawaii to take place during the school day, gives students the opportunity to receive daily instruction in core subjects using a 50/50 model, 50% of each day in mandarin and 50% in english. in addition to developing proficiency in a second language, research shows that immersion students achieve the same levels of competence, or better, in academic subjects including english, in addition to many cognitive benefits. 
immersion integrates language and content and is based on the principle that language is acquired most effectively when learned in a meaningful social context. the school curriculum provides a natural basis for second language learning.

higher education in an innovative way

through an exciting partnership with hawai‘i pacific university (hpu), maryknoll high school juniors and seniors have the option of taking courses at hpu for dual credit at no additional tuition cost.
 
students who complete sufficient credits may even earn an hpu associate of arts degree at the same time as their maryknoll high school diploma, potentially resulting in significant savings of up to two years' worth of time and undergraduate tuition.

pre-kindergarten

the year before kindergarten is a time of tremendous growth. as a parent, you want your child to enjoy this stage while building the right skills for the steps ahead.our program provides opportunities for each child to cultivate knowledge, self-discipline, creativity, and spiritual and physical growth. we believe in creating a warm and loving environment where children can learn about themselves, gain an understanding of others and develop strong self-esteem.
