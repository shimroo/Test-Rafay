what our customers say 


















 






the danish course is well structured and perfect for a (german) beginner. the separate pronunciation samples that can be played at different speed and one by one work much better than any cd-based course. the website is well designed and easy to use. very kind and quick personal service!

absolutely amazing. this tool is very helpful, and just one of a kind; simply unique from other language learning sites and apps. it is independent on its own, but perfectly compliments other language learning methods. it's a very informative and practical site to learn danish. to the one(s) behind this, tak skal du have! <3
