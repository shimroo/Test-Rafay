vibrant, sustainable developments shape the vision and future framework of a successful and active community.
we offer comprehensive land planning, design and development services to make such places possible. our collaborative approach focuses on uncovering strategies to realize the full potential of a development project, whether it’s an entire region or a single city block. working with owners and key stakeholders, we help guide development and investment decisions to revitalize districts and corridors using achievable and proven implementation tactics.
our projects span the full spectrum of land development — from infill redevelopment, mixed-use development and community infrastructure to urban revitalization and transit-oriented development. our clients include regional planning councils, economic development agencies, redevelopment authorities, municipalities, health care providers, learning institutions, corporations and developers.
dynamic & pragmatic
we build our multidisciplinary teams to match the needs of your project. beyond our core disciplines, we integrate scientists, analysts, economists, public engagement and strategists, to streamline project development and delivery. taking a holistic approach means planning high-performance places at the same time we’re engineering smart infrastructure — forming an unshakeable foundation for growth and stability.
