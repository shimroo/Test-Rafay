introducing pi

math


pi is an important number in mathematics. it is also a difficult concept for students when it is first introduced. pi = 3.14… approximately, but that is not quite right.  pi = 3.14159… approximately, but that is not quite right either.  pi = 22/7 but that is an approximation too.  pi has been computed out to millions of digits, but the result is still an approximation.

connect your family with games

history, homeschooling with games


many families now have more t.v. sets than people. add to that the array of smart phones, computers and electronic game devices owned by most families and you get a recipe for family disconnection.  one of the best advantages of homeschooling is family time together, but if we squander too much of that time in our separate electronic worlds, we lose a precious treasure forever. time lost can never be regained and children are soon grown and gone.
