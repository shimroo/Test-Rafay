a surprise e-mail from the uk





 long time no heard, but i had an email in from black ice in uk, no it wasn't any more exciting shots at torture garden or some obscure fashion magazine he acquired. nope it was a link to a kumguri site that has it all!!!the main site is https://www.kigcos.com/and the bodysuits are here!!!!i'm making as wish list already and the head to toe latex, molded mask and hair is identical to the statue permanent ones at the  xxx sss who'd thought that one could so perfectly mimic as second life look. cross promotion and marketing?more later once i've wrapped my head around it. like how about zentai suits based on theiry muglers gynoid or maria from metropolis?i think we could inspire and fuel (bulk buy) the robots, dolls, mannequins we'd love to  realise?

if your jonsing for fetish images try - deviant art 





and more specifically mine an others collections. mine is right here  i don't love all the images in my collection. sometimes in an element, and idea, or erase all the text completely and rewrite it. the above as you can tell is a cut off of a caption. wasn't keen on the text but loved the image. something there that needs a storyxx

its been awhile





so sorry but i continue to have medical issues. so lack of postings as i have to have a clear head - also just sleeping way to much.in the meantime have a look at asmr videos on yt- i'll post some interesting doll ones later. here's one that has a range of fantasy; some are just direct videos, other have plot, costumes and characters. i can't be everywhere so please post ones you find that work for you. prefer robots, dolls and mannequins (what a surprise)also there are websites and apps that download the vidoes so you can watch on phone etc. also strip the audio out. i use iskysoft video coverter ultinmate btw. share your finds, and i'll get onto my short list. so far none have replied to my offer to help with plots etc. perhaps we can push/ inspire together?xx

and cute but creepy goth doll?





so there's a seed of an idea there for a story. goth lolita, tricks you and stuck in her house on halloween. only to be made over by her into her clone. its a spell and it has to be fullfilled and replaced for her to escape.xx
