a few totally gay questions

state representative steve harrelson’s “under the dome” blog raises some excellent questions about the arkansas family council’s proposed initiated act to prohibit homosexuals from adopting or being foster parents. he uses the arrest of idaho senator larry craig as a basis for his inquiry. as you know, craig was arrested and entered a guilty plea on misdemeanor public indecency charges stemming from an incident in a minneapolis airport men’s room. riddle me this one, family council. under the law you are asking voters to adopt, is craig qualified to foster or adopt? does the guilty plea equal an admission? it is a substantial question because craig denies being gay. does a single act qualify? what if somebody says they are not gay any more? there are so many other little complexities to this proposal, and they demand an answer. what about unrelated people of the same sex living in the same residence? are they presumed to be homosexuals? can homosexuality be reversed, and, if so, under what conditions? one presumes the department of human services will have to enforce the law if it passes and they will need guidance. the voters will need some help as well.

what to do about iraq

while trying to save himself this morning on kark tv channel 4's wednesday wake-up, republican consultant and strategist bill vickery gained a momentary victory by asking what democrats would do about iraq.of course, no democrat got us into the war and, last time i checked, it is a republican who is commander-in-chief. don't they even believe in personal accountability?anyway, i was researching another story when i came across a little story about democratic presidential candidate joe biden. here is what he has to say.his plan for withdrawal calls for unifying iraq by establishing autonomous regions for the kurds, shiites and sunnis with a central government that controls border security and distribution of oil revenues on a per capita basis.second, his plan includes securing sunni support by guaranteeing them a proportionate share of oil revenues, putting baathists back to work and re-integrating those with no blood on their hands.third, his plan calls for increasing economic aid by tapping the oil-rich arab gulf states. biden also proposes convening a regional conference to enlist the support of iraq's neighbors and create a contact group of major world powers to enforce their commitments.finally, his plan includes withdrawing u.s. troops from iraq by 2008, which would allow time for the political settlement to take effect. in turn, a small residual force would be left solely for counter-terrorism and training.of the 27 million people in iraq, about 4.2 million have self-cleansed, 2 million have left the country and 2.1 million have been displaced internally, according to biden.

arkansans increase amtrak revenue

if you missed it, my friend, dr. bill pollard from conway, got his picture on the front page of yesterday’s arkansas democrat-gazette. pollard is part of a volunteer team that has, for the past nine years, been successfully managing the sleeping car and coach inventory on amtrak. they manage the price charged for tickets based on availability. airlines do a similar thing. this group also talks with train crews and helps them identify regular travelers, especially between st. louis and chicago, and target them to buy unused sleeping car rooms as office space. since that is a short trip and the same room is sold later at night, when the business traveler is gone, it increases revenue. it looks like this little hobby has brought revenue up for the eagle, which passes through arkansas once daily northbound and southbound. why does every long distance train not have a marketing expert devoted to increased revenue production? the reason is that airline and highway interests want amtrak service snuffed out anywhere it is not already booming. that is the other dirty little secret. in the northeast, where there are modern fast trains on convenient schedules, rail travel is thriving. around the world, many countries have trains going at over 200 mph.

larry craig

we are not supposed to gloat over our adversaries’ problems, so let us consider soberly the case of republican senator larry craig of idaho. he was arrested on a misdemeanor charge arising out of lewd conduct in a minneapolis airport men’s room. apparently some vice cop became suspicious about the foot tapping coming from the honorable gentleman’s stall. the first reaction, of course, is “good grief!” surely such a powerful and wealthy man could find some other outlet for his sexual desires than such a public and humiliating venue. the crime is an offense against his office and the institution of the senate. and, just in case you are about to ask, yes i would apply the same standard in other high-profile cases, although an office is not quite as public as a restroom. the folks back home in idaho will remember how much he denounced homosexuals and espoused “family values.” who knows? maybe he is a compassionate conservative, although i doubt it. apparently rumors about senator craig have been floating around for some time, so perhaps he just wanted to get caught. surely a smart guy like this must know that cops patrol airport restrooms. the genius of our system has a method to handle things like this known as elections.

education investment pays off

here is something mike huckabee should be telling the club for growth. this is real growth, not just increased greedy gain for a favored few.state’s public school students strenghthen showing on ap exams, hold steady on satarkansas’ public school students once again posted gains in terms of participation and performance on advanced placement (ap) exams in 2007 and maintained sat scores that are above the national average, according to information released tuesday by the college board.“last year we were named ‘the arkansas model’ for other states to emulate in terms of our policies encouraging participation in advanced placement courses,” dr. james said, “so it is wonderful news to hear that both participation rates and exam scores remain on the rise.”in 2007, 16,013 public school students took ap exams, representing a 6.4 percent increase over the 15,054 students who took the exams the previous year. what’s more, there was an 8.8 percent increase in the number of exam scores of 3 or higher from last year for public school students. on ap exams, a 3 is “qualified,” a 4 is “well qualified,” and a 5 is “extremely well qualified.”"it is impressive to see the increase in the number of students who score well on the ap exam," said dr. steve floyd, interim director of the department of higher education. "this means there are more high school students who are earning college credit and preparing themselves well for postsecondary education. good preparation in high school will contribute to higher graduation rates from college."as of the 2009-2010 school year, all high schools in the state will be required to offer an advanced placement course or its equivalent in each of the four core areas of english, mathematics, science and social studies. the state also began paying for students taking ap exams in may 2005. both of these pieces of legislation have garnered national praise for arkansas because of the increased access they gave public school students to rigorous course work.“we know from research that anytime students take ap courses, they are greatly increasing their chances of finishing college in five years or less,” dr. james said. arkansas public school students did not completely mirror the scoring trend found nationwide on the sat reasoning test, which incorporates critical reading, math and writing portions:·         the state’s public school students’ mean score in critical reading increased by 2 points to 579, as compared to a one point drop in scores nationally to 502.·         the state’s public school students’ mean score in math remained at 571 as compared to a three point drop in scores nationally to 515.·         the state’s public school students’ mean score in writing fell one point to 567 as compared to a three point drop in scores nationally to 494.the state had 1,044 students taking the sat in 2007, a 3.6 decrease in the number of test-takers in 2006.of the public school students taking the sat, 87.2 percent enrolled in colleges, according to the college board, and two-thirds of those attended arkansas schools. the three colleges and universities in arkansas receiving the most sat scores from arkansas test-takers were the university of arkansas at fayetteville, the university of central arkansas and hendrix college.
