new beginnings












this video was taken from the hospital bed. the girls had just come in to meet their brother for the first time. maddy was a little timid to hold him, but jordan couldn't wait! her smile says it all :)

miley cyrus at last







we counted down from 130 days and last night, we finally were able to go to the miley cyrus concert. needless to say, the girls were super excited for her to come out. here's the big moment from the concert when she came out on stage.

she had me at hello







yesterday, i went to have lunch with maddy at her preschool. the kids and teachers had prepared a special lunch for all the moms in honor of mothers day. they had worked on preparing for it all week and the best part was when they sang a couple of songs for us at the end.
