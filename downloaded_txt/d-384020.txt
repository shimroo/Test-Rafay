		(note: cleared readers 
		only, please.)
in the intelligence community, ‘bang and burn’ 
		doesn’t only refer to paramilitary ops.

● obtaining an 
		operational approval will tend to involve more operatives than the 
		operation being approved.

●
		last night i finally achieved 
		multiple orgasms. next year i’m going for number three.

● the needs of 
		the larry and curly outweigh the needs of the moe.

● you only live 
		√–once.

● spookspeak. negative control 
		n. 
		the use of blackmail against an intelligence asset. (see: positive 
		control n. the offer not to use negative control.)
● i need an emotional support animal – but a 
		different animal for each emotion.
● i’ve said it before, and i’ll say it again – 
		at least until someone comes up with an alternative neuter singular 
		pronoun for the nominative and accusative cases.
● die or get rich tryin’.

the mightiest 
		of weapons is truth. and everyone knows you’re 
		not permitted to bring a weapon into a government building.
● never lie on a polygraph. the needles get all 
		bent, and then they ask you even more questions.
● you say ‘cosplay convention’ like there’s 
		some other kind.
● the 
		super bowl has become so commercialized, its religious meaning is in 
		danger of being lost completely.
● [alien visiting our planet]: tell me more 
		about this ‘wiggle room.’
