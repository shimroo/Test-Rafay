            when our elderly garage door went off the track, door systems promptly sent a repair technician who provided a temporary repair but warned that the rust at the connecting points of the springs endangered a failure.  the salesman, hank, came out and was extremely helpful in explaining our options, providing quotes for various replacement doors, and ordering our selection.  the new door was expertly installed by john, who was very expert and answered all of our questions.

            unfortunately, the sales advisor recommended a solution for our broken garage door that was not correct. when the installer arrived weeks later, we discovered that it would not be possible to fix our broken door with the proposed solution. this led to an additional 6-8 week delay while awaiting new parts. to make matters worse, we ended up initially being charged additional cost to address this error by the sales advisor. throughout the whole process communication was poor.
          




good job!
