beautiful afghan!





what a beautiful afghan.  i am in the beginning stages of planning my great american afghan.  i just love the color you've used.  i too wanted a variation from the basic natural color, which is very beautiful too, but i am a color person.  i too will combine the aran and the the great american afghan design.could i ask you what color you used, you mentioned a green heather.  i am curious because your photo looks like a camel color.new to the great american aran afghan blog and love planning my new afghan project and soon will be starting mine.

i'm all done!!





wow!  it's been 2 years - but the afghan is completed, sewn together, and has it's edging.  all ready for use.  what a wonderful adventure in knitting these years have been; i've learned a lot, and grown in self-confidence as well.i made my afghan huge.  it is 6 squares by 5 squares, for a total of 30 different squares.  most come from the great american aran afghan book, but some come from the great american afghan book.  the edging went on perfectly; didn't have to finesse a thing.the color is green heather, and some squares have some touches of white.  a few of the 2-color squares made me a bit unhappy, but i wasn't about to do them over!  i especially love the 2-color squares with the trees, and the one with the flower buds.now...what to do next??

i finished my last square!





wow!  i combined the great american afghan and great american aran afghan, and finally, after two years, completed 30 squares - it's really big.  blocking took a really long time - some of them were much smaller than they should have been, and some were at quite a rakish angle.i spent last night basting the squares together, and will begin the actual sewing today.  they actually seemed to fit together pretty well when basted, so i'm hopeful the afghan will look as it should.  of course, the border will probably take another month or so, but it would be really cool if i could give myself the afghan for christmas.

hello,i´m reni from austria, 40 years old, three sons. i´ve been knitting a lot when i was younger, but mostly cardigans, pullovers etc. now i began again - and i am totally addicted to do lace and - the gaaa. i fell in love with it when i saw it the first time.a few days ago i finally got my yarn - cascade 220 - and today i had some free minutes to start the first square. i choosed hanna burns because it was told to be one of the easiest. ujujujuj - i wonder how the more difficult squares will be???i succeeded to do 11 rows today, and my fingers are nearly broken. i´m afraid how the other squares will be? and wonder if i will ever succeed to finish the afghan :((however, it is a great fun to knit the pattern!! and the wool is perfect.so i hope to hear from you and not to desperate with my aran!!greetings from austriareni

introducing myself :)





hello :)
my name is gabi, and i'm living in australia with my husband, 2 daughters and couple of critters. recently i picked up my knitting needles again after long long years of not knitting to start this afghan. fell totally in love with this aran afghan when seeing some fellow stitchers starting it.
and i deeply enjoy knitting these squares. my plan is to knit all 24 squares of the book. 
the wool i chose is called luxury from the bendigo woollen mills - a soft pure wool.



3 squares are already done: ginette belanger, barbara selesnick and hanna burns.
