all that drama for 1%?



from the sacramento bee: 

since 1976, the sacramento housing market has experienced three 
distinct booms and busts. each was longer and more dramatic than the one
 preceding it, according to a bee review of data from the federal 
housing finance agency.

in the first boom, from 1976 to 1981, 
inflation-adjusted sacramento home prices shot up by 37 percent, more 
than twice the national average, before falling by 15 percent, about the
 same as the rest of the nation.  in the boom that lasted from 1984
 to 1990, home prices rose by 48 percent, after adjusting for inflation,
 while rising 12 percent nationwide. during the next seven years, 
sacramento prices fell by 29 percent, compared to a 5 percent fall 
nationally.

the most recent boom ran from 1997 to 2006. it was the longest and the most extreme.  spurred
 by easy credit and subprime lending, sacramento home prices soared 135 
percent after being adjusted for inflation, compared to a 50 percent 
increase nationwide. so far during the bust, home prices here have 
fallen 53 percent. the average drop across the united states has been 
about 25 percent. 

the net result of all the ups and downs: 
sacramento home prices grew by just 33 percent during the past 35 years,
 after adjusting for inflation, for a relatively mundane growth rate of 
about 1 percent each year.
