well it started by watching that 70s show, which after 20 years still rocks.

i tried watching cheers, it's just not funny anymore.

they really don't make good sitcoms anymore, i must say, about to give up on watching american sitcom until i watched the ranch.

this one gets a triple a rating from me, compared to the rest of 30 minutes horse shit that tried to pass off as sitcom. more like shitcom to me.

it also stars once upon a time to die for the girl next door, elisha cuthbert.

the punisher





i started watching daredevil, i continued watching cause i wanted to see how he progress into his daredevil costume, other than running around with his child like cap.

of course i also like to see karen getting bone, then frank appeared, then i started watching the punisher and stopped watching daredevil.

in short daredevil is a little kid with some amateur kung-fu skills and won't kill anyone, he rather beat the bad guys senseless and still risk the chance of getting shot from the back.

the punisher is tha man. tak payah cakap banyak, aim shoot, am shoot.

i find the syrup that accompany the tau fu fah somehow needs to to be overwhelming, you know is overwhelming when you finish your tau fu fah and there is like 1/2 cm worth of sugar left. but in the beginning as you start to slurp and eat the tau fu fah, you find your tau fu fah rather tasteless and had wish your tau fu fah  seller had put more syrup in it. then at the end you end up with more sugar. so if you don't want the extra sugar at the end, then that means you would need less sugar in the beginning and thus make it even more tasteless then when it had the overwhelming sugar.



but strangely this tau fu fah problem only happens when you tapau/takeaway. if you are having it there and fortunate enough to have it serve in a bowl, there is no overwhelming or lack of sugar experience to be had, the first slurp taste as good as the last one.

flags 101





i realised, quite a number of flags actually looks like the flag of another nation.

 
italy/hungary
 
serbia/netherlands
 
poland/monaco
 
belgium/germany
 
czech/filipina (ok lah this wan not same)



but these are the best, the scandinavian countries, 1 design, different colour.

 
sweden/finland
 
norway/iceland

denmark

there is something about californication and weeds.

i watch them again regularly.

weeds yes, it's an annual event.

but californication, is different. it's deep and emotional.

every time you watches it, you feel different.

first time i watched it, i was blown away with all those naked hot ladies.

second time i watched it, i wanted to be hank moody.

third time, all those muthafukka quotes .

fourth time i need to get me a karen, i just do.

malaysia general election 2018





this shit has to be documented and made into a film.

the drama before elections, the numbers of malaysian overseas that came back, the tension, the predictions and the waiting. ah the waiting in the wee hours of the morning.

on sunday night prior to election wednesday, attended a ceramah.

this part of the ceramah caught my attention.

if by 11pm tv3 have not made the announcement that barisan nasional has won, it's good news.

if by 12am tv3 still has not made any announcement, you know and i know it's going to be a very good news.

if by 1am, still tv3 has not made any announcement, ladies and gentlemen i tell you, we have won, kita sudah menang.

but those that stayed up until 5am to watch the final results still knew it wasn't over yet, until the new pm is sworn in. we were sceptical and we were worried of the shit bn will pulled out of their ass.

an 11am sworn in was delayed until 9.30pm.

finally at the awaited hour, it happened. barisan nasional was finally defeated.

few quotes that i heard that tickles me during the nomination day to election.

1. the mp that forgotten to bring along her nric on nomination day, would had forgotten to bring her cheebai if it was an attach accessories.

2. we came back "kow kok-kah" in cantoenese which literally translate to "we came back to save the country".

3. on election day while waiting for the school gate to open, an uncle was calling his friend "hei san thong kai ah" in cantoenese translate to wake up and gut the chicken.

salam 1 malaysia, majulah sukan untuk negara.

mr selfridge.

i could not help my self, i just needed another shot of british era series.

not as good, watchable.

self made man, full of himself, should have sold his adrenaline instead of his dreams.

made for entertainment the beginnings of selfridge & co.
