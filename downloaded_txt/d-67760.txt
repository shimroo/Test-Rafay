financial aid

















how can i apply for federal financial aid to pay for college?









students must submit the free application for federal student aid (fafsa) for each academic year to apply for federal financial aid. at university of phoenix, our fafsa school code is 014593.











how do i complete the fafsa for 2024-25?









students may complete the 2024-25 fafsa by visiting https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa. the 2024-25 fafsa has some major changes from previous years, which are intended to expand eligibility for federal student aid, including pell grants, and provide a streamlined user experience.
here’s what you should know about the fafsa changes for 2024-25.











what is the fafsa simplification act?










the fafsa simplification act is a significant overhaul of the processes and systems used to award federal student aid, beginning with the 2024-2025 award year. major changes include a streamlined fafsa® form, replacing the expected family contribution (efc) with the student aid index (sai), adjustments to how a student’s family size is determined and expanding access to federal pell grants.
to learn more about your financial aid options, visit our federal financial aid faqs.












what is the student aid index (sai)?










beginning with the 2024-25 award year, the student aid index (sai) replaced the expected family contribution (efc). sai is calculated based on the information that you and your required contributors provide on your fafsa® form. this number is not a dollar amount of aid eligibility or what your family is expected to pay.
sai is an eligibility index number used to determine how much federal financial aid you may be eligible for. both the name and formula have changed, meaning your qualifications for student aid may change, too.
