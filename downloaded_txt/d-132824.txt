                new issues and archive

after 
              eight years of free access, the award-winning jenda: a journal 
              of culture and african women studies (issn: 1530-5686) will 
              be going under subscription to meet the growing operational cost 
              of production. old copies of the journal will not be free. the pdf version that is formatted, with 
              complete notes, pagination, and easier to read is available for 
              digital download at a minimal cost. as new technologies and standards 
              emerge, africaresource will be in a position to adapt our content 
              and tools, improve the software, enhance our services, and respond 
              to the annual costs of maintaining the journal download. to 
              accommodate the specific reading preferences of viewers, individual 
              articles of each issue will be available on a pay-per-view model 
              on africaresource.

"published 
          by africa resource center and directed by an all-african women team 
          of co-editors, this new ejournal represents in part an effort to occupy 
          and redefine the space of african women's studies, a space initially 
          defined by white female scholars. judging by the inaugural issue, jenda 
          holds great promise, offering a large selection of interesting and engaging 
          essays and other content, much more than comparable print or online 
          journals." -- michael de nie, director of scout report, university 
          of wisconsin-madison (march 3, 2001).
