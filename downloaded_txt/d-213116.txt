meet ryan dahlem

our ninth head of school



		we are delighted to introduce ryan dahlem, who began his tenure as rivers’ ninth head of school on july 1, 2023. ryan comes to rivers from st. margaret’s episcopal school in san juan capistrano, ca, where he held numerous leadership roles across the academic and administrative teams. ryan is a proponent of student-centered education that emphasizes relationships, community, and supported risk-taking. this approach makes him a perfect fit for rivers and its philosophy of excellence with humanity. in the words of board president alan d. rose, jr., who led the head of school search committee, “ryan is an inspiring visionary leader with a keen understanding of multiple facets of independent school management and leadership.” we can’t wait to see rivers’ next chapter unfold under ryan dahlem’s guidance.
