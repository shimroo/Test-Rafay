water heating
upgrading your water heater will save you energy and money
your water heater is one of the highest consumers of energy in your home, second only to your central air conditioning system. if you’re energy conscious and want to make your water heater more energy efficient, there are two options to consider: a solar water heater or a heat pump water heater (also known as a hybrid). the annual average utility bill savings can range from $500 if you’re currently using an electric water heater to $1200 or more if you have a propane water heater.
