the alameda all stars are one of my all-time favorite gregg allman
bands.

founded in 1979, the alameda all stars
has a new mission:
celebrating the music of gregg allman. this musical
approach is to honor gregory's memory based on the time we
spent with him between the years 1990-2004 as band mates in his
solo band, gregg allman & friends… the
all stars were the original friends
(new years
eve 1993).



intreview with gregg discussing
gregg allman and friends.


besides extensive yearly tours throughout the u.s., canada and japan
during that time, the aas also recorded with gregg
on two of his solo albums: "searching for simplicity" (1997 sony)
— which was produced by tom dowd — and "no stranger to the
dark: the best of gregg allman" (2002 — sony).


in 1994, gaf performed @ sf's bay to
breakers run held at the polo grounds in golden gate park.
jay leno was the mc for the event. the crowd was
estimated at over 200,000.


and then in 2007, the alameda all stars backed up
ultra-keyboardist brian auger for the

40th anniversary of the summer of love
which
was held @ fabled speedway meadows in sf's golden gate park. over
100,000 people attended.


two years later in 2009, the alameda all stars were
back again at speedway meadows to perform at west fest
- which was held to celebrate the

40th anniversary of woodstock. this time backing
up lesley west (mountain),and
denny laine (the moody blues and
paul mccartney's touring band). once again, the
crowd was over 100,000 strong.


the aas has also performed onstage as a backup band
for a number of very diverse artists. this partial list includes:
warren haynes and allen woody
(the allman brothers band), joe satriani,
harvey mandel (the rolling stones),
david & linda laflamme (it's a beautiful
day), norman greenbaum, dickie
petersen (blue cheer), greg
douglas (steve miller band), maria
mauldar, jimmy hall (wet willie
band), lester chambers (the chambers
brothers), greg kihn, as well as
aas alumni members brad gillis
(ozzy osbourn, night ranger),
dan chauncey (.38 special), and
many others.


in 2021, the aas recorded
"crooked road," written
by preston thrall & tom miller. it was engineered
& produced by pat thrall who also played some
guitar on it.


over their 43-year history, the alameda all stars
has always kept up a high level of musicianship, along with a
professional approach to entertaining audiences by means of a
well-planned stage show. and ever since those early days back in
'79, the band has never looked back… we're just looking forward to
many more years of music, fun, and friendship with each other, our
alumni band members, and our fans.
