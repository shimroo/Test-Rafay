 this year’s passuk





this years passuk  - calculated by counting backwards from the end of the torah (5845) - is (ha’azinu 5th aliya passuk 31):כִּ֛י לֹ֥א כְצוּרֵ֖נוּ צוּרָ֑ם וְאֹיְבֵ֖ינוּ פְּלִילִֽים׃ the passuk for 5780/2020 - the year of corona - is:כִּי־ג֛וֹי אֹבַ֥ד עֵצ֖וֹת הֵ֑מָּה וְאֵ֥ין בָּהֶ֖ם תְּבוּנָֽה׃ the meforshim tell us this is talking about the goyim, the דעת זקנים tells us:כי גוי אובד עצות המה. אותם האויבים שמסרתי ישראל בידם אבדה עצתם ואין בהם תבונה:and from this passuk onwards for the next few pessukim, the torah is talking about the goyim. from this point the tide seems to have turned against the goyim, according to the pessukim, and according to what we have seen with our own eyes.about this years passuk, the דעת זקנים tells us (about the goyim):. . .היה להם להבין כי מאחר שלקו ישראל שהם בניו של מקום על רוע מעלליהם יש להם לישא ק"ו בעצמם ועתה מפרש והולך מה אחריתםis this passuk hinting to us that hashem’s retribution against the goyim (that appears to have started in 5780/2020) is now going to escalate?

 are we witnessing the breaking out of the klippot?





as is well known, the geulah is often compared to the sprouting of a seed. the outer shells of a seed are there to protect (and hide) the inner parts of the seed and when the seed begins to germinate the outer shells begin to whither and fall away so that the plant may sprout, grow and mature.  the shells eventually completely rot and disintegrate when their job is done.if however, for some reason, the outer shells do not wither and fall away at the correct time, the inner part of the seed and eventually the whole seed will die.so it is with the geulah, the kedushah of the future kingdom of the mashiach is initially contained within an entity who’s only purpose is to create an environment for the kedusha to sprout and grow.  but soon that entity starts to whither and rot in order that the sprout of the mashiach can shoot forth.with the creation of the recent new “government” in israel we have witnessed a great “withering” of the klippah.  when we saw what new destructive policies the new minister of religious affairs, matan kahanah (interestingly enough, from the party that was once the mafdal party), was trying to enact we saw an even further rotting of the klippah. such that if “germination” does not start soon, it will cause great damage to the seed of kedusha within.sprouting out of the klippahthese recent events have caused a great new unity between the chareidim and the chardalim or the torani part of the dati leumi community. the rav of be’er sheva, hagaon rav yehuda deri, said: “i’m a member of the moetzes harabbanut for already 22 years and it was never so united with rabbanim from all eidos as it is now. the key of all the ikarei emunah, of all the ikarei yahadus is the kashrus of foods.”and a determination and resolve within the rabbanut to stand against the government.150 rabbanim at unprecedented asifa: “we won’t recognize giyur, kashrus outside rabbanut”‘we will not cooperate with dismantling the chief rabbinate,'dozens of rabbis hold conference decrying government reforms in religious sphereare we witnessing the initial breaking out of the unholy klippah, and the sprouting of the kedusha?

wisconsin to liquefy the dead, flush into sewers, then spread the goo on food farms





 "america gets exponentially more disgusting and depraved with each passing day"https://www.naturalnews.com/2021-05-20-wisconsin-liquify-dead-flush-sewers-food-farms.html(natural news) the wisconsin senate has approved a new bill that allows for dead bodies to be dissolved in a chemical bath, disposed of like sewage, and spread all over food crops as “biosludge.”senate bill 228 authorizes a practice known as “alkaline hydrolysis” that essentially liquefies corpses through “water cremation” using a mixture of water, heat and chemical agents. the only thing left behind are the bones, reports indicate.once liquefied, these human remains are then dumped into the sewer system or boiled off, while the bones are crushed and deposited into an urn.the republican-led senate passed the legislation without debate, despite objections from the catholic bishops of wisconsin, who say that deceased humans are not to be treated in such a disrespectful and disgusting manner.“catholic teaching is centered on the life and dignity of the human person because each person is created in the image and likeness of god,” says kim vercauteren, executive director of the wisconsin catholic conference.“the heart, mind, flesh, and bones of a human person are all elements of a unique creation, down to the dna, which must be honored even after death.”vercauteren and other catholics are concerned that the alkaline hydrolysis process treats human remains as if they were never actual people who were created by god. in essence, water cremation treats a deceased person as if he or she never existed.“wastewater does not honor the sacredness of the body, nor does it allow the grieving to honor the dead after disposition,” vercauteren added in an email to the senate health committee.america gets exponentially more disgusting and depraved with each passing dayas we reported in the past, some of america’s wastewater is converted into “fertilizer” for food crops, which means liquid human remains will now be spread all over food crops in wisconsin and possibly elsewhere.there is also the risk that the wuhan coronavirus (covid-19) and other elements will pass through the sewer system and end up on cropland as well, polluting farms and the food that grows there.the whole thing is simply repulsive, but according to sen. patrick testin, a republican from stevens point, it is necessary to promote “consumer choice.”“wisconsin funeral directors are receiving more and more requests for flameless or water cremation,” testin is quoted as saying.“i believe in allowing consumers choices. and if a consumer chooses flameless cremation, i would like to empower wisconsin funeral directors the means to fulfill that choice.”catholics, however, object to all of testin’s claims. they say respect and reverence for human bodies “must not be sacrificed for a cheap, quicker disposition.”“we must treat the remains of all human beings, no matter how long they lived or how they died, with dignity, charity, and respect,” the texas catholic conference of bishops stated two years ago after numerous attempts were made to legalize alkaline hydrolysis in the lone star state.“chemical digestion of the human body fails to follow this simple principle.”as you might expect, leftists are in favor of alkaline hydrolysis because they claim it is “greener” than normal cremation or traditional burial. they claim this despite the fact that large amounts of dangerous chemicals are necessary to liquefy human remains before pumping them into the sewer system.“if you’ve been paying attention, and connect the dots, it’s very likely states and the freemasons and jesuits who rule our lives are expecting mass death,” wrote one lifesitenews commenter about this sudden push for legalized alkaline hydrolysis.“it shouldn’t be surprising to anyone considering doctors and scientists have been predicting mass death in the coming months and years. what a wonderful way to eradicate any evidence of humanity.”to learn more about toxic biosludge and how it is spread over food crops, visit biosludge.news.

how hashem saved israel on 911





  tehillim 117 says:הַֽלְל֣וּ אֶת־יְ֭הוָה כָּל־גּוֹיִ֑ם שַׁ֝בְּח֗וּהוּ כָּל־הָאֻמִּֽים׃ {ב}כִּ֥י גָ֘בַ֤ר עָלֵ֨ינוּ ׀ חַסְדּ֗וֹ וֶֽאֱמֶת־יְהוָ֥ה לְעוֹלָ֗ם הַֽלְלוּ־יָֽהּwhich means that all the nations of the world praise hashem because of his kindness to the jews.why do the nations of the world praise hashem because of his kindness to us? because they are always plotting against the jews in ways that even we do not know about and hashem always saves us from them. most of the times we never even find out about these plots. so we can’t even marvel at the way hashem has saved us, but the goyim themselves know. here is an example i have just seen now that happened 20 years ago:george bush jr. was planning on recognizing a ”palestinian” state on the day of 911, but the 911 attacks put an immediate end to that:on 9/11, president bush was supposed to recognize ‘palestine’, saudi official revealsanother more divine revelation came later in the interview when bin sultan revealed that on september 11, 2001, washington under the leadership of former president george bush jr., was supposed to sign an agreement to recognize palestine. but after the twin towers were taken down, bin sultan admitted that it “was not meant to be.”when 9-11 happened, “the palestinian cause became the least concern for america and for much of the world” he said. regarding the ‘palestinian’ leaders, “it’s difficult to trust them” bin sultan admitted after a long rant regarding their indignation of attempted peace negotiations between them and israel by bill clinton.

acharit kereishit





on quora.com, in answer to the question "is palestine, still occupied by isreal?", michael davison states the following:


. . . so the arabs of palestine have refused how many offers for a state of their own? 

1937 peel commission; 1939 woodhead commission (3 options, all rejected) 1945 anglo-american committee; 1947 ungar 181, 2000 barak-clinton proposal; 2001 taba proposal; 2008 olmert jerusalem proposal. 

total: nine proposals for establishing a palestinian state, rejected by the palestinians. . .

i have always wondered whether  the arabs refusal of all peace offers corresponds with paro's refusal to let bnei yisrael go.

so far - according to michael davison's count - we have 9. does that mean that there will be one more (rejected) offer of land/"peace" to be immediately followed by mashiach?

does the pre-rejection of trump's plan count as the tenth one?

we protest







we, the undersigned jewish bloggers, hereby protest – in the strongest terms possible – the parading and glorification of an “alternative lifestyle”, one that is classified in the holy torah as an abomination, especially through the streets of the holy city of jerusalem.

the torah demands that we live by a certain code of sexual morality, and as such, we are forbidden from certain relationships that a moral society cannot tolerate.  these include incest, adultery, bestiality, and homosexuality.  all these are considered grave sins in judaism and incur the punishment of karet, or excision from the jewish people.  an act performed with witnesses during the time of the sanhedrin would incur an even worse consequence – namely, capital punishment.

and this is only on an individual level.  when the sin is committed on a societal level, it is much worse.  the torah and our sages record how these acts were catalysts for both the great flood during noah’s lifetime and the destruction of the five cities of the plain.

as such, we consider any attempt to glorify acts that the torah vehemently forbids by parading any such lifestyle through the streets with horror and utter disdain.  such parades in new york and san francisco would be bad enough, but through the streets of the holy land of israel is a thousand-fold worse.  the torah specifically warns us not to act in sexually abominable ways lest we be vomited out of the land.  one can only imagine how it is viewed in heaven when people brazenly display to g-d how abominable one can be.  and if the land of israel cannot tolerate such acts of utter gall, all the more so in the holy city of jerusalem, a city that is overwhelmingly religious.

we in no way wish to minimize the struggles in temptation some may have in this area and view with positivity those who have such inclinations and bravely overcome them.  but those are not the people irreverently parading through the streets with rainbow flags, who show utter contempt for the holy torah and all we hold dear.

we therefore vehemently protest the “pride” parade in jerusalem and everywhere else in the world where they may occur.  we hope and pray that those who take part in such parades do a complete teshuva for their actions, and may we see a rebuilt jerusalem, speedily in our days, amen.

a message from eliyahu hanavi to an idf soldier





yeranen yaakov has a link to an interesting story on sod1820.co.il

here is a very quick translation:




we heard in a lecture on chanukah 5778 by rabbi dov kook of tiberius, who said that by purim the war of gog and magog will breakout and that this purim 5778 will be the last purim before the revelation of mashiach.


a few days ago, after services, a young student approached his rabbi 
in a certain village in israel and asked if he could tell him about a 
frightening incident. a true story that happened to a young man a few 
days before that.


a young soldier got on a bus and sat at the back seat. an old man 
came to sit next to him. the old man, without knowing him started to 
speak to him and said: "you should know that the war of gog and magog 
will breakout in shvat"


the shocked young man asked him "how do you know this", the old man 
said "it is hard to prove what i know, but in order for you to 
understand that it is true, you can ask me any question you have about 
any person you know and i will tell you everything about him".


the young man thought and said to himself i'll ask him about my 
cousin who is very sick and we'll see what he'll tell me. and he told 
the old man the name of his cousin.  the old man told him exactly about 
the difficult situation of his cousin, that she needs divine mercy and 
everything about her without knowing her.


the old man continued and said that you should know that hashem hates
 licentiousness, and that what is going on in the army with male and 
female soldiers is no secret. that they are committing sins of sexual 
immorality, and that they are deliberately enlisting females into the 
army in order to cause the young men to sin and any jobs that female 
soldiers do in the army can be done by young men.


and also that it is no secret that one of the purposes of the army is to secularize young israeli men. it will not continue, hashem hates licentiousness.


he left the young man without another word and got off the bus. the 
curious young man, who wanted to know where the old man lived, got off 
the bus after him, and the old man disappeared. they say he merited a 
revelation of eliyahu hanavi of blessed memory.


it is brought in the book "davar b'ito" (everything in it's time) about the month of shvat, that on the 15th of shvat there will be a full lunar eclipse. it is written in the book "yalkut moshe"
 that a lunar eclipse in the month of shvat [is a sign of] stringent 
judgment on most of the world, and that day will be very dark.


we have to wake up, hashem is dealing with us with great kindness and
 is sending us faithful messengers that we may merit to wake up and 
prepare ourselves for the geulah.


we have a few days left to examine ourselves and to quickly 
strengthen ourselves and to change our behavior. to swap our tight 
clothing for modest clothing, for longer and wider skirts, long sleeves,
 wider shirts that are not so tight.


every married woman should cover her hair with a modest hair covering, not a foreign wig (foreign wig = foreign woman).


to get rid of our impure devices with forbidden images!!! and are also a bitul torah!!! they are unnecessary in a jewish house .


to maintain our pure speech, to sit and learn torah, to learn halachot in order to be a kosher person.


and to increase acts of kindness, and to judge everyone favorably. we must be shomer shabbat kehilchatah.



may we all merit the revelation of eliyahu hanavi who comes to announce the arrival of mashiach tzidkeinu.

and may we all merit to be united and receive the mashiach with great mercy and kindness.



when the mashiach comes don't say we didn't know and don't say nobody told you. you have enough time to do teshuvah before yom hadin hanorah.

an addendum to my previous post: the beginnings of international isolation??? 






the flight ban - kerry came with a stick
it seems i might have been a little naive.  the timing of kerry's visit and the faa ban does seem a little too convenient/suspicious.  otherwise what was the entire purpose of  his little visit?  from his point of view, without a subtle/not-so-subtle threat he didn't have anything new to bring to the region to 'persuade' israel. 

it is not as if he and obama haven't tried something like this before.

see:


is the faa the new irs? 
president 'lead from behind' leads from the front for hamas
u.s. banning flights to press israel into cease-fire?
finally, obama leads from the front: the hamas-faa move against ben gurion
israel, the faa, and international isolation
obama to the rescue – of hamas


even if the faa ban proves to be only temporary, it does appear from this to be the start of something new.

prophetic malbim describes august 2010 discovery





amazing article from: http://matzav.com/ quoted here in full



prophetic malbim describes august 2010 discovery

thursday august 5, 2010 10:27 am 
by rabbi yair hoffman
there is a remarkable malbim on the book of yonah 2:4. the malbim discusses how yonah was caught in a river under the sea - where the waters of the river were separate from the ocean waters. until this month - this was generally thought to be a physical impossibility.
below, however, we find an article written by richard gray - the science editor of the british newspaper the telegraph. the results are striking. the reader is urged to see the malbim with his or her own eyes. the term utilized by the malbim - "levav yamim" clearly means sea bed.

"researchers working in the black sea have found currents of water 350 times greater than the river thames flowing along the sea bed, carving out channels much like a river on the land.
the undersea river, which is up to 115ft deep in places, even has rapids and waterfalls much like its terrestrial equivalents.
coral reefs suffer mass bleaching if found on land, scientists estimate it would be the world's sixth largest river in terms of the amount of water flowing through it.
the discovery could help explain how life manages to survive in the deep ocean far out to sea away from the nutrient rich waters that are found close to land, as the rivers carry sediment and nutrients with them.
the scientists, based at the university of leeds, used a robotic submarine to study for the first time a deep channel that had been found on the sea bed.
they found a river of highly salty water flowing along the deep channel at the bottom of the black sea, creating river banks and flood plains much like a river found on land.
dr dan parsons, from the university's school of earth and environment, said: "the water in the channels is denser than the surrounding seawater because it has higher salinity and is carrying so much sediment.
"it flows down the sea shelf and out into the abyssal plain much like a river on land. the abyssal plains of our oceans are like the deserts of the marine world, but these channels can deliver nutrients and ingredients needed for life out over these deserts.
"this means they could be vitally important, like arteries providing life to the deep ocean.
"the key difference we found from terrestrial rivers was that as the flow goes round the bend, the water spirals in the opposite way to rivers on land."
the undersea river discovered by dr parsons and his colleagues, which is yet to be named, stems from salty water spilling through the bosphorus strait from the mediterranean into the black sea, where the water has a lower salt content.
this causes the dense water from the mediterranean to flow like a river along the sea bed, carving a channel with banks around 115 feet deep and 0.6 of a mile wide. it is the only active undersea river to have been found so far.
scientists have long suspected they can form, after sonar scans of the sea bed have revealed meandering channels in many of the world's oceans, although none have been found before to have currents of water flowing through them.
among the largest of these channels is off the coast of brazil where the amazon enters the atlantic ocean.
most are believed to have formed when sea levels were much lower and the channels have been found to be up to 2,500 miles long and be several miles wide.
the channel in the black sea, although much smaller, is the only one to be found still flowing and proves that these mysterious channels are formed by underwater rivers.
unlike ocean trenches, which are geological formations that form at the deepest parts of the ocean due to movements of the tectonic plates, the undersea river channels meander like rivers on land and form banks in the same way by eroding the silt from the bottom of the channel and building it up at the edges.
dr parsons found that the black sea river is flowing at around four miles per hour with 22,000 cubic metres of water passing through the channel every second - 350 times greater than the flow of the thames and 10 times greater than europe's biggest river, the rhine.
the black sea river flows only for around 37 miles until it reaches the edge of the sea shelf and dissipates into the deep sea.
dr parsons said data from the research will also be important for oil companies looking to drill in areas where these rivers exist.
he said: "this is the first time we have been able to show that there is a flow through a natural channel system and take direct measurements of what the flow is like and how that is linked to the shape and morphology of the channel."
this article appeared in the august 1st edition of the telegraph.
the malbim, rav meir leibish ben yechiel michel weiser passed away in 1879. the motif of his commentary was to prove the divine origin of the torah - as a counter measure to the rise of the reform movement. the fact is that the commentary of the malbim is filled with such gems.

 millions are spent by arab interests on            public relations campaigns. the owner of one of the 25 largest            us pr agencies in america [not torossian]explained why his            firm would no longer work with jewish organizations. he said            there is simply too much money working for arab interests and            he was no longer working for pro-israeli organizations. it’s a            trend that will grow – and will see arab interests even more            positively portrayed in american media. ronn torossian, president & ceo of new york-based 5w public            relations, front page 
   
 anti-semitism 
 anti-semitism            is like alcoholism. you can go for 25 years without a drink,            but if things go bad and you find yourself with a vodka in            your hand, you can't get rid of it. british novelist            iain pears. 
   
 it is a            moral scandal that a few decades after the catastrophe that            overtook the jewish people in europe, anti-semitic themes and            ruses are once again respectable, not just down there with the            thugs, but also within polite society, and within the            perimeters of a self-flattering liberal and left opinion. it            is a bleak lesson to all but those unwilling to see. 
 norman geras            professor emeritus university of              manchester quoted by rick richman,  
   
 a new            survey commissioned by the bbc shows that the four least            popular countries in the world are pakistan, iran, north korea            – and israel. in america 50% took a positive view of israel            and 35 percent were negative: russia 25-26%; canada 25-59%;            france 20-65, britain 16-68, germany 16-69, spain 12-74. the            nigerians (54-29) and kenyans (45-31) were far friendlier to            israel than any west european country. the country that was            most hostile of all, even more than arab countries, was japan,            where only 3 percent had a positive view of israel.

 the new            french cabinet will have three muslim members, one will serve            as minister of women’s rights and spokesperson for the french            government; another has been vocal in blaming israel for            france’s foreign affairs problems; the third has worked to            perpetuate the myth that the problems caused by muslim            immigrants are due to french racism, rather than to islam. in            addition the new justice minister, who has no law degree, was            one of only a handful of members of the national assembly to            have voted against the law banning hijabs in schools.

 søren espersen of the danish folkeparti            described his experience when visiting high schoolsin denmark.  “talented and            articulate” kids explained to him the history of israel as            it’s been taught to them.  after the holocaust, they informed            him, the western countries, led by the u.s. and britain, flew            “massive numbers of american, english, german and polish jews”            to palestine, where “they chased all the palestinians out of            their houses with gunpowder and cannons and other modern            weapons, helped by the british and americans, and sent them to            refugee camps, where they have been ever since.”  
   
 “ daniel,”a 17-year-old norwegian jew told            him how he was “ sitting at the library playing an internet            game that involves shooting the greatest possible number of            people with bows and arrows. a kid walked in….’pretend you’re            shooting a jew,’ he commented enthusiastically.’” 
   
 daniel            recalls,  “during the gaza demonstrations, people went around            with posters in arabic saying ‘kill all jews.’  he points out            that in school if he were to call for the murder of all            muslims or christians, he would probably be sent to the            principal or worse; but when people call for the murder of all            jews, it’s treated as a question of free speech.

 the              lighter side 
 a biker was            riding by the zoo, when he saw a little girl leaning into the            lion's cage. suddenly, the lion grabbed her by the cuff of her            jacket and tried to pull her inside. the biker jumped off his            bike, ran to the cage and hit the lion on the nose with a            powerful punch. the lion jumped back and let go of the girl. a            reporter saw the whole scene, and said, 'sir, that was a very            brave thing you did.' 'why, it was nothing,' the biker            replied. the lion was behind bars. i just saw this little kid            in danger, and acted as i felt right.'
 
 'i noticed            a patch on your jacket,' said the journalist. 'yeah, i ride            with an israeli motorcycle club,' the biker replied.' well,            i'll make sure this will not go unnoticed. i'm a journalist            with the new york times. 
  
 the following morning the new york            times had the following headline: 'israeli gang member            assaults african immigrant and steals his lunch'

 during a            presentation at the jerusalem center for public affairs, a            respected israeli think tank, josé maria aznar, former prime            minister of spain, recalled a “private discussion” in tehran            in october of 2000 with supreme leader ali khamenei, who told            him: “israel must be burned to the ground and made to            disappear from the face of the earth.” dore gold, the former            israeli ambassador to the u.n. wanted to be certain there was            no misunderstanding. he asked aznar whether khamenei was            suggesting “a gradual historical process.“ he meant physical            termination through military force,” aznar replied. khamenei            also told aznar that the goal of the islamic revolution of            1979 has remained constant. it is to rid the world of two            evils: israel and the united states 
   
 aznar also            recalled a meeting he had with vladimir putin, in which he            advised the russian president against selling surface-to-air            missiles to iran. “don’t worry — we can sell them everything,            even if we are worried by an iranian nuclear bomb,” aznar            quoted putin as saying. “because at the end of the day, israel            will take care of it.”

 ecofascism 
 august            haussleiter, a former ss officer and a founding member of the            nazi party, started the german green party based on 19th            century writings that popularized a cult ideology of the            old-fashioned german country people or volk. the volk            derived their “genuine” souls from their “rootedness” in            the land, shared ancestral kinship, and connection to nature.            in contrast, jews, represented corrupt urban modernity, lacked            ties to the land, were soulless and thus could never be part            of the german volk.  
   
 although            the existence, influence and consequences of the            "green wing" on the nazi movement has yet to be adequately            researched, there is a theory put forward by peter staudenmaier, a professor of german history, that ecofascism              played a big role in the search for the final solution. at            the heart of this theory is that this “völkisch            temptation” was a pathological response to modernity. völkisch            thinkers preached a return to the land, to the simplicity and            wholeness of a life attuned to nature's purity. while "the            volkish movement aspired to reconstruct the society that was            sanctioned by history, rooted in nature, and in communion with            the cosmic life spirit," jews had foisted on them the hostile            milieu of urban industrial civilization. 
   
 the most            prominent top nazi leaders who searched for a lost connection            to nature were heinrich himmler, alfred rosenberg, and walther            darré. rosenberg wrote in his colossal the myth of the              20th century: "today we see the steady stream from the            countryside to the city, deadly for the volk. the            cities swell ever larger, unnerving the volk and            destroying the threads which bind humanity to nature; they            attract adventurers and profiteers of all colors, thereby            fostering racial chaos."

 check              list for journalists of the main stream media 
 1, israelis            live in posh houses stocked with all the latest appliances.            arabs live in crumbling shacks that are always in danger of            being bulldozed.  
   
 2. israelis            are fanatical and hate-filled. arabs are passionate and            embittered.  
   
 3. be sure            to call a terrorist prisoner in an israeli jail a militant. do            not mention the sheer amount of food in the prison, especially            if he is on a hunger strike. if you happen to notice that the            prisoners live better than most israelis, do not refer to it.            never ask them how many children they killed or how much they            make a month. ask them what they think the prospects for peace            are. nod knowingly when they say that it’s up to israel. 
   
 4.            depersonalize israelis, personalize muslims. one is a            statistic, the other a precious snowflake. a muslim terrorist            attack is always in retaliation for something, but an israeli            attack only feeds the “cycle of violence.” quote some official            who urges israel to return to peace negotiations. 
   
 5. frame            all israeli politics by asking whether a politician is finally            willing to make the compromises that you think are necessary            for peace. a vote for a conservative party means that israelis            hate peace. 
   
 6. israeli            soldiers should be depicted looming menacingly over children.            your stringers are already experienced at urging a child into            camera range, then getting down on one knee and tilting the            camera up just as an israeli soldier walks into the frame. if            there isn’t time to set up the shot, get what you can. the            photo can be cropped afterward to show just the israeli            soldier and the palestinian child, even if the two are not            actually interacting in any way. 
   
 7.            checkpoint lines should consist entirely of old people and            pregnant women waiting to visit their families.  
   
 8. describe            “settlers as “dogged” and “fanatical.” convey to the reader            that there is something disturbing about the tenacity with            which they cling to the land, while making it clear that they            will have to be evacuated from the land for there to be peace.             
   
 9.            palestinian politicians are always willing to make peace, even            when they aren’t. never ask them any tough questions, about            the their support for terrorists or why they refuse to            negotiate.  
   
 10. if an            israeli tells you that there is no such thing as palestinians,            that they’re gangs of muslim militias who have no interest in            running their own country, or that jordan is the actual            palestinian state, ignore him. you’re here to tell a story.  
   
 11. close            with an old arab man who expresses hope that one day peace            will come to this troubled land.

un condemns israel for judaizing the talmud





in a related item, unesco declares rashi an ancient       "palestinian islamic sage".     a special un rapporteur condemned israel yesterday for judaizing the     talmud. "the judaization of the talmud is the new frontier of     dispossession of the traditional palestinian religious and     intellectual heritage" said eva nudnik, a special rapporteur     appointed by the united nations committee for the establishment of a     palestinian history.      she accused the government of israel of collaborating with extremist     rabbis in a effort to eradicate any traces of signs of the true     palestinian and islamic claim to the talmud. nudnik was especially     annoyed with the artscroll schottenstein edition which she said is a     devious effort to establish and spread a false jewish claim to the     talmud.      palestinian authority chairman mahmoud abbas said on sunday that the     pa will never recognize any jewish connection to the talmud. unesco declares rashi an ancient "palestinian islamic       sage". unesco last week declared rashi to be an ancient       palestinian islamic sage and called for the establishment of a       fund to raze the "rashi shul" in worms, germany and to       erect in its place a mosque and a museum in the memory of the       ancient islamic imam.  palestinian minister of culture, mr yahya yaklef congratulated       the unesco vote to forbid any jewish access to rashi's       burial site in troyes.

israel's shalit eclipses arab 'shalloots'





received via email: israel's shalit eclipses arab 'shalloots' it is humiliating that a large number of       palestinian detainees will be exchanged for a single soldier  by           faisal al qasim, special to gulf news published: 00:00 october 17, 2011      image credit: luis vazquez/gulf news        at long last the famous israeli captive gilad shalit has secured       his freedom from his palestinian captors. hamas and israel have       come to a prisoner swap agreement at a very dubious time to       release shalit in exchange for over a thousand palestinian       detainees. i bet millions, the world over, have heard of the       israeli soldier, who was captured by hamas a couple of years ago       to the extent that he has become, by all accounts, an       international figure. he has been in the news for months and       months on end. all american and european media have written       extensively about his case. even the arab press has given his ordeal huge coverage forgetting       of course the ordeals of thousands of arab “shalloots” both at       home and abroad. it is no wonder then that hamas leaders have       remarked sarcastically more than once that wherever they go in the       arab world, arab officials ask them about shalit with great       enthusiasm. we have all seen how the deposed egyptian president       hosni mubarak and others worked for months on end to secure       shalit’s release, but to no avail. i am sure some are asking now what is meant by “shalloots”. is it       a derivative of “shalit”. the answer is no. i am trying here to       play on words to show how great the difference is between the       israeli shalit and the so-called arab “shalloot”, which means in       arabic “shabby or seedy shoes”. this colloquial arabic word is, in       actual fact, a metaphor for run-down cheap things. why have the whole world including many arab leaders been so busy       trying to free shalit when there are tens of thousands of arab       “shalloots” languishing in israeli and other prisons unnoticed?       why are they so cheap and unimportant?      it is not a secret at all that the value of an arab person in the       stock-exchange of arab regimes is sort of nil. he is as valueless       as an onion’s peel. one should not expect of regimes which treat       their downtrodden people like dirt by torturing and starving them       inside their countries to care about an arab captive in israeli or       other foreign jails. thousands of arab detainees have been held       all over the world for decades legally or otherwise, and some of       them died abroad unheard of. hundreds of arabs might disappear at       one point outside their countries, and nobody would care an iota.       we have seen how hundreds of people die while trying to flee their       countries in the so-called “death boats. have you ever seen an arab government organising a campaign to       release one of its nationals from a foreign jail? probably a few       such as the kuwaitis who worked hard at one point to secure the       release of their captives in iraq. but this remains the exception       and not the rule. have you ever seen an arab government trying to       get one of its citizens out of guantanamo bay camp? not really.       most of them have kept silent. and were it not for the pressure of       western governments, no naturalised european arabs would have got       out of the infamous camp. have you ever seen an arab regime trying to get its captives out       of israeli prisons? forget about it. most of arab regimes have no       problem at all letting their nationals die in israeli jails. the       arab citizen is so cheap that israel sometimes exchanges hundreds       of arab detainees for the remains of an israeli soldier. how would one expect arab regimes to care about their citizens       detained abroad if their security services are even collaborating       with the americans and others to kidnap arab persons and torture       them in the so-called ‘rendition prisons”? it is worth-mentioning       also that some arab states are hosting us prisons on their lands       because american law prevents the authorities from torturing       detainees on us soil. have you ever seen an israeli or american       security apparatus collaborating with an arab counterpart to       arrest and torture an american or israeli citizen? not at all. it       is quite funny and extremely painful at one and the same time that       some arab security apparatus have supplied western authorities       with fabricated information to help condemn some arab dissidents       held abroad instead of helping them to get out of prison. when will we see an arab leader visiting the family of an arab       citizen arrested in israel or somewhere else? when will we see an       arab official assuring a family that the government is doing its       utmost to help secure the release of an arab captive abroad as did       israeli prime ministers with shalit’s family? it is quite great to see over a thousand palestinians released       from israeli prisons, but it is very sad that this huge number of       detainees will be exchanged for a single israeli soldier. isn’t it       very humiliating for all arabs politically and morally? it is no wonder at all that israel is releasing a large number of       arabs for one person. it must have seen the arab armies and       security services opening fire randomly on arab demonstrators as       if they were a swarm of flies or a herd of livestock just because       they went out clamouring for their basic rights. have you ever       seen an israeli force shooting israeli demonstrators with great       ease? of course not. in actual fact israel sent its aircraft to       uganda years ago to help free israeli citizens kidnapped by       palestinians there. and so, as long as we, arabs, do not respect       ourselves nobody will ever respect us, and we will always exchange       thousands of arabs for one single israeli. we are crossing our fingers that the new arab revolutions might       one day liberate arab people from despotism and turn them from       “shalloots” into “shalits”. dr faisal al qasim is a syrian journalist based in doha

fwd: “their souls are screaming out for what you have”





 rabbi yitzchok adlerstein:   unlike many new yorkers i know, i do not have an easy time listening to michael savage. i squirm when caught in a car in ny when the driver tunes in to his show. while appreciating his support for israel, i find his manner over the top, and his content simplistic. all this makes his july 12 remarks more significant, for the pure genuineness of his observations. apparently invited to a leyl shabbos dinner, he meets ten chabad teenaged girls, and is overwhelmed by their purity. it leads him to contrast their life style with that of their non-religious peers, and to advise them not to be jealous of the lifestyles of cultural icons, because nothing that the beautiful people have holds a candle to what the g-d-fearing have. he notes how many belong in rehab – and can't stick it out. why does their stardom fade and fizzle? savage tells these girls quite simply: "their souls are screaming out for what you have."

when to doubt a scientific 'consensus'





here is an article that i saw referenced on  rabbi dovid gottlieb's blog that is worth showing here in full:when to doubt a scientific 'consensus'by: jay richardsthe americanmarch 16, 2010link to original articlea december 18 washington post poll, released on the final day of the ill-fated copenhagen climate summit, reported “four in ten americans now saying that they place little or no trust in what scientists have to say about the environment.” nor is the poll an outlier. several recent polls have found “climate change” skepticism rising faster than sea levels on planet algore (not to be confused with planet earth, where sea levels remain relatively stable).many of the doubt-inducing climate scientists and their media acolytes attribute this rising skepticism to the stupidity of americans, philistines unable to appreciate that there is “a scientific consensus on climate change.” one of the benefits of the recent climategate scandal, which revealed leading climate scientists manipulating data, methods, and peer review to exaggerate the evidence of significant global warming, may be to permanently deflate the rhetorical value of the phrase “scientific consensus.”even without the scandal, the very idea of scientific consensus should give us pause. “consensus,” according to merriam-webster, means both “general agreement” and “group solidarity in sentiment and belief.” that pretty much sums up the dilemma. we want to know whether a scientific consensus is based on solid evidence and sound reasoning, or social pressure and groupthink.anyone who has studied the history of science knows that scientists are not immune to the non-rational dynamics of the herd. many false ideas enjoyed consensus opinion at one time. indeed, the “power of the paradigm” often shapes the thinking of scientists so strongly that they become unable to accurately summarize, let alone evaluate, radical alternatives. question the paradigm, and some respond with dogmatic fanaticism.we shouldn’t, of course, forget the other side of the coin. there are always cranks and conspiracy theorists. no matter how well founded a scientific consensus, there’s someone somewhere—easily accessible online—that thinks it’s all hokum. sometimes these folks turn out to be right. but often, they’re just cranks whose counsel is best disregarded.so what’s a non-scientist citizen, without the time to study the scientific details, to do? how is the ordinary citizen to distinguish, as andrew coyne puts it, “between genuine authority and mere received wisdom? conversely, how do we tell crankish imperviousness to evidence from legitimate skepticism?” are we obligated to trust whatever we’re told is based on a scientific consensus unless we can study the science ourselves? when can you doubt a consensus? when should you doubt it?your best bet is to look at the process that produced, maintains, and communicates the ostensible consensus. i don’t know of any exhaustive list of signs of suspicion, but, using climate change as a test study, i propose this checklist as a rough-and-ready list of signs for when to consider doubting a scientific “consensus,” whatever the subject. one of these signs may be enough to give pause. if they start to pile up, then it’s wise to be suspicious.(1) when different claims get bundled together.usually, in scientific disputes, there is more than one claim at issue. with global warming, there’s the claim that our planet, on average, is getting warmer. there’s also the claim that human emissions are the main cause of it, that it’s going to be catastrophic, and that we have to transform civilization to deal with it. these are all different assertions with different bases of evidence. evidence for warming, for instance, isn’t evidence for the cause of that warming. all the polar bears could drown, the glaciers melt, the sea levels rise 20 feet, newfoundland become a popular place to tan, and that wouldn’t tell us a thing about what caused the warming. this is a matter of logic, not scientific evidence. the effect is not the same as the cause.there’s a lot more agreement about (1) a modest warming trend since about 1850 than there is about (2) the cause of that trend. there’s even less agreement about (3) the dangers of that trend, or of (4) what to do about it. but these four propositions are frequently bundled together, so that if you doubt one, you’re labeled a climate change “skeptic” or “denier.” that’s just plain intellectually dishonest. when well-established claims are fused with separate, more controversial claims, and the entire conglomeration is covered with the label “consensus,” you have reason for doubt.(2) when ad hominem attacks against dissenters predominate.personal attacks are common in any dispute simply because we’re human. it’s easier to insult than to the follow the thread of an argument. and just because someone makes an ad hominem argument, it doesn’t mean that their conclusion is wrong. but when the personal attacks are the first out of the gate, and when they seem to be growing in intensity and frequency, don your skeptic’s cap and look more closely at the evidence.when it comes to climate change, ad hominems are all but ubiquitous. they are even smuggled into the way the debate is described. the common label “denier” is one example. without actually making the argument, this label is supposed to call to mind the assertion of the “great climate scientist” ellen goodman: “i would like to say we’re at a point where global warming is impossible to deny. let’s just say that global warming deniers are now on a par with holocaust deniers.”there’s an old legal proverb: if you have the facts on your side, argue the facts. if you have the law on your side, argue the law. if you have neither, attack the witness. when proponents of a scientific consensus lead with an attack on the witness, rather than on the arguments and evidence, be suspicious.(3) when scientists are pressured to toe the party line.the famous lysenko affair in the former soviet union is often cited as an example of politics trumping good science. it’s a good example, but it’s often used to imply that such a thing could only happen in a totalitarian culture, that is, when all-powerful elites can control the flow of information. but this misses the almost equally powerful conspiracy of agreement, in which interlocking assumptions and interests combine to give the appearance of objectivity where none exists. for propaganda purposes, this voluntary conspiracy is even more powerful than a literal conspiracy by a dictatorial power, precisely because it looks like people have come to their position by a fair and independent evaluation of the evidence.tenure, job promotions, government grants, media accolades, social respectability, wikipedia entries, and vanity can do what gulags do, only more subtly. alexis de tocqueville warned of the power of the majority in american society to erect “formidable barriers around the liberty of opinion; within these barriers an author may write what he pleases, but woe to him if he goes beyond them.” he could have been writing about climate science.climategate, and the dishonorable response to its revelations by some official scientific bodies, show that scientists are under pressure to toe the orthodox party line on climate change, and receive many benefits for doing so. that’s another reason for suspicion.(4) when publishing and peer review in the discipline is cliquish.though it has its limits, the peer-review process is meant to provide checks and balances, to weed out bad and misleading work, and to bring some measure of objectivity to scientific research. at its best, it can do that. but when the same few people review and approve each other’s work, you invariably get conflicts of interest. this weakens the case for the supposed consensus, and becomes, instead, another reason to be suspicious. nerds who follow the climate debate blogosphere have known for years about the cliquish nature of publishing and peer review in climate science (see here, for example).(5) when dissenting opinions are excluded from the relevant peer-reviewed literature not because of weak evidence or bad arguments but as part of a strategy to marginalize dissent.besides mere cliquishness, the “peer review” process in climate science has, in some cases, been consciously, deliberately subverted to prevent dissenting views from being published. again, denizens of the climate blogosphere have known about these problems for years, but climategate revealed some of the gory details for the broader public. and again, this gives the lay public a reason to doubt the consensus.(6) when the actual peer-reviewed literature is misrepresented.because of the rhetorical force of the idea of peer review, there’s the temptation to misrepresent it. we’ve been told for years that the peer-reviewed literature is virtually unanimous in its support for human-induced climate change. in science, naomi oreskes even produced a “study” of the relevant literature supposedly showing “the scientific consensus on climate change.” in fact, there are plenty of dissenting papers in the literature, and this despite mounting evidence that the peer-review deck was stacked against them. the climategate scandal also underscored this: the climate scientists at the center of the controversy complained in their emails about dissenting papers that managed to survive the peer-review booby traps they helped maintain, and fantasized about torpedoing a respected climate science journal with the temerity to publish a dissenting article.(7) when consensus is declared hurriedly or before it even exists.a well-rooted scientific consensus, like a mature oak, usually needs time to emerge. scientists around the world have to do research, publish articles, read about other research, repeat experiments (where possible), have open debates, make their data and methods available, evaluate arguments, look at the trends, and so forth, before they eventually come to agreement. when scientists rush to declare a consensus, particularly when they claim a consensus that has yet to form, this should give any reasonable person pause.in 1992, former vice president al gore reassured his listeners, “only an insignificant fraction of scientists deny the global warming crisis. the time for debate is over. the science is settled.” in the real 1992, however, gallup “reported that 53% of scientists actively involved in global climate research did not believe global warming had occurred; 30% weren’t sure; and only 17% believed global warming had begun. even a greenpeace poll showed 47% of climatologists didn’t think a runaway greenhouse effect was imminent; only 36% thought it possible and a mere 13% thought it probable.” seventeen years later, in 2009, gore apparently determined that he needed to revise his own revisionist history, asserting that the scientific debate over human-induced climate change had raged until as late as 1999, but now there was true consensus. of course, 2009 is when climategate broke, reminding us that what had smelled funny before might indeed be a little rotten.(8) when the subject matter seems, by its nature, to resist consensus.it makes sense that chemists over time may come to unanimous conclusions about the results of some chemical reaction, since they can replicate the results over and over in their own labs. they can see the connection between the conditions and its effects. it’s easily testable. but many of the things under consideration in climate science are not like that. the evidence is scattered and hard to keep track of; it’s often indirect, imbedded in history and requiring all sorts of assumptions. you can’t rerun past climate to test it, as you can with chemistry experiments. and the headline-grabbing conclusions of climate scientists are based on complex computer models that climate scientists themselves concede do not accurately model the underlying reality, and receive their input, not from the data, but from the scientists interpreting the data. this isn’t the sort of scientific endeavor on which a wide, well-established consensus is easily rendered. in fact, if there really were a consensus on all the various claims surrounding climate science, that would be really suspicious. a fortiori, the claim of consensus is a bit suspicious as well.(9) when “scientists say” or “science says” is a common locution.in newsweek’s april 28, 1975, issue, science editor peter gwynne claimed that “scientists are almost unanimous” that global cooling was underway. now we are told, “scientists say global warming will lead to the extinction of plant and animal species, the flooding of coastal areas from rising seas, more extreme weather, more drought and diseases spreading more widely.” “scientists say” is hopelessly ambiguous. your mind should immediately wonder: “which ones?”other times this vague company of scientists becomes “science,” as when we’re told “what science says is required to avoid catastrophic climate change.” “science says” is an inherently weasely claim. “science,” after all, is an abstract noun. it can’t say anything. whenever you see that locution used to imply a consensus, it should trigger your baloney detector.(10) when it is being used to justify dramatic political or economic policies.imagine hundreds of world leaders and nongovernmental organizations, science groups, and united nations functionaries gathered for a meeting heralded as the most important conference since world war ii, in which “the future of the world is being decided.” these officials seem to agree that institutions of “global governance” need to be established to reorder the world economy and massively restrict energy resources. large numbers of them applaud wildly when socialist dictators denounce capitalism. strange philosophical and metaphysical activism surrounds the gathering. and we are told by our president that all of this is based, not on fiction, but on science—that is, a scientific consensus that human activities, particularly greenhouse gas emissions, are leading to catastrophic climate change.we don’t have to imagine that scenario, of course. it happened in copenhagen, in december. now, none of this disproves the hypothesis of catastrophic, human induced climate change. but it does describe an atmosphere that would be highly conducive to misrepresentation. and at the very least, when policy consequences, which claim to be based on science, are so profound, the evidence ought to be rock solid. “extraordinary claims,” the late carl sagan often said, “require extraordinary evidence.” when the megaphones of consensus insist that there’s no time, that we have to move, move, move!, you have a right to be suspicious.(11) when the “consensus” is maintained by an army of water-carrying journalists who defend it with uncritical and partisan zeal, and seem intent on helping certain scientists with their messaging rather than reporting on the field as objectively as possible.do i really need to elaborate on this point?(12) when we keep being told that there’s a scientific consensus.a scientific consensus should be based on scientific evidence. but a consensus is not itself the evidence. and with really well-established scientific theories, you never hear about consensus. no one talks about the consensus that the planets orbit the sun, that the hydrogen molecule is lighter than the oxygen molecule, that salt is sodium chloride, that light travels about 186,000 miles per second in a vacuum, that bacteria sometimes cause illness, or that blood carries oxygen to our organs. the very fact that we hear so much about a consensus on catastrophic, human-induced climate change is perhaps enough by itself to justify suspicion.to adapt that old legal aphorism, when you’ve got decisive scientific evidence on your side, you argue the evidence. when you’ve got great arguments, you make the arguments. when you don’t have decisive evidence or great arguments, you claim consensus.jay richards frequently writes for the enterprise blog and is a contributing editor of the american.
