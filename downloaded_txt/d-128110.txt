appreciation



“yungchen sings like an unearthly creature. her voice has the power to stop time and makes everything else in the world fall away. her voice transports you."— natalie merchant



“for a musician of yungchen lhamo’s towering reputation, you could be forgiven for expecting to hear a powerful, soaring soprano sound when you press play on her sixth studio album awakening. instead, lhamo’s singing voice befits her humble personality;.”— jared proudfoot for bandcamp






“yungchen joined our real world records label in 1996. the label was founded in 1989 to provide gifted musicians from around the world with access to state-of-the-art recording facilities, with the aim of bringing the music of the world to the world. we have been lucky to work with yungchen’s wonderful voice and music, which encapsulate the spirit, understanding and compassion of tibetan culture.”— peter gabriel



“each track has its own profound lyrical message, ranging from the suffering of our natural world and environment to the more recent phenomena of “monkey mind”—the inability of people to concentrate for extended periods of time. for a western audience, the album amounts to a snapshot of an under-represented worldview from a transcendent figure—one the world needs to hear a lot more from..”— jared proudfoot for bandcamp
