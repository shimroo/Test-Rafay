      testimonials
    
  ★★★★★
this is my first time at a compounding pharmacy, and it wasn’t a bad experience. i could easily submit my order through their portal, attach the prescription and get updates. they prepared it within a couple hours, and sent a text message, which is helpful in case you are not able to answer the phone. the pharmacists are informative, answering any questions you may have.-geethmi d.

after trying a cream from a drug store chain that did not work, my healthcare provider recommended i try a compounded product. after just two uses my symptoms of 6 months were gone and have remained so. i have found the customer service at reed’s compounding pharmacy to be excellent, timely and informative. dana reed is so knowledgeable and runs an efficient group of excellent professionals. my health care provider said that she calls dana regularly because she has so much respect for her. the entire pharmacy truly stepped up at the beginning of covid to make hand sanitizer when the need for it far outpaced the supply. and, they did not price gouge like they could have. we are fortunate to have this pharmacy and its staff here in tucson.- karen l.

reed's has been a part of my world since 2000 when i adopted a special needs cat from the humane society - iris needed medication that was able to be compounded for her with wonderful flavors and deliving that medication was so much easier that way! with her health issues, we were told we'd likely have a short time with her--well she lived to be 18 years old and was such a sweet part of our lives. thank you for all you do, reed's! there's so much more to you than people know!- kat r.

  ★★★★★
this place is one of tucson's gems. we are so lucky to have a pharmacy here that can accommodate to our needs with such attention and care. we have been using reed's for all of our compounding needs for almost 5 years. we have always had a positive experience here. the staff are super understanding when we forgot to call in our refill and needed our son's medication made last minute. they also have been able to order our supplements that we use for ourselves and also our children. they have tons of options available, including natural options, you only need ask and make it clear that's what you want. the staff is also super knowledgeable about about many of the the products and if the person helping you doesnt know, they always offer to do the research and call back. we have had to do that a few times regarding some supplements. we wouldn't trust any other pharmacy with our children's medications and supplements.- cess d.

after suffering a sever bite trying to pill my cat i contacted reed’s pharmacy. life changing! coco loves the chicken flavor. he purrs while willingly licking the syringe, and even licks his chops when done. no more scruffing, no more pinning down, and no more bloody fingers. thank you!- ashley d.

  





 
  ★★★★★
my family has used reed's for the past 4 or 5 years. i am always able to get my prescriptions filled easily. their knowledgeable staff is always able to answer any questions that i have easily and efficiently. i was recently in an auto accident and have since began using cbd products. their prices are very competitive and the array of products impressive. i have used oils, salves and lotions, depending on my needs. ( the lotion is an amazing peppermint infused one that i love when getting my massage). i would recommend reed's to anyone looking to support a local business rather than those chain stores. friendly, efficient and competitive.  thank you, reed's.- michele m.

  





 
  ★★★★★
i love coming to reed's for all my pet needs. they were perfect to make medicine for my cat. they even flavored it in chicken which is her favorite flavor!!! they were very quick and attentive and their customer service is the best. i will definitely be back here for all of my needs for any future animals or even myself if i need it!- bre r.

  





 
  ★★★★★
we needed medication for my son. he has allergies and cant do anything artificial. when we specifically made them aware of this and asked what our options were, they offered natural flavors to make the medicine flavorful and also still accommodate to his dietary needs. staff was very pleasant and we will definitely be back if we ever need anything else!!! thanks reed's ☺️- cecilia d.
