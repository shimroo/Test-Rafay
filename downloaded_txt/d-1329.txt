childbirth connection









with so much information out there on pregnancy and childbirth, it’s hard to know what to trust. but it’s important to become informed, because the care you receive during this time can have a big impact on your health, your baby’s health and your overall satisfaction.
to make informed decisions, women need access to evidence-based information and help navigating their maternity care throughout their pregnancy and birth journey. that’s why, for nearly 100 years, childbirth connection (now a core program of the national partnership for women & families) has connected women with just that kind of high-quality information.
we hope this information will empower you to take charge of your maternity care and guide you in making the best possible decisions for yourself and your baby.
