 "my education at dsm gave me a foundation to start and i am thankful for that! the education also touched on different subjects that piqued my interest and has given me something to look forward to learning more about."
olivia l., january 2014




     


 “dsm helped me to grow in ways i never imagined. i am grateful for the opportunity to study here, the people i met, and the experiences i was introduced to.”
jenna b., january 2018






       


 "the downeast school of massage provides topnotch education from leaders in the industry, which equips graduates to be highly effective critical thinkers and therapists who mindfully treat per each client’s individual needs. just as valuable are the caring support, personal growth and transformation, and close bonds formed all with a healthy dose of heart in a beautiful, relaxing setting. thankfully, the learning, guidance, and friendship continue well beyond graduation, because it’s a hard place to leave behind!"
kate g., september 2013




     


 “as a physical therapist, one of the primary reasons i enrolled in the dsm was to expand my hands-on manual therapy skills in my therapeutic “tool box.” i chose dsm because of their commitment to providing a scientific background as a foundation for all their students, as well as their reputation for providing a thorough massage education. the courses in anatomy, physiology, and kinesiology were comparable with those of my undergraduate education in exercise physiology.“what i came away with from the school was far more than i expected. not only did i expand my collection of manual therapy skills, but also i gained a whole new level of understanding of the healing benefits of hands-on treatment and massage.“the addition of massage in my practice will help bridge the medical model of client care with the more holistic health model of wellness and prevention.”
susan v., december 2008






       


 "as a student at dsm, i was given the guidance, techniques and knowledge to become a professional massage therapist in the state of maine. i am very grateful to have been given the opportunity to study with nancy and her colleagues. upon graduation, i will be working as a lmt in a collaborative non-profit center for healing. i truly believe that my education through dsm has given me the ability to make a difference in people’s lives with therapeutic massage.”
kat p., september 2013




     


 “my time at downeast school of massage will always stand out as a major life-changing experience that transformed my life for the better. i look forward to a life of balance and wellness as i serve others through the healing art of massage therapy!"
lauren a., september 2016
