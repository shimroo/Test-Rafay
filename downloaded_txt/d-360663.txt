red sands radio
                                          earlier this year, bob le-roi was forced to abandon his red sands radio website, after suffering a cyber attack, but radio london came to the rescue.
                                          chris and bob have worked very hard since then, in preparation for mooring the site beside ours and now the job is finished.
                                          bob's red sands radio, containing a  fascinating archive of not merely the stations on the thames forts, but of all the offshore stations and is now available again,
                                          hosted by radio london ltd – click on the banner below.

the biggest sixties  offshore reunion, ever!

on 14th august 2017, over 100 offshore radio personnel gathered on a ship on the thames to mark 50 years since the marine offences act decided that even though they were entertaining a third of the uk population with music, what they were doing had to be made illegal...

i want to send my thanks to you both for a really wonderful website. it's been over 10 years of wonderful news of offshore gems. you have both kept the interest of offshore radio alive, and it's magical – there is nothing in the whole of this world to beat it. i also believe that offshore would have died if the website wasn't around with the amount of news items, the hard work behind the scenes and the time that you both put into it. no other site has the same dedication on the same scale as yours.
i hope you will keep the site going for many more years to come and i feel you both should be awarded the mbe for keeping offshore radio alive on the site and in our hearts.

"i 
              could not possibly thank you enough for keeping the blood, sweat 
              and tears fresh and alive. without you, radio london would merely 
              be an ever-fading, occasional memory."

radio london founder, tom danaher (died 2015)


"you 
              have done an outstanding job in keeping the spirit of radio london 
              alive; i know my father would have been amazed and impressed that 
              something he started over 40 years ago is still being talked about. thank 
              you, mary, for all that you do."

              grey pierson, son of the late radio london founder, don pierson
