art and tradition in singapore red packet designs

posted on december 28, 2024 by suzanne snyder 



lunar new year in singapore is not only about family gatherings and festive foods; it’s also marked by the beloved tradition of exchanging red packets. these envelopes, filled with money, symbolise good fortune, prosperity, and blessings for the year ahead. in recent years, the designs on red packets have evolved, blending art and tradition to reflect singapore’s multicultural identity. let’s explore how red packets have transformed from simple envelopes into artistic expressions of culture.
the origins of red packets
the tradition of giving red packets dates back to the tang dynasty in china. according to legend, villagers used red paper to wrap coins to ward off a demon called “sui,” believed to harm children. the red color, associated with luck, was thought to offer protection. over time, the practice became a way for elders to bless younger family members during lunar new year.
in singapore, where diverse cultures coexist, the tradition has taken on local influences. originally, red packets were simple, decorated with gold calligraphy for “fortune” or “luck.” today, their designs are more intricate, reflecting singapore’s melting pot of cultures.
modern artistry in red packet designs
in recent years, singapore has seen a transformation in red packet designs. what was once a plain red envelope has turned into a canvas for creativity. designers now incorporate local elements like the merlion, orchids, or hawker food icons, making red packets distinctly singaporean. the rise of unique designs, such as those with peranakan patterns combining chinese, malay, and western influences, reflects the nation’s multicultural spirit.
designs have also moved beyond traditional red and gold, experimenting with pastel shades, bold colors, and even metallic finishes. limited-edition red packets from luxury brands or local artists are now highly sought after, adding an element of exclusivity.
tradition meets sustainability
in an age where sustainability is increasingly emphasised, singaporean companies are becoming more eco-conscious. many are opting for recycled paper, vegetable-based inks, and biodegradable materials in red packet production. this shift aligns with the growing interest in reducing waste while maintaining festive traditions.
bridging generations through art
red packet designs also serve as a bridge between generations. for older singaporeans, the exchange of hongbao is a nostalgic ritual that strengthens family bonds. for younger generations, the creative designs offer a modern twist on a beloved tradition. this fusion of the old and new allows the practice to stay relevant while respecting its roots.
some brands have incorporated traditional chinese artwork or calligraphy inside the red packets, educating younger recipients about cultural heritage. this approach keeps the tradition alive, adding depth to the modern designs.
the future of red packet designs
as singapore continues to evolve, so will the art of red packet design. designers are now exploring augmented reality (ar) features that can be scanned to reveal animations or personalised messages, blending tradition with technology. this innovation keeps the tradition fresh and exciting for younger generations.
there is also a renewed appreciation for red packets that reflect local culture, history, and values. by combining traditional symbols with modern aesthetics or sustainable materials, designers are ensuring that the red packet remains a meaningful gift in the digital age.
conclusion
the art and tradition of red packet designs in singapore beautifully capture the city-state’s essence. red packets are more than just envelopes; they’re pieces of art that tell stories, celebrate culture, and bring people together. as these designs continue to evolve, they not only preserve cultural heritage but also adapt to the changing times.

prevent dry winter skin in babies

posted on november 15, 2021 by suzanne snyder 



the cold weather affects baby’s skin
the winter season makes the skin of babies dry and itchy. it would help if you paid special attention when the weather is being changed. some paediatricians believe that winter doesn’t have to make your baby’s skin dry and itchy if you have already taken necessary actions to counter its harmful impacts. the skin of babies is more sensitive than adults, and it can lose a level of moisture rapidly. during the winter season, you need to be extra careful about dry skin in babies. you need to bring in some changes in the routine of your babies, and any season can pass by.
go for short bath times:
this probably is the number one part factor that can trigger dry skin in babies. a longer bath with very hot water tends to reduce the skin’s moisture, thus making it dry. babies indeed tend to relax in hot water, but lukewarm water for their skin is the best therapy. also, too long baths are said to harm the skin of babies and adults. you can keep the baby bath time to almost 10 to 15 minutes and use lukewarm water. if you want to apply any body wash, go for the mild and soft one. also, always choose the towel that hasn’t been washed with harsh detergents to pat dry the skin. these preventions are just for winter seasons; you need to adopt these for any season to keep the baby’s skin hydrated. 
don’t bathe in foamy, bubbly, or scented body washes:
parents tend to like scented and fragrance-prone soaps and powders for their children so they smell like flowers. but these elements can hurt the skin of your baby. you need to choose fragrance-free, hypoallergenic, and non-harsh products for bathing your child. we all must have seen pictures of a baby taking a bath in hot tubs with bubbles all around. it does look cute, but in reality, these things can dry the skin of your newborn. rather than making it artificial, make sure to use the baby products that have been recommended by dermatologists and made especially for the baby’s skin. you can also apply baby oil, the one that has been extracted from natural sources. avoid using artificial means on your baby’s skin and always choose natural products. 
use soft clothes for dryness of the baby’s body:
once the bath has been given, dry the body of the baby with a soft towel. you need not rub the towel against the body as the friction can give way to rashes. just pat dry and apply proper moisturizer to the entire body. it would be best if you were careful as some parts of the body are drier than others. look for those parts and apply lotion or moisturizer on those parts twice or thrice a day. 
conclusion
all babies are precious, and all parents are first-time parents at some point in time. go for a baby dry skin moisturiser in singapore if you need to get rid of dry skin. they need advice and suggestions to look after their kids. these articles are one way to help parents in bringing up their young ones with care.

rash creams – how to get the most out of them

posted on november 8, 2021 by suzanne snyder 



what is diaper rash?
diaper rash is a common condition that is caused by irritation from moisture or friction. a simple way to address it is by applying rash cream on the affected area. the cream will help shield the skin from moisture. this, thus, will prevent further irritation and encourage healing. 
as a parent, you have the freedom to buy basically any rash cream for your baby. that said, you need to keep in mind that not all rash creams on the market can actually deliver what they promise. what’s more, they may not be able to address the type of rash your baby is experiencing. 
for example, if your baby’s rash is caused by a fungal infection, just any rash cream may not be able to address the issue.  the lesson here is to find the underlining cause of your baby’s rash before buying a rash cream. 
regardless of the rash cream you eventually purchase, there are a few things you must do to get the most out of it. read on to learn about some of them. 
getting the most out of your rash cream
truth be told, rash creams are expensive, especially high-quality ones. to get the most out of them, you have to follow some of these tips. 
choose the right cream 
as mentioned, not all rash creams on the market can address the issue of your baby. so, before choosing a rash cream, regardless of how high quality it is, you should consult a paediatrician. these professionals have the skills and expertise to deduce the underlining cause of a rash. what’s more, they will be able to recommend the best product for it. 
leverage petroleum jelly 
as you likely know, rash creams are expensive. if you are on a budget, using them every day may not be an option. an excellent alternative for rash cream is petroleum jelly. petroleum jelly can help reduce friction and prevent moisture from touching the skin. 
you should save your rash cream for when your baby has a rash outbreak. 
use the rash cream moderately
many parents have the notion that over-applying rash cream will yield good results, but this isn’t true. in fact, applying too much rash cream may make your baby uncomfortable.  
to get the best result, you should apply the cream moderately. 
follow the instruction 
some rash cream comes with detailed instructions on how to use them. most times, these instructions are clearly written on the product packaging. 
remember that not all products are made to be administered the same way and manner. some products may require you to clean the affected area before applying them. others may have labels stating that they should be shaken properly before use. 
final notes 
moisturing rash creams for babies come in different variances that can help address serious or mild rash. before picking a rash cream, it is important that you first find out the underlying cause of your baby’s issue. while doing this may not be easy, it will go a long way in ensuring that you choose the best one for your baby.

instead of using deodorant, make sure that you are applying antiperspirant more frequently.
try to stay clear from restrictive and tight clothing and artificial fibers like nylon.
when you wear either white or black colored clothing, it can bring down visible signs of sweating.
make sure that you are wearing that are made of leather. try not to wear the same pairs of shoes daily.

use shields for your armpit so that excessive sweat can be absorbed and your clothes can be protected too.

stronger antiperspirants
when your sweating can not be controlled by a regular antiperspirant, your general practitioner may suggest or prescribe a stronger antiperspirant for you. often antiperspirants that constitute of aluminum chloride are used in the treatment of hyperhidrosis. an antiperspirant plugs your sweat gland thus reducing sweat. it should be regularly applied at night before your sleeping time. it should be washed off the next morning. regular use of moisturizers or emollients and soap substitutes can also be helpful.
