what is webphysics?


web physics is a flexible low budget outlet for small volume,

high quality, html based curricular material.

web physics provides a forum for physics educators to exchange

curriculum ideas and resources that make use of the web technology

(primarily public domain material.)

webphysics provides a medium for the dissemination of student

work.

webphysics is democratic. let the democracy of the net do

the weeding.
