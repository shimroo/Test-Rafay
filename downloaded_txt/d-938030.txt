finished this prototype today as my first project after the  bladeshow...it was nice to work on something like this to get started  again after more than a week out of the shop....turned out really nice  in my opinion. the knife is based on the most recent outbreak. the main  difference is the blade features a spyderco opening hole instead of a  thumbstud.the knife features a 3 1/4" handrubbed blade in .200"  rwl-34, 7 3/4" overall... frame made from contoured .140" titanium.  all  the titanium parts has been beadblasted, anodized, stonewashed and  anodized again for a very cool suttle look and feel. the screws and  standoffs are heatcolored ...this knife will sell via auction. the  auction will be open for 24 hours from posting. (thats friday the 17th  approx 2.00 pm east coast time )to place a bid you can email  (info(at)ansoknives.com) me your bid. to avoid any last minutte sniping  the auction will run 10 mins after the last bid. (i will close the  auction on saturday the 18th at 2.00 pm east coast time or 10 mins after  the last bid) the winning bidder will pay shipping of $35 anywhere in  the world. bidders from europe please contact me before bidding as vat  have to be added to the final bid.auction is now closedwinning bid: $1450i
