alert - we have reports of students being scammed by someone posing as a landlord for properties they do not own/manage. check ownership and licensing of landlord/property manager. phone numbers alone can be spoofed, so corroborate authenticity with supplemental info. meet: when possible, meet in person. don’t rent unseen unless you’ve verified the property with a trusted source. reach out to our office for more information.
