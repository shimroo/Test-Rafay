“i had the honor of meeting with career services, and they were very helpful. we discussed resume building, interviews, how to introduce myself at booths, and researching the companies before meeting and always carrying a notepad with questions. i also had the opportunity to attend some events, such as the one hosted by northwestern mutual. i had the opportunity to use my attire from the career closet at the fall career fair. my experience with career services allowed me to earn my first internship with state farm and to be invited to the aspiring leaders program by northwestern mutual. having the resources at career services has definitely helped me start my career and begin networking, especially knowing the importance of linkedin to connect with people!”
