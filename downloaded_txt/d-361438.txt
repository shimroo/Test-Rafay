aloha



  welcome to the waikōloa village association (wva)
located on the western slope of mauna kea, waikōloa village is close to the renowned hapuna beach,  mauna lani beach resort, and mauna kea beach resorts. the village offers majestic views of the kohala coast and five nearby volcanoes: mauna kea, mauna loa, kohala, hualālai, and haleakalā on maui. the village is known for its warm weather, tropical breezes, stunning sunsets, and homey aloha spirit. 
 
waikōloa village is an open and inclusive community accessible to people of all ages. much of that community is part of the waikōloa village association. the purpose of the wva is to provide management, maintenance, protection, preservation, development, and architectural control of the common property for its membership. more information about the association can be found by clicking on the association tab.
 
the wva owns and manages a stunning robert trent jones ii golf course, the village course, a brand-new aquatic center, and the waikōloa stables. information and details about all our amenities can be found by clicking on the amenities tab. 

 
there are three county parks; four houses of worship; a public k-8 primary and middle school; a number of community service organizations; and a shopping center, waikōloa highlands shopping center, in the village. a new shopping center, plaza shopping center, is currently under construction next to the u.s. post office. available medical services include primary care, dental care, vision care, and veterinarian services.
 
free non-profit survey technology provided by questionpro. thanks to questionpro for providing us over 35 question types to choose from. the advanced question types help us collect deep insights.
 
apart from the free survey software, we also have access to questionpro's free survey templates. we've found many of them useful and powerful to collect insights from various stakeholders of our organization.

the village course


our robert trent jones ii course features generous fairways and well-guarded greens. wide, forgiving landing areas encourage aggressive tee shots while the large, well-bunkered and undulating greens provide a test for any level of golfer. #playthevillagecourse
