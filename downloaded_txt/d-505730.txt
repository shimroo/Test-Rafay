                                                        steiner (1861-1925) was 
                                                        an austrian thinker and 
                                                        lecturer of striking originality. 
                                                        claiming direct experience 
                                                        of the spiritual world, 
                                                        he spoke in great detail 
                                                        about 



                                                what he saw there.

                                                     results of steiner's insights
                                                    
                                                  prompted a large number of
                                                    practical  initiatives, including

                                                  (the biodynamic movement),

                                                  in some 40 volumes of written
                                                     work and almost 300 volumes
                                                    
                                                  of lecture transcripts have
                                                     sparked controversy from
                                                    the 
                                                  outset. during steiner's lifetime
                                                     it was widely considered
                                                    that 
                                                  logic and spirituality were
                                                     incompatible. from one side
                                                    
                                                  it was argued that since the
                                                     spiritual did not exist,
                                                    any 
                                                  discussion of it was ipso facto
                                                     absurd. from another, his
                                                    ideas 
                                                  were considered heretical in
                                                     as much as they did not
                                                    confirm 
                                                  the favored ideology of the
                                                     moment (be it theosophical,

                                                     in his lifetime, his efforts
                                                    
                                                  at social reform were opposed
                                                     by the extreme right and
                                                    the 
                                                  extreme left, and he was even,
                                                     without any factual basis,
                                                    denounced 
                                                  by hitler as an agent of jewish
                                                     conspiracy. this was not

                                                  first or the last time he would

                                                     to defend himself today.
                                                    whether 
                                                  you like or dislike his ideas,

                                                    mischaracterizations 
                                                  purporting to represent the 
                                                  "real" steiner. many
                                                   of his ideas are "out
                                                   there." 
                                                  they might seem quite strange;
                                                   however, with a little effort,
                                                  
                                                  an open mind and basic logic
                                                   it is possible to understand
                                                  
                                                  them. at that point you can
                                                   choose to agree or disagree,
                                                  
                                                  to believe or disbelieve. however,
                                                   i feel that this step of first
                                                  
                                                  understanding before agreeing
                                                  or disagreeing is often skipped.

                                                  to defend steiner and his ideas
                                                     from the many misrepresentations
                                                    
                                                  that are currently circulating.

                                                  or fail to do in his name is
                                                     beyond the scope of this
                                                    endeavor, 
                                                  though i will touch on it where

                                                  attempt here only to represent
                                                     steiner's ideas without

                                                  judgments. such judgments,
