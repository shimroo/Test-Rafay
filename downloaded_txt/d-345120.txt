maryam and birth of isa (jesus): a divine miracles in islamic traditionin the islamic tradition, the story of maryam (mary) and her miraculous delivery of isa (jesus) is a tale of divine intervention, faith, and purity, deeply revered in the quran. maryam, held in high esteem as the epitome of virtue and devotion among women, is the only woman mentioned by name in the quran, which underscores her significance in islamic theology. according to islamic scripture, maryam was dedicated to the service of god from a young age, secluding herself in prayer. when the angel jibreel (gabriel) appeared to her with the news that she would bear a son, she was initially astonished, questioning how she could have a child when no man had touched her. the angel replied that for god, this was a simple matter, and thus jesus would be a sign for humanity and a mercy from god. this conception was miraculous, emphasizing god's power over creation. the holy quran narrates that when the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm tree, she wished she had died before this moment and been forgotten. however, a voice comforted her, instructing her to shake the trunk of the palm tree so that fresh, ripe dates would fall for her to eat, and to drink from a nearby stream. this provision was a mercy from god, easing her labor and sustaining her. after the birth of isa, she faced her community, who accused her of impropriety. in response, she pointed to the infant isa, who, by the will of god, spoke in her defense, proclaiming his prophethood and servitude to god even from the cradle. this story in the quran highlights themes of divine provision, the miracle of life, and the importance of faith and patience in the face of adversity. maryam's story is celebrated as an example of unwavering devotion to god and is a testament to the miraculous in the everyday, serving as a source of inspiration and guidance for believers.  in this chapter we will shade light on the issue of mariam delivery and return to her people (in the book the lamp in a glass) – see amazon and lulu books.    maryam is mentioned 27 times in the holy quran, and her mention is associated with christ jesus (peace be upon him), as she is his mother who conceived him by a direct order from god, as he created him from a mother without a father, just as he created adam without having parents.   the process of creating a human being according to the law enacted by god for humans is summarized by the occurrence of a reductive division in the number of chromosomes inside the sperm to become half the number of chromosomes, i.e. 23, and the same thing happens inside the egg to be 23 chromosomes as well, so that a full number of chromosomes, 46, is born from fertilization, half from the mother and the other half from the father. modern science was able to clone an organism from a mother only, without performing meiosis, so the number of chromosomes remained the same in the mother's cell without fertilization. parthenogenesis is surprisingly common throughout the tree of life and is found in a variety of organisms, including plants, insects, fish, reptiles and even birds. there are some organisms that reproduce sexually, but their females sometimes produce eggs that do not need to be fertilized and are able to divide and form a new organism from an unfertilized egg without the need for a male. or, more likely, meiosis takes place and then the egg is fertilized by the polar body that results from the meiosis of the egg itself (in other words, the egg fertilizes itself), and these polar bodies can carry the y element needed to determine the male's sex.   the process of oogenesis by meiosis results in a mature egg with half of the chromosomes and 3 polar bodies   in some creatures, the egg is fertilized by a virgin mating in which one of the polar bodies fertilizes the egg, so there is no need for a male  science does not yet understand exactly how parthenogenesis occurs and how the offspring of the fetus is determined, but it is in fact very present and clear and may be done by polar bodies according to the opinion of specialists.    in any case, god almighty is able to do everything (by be and it is). “the parable of jesus in the sight of allah is like the parable of adam, whom he created from dust and then said to him, ‘be and it will be,’” (59 al-imran).   hannah, the wife of imran, a descendant of the prophet david and solomon (peace be upon them and upon muhammad), was the mother of maryam. hannah remained barren and did not conceive from imran until she was sixty years old. one day she saw a bird feeding its chicks, and she wished to have a son so that she could love him like that bird, so she prayed to allah to give her a son.and she said: o allah, if you give me a son, i will donate him to the service of the holy house. when the woman of imran said, “lord, i have vowed to you what is in my womb freely, so accept from me, for you are the all-hearing and all-knowing (35 al-imran).” (holy quran) god answered her prayer and she became pregnant, and when she gave birth, the newborn was a female, not a male. when she gave birth, she said, “lord, i have given birth to a girl, and god knows what she has given birth to, and there is no male like a female, and i have named her mary, and i will protect her and her offspring from the evil devil.” (36 al-imran, al-imran) in this verse, the qur'an has favored the female over the male, as the tool of similitude has entered the similitude (the female). originally, it should have entered the similitude, but it entered here on the similitude because of the clarity of the situation, as the original is (not the female like the male), but it was changed from this original; because the meaning: the male who asked is not like the female who was given; because this female is better than him.  hannah took maryam to the temple and placed her with the pontiffs, the sons of aaron (peace be upon him), and said to them, “don't forget this prophetess. imran was a virtuous man and one of the great scholars of his time among the israelites, and he died before the birth of mary, so she was born an orphan, so the pontiffs competed as to who would sponsor mary, and zacharias asked to sponsor her and said: i am more entitled to her because i have her aunt (elisha) my wife so he is her uncle. imran, maryam's father, was their teacher and the one who taught them their religion and favored them. they agreed to stand on the riverbed and throw their pens (they chose the pen because abu maryam had taught them with the pen). the last pen that stays in the river without being washed away is the one that vouches for her. they threw their pens and their pens were washed away and zechariah's pen stood up, meaning that it was not the last one, but it stood right in the river. they threw a second time and the same thing happened as the first time, i.e., zechariah's pen stood in the river. they threw the third time and the pen stood in the river again, so zakariyya sponsored her and he (her aunt's husband).the almighty said:this is from the revelations of the unseen that we have revealed to you, and you were not there when they cast their pens to decide which of them would sponsor mary, and you were not there when they were disputing (al-imran, 44) her lord accepted her with a good acceptance and gave her a good upbringing, and zachariah took care of her. whenever zachariah entered the room, he found food for her, and he said, “o mary, where did you get this?” she said, “it is from god, for god provides for whomever he wishes without reckoning” (37 al-imran)    mary grew up in the service of the temple, and throughout that time she was a devout worshipper in the sanctuary of the mosque, spending her nights in remembrance, worship, prayer, and fasting, as the angels began to speak to mary while she was in the temple.  the angels began to speak to mary while she was in the temple, telling her that god had chosen her: “when the angels said, 'o mary, allah has chosen you, purified you, and set you apart from the women of the world.  o mary, obey your lord, prostrate yourself and kneel with those who kneel.” (42 al-imran) then gabriel (peace be upon him) descended upon her while she was in her seclusion worshiping allah in the form of a man to announce to her the messiah as her son; she took a veil from them, so we sent our spirit to her, and he appeared to her as a normal human being. she said, “i seek refuge in the merciful from you, if you are pious.  he said, “i am the messenger of your lord to give you a son.  she said, “how can i have a son when no man has touched me, and i have not been a prostitute?  he said, “thus says your lord, it is easy for me, and we will make him a sign to people and a mercy from us.” (18-21 maryam – holy quran) maryam saw an angel in the form of a human being. he did not say a man, and the word “human being” means that he is a human being, neither female nor male, and he is straight, that is, not like other human beings, but free from evil and obscenity, so he is not human in nature, but free from evil and obscenity, human being from the annunciation, not a man. when mary saw this human being, she sought refuge from him by al-rahman, not by allah, because she was not sure whether this human being was pious, i.e. worshipping allah or not, so she sought refuge by al-rahman, who is the lord of all things whether they accept or not (the owner).  al-rahman is one of 99 names of allah. otherwise, if she had known that he was a believer in god, she would have said, “i seek refuge in allah from you.” this is the name of divinity, which is believed only by those who worship god. this is the reason why the angle answered by saying, “i am the messenger of your lord.” he did not say the messenger of your god or from god, because he used the similar term, which she used.  then he used the word “to give” which is derived from al-wahab, which is the name of god, which means that this gift is free from objections and purposes, then mary did not object but inquired how this could be, and the answer was that it is easy for god, and in the speech also used the word your lord, which is a sign to the people and a mercy from god. in this verse, mary was cleared of what the jews said about her. according to most sources, mary was about 14 years old when she became pregnant and showed signs of pregnancy, so she went out in fear to a place where she could hide from the eyes of people so as not to attract attention.   when she went into labor, she was sad and wished to die before that; when the labor brought her to the trunk of the palm tree, she said, "o that i had died before this, and i was a forgotten person," (23 maryam) maryam wished that she was dead and had been forgotten, which indicates her poor mental state. so, she needed something to reassure her, especially after returning to her people, so isa began to speak to her, and this is what would help her among the people, almighty god said:and he called to her from underneath her, 'do not grieve, your lord has made you a sacred underneath you,'" (24 maryam) the sacred (in arabic, sarya) is the honorable master, and this is the closest explanation, and it is also interpreted as a running river, but maryam needed the child's words more because it is he who saves her from the sorrow she is in, not the running river. the one (from under her) must be the voice of the child, and this gave her relief and hope and took away her sadness. postpartum grief can cause death and other complications such as lactation anemia and postprandial depression; “and shake unto thee the trunk of the palm tree, and it shall fall upon thee with fresh dates.  eat, drink, and rest your eyes, and if you see any human being, say, "i have made a vow of fasting to the merciful (alrahman), so i will not speak to a human being today." (25-26 maryam) mary needed more reassurance, so she heard the voice (the voice of her son) telling her to shake (the trunk) of the palm tree and that if she saw a human being, she should leave the matter to him who would answer, and she would fast from speaking.so, the newborn spoke to her before birth, during birth, and after birth, and this is what made her reassured, so she decided that she would return and the newborn would defend her with his words with the people, or she would fast from speech. in the time of maryam (peace be upon her), fasting from speech was a well-known practice that people resorted to in times of distress and adversity, to enhance their worship of god or to thank god, such as the fast of prophet zacharias.  fasting from speech has many medical and psychological benefits. language and social communication require brain work that can be exhausting because it is about generating thoughts and converting them into understandable language, as well as converting the language of others into thoughts that the brain analyzes and responds to, a very complex process known as (thought processing) that involves all areas of the brain. this process is usually more stressful and can go wrong when a person is in a state of stress. fasting from speech is a rest for the brain and brain from the fatigue caused by thinking, analyzing and speaking, and relaxation from the burden of constant speech that generates calm and comfort for the mind, the soul, and getting rid of anxiety, stress, repression, and social and psychological pressures. mary looked at the palm tree and found only a stump with no moisture in it, and the season was not yet for dates, but she complied with the call and began to shake the stump, which in itself helps in childbirth because it expands the pelvis, strengthens its muscles, and increases uterine contractions to expel the fetus. the verb "shake" has a root that indicates turbulence and movement, such as the shaking of the wind, meaning (its movement and sound), and this is what the woman makes when giving birth, inhaling, exhaling and pushing without disturbance. in the arabic language, the letter "eh" is a weak letter, so it means pushing gently, which is the opposite of the verb (az), which means moving, stirring and disturbing, like the fizzing of boiling water, and then since the letter "huzai" is a letter of strength and intensity, it is a strong push, as in the words of almighty god; “did you not see that we have sent the devils against the unbelievers, so that they may be augmented?" (83 maryam)- haza in arabic. because maryam complied with the command, dates began to fall on her, and falling implies continuity, and the harvest is what is good and fit to be taken care of.  here it must be pointed out that the trunk of the palm tree cannot be shaken easily, so how is it when she is an exhausted, weak and sad woman in labor? god was able to provide her with whatever he wanted, as it happened before in the temple when the fruit came to her out of season, but wisdom required that she help herself to give birth, and if god had shaken that trunk and mary saw it, it may have increased her fear, but her compliance with the command helped her, and this reminds us of the compliance of (abraham and ismail, peace be upon them) where he said: almighty, who said: when he came with him, he said, "my son, i see in a dream that i am slaughtering you, so see what you see." he said, "o father, do as you are commanded, and you will find me, if allah wills, of those who are patient" (102 al-safat).     dates fruits contains oxytocin in large quantities, which helps with childbirth, uterine contractions, milk production, and stopping bleeding. it is a complete food of proteins, sugar, fibers, and easily absorbed sugars that help avoid low blood sugar in the mother and the fetus, which is a dangerous condition for the baby's brain if it occurs. these are all things that god could have avoided, but he is able to make everything a cause, so he takes the causes.  so, the trunk of the palm tree prepared some reasons for the birth and prepared water, the right food, and the right position.  maryam was reassured when the newborn spoke to her, which made her not afraid when she returned to the people.  she returned, and they blamed her for what she had done; she brought him to her people carrying himthey said, "o mary, you have brought a terrible thing.  sister of aaron, your father was not a bad man and your mother was not a prostitute (27-28 maryam) maryam pointed to the newborn, reassured that he would speak and defend his mother, and indeed this happened; she pointed to him (because she was fasting from speaking) they said, "how can we speak to someone who was in the cradle as a child?  he said, "i (the servant of allah) have given me the scripture (and made me a prophet)  he made me blessed wherever i was, and commanded me to pray and give zakat (charity) as long as i live.   peace be upon me on the day i am born, on the day i die, and on the day i am resurrected (30-33 maryam) it is surprising that we refer to the verse:therefore, if you see any of the humans, say, "i have made a vow of fasting to al-rahman, so i will not speak to any human being today" (26:maryam)   this is because al-rahman is the name of the lord, who is the owner of everything sane and non-sane, and who acts without speech, i.e., he does not need to say "be" to be, so he acts without movement or speech, as he is the lord of the heavens and the earth; the lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them is the merciful one (al-rahman), from whom they have no speech (37 al-naba') mary was speechless at the time, and the one who uttered isa was the rahman, so he made mary's innocence through the utterance of the infant.  this is a miracle aimed at obtaining merciful innocence. it is also the innocence of polytheism and the trinity that will occur later, because the first word that isa said was "he is the servant of allah and made him a prophet" and this is important for what he will become in the future.  the almighty said; and he speaks to people in the crib and as an infant, and among the righteous (46 al-imran) and the almighty said: i supported you with the holy spirit, and you spoke to people in the crib and as a child, and i taught you the scripture and wisdom (110 al-ma'idah)   despite its high importance, the issue of jesus (peace be upon him) being spoken to in the cradle by his followers was not mentioned in the bible. it was of paramount importance to his mother's innocence of obscenity in a merciful innocence. the reason why it was not mentioned by his followers throughout the ages is because isa's first words were "i am a servant of god, then he said that he is a prophet." if they had mentioned that he spoke in the cradle, they would have had to mention what he said, as this is his first speech, which undermines the entire christian doctrine that considers isa to be the son of god or even god.

 where did water came from to earth and what is the dwelling water? allah said in the holy quran:and we send down water from the sky according to (due) measure, and we cause it to dwell in the earth; and we certainly are able to drain it off. with it we grow for you gardens of date-palms and vines: in them have ye abundant fruits: and of them ye eat (and have enjoyment).  (18 – 19 al-mu'minoon)- dwell فَأَسْكَنَّاهُ it means to reside there inside the earth. وَأَنْزَلْنَا مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً بِقَدَرٍ فَأَسْكَنَّاهُ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَإِنَّا عَلَىٰ ذَهَابٍ بِهِ لَقَادِرُونَ.  فَأَنْشَأْنَا لَكُمْ بِهِ جَنَّاتٍ مِنْ نَخِيلٍ وَأَعْنَابٍ لَكُمْ فِيهَا فَوَاكِهُ كَثِيرَةٌ وَمِنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ.  َ (١٨ – ١٩ المؤمنون). and allah said: and we sent down water from the sky, then we gave it to you, and you are (unable of its storage) (22 al-hajar) (it means the process of its storage is complicated that only can be managed by god) the first verse says that god sent down water from the sky with a measure.  in language, “qadr” means “capable” or “mighty”, and it means “with precise estimation”, which refers to the water cycle in nature, as god is capable of it, capable of managing it, capable of continuing it, and appreciative of its destiny, i.e. all the attributes are combined in the word “qadr”.  this means allah brought the water in after it came down from the sky and stored it inside the earth and made a way for it, so it settled in the earth and dwelt in stores inside it, but it can come out again when it is needed.  this is not about the outside on surface water but the stored one.  god is able to make a path for this water and preserve it so that it flows like the oceans but in the interior of the earth to supply what is on exterior surface water of the earth from the storage water.  so, he made that water a path and a passage in the earth's interior for a wise purpose and a delicate balance (fate) and that its source is from heaven.  in a study conducted at the university of glasgow in the united kingdom and the university of curtin in australia, it was found that the source of water on earth came from the sky by (meteorites) saturated with water, while other meteorites were found to contain atoms that, if they interacted with solar storms, resulted in large amounts of light water, which later formed the water on the surface of the earth, while the other type of water descended into the earth's interior and was stored there as a reserve for the water on the surface. without this stored water, the water on the surface would have run out in the seas and oceans.   there are two types of meteorites:type c meteorites: these are the ones that carry heavy water and make up 75% of meteorites type s meteorites:  they are the ones in which light water is formed by the interaction of hydrogen h coming from the sun, which is strongly ejected at a temperature of up to two million degrees celsius with the atoms of the meteorite, producing h2o (light water), which constitutes about 75% of the earth's water.   the research team conducted a similar experiment on a piece of s-type meteorite called itokawa, resulting in the formation of light water at a rate of 20 liters per cubic meter of the meteorite.  the process of light water formation from the interaction of solar storms with s-type meteorites   the formation of water in the sky and its descent to the earth  on the other hand, several underground rivers have been discovered. an underground river is a river or stream that runs wholly or partially underground, where the bottom of the river does not represent the surface of the earth.  however, the verse is talking about another water that has dwelt and stored in the subsoil that is different from groundwater and surface water.  in other words, the verse is talking about the water stored underground, not the groundwater near the surface.   groundwater is water that flows like a river but is contained within a permeable layer of rock or other unconsolidated material. these rivers would be a great source of water if humans could extract them.  according to this verse, there are two cycles of water in nature, one surface, such as the seas, oceans, rivers and groundwater, and the other subterranean, inside the earth, which acts as a reserve for the first.    in a paper recently published by environmental scientists from germany in nature geoscience, the researchers concluded that there are two water cycles in nature.  the first is the one we know about - the oceans, seas, clouds, rain, rivers, etc. and the second is the one we don't know much about - the cycle of water stored inside the earth, which is of paramount importance to the water on the surface.  to this day, according to the research paper, scientists do not have a clear perception of how water flows in the earth's interior (and we sent down from the sky water with a measure of fate, and we dwelled it in the earth, and we are able to go away with it – means make passages for it inside the earth) (holy quran).   when the tectonic plates of the earth move, the water molecules are trapped in the rocks, forming minerals with different chemical compositions. in areas where the plates collide, the stored water molecules emerged up to the surface as water.   god described this process in the holy quran as very strong that needs huge ability that man cannot and unable to do it.   oliver blomber, a researcher at utrecht university and lead author of the study, said: “using state-of-the-art rock analysis and advanced numerical modeling, we were able to show a complex pattern of channels within the rocks. “from nanoscale to meters in length, we saw clear channels forming at the onset of water release and with surprising speed.  these channels resemble hidden river systems that carry water through the solid subsoil and eventually join into large upward channels where the water is pushed back to the earth's surface, often through volcanic activity. “previous concepts of the earth's deep water cycle usually assume that water moves slowly throughout the entire rock without forming channels, but this is clearly not the case,” said his colleague tim john, a researcher at the free university of berlin.    huge oceans of water were found inside pressurized rocks (and we dwelled it in the earth – holy quran) 410 miles from the surface   the holy qur'an mentions water coming down from the sky in the past tense (anzal or anzalna) 14 times, while the verb descending is mentioned at least 6 times.   the almighty said: who made the earth a bed for you and the sky a building, and sent down water from the sky and brought forth water from the fruits for your sustenance, so you should not make allah an idol while you know it (22 al-baqarah), i.e. he created the earth and made it a bed, i.e. comfortable and safe for living, while he built the sky as we have shown, and then sent down water from the sky, i.e. after it was built.   bringing down water from the sky has two meanings: the descent of water from the sky by meteorites, as we mentioned, resulting in surface waters, which are the seas, oceans, rivers, and groundwater, and underground waters in the interior of the earth as a reserve for what is on the surface water coming down from the clouds as part of the underground surface water cycle then it became a cycle between the earth and the earth's atmosphere, which is the second meaning of the sky.  that is, first the water descended by meteorites, then it had two cycles, one from its stock in the interior of the earth and the second from its water on its surface and in its atmosphere, as the almighty said; allah said: haven't you seen that allah sent down from the sky water, which flows into the earth, and then brings forth crops of different colors, and then it waxes hot and you see it yellowish, and then makes it a wreck, that in this is a reminder for those who have the best intellects (al-zumar 21) and what the almighty says:  “did you bring it (water) down from the muzn, or are we the ones who brought it down?” (69 al-raqa'a) according to the dictionaries of the arabic language, muzn means hastening to seek what it needed and then went to its destination.  muzn also means it comes from distance, which also associated with calamites, and it also means the bottle filled with water.  muzn is also means a luminous thing.    these meanings all apply to meteorites, as they are fast and appear to fulfill their purpose and vanish and they come from distant space and may lead to disasters as well.  it would be more meaningful if the verse were interpreted as water coming down to the earth through meteorites (muznah), and it is okay if both meanings are correct, i.e. meteorites bringing down water first and then clouds as part of the surface water cycle, (one word describe two meaning)   as for the reason why it is called the clouds, it is because of this verse, as the early commentators interpreted it as a luminous or white cloud, and we know that distant white clouds are usually not rainy.  also, rain is described in the quran with other descriptions such as ghayth, tal, wuduq, wail, as well as water.    one may say that man has been able to create clouds that bring down rain, so how can this be consistent with the saying, “did you bring it down from the balance or are we the ones who bring it down?” here comes the first concept or interpretation, which is the muzn or the meteorites.   the water god make to dwell inside earththe water that is stored more than 400 miles below the earth's crust is one of the miracles of creation and the great divine ability that only the almighty god is capable of.  the holy qur'an states; “and we sent down water from the sky, and we gave it to you, and you are not hoarders” (22 al-hajar)  - it means god is the one who hoarded it, (this verse in arabic means you are unable to store that water) - فَأَنزَلْنَا مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً فَأَسْقَيْنَاكُمُوهُ وَمَا أَنتُمْ لَهُ بِخَازِنِينَ ﴿٢٢ الحجر﴾  the holy qur'an says:  “there is nothing except that we have its treasuries, and we do not bring it down except by a known amount” (21 al-hajar),  and (allah has the treasuries of the heavens and the earth, but the hypocrites do not understand” (7 al-munafiqun)).   he said, “i do not say to you that i have the treasuries of allah, nor do i know the unseen,” (31 hud 31)  and he said,  “we have watered you with it, and you are not storing it for yourself, because you cannot do that, for it is in the earth's interior, so you are only able to store the surface water, but what is in the interior of the earth, we store it for you, and we watered you with it, meaning that we give you part of it )part by part(.    in the language, it is said (he drew from his water), meaning he took something from this water (the stored),  given by a specific share added to the oceans and seas - (we watered you)). this stored water is different from the one mentioned in the next verse; haven't you seen that allah sent down water from the sky and wired it into springs in the earth, and then brought forth crops of different colors, and then it grows wild and you see it yellowish and then make it a wreck, for this is a reminder for those who have the best minds (al-zumar, 21) whereas the latter is the form of springs, which is the water on the surface of the earth, so he described it with the word (he wired it), while the former was (storage it).  this stockpile is the one that god brings out of its place and location or brings it from one state to another, such as water from the state of ho, turning it into the state of h2o, as god said: “he brought out of it, its water and its pasture” (31 al-naz'at), meaning that he brought out of the earth its water from one state to another.  so, its stored in a different state that converted to water when needed.   scientists say that the stockpile of water is found in rocks that work as a sponge to store huge amounts of water in them.  these rocks are ringwoodite, which contains the hydrogen oxide oh, which is part of the water molecule. when volcanoes occur, for example, oh combines with a hydrogen molecule to form h2o water, which is added to the oceans and helps to form (magma), (he brought out of it its water and its pasture {31 al-nazarat}).   water is stored in the form of oh molecules in the structure of rocks because it spoils if it is water or evaporates if stored as h2o.    water is stored in the earth at a depth of more than 400 kilometers from the surface in the form of oh (hydrogen oxide) and is added to the oceans(and we gave you water, and you are not stewards of it) (he brought out of it its water and its pasture) conclusions:the holy quran mentioned that water origin is from heaventhe holy quran mentioned two type of water cycles one is the surface and cloud and what is inside the surface and this is h2o and there is another water cycle stored under strong conditions in the rocks and it supply the surface water in a precise way and its water is stored in different form and when needed convert into water to make the surface water not to run away this is ho convert to h2o. of course the holy quran did not mention ho and h2o.  praise be to allah, the almighty
