what our clients have to say 



don't take our word for it 










						we brought our 1 year old pit mix to wag n tails. had great results after only 2 visits with christine! i'm amazed at how far our dog has come in such a short time. he had all kinds of issues, over excitement, barking, not getting along with other dogs, being too mouthy. we tried 2 other trainers before coming to christine, and were feeling really discouraged. do not give up hope, christine and her staff know what they're doing! you will feel empowered. you will see immediate results. we're back in control of our dog, not the other way around. 5 stars!!!⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

						beautiful, clean welcoming studio.they were so kind and patient with my new puppy after covid. also we had a virtual puppy training class with christine during covid19 and we absolutely loved it and her. can't wait to take jasmin to more puppy class and daycare. thank you wag 'n' tail for an outstanding service.

						shelly seriously treated my dog like she was hers. she knew so many tips and tricks to help ease my diamond’s anxiety. i will never go to another groomer. she is beyond knowledgeable when it comes to animals and my dog smells sooooo good! 
thanks again for being awesome. you have a customer for life.

						the training staff are amazing. the dogs are taught to play, learn, relax, and be wonderful animals. the training classes have been very helpful in his development as a therapy dog. highly recommended!					


mike laferle 






						wag'n tails is my first and only choice for training, daycare, boarding, and grooming.  they are truly the only ones i would trust to care for my dogs.  the staff and owner are absolutely incredible, extremely caring, and knowledgeable.  one of my dogs suffers from seizures and when i asked how he would be handled if a seizure were to happen while in their care i received a very detailed explanation of exactly what would take place.  they completely put my mind at ease.  both my boys are treated like rock stars at wag'n tails and i cannot thank them enough!

						went to partridge creek for the dog walk, charlie's wonderful teacher chris was on the walk, we were so excited to see him, can't believe he remembered our names , our dogs name and our daughters name. chris was great with charlie, we tell everyone how patient he was and we love the training program, great job chris... we love you !!
