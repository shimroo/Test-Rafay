caption contest 1





ok, drawing an idea from some fellow bloggers, i have decided to post a new picture of john kerry each week until 11/2 (beginning on a tuesday and ending on a tuesday, great timing dontcha think) and on 11/2 (when bush is re-elected) the best caption of all of them will be posted for all the world to see. this being the first of 7 contests, i will start, but i've never been too good a "witty captions", so i'm sure i won't be the best (and how would it look to pick one of my own comments as best, right). so have fun and good luck.

bush memo story a 'mistake'





ok, it appears that we have put enough pressure (so far) on c-bs to make them admit a little more. in a recent article on their website, they called the story a "mistake", but did not say that the memos in question are fake and therefore the story was a complete lie. rather is quoted as saying he "feels like hell", and if i were in his place, i would to. there is a line from the movie backdraft where billy baldin's character asks a question of a city official "you see that flash of light in the corner of your eye? that's your career dissipation light. it just went into high gear", and i think someone needs to say this to danny boy. below you will see a few links to this story and a few other stories on c-bs' website.

yes yes yes! finally somone said what we all want to!





ok, why is it that when this comes from algore it's "patriotism" and "justified anger" but when it comes from a conservative, that person is a "raving weirdo" or just "ranting without thinking"? i cannot stand the state of affairs today, when being "pc" doesn't mean trying not to offend anyone, but in reality it means you have to agree with the dnc. well, i don't. i don't care where you were born (and raised if that's the case), if you live here/work here, and want to stay here legally, you are an american no hyphens, no pre-fixes, just american, so act like it! lesson one - learn the language, i'll give more lessons if i need to.

treason!





why is it that when stuff like this happens, we don't hear about it, but let a conservative pastor preach that homosexuality is a sin (btw, i agree with that thinking, homosexuality is a sin, and that includes being "bi") and he is immediately denounced as "supressing" a groups freedom, or "repressing" freedom of speech. well, you know what, if you don't like what a speaker is saying, leave! this is a free country, and you are not forced to do anything. for those that claim we are "criminals" because of iraq, look at how many schools are now open (with teachers earning more and girls attending for the first time), how many hospitals are open (with doctors earning more), how many banks are open (and making loans to small businesses), and so on......and tell me that we are only there for the oil. well, you know what, you can say that all you want, but i have the same rights as you. i was born here (texas, usa) 27 years ago, and when you start speaking your mind, i will do the same, and i have the right to stand right beside you and speak my mind, and you know what, you can't stop me. i will not stand idle while people living under the blanket of freedom (provided by men years ago who were willing to die for it, and protected to this day by men of the same caliber by men willing to die for that blanket of freedom) call those heroes and patriots "criminals" and "killers". does the military kill people, only when we have to. did we kill terrorists in the search for al-queda (and are we still searching) yes, but can you honestly say that if someone came in to your home and was going to kill you and your family that you would not take their life to protect yours and your family's lives? i know i would. i have a sign (and it is a joke) that says my home is guarded by shotgun 3 nights per week (you guess which three) and that i am insured by smith and wesson. while these signs are jokes, if you come in to my home seeking to do harm to me and/or my family, you better be able to dodge buckshot from point blank range, as i will protect my home and my family. if all you want are the material possessions, i'm sorry, i will hold you at gun point until the cops arrive. for those who are only "driven" to life of crime due to loss of work, i'm sorry if i seem insensitive, but the red cross, salvation army, and many other wonderful organizations are out there willing to help you with food, shelter, clothing, and also help you learn to interview and will write a resume for you to help you get another job! i hate that people are unemployed who really want to work, but there are many more out there who are unemployed, who simply want a hand out. why are we not seeing that the picture of unemployment is being "spun"? while there are many people who want to work and simply are having problems finding a job, there are many more who simply don't want to work, and think we (ie - taxpayers) should support them.

let foreign-born seek white house?





ok, while i feel that this idea has some merit, it also has some potential problems. just how many "charismatic" and "intelligent" people are out there that could become a citizen and then run for president that would not have our best interests at heart. while i would vote for "ahnold", i feel there needs to be more to this than just setting a "time limit" on how long one must be a citizen before running. also, we now have the "governator", but what would we call him as president? i'm at a loss and i am accepting ideas for the posters. also, if this does pass and he runs, whoever has the best idea for his new slogan will get a free t-shirt or polo from me with that very slogan on it (or you can request a mousepad, koozie, clock, or coaster if you wish).

ted kennedy's anti-american slander





ok, the first question that comes to mind is this, how does he keep getting elected? ted kennedy is a drinking, swearing, liberal jerk! the bumper-sticker that is sold in gun stores saying "ted kennedy's car has killed more people than my gun" is true in the case of most gun owners. contrary to popular belief, the law-abiding citizen does not seek to own any fire-arm for use against humans. yes, people hunt (but we were born with teeth for eating meat, and some like to hunt and kill their own in stead of going to kroger), and some target shoot, but check this out. did you realize that the criminal element in america is not buying it's guns legally? i know, it's a shock.

now, back to teddy boy. these remarks would not be tolerated from a conservative if referring to a democrat president. the entire left wing would be screaming for charges of treason, slander, and the like to be brought against that person, but let a liberal say something like that about a republican president, and what happens, nothing! funny, i thought it was the "right wing wacko" who suppressed freedom of speech, but ted wasn't suppressed was he?

iran is not peaceful, say it ain't so?





and for those that didn't get that, it was sarcasm! iran has long been an enemy to our way of life and our belief that all men are created equal and have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. now, with the un still trying to "talk them down" from nuclear pursuits, what is our next move? you know (my next comment is in jest, but i won't be surprised when i am attacked for it), two words come to my mind, carpet bombing, but let's see if we can find another way first, and if not, then we have a new parking lot
