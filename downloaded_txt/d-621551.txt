digital twin from the owner's perspective - augi con 2024 video





a few weeks ago, i was honored to be one of the few speakers chosen to present at the first ever augi con 2024.there were so many great questions and discussions from the attendees. the recording of that presentation is now live!augi con 2024 area - digital twin from the owner's perspective video (edit: now also available on youtube! though you still need to go through the community app to access the slide deck and handout.)you do need to be registered as a member at augi.com first, and then the augi community (available desktop and in an app) which will be checked against your augi membership (there is a free membership level available, so there is no cost involved). i was worried about going over on time and talked pretty fast, so it's probably only about a 30 minute presentation, with about 15 minutes of q&a. (if this presentation sounds familiar outside of augi, i gave a very similar talk at aectechcon here in st. louis the following week.)in addition to a video recording of the session, my slide deck, as well as a 10 page course handout that provides almost as much detail as the talk itself, are also available in the mighty augi community. first it was "bimwashing", now it is "twinwashing".before we try to sell digital twin services to facility operators, let's discuss how owners are using your design data today. understanding what an integrated workplace management system, or computerized maintenance management system, is will be vital to determining what your client actually needs from your construction documentation. learning how few people will actually interact directly with your models can bring perspective of how facilities/operations curates technical documentation and makes updates throughout the lifecycle of their campus.who is the ownerwho are the stakeholders?how will they access your data?iwmswhat is an integrated workplace management system?how does my data get ingested & updated over the lifecycle?project closeoutwhat handover mistakes are commonly seen from the aec side?what mistakes are commonly seen from the owner’s side?how does digital twin fit in?what real world problem would a ‘digital twin’ solve?in addition to giving definitions and background data, real world examples were also provided at each step, from my 20+ years of experience working in facilities, networking with other owners, and being a consultant who implements and supports facilities operations and management around the world.thank you to my team over at r.o.i. consulting group for highlighting my digital twin for fm session to our blog readers!

smart museum - digital twin at the wright museum





last year, my team at r.o.i. consulting group was fortunate enough to be able to work on a great project with the charles h. wright museum of african american history as an iot sensor partner (though i also like to think our experience with digital twin and facilities management issues and platforms came into play as well).you may have heard about them from autodesk university 2023, operationalizing a smart museum: an owner's journey to digital twin. this talk was recorded and the slides and handout are available for download, and you get to learn about how they are creating the next generation green museum.we primarily worked with their chief sustainability officer (cso), leslie tom, and their exhibit designer, korzell coe. they have a lot of really interesting initiatives that their model and sensors will be the base for, and a big team behind them making the vision that they expressed become reality.i have been meaning to share their au presentation, and unfortunately had not gotten around to that yet... but what more perfect time than today? they've been working with autodesk on a highlight video of their project and it just went live! having worked in facilities for over 20 years, it is so important for us to hear from the owner / operators of these campuses directly, what they are actually doing, the problems they are solving. architecture, engineering, construction, and consulting firms should not be trying to push technologies that facility engineers and space planners and energy managers do not need. it is a waste of effort on both sides and can lead to a lot of dissatisfaction of unmet expectations. so, really understanding where these owners comes from allows you as a service provider to recommend and provide something useful and wanted that solves the problems the building owner has, and brings them back to you as a trusted adviser and partner.read and watch on the autodesk websiteyou can also watch on linkedin. this video not only shows their beautiful facility, but explains their goals and some of the documentation issues they've had in the past, and how they moved past that and recreated record drawings for their facilities management and future planning needs, as well as to connect to sensors.the video is only 4 minutes long, so please watch, but also i encourage you to carve out some time to read the article beneath it, as it delves into more of their drivers, the roi, sustainability, environmental and cultural awareness, historical artifact preservation, and much more!another article has been published about this project:how the wright museum’s digital transformation is leading the way for sustainability in museumsdiscover how the charles h. wright museum of african american history is leveraging smart technology to become a model of cultural and sustainable preservation.

reality of bim in fm - podcast





this summer, i sat down with angela simoes and jonathan girroir from techsoft 3d to discuss digital twin, and how that actually plays out in the real world.apple podcastsoundcloudyoutubewhile i am currently a consultant, and have been since 2016. most of my career was on the owner / operator side of the aeco industry. i will never try to convince our clients to use a solution i would not use in their shoes. in fact, one of the services that we offer here at r.o.i. consulting group is evaluating iwms and iot solutions for clients and making an informed recommendation to them, based on our knowledge of the platforms and their needs. so, my leadership and coworkers are of the same mind as me in this regard.on a high level, we discussed:1. what does it look like when an ideal model-based handover occurs and is ingested into the operations management system?vs2. what does handover actually look like and where does it go wrong?topics that were touched upon: in this discussion, i explain why owners need a single file format for deliverables, and how those (either dwg or rvt) work with our iwms / cafm / cpip systems.how bim requirements are laid out in materials specs/sows.we do not get the deliverables that we spec and pay for, sometimes intentionally, sometimes due to shifting priorities.collaboration between teams during design and construction is far overstated.there can be multiple points of failure during closeout and handover that results in clients not receiving editable documentation or consistent documentation.every design team should have at least one programmer who can automate changes across a project. don't do this manually, come on.don't make assumptions on facility engineering requirements, ask why that spec is there.the iwms is the single source of truth and touchpoint for most users, not the model.how databases have longevity and portability, ensuring long term maintenance.the model must to be editable, for maintenance corrections and future renovations.keeping models up to date saves vast amounts of money on future projects not requiring surveying and redrawing.the biggest improvement in our segment of the industry is actually saas iwms hosting (regular included updated) vs internal or consultant hosted (years between updates, so many customizations that upgrades are long and expensive).the design team needs to speak to the owner, meaning the operator... not the project manager. if you are involving the occupant, you can involve the fm team, too, include it in that process.see also: who is the owner and how do they use your deliverables? the technology is there, but the processes and coordination still have a long way to go.scanning existing conditions is getting easier as devices become cheaper.monitoring devices, sensors are so much cheaper and easier, you can diy. for example, the disruptive sensors that are plug n play. consumer level devices such as these are easier to get past finance / it, etc. compared to traditional bas/bms and hand surveying which is more complex and expensive.

2022 more results for the ifma itc's digital twin survey





ifma survey summary: expectations and reality
 
last year, r.o.i. partnered with ifma’s itc and autodesk
to run our first annual survey on the state of electronic documentation for
building owners and operators. autodesk recently published a
whitepaper revealing the highlights of that survey, demonstrating current
state and desired future state. please download this document and see what the
industry has to say!
 
the 2023
ifma itc annual digital twin survey is running now. the imfa survey has closed, please keep an eye out for results.
please take a couple of minutes to chime in with
information about your facility.
 
while you’re here, you might want to check out my prior
article on the current state of electronic records and bim requirements.
 
what makes a digital twin? 
 
much like cafm (computer aided facility management) and
iwms (integrated workplace management system), what people believe a technology
does or should contain is influenced by their respective needs. as a result of
this survey, we see that the top component of a digital twin is a facility
record model.
 
 which elements are in use today?
 
the prior chart displays what facilities want from their
technology adoption, as an end goal. they also shared what elements are already
in use. we look forward to monitoring this during our annual surveys and seeing
how the industry progresses. 
 
why not digital twin? 
 
for the respondents not yet utilizing a digital twin, a
variety of obstacles were revealed. there are many replies citing a lack of
resources (whether that be skills, funding, leadership support, or current
large projects which would benefit), but nearly half of the negative replies
indicate they cannot currently justify a business case.
 
dominant use cases
 
for those who shared their expected business case, the
most popular is supporting maintenance. though, visualization for space and
workplace management is not far behind. commissioning a building and execution
of jobs are fairly close in popularity as well. some additional use cases were
suggested, strategic portfolio planning, simulation, predictive design, and
baseline comparisons. 
  
anticipated business benefits
 
when we asked, “does your senior management see value in
digital twin?”, a resounding 78% affirmed that they have support.
 
when queried, on a scale of 1 to 5, what are the most
valuable benefits you expect from a digital twin initiative? all of the
suggested benefits ranked strongly, indicating the importance for a wide range
of functions. receiving better deliverables and having an easier time keeping
record documents up to date post-occupancy were valued most.
  
please keep an eye out on notifications from r.o.i.,
autodesk, and the ifma information technology community (itc) announcing future
results and surveys.

2022 results for the ifma itc's digital twin survey





ifma survey summary: state of digital deliverables
last year, r.o.i. partnered with ifma’s itc and autodesk
to run our first annual survey on the state of electronic documentation for
building owners and operators. autodesk recently published a
whitepaper revealing the highlights of that survey, demonstrating current
state and desired future state. please download this document and see what the
industry has to say!
the 2023
ifma itc annual digital twin survey is running now. please take a couple of minutes to chime in with
information about your facility. the imfa survey has closed, please keep an eye out for results.
to prepare you for the next run of that survey, we would
like to go over the first year’s questions and results more in-depth: 
what is your industry? how much of your records are available
digitally?do you require bim for project deliverables? why haven’t you adopted digital twin yet? what are the essential elements of a digital
twin? what are the most important use cases you have
for digital twin? what benefits are you expecting from your
digital twin adoption? where are you in the process of digitizing your
portfolio and asset records?how are you planning to maintain your digital
twin? do you have support from senior leadership? do you believe a single vendor can provide
adequate features for your needs? 
who participated
the responses to this survey came from a variety of job
roles across the industry, however, the majority came from facilities management
and corporate real estate professionals. more than twice as many building
systems (mep/fp) aec professionals participated compared to architectural.

to give you an idea of the type of work those roles specialize
in, see the chart below. 
industry representation covers a wide variety of market
specialties. financial services had the highest level of participation (16.8%),
but education (14.3%) and commercial real estate (13.7%) were not far behind.

current electronic records
whatever goals we set for the future; it is important to
assess where we are currently. the chart below illustrates what percentage of
respondents reported having 50-100% of their documentation available
electronically.
bim requirements
if applicable, do you require bim deliverables for your
new construction and/or renovation projects? 
the answer is yes!
if you are wondering why bim might be required on some
projects, but not others, within the same facility, there can be a variety of
reasons. some might be budgetary, any projects over x amount will have room for
documentation, but smaller ones may not. renovations that only involve finishes
but not mep or structural components would also be a reasonable exception.

long term digital twin management
when assessing whether or not a single software vendor
was capable of providing a solution platform, 73% of respondents stated that
they think it is possible.
once a platform is selected, one needs to determine who
will be responsible for maintaining their records over the long term. a
majority (66%) of owners intend to manage their digital twin in-house, whether
than means utilizing an existing resource or expanding a team to hire
specifically for those skills. only 17% of respondents intend to outsource that
work to a consultant at this point.

please come back and read our next article on what
facility owners and operators expect from a digital twin initiative, and where
they currently stand with the various components of their smart buildings.
