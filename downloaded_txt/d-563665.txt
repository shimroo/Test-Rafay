making enemy, loving enemythe list is long. if you live long enough you will experience harm, hurt, and loss due to the actions or inactions of others. this reality means that we have enemies, make enemies, and find ourselves as an enemy to the other. this week pastor juan carlos huertas invites us into a conversation about one of the most difficult aspects of following jesus, loving our enemies. our striving for this more excellent way, will free us, and free our communities to become more just, loving, and whole places.sun 9:00am digital
