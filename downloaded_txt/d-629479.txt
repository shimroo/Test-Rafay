credit union income, after expenses and reserves, is returned directly to members in the form of lower rates on loans, higher dividends on savings and many no-fee services. every primary member has a vote for the credit unionâ€™s board of directors, regardless of how much he or she has on deposit. there is no select group of shareholders or owners that profits more than anyone else. all members profit, individually and collectively.more than 85 million americans belong to credit unions. research shows that consumers are more satisfied with credit unions than with any other financial service providers.our memberâ€™s satisfaction mattersbrightstar is the best! the customer service is excellent...in person, on the phone and in the drive thru. five stars is just not enough to rate this bank, especially the margate branch. i want to personally thank nicki at the margate branch for being so helpful today. you brighten up my day just by you doing your job. you are a brightstar in my book. you guys are awesome! keep up the great work. your services are truly appreciated!tamarahappy member




i have banked with bright star for 10 years and knew i waned to use them when it was time to purchase a vehicle. zoie and liliana were so helpful and made the process so easy. we were approved quickly and with the help of their autoadvisors service, we found and purchased our vehicles within a week. great service!!!shawnteehappy member




i love brightstar! we have moved all our accounts: checking, savings, mortgage, business account, car, equity line. every account has a great interest rate. online access and convenience is excellent and highly reliable. at the downtown office i use customer service is tops with everyone helpful and friendly. it's important to me to use local services, and brightstar can't be beat.carolhappy member




absolutely a "five star" experience. from the branch manager to the tellers, the staff is helpful, professional, knowledgeable and kind. i have had a personal checking/savings account for many years with bscu and now a business account. for personal attention to your needs check them out! you will be happy you did. thank you bright star credit union!dorotheahappy member
