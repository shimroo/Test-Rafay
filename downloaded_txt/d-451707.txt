  reporting health concerns or problems caused by
environmental lead exposure 
to report or discuss concerns regarding adverse health effects from exposure to airborne, leaded aviation gas emissions from morey airport aircraft overflights, please contact: 
 
public health madison & dane county, environmental health phone number: 608/242-6515 
 
there is no safe level of lead in humans, particularly children with developing brains:
https://publichealthmdc.com/documents/lead_summary_report.pdf
https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/lead/sources.htm
morey airport produces 32% of airborne lead emissions in dane county.  dane county has the second highest airborne lead emissions of all 72 counties in wisconsin (wi dnr). 
primary prevention is key.  breathable airborne lead is one of the most dangerous ways to be exposed to lead.  "...[the body absorbs higher levels of lead when it is breathed-in.  within our bodies, lead is absorbed and stored in our bones, blood, and tissues. it does not stay there permanently, rather it is stored there as a source of continual internal exposure."  https://www.cdc.gov/lead-prevention/prevention/index.html

resident info

snow removal
road safety is the town of middleton public works department’s primary concern during the winter months. the public works department treats the pavement and removes snow whenever road conditions call for these services. our drivers work extended hours to ensure safe and effective snow removal. this does not mean bare drive pavement should be expected after each snowfall or ice storm. furthermore, this does not mean the roads will be free of ice and snow.
a few helpful suggestions (more tips may be found here):

when standing in your driveway facing the road, remove snow to the left of your driveway entrance.  this will help prevent snow from being plowed back into your drive.
the only way to avoid extra shoveling is to wait until the town crew has gone by and/or have done their final clean-up on the road.


 
important reminders from pellitteri
         tipped over carts: we are experiencing a high volume of carts being tipped over prior to our trucks arriving. drivers are not able to collect carts that are knocked over and cannot get out at every stop to upright them. if you can, please set the carts upright prior to our arrival so they can be serviced.         cart placement: to help with plowing efforts and help prevent tipped over carts, please place your carts on the terrace or in your driveway, not in the road, and not on top of snowbanks. you may need to shovel out an area for your carts. please keep carts 4 feet away from each other and any other obstructions to prevent them from being tipped over during service, or not serviced at all.         timing: collection times may be different, either earlier or later than usual. please make sure your carts are out by your community’s designated time (7 a.m. for town of middleton residents).         notifications: download the pellitteri waste systems mobile app at www.pellitteri.com/recycleright for updates on weather delays or cancellations or sign up for email alerts at www.pellitteri.com. future weather updates can also be found at www.pellitteri.com/weather.
