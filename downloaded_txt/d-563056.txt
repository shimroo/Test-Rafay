about carbon leaf a touring mainstay and an indie folk rock staple, this virginia quintet’s well-hewn live show and musical style drift in and out of americana, bluegrass, rock, folk, celtic and pop traditions with ease, using an arsenal of instruments to define the band’s lively stage presence and sonic landscape.
