at routt catholic high school, we develop the whole student, emphasizing spiritual growth with regular mass attendance and theology courses all four years.a routt student not only learns to be a critical and creative thinker, they learn how to build a life of purpose.





though we welcome students of all faiths, at our core are our catholic values. we teach students to adapt to changes while remaining true to those values. we are committed to providing our students with the skills and dispositions that will make them into the good people the world needs.
we do this in a welcoming community of faculty and staff, who receive ongoing professional development for teaching, coaching and mentoring young people. we know and love our students and believe deeply in our mission.

“family legacy is important to us – our son’s great-grandfather and grandmother are routt graduates. but the most important reason why we chose routt was the high-quality catholic education. a big bonus is the safe, family environment. routt is an extension of our family, and we are proud to be a part of it.”
lisa orr taylor, parent

admissions



“i love routt because it academically challenges students in small classroom settings; but, most importantly, christ is the focus at routt. there is nothing more important for a child to learn than how to rely on god in their lives. routt supports and encourages this in all students.”
angela davis, parent

“routt builds the entire student. not only do students get academic opportunities to prepare them for the next level, they’re also involved in service, leadership and teamwork to help them be successful members of the community. that, in addition to the time routt devotes to prayer and solidifying god’s place in students’ lives, is the reason routt is the best choice for our family.”
jb and jess brown, parents

athletics



“routt is more than a school; it’s a family. it’s a group of imperfect people who love jesus and support each other through good times and bad. the perks of small class sizes, great coaches/sports, and excellent teachers are wonderful, but we love the community of routt most.”
ryan and casandra turner, parents
