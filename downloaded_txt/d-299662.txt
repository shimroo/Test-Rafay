cabins of sugar grove

















two log cabins, six plus acres, a cascading waterfall,
          a clear pond, a quiet walk, tall trees, fresh air,
          all wrapped up in the mountain tops of the
          north carolina high country.
the cabins of sugar grove
          invite you to plan your escape.
our cabins have two bedrooms, two bathrooms,
          and all the comforts of home.
we've thought of everything.....just pack your bag.
