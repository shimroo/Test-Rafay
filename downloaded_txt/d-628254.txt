welcome
welcome to the office of inspector general (oig) for pension benefit guaranty corporation.  our office serves as an independent entity within pbgc.  our mandate is to detect and prevent fraud, waste, abuse, and violations of law, and to promote economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the pbgc.   the oig strives, as an agent of positive change, to continually improve pbgc management and program operations by independently conducting audits, evaluations, and investigations.  additionally, the oig dutifully informs congress regarding major developments associated with our audit and investigative missions.   we report our accomplishments semiannually to pbgc's board of directors and congress (congressional testimony and statements).
the office of inspector general consists of the inspector general and the assistant inspectors general, who provide leadership and oversight for the offices of audit and investigations.
pbgc employees, contractors and the public may confidentially report suspected wrongdoing by pbgc employees and contractors or allegations of possible fraud, waste or abuse occurring in a pbgc program or operation. visit our hotline web page for information describing how investigative information or complaints can be directly communicated to the oig. for general inquiries about the pbgc oig and its operations, dial the oig phone number: 1-800-400-7242 and then enter extension 4030 during local business hours.
