i love this place!july 02, 2006just being inside i can feel the history. my husband and i used to go once a week. for a small price you get 1 hour lesson (group) and then can dance the rest of the night. a great bargain and loads of fun! not only did we learn some new swing dancing, get some good exercise, and have a great time — we love watching the young “kids” dance. it was a show! i truly enjoy going there and am so glad that st. louis has such a place! my only concern is that the neighborhood does not feel like the safest, but nothing bad has ever happened to us there.vicki k.insider pages reviewexcellent unique place to have a wedding reception10/03/2009there is so much history there and incorporating your wedding theme to the ballroom can make it really special. the owners, pat and his wife, are so flexible. you have to check this place out! he really let me do anything that i wanted to transform the room into a perfect reception!  also, be sure to clear up where exactly your guests can park…some of my guests were parking in the wrong lot and were being charged!! other than that, the place was roomy and a great value for the price! pat and his wife are some of the nicest people i have ever met and so flexible!amythank you!2013where do we begin? we can’t thank you enough for all you did to make our wedding perfect! and for that, we’ll be forever grateful.pat and terriwe were elated2019you must have your wedding reception here!!! my husband and i lost our original venue to flooding in st. peters and were left with 3 weeks to relocate and tell our guests, potentially re-think décor, and schedule – the whole ordeal. amidst the stress, my husband and i checked the casa loma ballroom schedule just for grins to see if it was available. we called late in the evening and pat picked up, delivered all information quickly, and was kind and inviting, ensuring us that the venue was available and that they’d be happy to have us. we were elated. i could go on and on about how incredible they were to work with in our short time frame. they were relaxed, answered every call, and made us feel totally comfortable with our last minute choice. we delivered all décor for the reception the week of the wedding and teri stayed up late the night before to set everything up and send us photos for approval. we didn’t have to lift a finger! the dj was the most entertaining and engaging dj i’ve ever seen, and he was a delight to work with. the all inclusive package (dj, food, bar) was so worth the ease of knowing that we didn’t have to hire other vendors last minute for our wedding. our guests are still talking about the beauty of the venue, the big dance floor, and the overall enjoyment of the night! we couldn’t have made a better choice – and to have our first dance as a married couple where we had our first date – so special. thank you casa loma ballroom for this unforgettable experience! also highly recommend their regular events- the music and dancing here makes for a perfect
