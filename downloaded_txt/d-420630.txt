richmond hyperbaric autism research program










our stories are on: 
























since 2004, richmond hyperbaric health center has treated over 200 children with brain disorders.  we are also involved in a clinical study on the effects of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (hbot) on children diagnosed with autism with extremely positive progress like: 



better eye contact
aphasia
better digestion and less picky on food
listen to instructions
improve focus and cognition
better sleep
increased interaction with people
... and more



for more information, please call us at tel.: 604-277-8628

			you may also find useful information and clients testimonials on our autism video gallery page.

			 





what is hyperbaric oxygen therapy (hbot)?




oxygen is the key element to life and healing. without oxygen for even a few minutes, the brain tissue dies. under increased atmospheric pressure, oxygen saturates the red blood cells and dissolves up to fifteen times the normal amount into the blood plasma, transporting oxygen deeper into the body via the lymph, intestinal fluid and cerebrospinal fluid, thereby maximizing tissue oxygenation. the increased oxygen stimulates growth and repair processes. this process is called hyperbaric oxygen therapy or hbot. hbot is beneficial for treating a variety of conditions like skin grafts, ulcers, multiple sclerosis, stroke, pain, cerebral palsy, chronic fatigue, alzheimer’s, autism, lyme disease, crohn’s disease, sports injuries and macular degeneration. immune disorders like lupus, aids & hiv, diabetes, conditions associated with shortage of oxygen and blood supply like problem wounds, gangrene and anemia would also benefit.
			 




benefits of hyperbaric oxygen theraphy (hbot)




hyperbaric oxygen therapy is a treatment in which a person breathes pure oxygen under greater than normal atmosphere pressure. hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying molecule in the blood, is almost completely saturated with oxygen in normal day-to-day life. instead of binding more oxygen to hemoglobin, hyperbaric oxygen therapy increases the free oxygen in body fluids enabling better perfusion of tissues.  this extra oxygen generates a cascade of events that helps to reduce inflammation, promote healing, reduce swelling, and improves the blood supply through angiogenesis [a process involving the growth of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels in areas deficient in oxygen].

hyperbaric oxygen therapy may improve:
			1. cellular metabolism
			2. immune system
			3. bone health
			4. mental alertness
			5. platelet function
			6. blood circulation
			7. inflammation
			8. edema

how does hyperbaric oxygen therapy (hbot) work?





			 

when you breathe oxygen at normal atmospheric pressure, oxygen is transported on hemoglobin in the red blood cells. under pressure, however, oxygen dissolves into the blood plasma, cerebrospinal fluid in the brain and spinal cord, lymph, and other body fluids. it is therefore easily delivered to all tissues, including those with a poor blood supply. therefore, even areas that have been deprived of oxygen are afforded the tremendous healing benefits of oxygen.

stroke is perhaps the most dramatic example of what can happen when oxygen delivery to a vital organ is cut off. during a stroke, a blockage or bleeding in blood vessels in the brain interrupts the flow of oxygen- and nutrient-rich blood. as a result, cells in affected area die or are damaged, resulting in speech, vision, mobility, or other problems. when these areas are infused with massive amounts of oxygen during a hyperbaric oxygen treatment, damaged brain cells literally wake up.

research videos on hyperbaric oxygen therapy






have you ever wondered how hyperbaric oxygen therapy can make a difference to your life or loved ones? many of today’s illnesses, as well as premature aging, are caused or made worse by a lack of oxygen. without enough oxygen the human body does not function properly and cannot get rid of free radicals, uric acid, fungal infections or bacterial infections. here are some real stories involving case studies like autism, cancer, diabetes, lupus disease, pain, reflex sympathetic dystrophy (rsd), traumatic brain injury and coma. in these videos, you will witness how hyperbaric oxygen therapy (hbot) improves health and vitality. these video clips are for informational purposes only and are not a substitute for medical advice or treatment for any medical conditions. to learn more, please visit our video gallery page.
