  "i could not have had a better experience with guy oberg and oberg properties. guy literally helped me find the home of my dreams, and before i met him, i was worried i wouldn’t find the house i was really looking for. guy spent so many hours with me showing me properties and was always available when i needed him or always got right back to me. he has also done an amazing follow up, helping me with an interior designer, yard people, pool cleaners, etc etc. i honestly don’t know if i could gone through this with anyone else. i highly recommend oberg properties and i would’t think of using anyone else."
