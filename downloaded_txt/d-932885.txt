   family owned for almost 100 years! management with a ❤️.  (we really do care!)
 
kos management is the present day management company passed down for three generations of kos hatcheries and moski corporation, which uses kos management as their trade name.the partnership was formed in the late 1920’s while operating a chicken hatchery on main street. our offices/warehouse is still located there today. the business then progressed into kos lumber in the mid-1940’s and was one of the first cash & carry lumberyards in the area. in the 1960’s, with the combination of farmland own by the family & building materials from the lumber yard, they became the leaders in the apartment home industry in the green bay area. these apartment homes continue to be leased today. in the 1990’s, the construction arm added additional apartments and are now in east and west green bay, howard and depere.commercial properties, including office buildings, strip centers, warehousing, and other multi-use buildings have been added over the past two decades. the development side of the business has transformed the farmland into residential/commercial lots thru out the brown, door, and kewaunee counties. some residential subdivisions include premier estate, muirwood manor, bay heights, the acres and willow grove.
