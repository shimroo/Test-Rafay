i wish all the islamobarbarians of the planeta very unhappy 9/11/04.
--nelson ascher--



the purpose of diplomacy isn't to make usfeel good about eurocentric diplomatic skills,and having countries from the axisof chocolate tie our shoelaces togetherdoes nothing to advance our infantry.--sir george--

--john galt--




first, go buy a six pack and swig it all down.then, watch ace ventura.and after that, buy a hard rock cafe shirtand come talk to me.you really need to lighten up, man.

if we wish to be free, if we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for which we have been so long contending, if we mean not basely to abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained -- we must fight!--patrick henry--



america has never been united by blood or birth or soil. we are bound by ideals that move us beyond our backgrounds, lift us above our interests and teach us what it means to be citizens. every child must be taught these principles. every citizen must uphold them. and every immigrant, by embracing these ideals, makes our country more, not less, american.--president george w. bush--



[blogs] are usually just cheerleading sessions, full of sound and fury and signifying nothing but a soothing reduction in blood pressure brought about by the narcotic high of being agreed with.--bill whittle



war is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. the decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse. the person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself.
--john stuart mill--




we are determined that before the sun sets on this terrible struggle, our 
flag will be recognized throughout the world as a symbol of freedom on the 
one hand and of overwhelming force on the other.--general george marshall--




we can continue to try and clean up the gutters all over the world and spend all of our resources looking at just the dirty spots and trying to make them clean. or we can lift our eyes up and look into the skies and move forward in an evolutionary way.
--buzz aldrin--




america is the greatest, freest and most decent society in existence. it is an oasis of goodness in a desert of cynicism and barbarism. this country, once an experiment unique in the world, is now the last best hope for the world.
--dinesh d'souza--




recent anti-israel protests remind us again of our era's peculiar alliance: the most violent, intolerant, militantly religious movement in modern times has the peace movement on its side.--james lileks--



as a wise man once said: we will pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty.
unless the price is too high, the burden too great, the hardship too hard, the friend acts disproportionately, and the foe fights back.   in which case, we need a timetable. 
--james lileks--



i am not willing to kill a man so that he will agree with my faith, but i am prepared to kill a man so that he cannot force my compatriots to submit to his. 
--froggy--



you can say what you want about president bush; but the truth is that he can take a punch. the man has taken a swift kick in the crotch for breakfast every day for 6 years and he keeps getting up with a smile in his heart and a sense of swift determination to see the job through to the best of his abilties. 
--varifrank--



in a perfect world, we'd live in peace and love and harmony with each oither and the world, but then, in a perfect world, yoko would have taken the bullet. 
--sarahbellum--



freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. we didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. it must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was once like in the united states where men were free.--ronald reagan--




america is rather like life. you can usually find in it what you look for. it will probably be interesting, and it is sure to be large.--e.m. forster--




do not fear the enemy, for your enemy can only take your life. it is far better that you fear the media, for they will steal your honor. that awful power, the public opinion of a nation, is created in america by a horde of ignorant, self-complacent simpletons who failed at ditching and shoemaking and fetched up in journalism on their way to the poorhouse.--mark twain--




the enlightenment was followed by the french revolution and the napoleonic wars, which touched every european state, sparked vicious guerrilla conflicts across the continent and killed millions. then, things really turned ugly after the invention of soccer.--iowahawk--




every time i meet an iraqi army soldier or policeman that i haven't met before, i shake his hand and thank him for his service. many times i am thanked for being here and helping his country. i always tell them that free people help each other and that those that truly value freedom help those seeking it no matter the cost.--jack army--




right, left - the terms are useless nowadays anyway. there are statists, and there are individualists. there are pessimists, and optimists. there are people who look backwards and trust in the west, and those who look forward and trust in the world. those are the continuums that seem to matter the most right now.--lileks--




the best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter.
--winston churchill--




a man or a nation is not placed upon this earth to do merely what is pleasant and what is profitable.  it is often called upon to carry out what is both unpleasant and unprofitable, but if it is obviously right it is mere shirking not to undertake it.--arthur conan doyle--




a man who has nothing which he cares about more than he does about his personal safety is a miserable creature who has no chance of being free, unless made and kept so by the existing of better men than himself.--john stuart mill--




after the attacks on september 11, 2001, most of the sheep, that is, most citizens in america said, "thank god i wasn't on one of those planes." the sheepdogs, the warriors, said, "dear god, i wish i could have been on one of those planes. maybe i could have made a difference."--dave grossman--




at heart im a cowboy; my attitude is if theyre not going to stand up and fight for what they believe in then they can go pound sand.--bill whittle--




a democracy is always temporary in nature; it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of government. a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover that they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury. from that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates who promise the most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that every democracy will finally collapse due to loose fiscal policy, which is always followed by a dictatorship.--alexander tyler--




by that time a village half-wit could see what generations of professors had pretended not to notice.--atlas shrugged--




i kept asking clarence why our world seemed to be collapsing and everything seemed so shitty. and he'd say, "that's the way it goes, but don't forget, it goes the other way too."--alabama worley--




so bush is history, and we have a new president who promises to heal the planet, and yet the jihadists dont seem to have got the obama message that there are no enemies, just friends we havent yet held talks without preconditions with.
--mark steyn--




"i had started alone in this journey called life, people started
gathering up on the way, and the caravan got bigger everyday."--urdu couplet
