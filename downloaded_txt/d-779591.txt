our story 



the land that whistle bear sits on was originally owned by one of cambridge’s founding fathers, william dickson. dickson purchased the property in 1816 for today’s equivalent of approximately $1.00 per acre. he later sold the property to joseph bowman in the early 1800’s. bowman built the original log home between 1829 and 1832, which is now incorporated into the clubhouse today.a portion of the property also consists of wetlands, forests, and farmlands that have been left untouched. they are there to preserve the natural habitat of wildlife and plant life in the area.the back nine holes were opened in late summer 2000, and the front nine opened in july 2001. in fact, each of the 18 holes at whistle bear tells a part of the lands historic story. researching cambridge’s archive records revealed the site had 18 previous owners, whom the holes are named after today.
