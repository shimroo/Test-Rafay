what’s happening?
ashokan fiddle & dance
it wouldn’t be summer without our annual trip to southern week at ashokan. for more than forty years, our dear friends, jay ungar & molly mason have been organizing, hosting and playing beautiful music at the ashokan center in upstate new york.
this summer, as usual, there will be music, dancing, classes, food and, most importantly, the positive energy of a community of wonderful people. if that all sounds like a great way to spend a week, believe us, it is. the dates are august 10 – 16, 2025, and registration is currently under way.
if you’re looking for a clogging/flatfooting dance intensive, this year will feature a dedicated percussive dance track for beginner to advanced dancers, taught by a formidable team of inspiring teachers.

sharon leahy, becky hill, matt gordon and nicole ball 
daily classes of drills for technique, ideas for improvisation, and the craft of choreography, will be taught by sharon leahy, becky hill, matt gordon and nicole ball. there will be an all-level accessible clogging team as well as advanced work for duets and trios. that’s four classes at varying levels each day, plus opportunities for a private lessons and social dancing to live music each night. an added bonus is a daily morning yoga class for strength, balance and flexibility.

as an added bonus, performing at the floyd country store that saturday night were our good friends, caleb klauder & reeb willms. the evening was a perfect compliment to a successful weekend.

big family business
the family business is our current catch-all for whatever project we might dream up. when it grows to include our extended family, it’s the big family business, and that’s where we’ve been busy lately.

many of you already know about the foundry theater, operating in yellow springs at the edge of antioch’s campus. we’ve seen several good shows there over the past couple of years and naturally it got us thinking of what we might do there ourselves.

good & young – sharon, rick, emma and linzay
on september 21st, good & young, our family band with daughter emma and her husband linzay, teamed up with our old friend bob lucas, his step-daughter chloe manor and her husband chris westhoff (who happens to be the driving force behind the foundry theater), to present a concert of original and traditional songs and tunes, super-charged with clogging to old time music.

sharon, rick, emma, linzay, chris, bob and chloe
to kick it up a notch, former rhythm in shoes dancers beth wright, along with her daughter, violet put some sweet icing on the cake along with cousin becky hill, world renowned instigator of terpsichorean delights.

the dance finale – violet, sharon, becky, beth and emma
this multigenerational ensemble of families, with too many decades of performance experience to count, fulfilled their promise to captivate, comfort and amuse. the performance was followed by a community barn dance, with gender neutral instruction designed for all ages and levels.
but that’s not all! on sunday afternoon we all came back to perform for an enthusiastic group of kids, parents, and supporters of the antioch school. as they say, a good time was had by all.

a new album by rick good

yes, you can still call them albums.
bob dylan once said, the world don’t need any more songs. they’ve got enough. they’ve got way too many. as a matter of fact, if nobody wrote any songs from this day on, the world ain’t gonna suffer for it. nobody cares. there’s enough songs for people to listen to, if they want to listen to songs. for every man, woman and child on earth, they could be sent, probably, each of them, a hundred records, and never be repeated. there’s enough songs… unless someone’s gonna come along with a pure heart and has something to say. that’s a different story.
and rick says: i wrote these songs over the course of almost fifty years because i had something to say. as for the purity of my heart, that is a work in progress.
and for those of you who remember with fondness the socially conscious folk music of the sixties, our response to a mass shooting in our hometown of dayton, ohio, do something, is just one example of the original songs rick has been writing about the ongoing state of our world. you can hear them all on soundcloud.
