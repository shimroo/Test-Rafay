 "raul and denise, thank you for our time here at canopy lodge. it is an extraordinary place with such lovely people running it. we hope to be back very soon." 


  


 angelina jolie 
 




 "...lovely rooms, excellent food and fascinating wildlife." 


  


 sir david attenborough 
 




 the canopy tower is unique in the world and splendid in both its conception and its execution. the cornell lab of ornithology may well break its rules of not "repeating" and return to your wonderful tower and gracious hospitality." 


  


 ned and linda morgens 
 chairman, cornell lab of ornithology 




 "raul, we have come to believe we have found the soul of panama in your family and your lovely place. thank you for the experience." 


  


 brad pitt 
 global nomads 




 "...grand in conception ...superbly realized..." 


  


 john rowlett 
 founder, field guides 




 "... a luxurious living and dining experience with superb birding and, perhaps most important of all, a wonderful lesson in conservation. a few days at canopy tower will install an environmental ethic in all who pass through." 


  


 katie and donal o'brien 
  chairman, national audubon society 




 "raúl, what you have done here in the canopy tower makes me doubly proud of the torrijos-carter treaty and its beneficial and just results. we wish you well as you introduce hundreds of visitors to the beauties of panamá's natural resources." 


  


 jimmy carter 
 39th president of the united states 




 "...exceeded all expectations ...beautifully done ...everything is first class" 


  


 barry zimmer 
 victor emanuel nature tours 




 "raúl, you have a truly wonderful place. i loved coming here during my stay in panamá; for the solitude and peace of it, for the great food and for your company, always lighthearted."
