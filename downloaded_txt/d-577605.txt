an unforgettable experience amidst a breathtaking landscape…

where adventure meets romance…. break from the pack and join us for a most unforgettable experience….
 
entering the griffin ranch you encounter an era of a classic, old florida ranch life: a world capturing the romance and elegance of a by-gone era. the ranch is set on 30 acres filled with ponds, pastures and wooded areas. it features guest cottages and cabins with antique interiors in a timeless unhurried atmosphere. we are thrilled to welcome guests to our ranch who are seeking an escape from a daily routine to share in an experience that enables one to enjoy close encounters with farm and florida wildlife, such as black bear, deer, red tail hawks, sandhill cranes, gators, and more. at sunset, you can sit by the grassy pond and experience life as described by legendary authors and philosophers such as walden, thoreau, and rawlings.
the griffin ranch is one of the most strategically positioned escapes in florida, positioned west of the national forest and north of silver springs. our ranch provides a destination that is essential to experiencing florida. an area that is a favorite among many enthusiasts for its scenic trails. it is a chosen destination for those who enjoy canoeing and kayaking. the ocklawaha river and the juniper springs run are the two most scenic canoeing and kayaking destinations in the us. you could also enjoy our other activates like hiking in the forest, biking along a scenic highways, scuba diving in the local springs such as devils den or blue grotto springs, horseback riding along the 100 mile trail or just exploring many of the wildlife areas around the ranch. a new 4-wheeler park opened minutes just east of the ranch offering the off-road beauty of the area. you may also choose to take a day trip to a local spring for a cool dip or maybe a trip to the historical town of st. augustine and the local beaches located within an hour drive.
best of all, there is always the choice to relax on a wooden deck in a rocking chair while watching, the sun rise or the moon climb over the grassy ponds. you can rest on the cottage porch and enjoy some of the best foods in the southeast while tasting  a glass of fine wine from the ranch winery, over a conversation with new-found friends in a real life ranch setting, then and only then you’ll begin to appreciate what the griffin ranch has come to be famous for.
