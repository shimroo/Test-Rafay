you're invited!



please join us at old firehouse winery for glass of wine and so much more…see the entertainment schedule to not miss a thing!“a quaint and enticing winery located right in the heart of geneva-on-the-lake. the name, old firehouse winery, summarizes the atmosphere; an eclectic collection of fire paraphernalia and the fact that this was indeed the first firehouse in geneva-on-the-lake. besides its historic charm, much of the enjoyment in visiting the old firehouse is in its setting: the lake erie shoreline.during the summer months, the large, meandering patio and gazebo overlooking lake erie features a full service menu with dishes ranging from sandwiches to ethnic foods, to barbecue chicken and ribs.  old firehouse is known not only for its fine food; almost of the eighteen wines have at one time won medals in statewide competition.  nightly entertainment is featured seven nights throughout the summer.”excerpt taken from theohiotraveler.com. read more here.
