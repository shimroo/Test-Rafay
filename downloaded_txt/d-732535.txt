                            accreditation of an educational program provides students and graduates assurance that the educational program will provide them with the requisite knowledge, skills, and values to competently perform the range of professional responsibilities expected by potential employers nationwide. it also assures they will be eligible for licensure in each of the 50 states.

                            what is accreditation?                        

                            the jrcert welcomes a collaborative relationship with our programs and faculty. we strive to work together with our programs to achieve our mutual goal of excellence in education. through the process of programmatic accreditation, educators are assured that their educational programs are keeping pace with the profession and with standards developed through national consensus.
