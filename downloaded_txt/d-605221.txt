 established in 1995…



a colorful legacy of northern california pioneers, farmers and purveyors of wine has transcended six generations of the de la montanya family. in 1995, dennis and tina founded de la montanya estate vineyards with the planting of pinot noir, chardonnay, and viognier grapes at our home ranch in the heart of russian river valley. eight years later, in the summer of 2003, the winery and tasting room was finally opened in southern dry creek valley, just off westside road. we just know you’ll feel right at home in the winery gardens tasting award-winning wine and rare varietals, where you’ll likely meet one or more members of the family. 
























de la montanya wine



today, we have over 200 acres of vineyards planted throughout sonoma and lake counties. about 90% of the bounty is sold to other wineries. the appellations include sonoma coast, russian river valley, dry creek valley, alexander valley, petaluma gap, red wood valley,  mendocino, and big  valley in lake county. we hand-pick the very best clusters from each of these vineyards to bring into the winery to produce a total of 3,600 cases annually. specializing in small-batch, handcrafted winemaking, we’ve been known to make over 30 different varietals, ranging in size from one barrel (24 cases) to 12 barrels (280 cases). our signature wines include viognier, zinfandel, primitivo, tempranillo, pinot noir and red blends from a broad spectrum of bordeaux varietals. visit our wine store to purchase and learn more about current releases.
