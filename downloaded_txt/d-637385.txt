at gateway, you will be welcomed into a friendly, casual environment. we would like to help you plan your visit. please explore the information below and join us for a service. we look forward to seeing you!















  worship















our services are casual but reverent. our worship experiences are designed to last between 65 -70 minutes and include contemporary worship, lights, video elements, scripture readings, and bible-based sermons. 



    what to wear



at gateway, you’ll see lots of people in jeans, khakis, and comfortable clothing. you’re welcome to dress casually and come as you are!















    kids



we have creative and biblically-engaging programs designed with your child in mind.at each campus, we will direct you to the children’s check-in station. our friendly check-in team will help you register and check your child into a safe and fun environment designed just for them.learn more & pre-register here!















    students



our mission is to help our students develop an authentic faith that lasts.  we teach practical, jesus-centered lessons that encourage questions, doubts, and conversations. we provide students opportunities every week to connect with adults who are investing in the next generation. we believe in families worshipping together, so our students start in our adult service and are dismissed before the sermon for their own age-specific lesson.learn more 















    security



your family’s safety is important to us. we have a trained security team and safety protocols to keep our campuses a safe place to visit. if you see anything suspicious at one of our locations, inside or out, please let us know immediately by reporting to the welcome center/starting point. you may also email us with your concerns.
