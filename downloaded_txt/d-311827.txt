how national marine sanctuaries fuel local
                    economies
healthy marine protected areas are good for businessâpeople travel from all over the world to visit
                  national marine sanctuaries and enjoy activities such as whale watching and fishingâand the money they
                  spend while visiting trickles throughout the local economy. some of america's most recognized
                  underwater treasures are found in the national marine sanctuary systemâand sanctuaries couldn't exist
                  without the communities and businesses who support them.

national marine sanctuary system posters




during the national marine sanctuary system's 50th anniversary
                celebration in 2022, a commemorative poster series was launched to capture the
                beauty and diversity of each site in the system. the posters are two sided, featuring original artwork
                on the front and educational information on the back. other posters created for the system over the
                years have also been added. dive in and download your sanctuary posters today!
