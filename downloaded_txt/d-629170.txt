this solidarity of the ages is so effective that the lines of connection work both ways. misunderstanding of the present is the inevitable consequence of ignorance of the past. but a man may wear himself out just as fruitlessly in seeking to understand the past, if he is totally ignorant of the present. there is an anecdote which i have already recounted elsewhere: i had gone with henri pirenne to stockholm; we had scarcely arrived, when he said to me: âwhat shall we go to see first? it seems that there is a new city hall here. letâs start there.â then, as if to ward off my surprise, he added: âif i were an antiquarian, i would have eyes only for old stuff, but i am a historian. therefore, i love life.â
