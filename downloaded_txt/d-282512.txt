old oak welcome tile.



for those interested in my craftsman style decorative tiles, welcome! i’m still making tiles but on a limited basis. please explore the galleries (links at top) and inquire if there are tiles you would like to order. meanwhile, i’m transitioning… and using this site to showcase some of my past tile work and also to introduce copper, silver and stone creations that are a new passion. i’ve been taking lapidary and metal smithing classes and really enjoy the process.you will find handcrafted items available for purchase in my etsy shop ravenstonehandcrafts. the shop offers some tiles and quite a few new pieces that incorporate metal and stone.
