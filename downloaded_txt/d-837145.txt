 mindfield - february 2025
mental health matters to god and is included in the greatest command to love the lord with all your mind. jesus addressed anxiety, depression, grief, anger, fear, and weariness. mindfield is identifying the worries within and allowing jesus to transform our thoughts and lead us toward positive mental health.

 the one who. . . - january 2025
from the start, god was. genesis is the story of the beginning. god created relationships, rhythms, covenant, and paths to wholeness. we discover that god is our god and we are god's people. as we search the stories of genesis we will find the foundation of our faith.

 long story - december 2024
christmas is a time to be with family and share the story of christmas. the christmas story is a long story that spans 1400 years. god took unlikely relationships and twisted plots to bring forth the promised messiah. we will take a look at the family of jesus recorded by matthew who lists the genealogy of the christ child. perhaps your family will be able to identify with some of jesus' family and discover there is hope for us all. it's a long story, but a good one.
