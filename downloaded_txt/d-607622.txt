what are adventure days?
we all know that one person who treads where others fear to step, or who loves doing something that truly gets the pulse racing and challenges them in every sense of the word. there is a chance that person might even be you. if so, an adventure day is the perfect way to get your adrenaline kicks!at extremedays, we've hand-picked the very best high energy adventure experiences that will truly let you take a walk - and other things besides - on the wild side! and whilst many of these are tailored primarily towards adults, there are also packages which even the kids can enjoy, or that would be ideal for group bookings.
adventure and activity days
amongst our most daring adventure activities are the ones that will see you scaling the heights, such as abseiling, climbing and caving. they're definitely amongst the more unusual ways to explore some of the british isles' most visually stunning natural wonders, from the brecon beacons in wales to the scottish highlands.there's also canyoning, or canyoneering, which is a truly unique experience combining many of the above activities into the same day, available as a half day or full day package!for those who fancy themselves a dab hand with a shotgun or a crossbow, there's our archery experiences (perfect for living out those robin hood fantasies) and our clay pigeon shooting packages to explore.those who really have a head for sheer drops will be taken with our bungee jumping days, where, attached to a strong elastic bungee cord, you'll jump off a platform and come bouncing right back up!or for something really out of the box, why not take one of our survival courses or zombie experiences - perfect for those who think they'd be able to take on an sas style challenge or who could hold their own in a 28 days later type scenario! adventure days near me
