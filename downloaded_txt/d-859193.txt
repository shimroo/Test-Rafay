john m. barberfellow emeritus, american society of marine artistswhen i was a young lad of seven visiting cape hatteras, north carolina i happened upon a man sitting under an umbrella with a canvas and easel before him, a paintbrush and palette in hand. using bits and dabs of oil paint, he was creating a seemingly magical image of the lighthouse and sea beyond. i can still recall the intoxicating aroma of turpentine mingling with the salty ocean breeze while gulls wheeled all around. i was mesmerized by the experience and decided that i would become a painter……and so i did. i have spent over four decades doing what i love: creating representational maritime paintings in the time-tested manner of the old masters, with a specialty in chesapeake bay artwork. i paint the bay’s skipjacks, harbors, and lighthouses, as well as landscape paintings. i also paint directly from nature especially when i travel. if you’d like to be among the first to see new work as it comes off the easel, please join my “wet paint” emailing list.the paintings below are samples of my oil paintings. visit “portfolio” for a comprehensive viewing.
