welcome to millennialchild.comabout us: we hope to serve as a digital media resource for anyone interested in educating children in the twenty-first century. we are not a school, nor are we a training center, but our roots lie in waldorf education, which in turn arises out of anthroposophy, a worldview promulgated by rudolf steiner. as a media company, we have developed a web site as a means to share as much about waldorf education’s roots and fruits as we can with the widest possible audience. we hope that millennialchild.com is helpful to all who visit it. to view a biography of eugene schwartz, the site’s creator, click here. to contact eugene, email him at: eschwartz1ster@gmail.com or iwaldorf@icloud.com












in addition to creating the waldorfonline courses for grades one through eight, during the past decade eugene schwartz has also created many streaming online courses. with the same breadth and depth that the waldorfonline courses approach the waldorf curriculum, eugene's courses explore the challenges, trials, and triumphs that individual teachers and the waldorf movement face in the twenty-first century. in the past, each courses was available only once a year. by popular demand, we are now making all of the courses accessible in two ways. each course will be featured once a year at the reduced fee of $100. and each course will be available for streaming all year long on our new catalyst courses web page. for those who wish to choose their own dates for course participation, the fee will be $150. new courses will be offered in the 2024-25 school year. to view all our presentations, visit the catalyst courses web site at:  iwaldorf.net/catalyst.html

there are growing numbers of waldorf students graduating from grade eight, but very few waldorf high schools ready to accommodate them. as of right now, help is on the way. for the first time, waldorf classes will be made available directly to high school students via the internet. eugene schwartz, who created the very successful online conferences, is developing high school main lesson blocks for homeschooling students, for students attending mainstream high schools who want to continue their waldorf experience, and for waldorf high school teachers who need some inspiration and resource materials to teach the main lesson blocks themselves. click here to learn more.click here to register
