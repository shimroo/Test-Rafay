how to identify someone who may be evading service



not only do process servers have a  number of duties and responsibilities when service of process goes as  planned, but when service becomes difficult these responsibilities  increase exponentially. it is of utmost importance that process servers  ensure that their service adheres to both state law and their clients’  instructions so as to be valid. failure to do so can result in a number  of problems such as increased costs and time for both the client and the  server. accordingly, ensuring that the party who is to be served  actually is the person served oftentimes requires thinking outside of  the box when faced with a difficult target.click here to read our 10 tips for verifying the identity of a difficult subject.

u.s. twitter subpoena is harassment, lawyer says



u.s. prosecutors’ demand that the microblogging service twitter inc. hand over data about users with ties to wikileaks amounts to harassment, said a lawyer for julian assange, the website’s founder.  the justice department subpoena, approved last month in federal court and later unsealed, also violates the u.s. constitution’s fourth amendment, which prohibits unreasonable government searches, assange’s lawyer mark stephens said today in a telephone interview in london. wikileaks is an organization that publishes leaked documents on its website.  “the department of justice is turning into an agent of harassment rather than an agent of law,” stephens, of the firm finers stephens innocent llp, said. “they’re shaking the tree to see if anything drops out, but more important they are shaking down people who are supporters of wikileaks.”  u.s. attorney general eric holder said nov. 29 that the justice department is investigating the posting by wikileaks of thousands of classified u.s. diplomatic communications and military documents. lawyers have said the u.s. will likely charge assange with espionage.  “to help users protect their rights, it’s our policy to notify users about law enforcement and governmental requests for their information, unless we are prevented by law from doing so,” twitter spokeswoman carolyn penner said in an e-mail.read more here and follow us on twitter!

why twitter was the only company to challenge the secret wikileaks subpoena



secret subpoenas of the kind the department of justice sent twitter are apparently not unusual. in fact, other tech companies may also have received similar wikileaks-related requests. but what is unusual in this story is that twitter resisted. which raises an interesting question: assuming that twitter was not the only company to have been served a secret subpoena, why was it the only company that fought back? the answer might lie in the figure leading twitter’s legal efforts, alexander macgillivray (right), an incredibly mild mannered (really) but sharp-as-a-tack cyber law expert.twitter’s general counsel comes out of harvard’s prestigious berkman center for internet and society, the cyber law powerhouse that has churned out some of the leading internet legal thinkers. the center was founded a little over a decade ago by none other than charles nesson, the famous defender of pentagon papers leaker daniel ellsberg. while at harvard, macgillivray helped teach a course on the law of cyberspace, along with wendy seltzer, a fellow at princeton’s center for information technology policy. today seltzer leads the chilling effects clearinghouse, a collaboration between several law schools and the electronic frontier foundation, which tracks legal challenges to lawful online activity.read more here and follow us on twitter!

some people think that seth rogen is making his crime-fighting debut this week in the green hornet. those people are mistaken.yes, rogen’s adaptation of the classic pulp character is fighting its way into theaters this weekend, but his turn as britt reid is hardly the first time that he’s played a gun-toting hero. rogen already covered that territory as pothead process server dale denton in 2008′s pineapple express, and based on comments from rogen’s screenwriting partner and pal evan goldberg, he could be headed back into the wacky world of weed-infused misadventures before much longer.speaking with screen rant, goldberg revealed:“i’m even hesitant to make pineapple 2, but i’m loosening up to it as of like the last few weeks. recently we were at danny mcbride’s wedding, and we were all there, well david couldn’t make it (david gordon green, the director of pineapple express); but me, (james) franco, seth and danny were all there and i thought; ‘this is fun, i have fun with these guys.’ … everyone has always wanted to do it, me and seth were very hesitant, but frankly i was the driving force behind that hesitancy. i just kept thinking, you know not to say we’re the coen brothers, because we’re super not – they’re my idols in a lot of ways – but those guys never make a sequel. like, great, great films don’t have sequels. … hopefully, there will be a sequel.”read more here and follow us on twitter!

casey anthony team denied subpoena for blogger's photos



casey anthony's defense attorneys suffered another blow today when they were denied a subpoena to collect what they suspect are a blogger's photos of the vacant, wooded area where her daughter's remains were found in 2008.judge belvin perry this afternoon denied a defense motion to subpoena searcher joe jordan's blog and internet photos, finding no factual basis to compel those items that may have appeared online.perry was not satisfied they would reveal meaningful "tangible" evidence and he expressed concerns that the defense was going on a "fishing expedition.""i cannot give you a license to fish," perry said soon before issuing his ruling today.perry did, however, deny the motion without prejudice, meaning the defense attorneys could revisit the issue if they can make a more compelling argument for the obtaining the information they seek.anthony, 24, is charged with first-degree murder in the 2008 death of her 2-year-old daughter, caylee marie, whose body was found in a lot off suburban drive near the anthony home months after she was reported missing.read more here and follow us on twitter!

louisville police to get electronic subpoenas in january



a decades-old problem of making sure louisville metro police officers know when they need to be in court may be fixed, thanks to a new electronic subpoena system that will start next month.outgoing mayor jerry abramson stood with police chief robert white and other city officials monday to announce the end of the county's cumbersome system of hand-delivering subpoenas to officers, an antiquated process that has helped cause thousands of felony and misdemeanor cases to be dismissed when police failed to appear.“it will improve by leaps and bounds everything that we have been able to do in terms of subpoenaing,” said abramson, noting the city is funding the new system through $480,000 in federal stimulus funds. “it will become a model for other communities statewide.”in recent years, an estimated 10 percent of the approximately 100,000 paper subpoenas issued annually to louisville police never reached officers, according to department officials.read more here and follow us on twitter!

a day in the life of a process server — business is good



tampa, florida — michael g. murray pulls his honda civic up to the gatehouse at cheval golf and country club, one of hillsborough county's priciest residential neighborhoods. the guard inside smiles as she takes murray's laminated photo id, which identifies him as a certified process server."you again," cheval's gatekeeper says with a grin. "how many you got this time?"murray, 45, pulls the top papers from a stack of recently filed foreclosure complaints piled on the armrest. "just one stop today," he says as the guard returns his id."all right then," she says. "good luck!"from the front seat of murray's car, which racks up about 50,000 miles a year zigzagging around northwest hillsborough county, one thing is clear: florida's foreclosure wave has washed away class distinctions. on this day in late november, he'll try to deliver foreclosure papers to owners of a double-wide as well as a $1.6 million lakeside mansion. he'll ring doorbells at a small pink-shuttered block home with grass gone to sand, a condo with a u.s. marine emblem on the door and a sprawling corner-lot estate with a well-tended lawn.read more here and follow us on twitter!

subpoena was not meant for plant worker



andover — a subpoena served at the north andover water treatment plant last week by andover police was not intended for water operator shawn rock, even though the police log said it was handed to him. the subpoena was addressed to the "keeper of records" at the plant, according to north andover assistant town manager ray santilli. a "keeper of records" is anyone who can access the records, he said. "it wasn't intended for anyone specifically in north andover," santilli said.  santilli said rock was the person on duty and accepted the subpoena when andover detective michael lane dropped it off around 9 a.m. last wednesday. it was written in andover's police log that the subpoena was "served in hand to employee shawn rock" but it did not say it was addressed to the records keeper.  the subpoena is one of two served last wednesday by andover police. the other was served in hand to cynthia vaughn, who previously worked as a water compliance specialist in andover, at her west newbury home.read more here and follow us on twitter!

former andover water employee served a subpoena at west newbury home



andover — police served a subpoena to a former employee of andover's water treatment plant at her west newbury home last week. the subpoena comes after police chief brian pattullo announced in september that the district attorney's office is preparing evidence to present to a grand jury as the result of an investigation into allegations of criminal misconduct involving two former employees at the lowell street water treatment plant. cynthia vaughn, who previously worked as a water compliance specialist in andover, was served the subpoena by andover detective michael lane at her 1 dole place home in west newbury around 9:45 a.m. dec. 22.  lt. james hashem said the subpoena is part of "an ongoing district attorney investigation" and declined to comment further. he referred all questions to the essex county district attorney's office. stephen o'connell, spokesman for the district attorney's office, declined comment on the matter. town manager reginald "buzz" stapczynski said that vaughn previously worked for the town but was "terminated" from her post in august. she was hired by the town in july 1996, according to the town's human resources department.read more here and follow us on twitter!

problems with foreclosure notices loom as next flaw in process



 improperly served foreclosure notices may be the mortgage industry's next  roadblock to repossessing homes.   the florida attorney general's office is investigating two of the state's  largest companies that serve court summonses on homeowners, while at the  same time judges are throwing out rulings based on faulty deliveries.   this month, appeals courts in miami and palm beach county sided with  homeowners in foreclosures where judges agreed their summonses were not  appropriately served.   in the miami case, the homeowner said she was recovering at her mother's home  after surgery when the person serving her the summons swore he personally  handed it to her at her residence.   but the server's own notes on the file showed he left the documents at the  door after seeing curtains move and assuming someone was home. the homeowner  later said she had no knowledge of the foreclosure until a final judgment  was entered against her.   "curtains may move because of the wind or curious cats, and not just  because some prospective defendant is attempting to avoid service," the  appeals decision noted.   once entrusted only to sheriff's deputies, summonses may now legally be  handled by "special process servers" certified by the court. with  the crush of foreclosures statewide, process service has become big business.read more here and follow us on twitter!

judge enforces chevron's subpoena of penn. lawyer



 (cn) - a federal judge said chevron can subpoena a pennsylvania lawyer and his firm over his role in a $113 billion environmental lawsuit against the oil company in ecuador. meanwhile in ecuador, one day after a judge closed the window to submit new evidence, chevron tried to invalidate the complaint because it allegedly contains forged signatures.     joseph kohn of kohn, swift & graf forfeited his right to attorney-client privilege by letting a documentary crew film strategy sessions, u.s. district judge jan dubois found.    kohn and another attorney, steven donziger, helped ecuadorians sue chevron over damage to their community from 30 years of drilling in the country conducted by texaco, which became a chevron subsidiary in 2001.    in a bid to draw international attention to the case, and mount pressure on chevron, they also invited filmmaker joseph berlinger to document the rainforest devastation. berlinger's access gave him an intimate look at the legal strategy adopted by the plaintiffs suing chevron in lago agrio, ecuador.read more here and follow us on twitter!

lawyer's ties to convicted process server probed

florida attorney general investigating companies that serve foreclosure papers



the first step in foreclosure process is that the homeowner is supposed to informed that the foreclosure is beginning. but as millions of americans face foreclosure, even the process of alerting the homeowner with the serving of a summons has been filled with errors. the times-union wrote about some of those problems in october. you can read that story here. now the miami herald has disclosed that the florida attorney general is investigating two of the larger companies whose job it is to deliver those papers. the herald reported that investigation began earlier this month of gissen & zawyer process service of miami and provest of tampa. provest is one of the nation's largest process servers. it was also the company involved in several of the cases that the times-union wrote about in october. a judge threw out one foreclosure case when he determined that the summons was allegedly served before the case was even filed.read more here and follow us on twitter!

accuserve process server seeks law firm clients as doggedly as defendants



accuserve llc’s daily grind is the stuff of tv  movies. the doorbell rings. the protagonist answers to what he thinks is a  flower delivery, but the delivery agent drops the flowers and slaps a  thick envelope into his hands instead. “you’ve been served,” the agent says, then spins on his heels and  walks away. believe it or not, the cliché is sometimes true, said kirk  wilhite, co-owner of accuserve, a grandview heights-based  process service firm. but it’s not common. “it’s true, there can be a lot of trickery to it. a lot of people are  expecting the complaint or summons, so they try to evade service. it’s  not uncommon for them to not answer the door,” wilhite said. not that that helps them. wilhite said in accuserve’s eight months in  business, he has a 100 percent success rate. in a nutshell, the business of process serving focuses on a brief and  elemental moment in civil cases – the serving of a civil complaint,  summons or subpoena. accuserve is a small but growing firm that wants to  make that moment in time big business. with only $5,000 in start up costs, wilhite said the company has done  $20,000 in its first eight months in business.read more here and follow us on twitter!

bill to target process servers



in mississippi, not much is required to be a process server, and some lawmakers believe that needs to change.rep. hank zuber, r-ocean springs, says he'll file a bill in the 2011 legislature that would require licensing and educational training for process servers. zuber believes the proposal, which died in the past, will have a chance next session because of the recent scrutiny given process servers handling child support cases for the mississippi department of human services.earlier this year, judges in hinds and jackson counties were reviewing hundreds of child support cases to determine whether some process servers had lied about delivering subpoenas.the process servers worked for subcontractors of youngwilliams child support division, a jackson-based company that received a $23 million contract to file about 15,000 cases, manage another 13,000 and operate a call center. company president rob wells has said about 30 of those cases are being reopened because they involved a process server facing the allegations.zuber said there have been other instances of process servers failing to properly perform their jobs and it's caused hardships for average citizens. zuber said the case of natalie parker of ocean springs is the reason he first filed the bill in 2008.parker's driver's license was revoked in 2003 and, because of that, she missed out on job opportunities. she eventually wound up living in her car. zuber said parker had told him about how a process server had lied about delivering papers to notify parker about a lawsuit that had been filed against her.read more here and follow us on twitter!
