running strong changes lives​
"we were so grateful to running strong for the school supplies and backpacks. our local programs are operating on limited budgets and were not able to help this year. running strong filled a void and helped families who would not have been able to get help."​

program spotlight 

clean water 

when running strong for american indian youth® was formed in 1986, getting clean, safe drinking water to the residents of pine ridge was one of our top priorities. previously, running strong satisfied this need by drilling water wells. however, the need for wells declined as the oglala sioux rural water supply system was created and water lines were laid providing access to water. this past year through diné naabehótó (the navajo people’s water challenge), running strong connected 13 households to water in these communities, providing 92 individuals with access to clean, running water.
