the rainbow center drag show 2025: love in full color
2025 is quickly around the corner and so is the 2025 uconn rainbow center drag show: love in full color in collaboration with the african american cultural center and the black queer student association.
to love in full color means accepting all parts of ourselves and not conforming to one notion of love, gender, sexuality, and relationship. this show is about celebrating that community, that love, and that space of freedom and resilience.
the 2025 uconn rainbow center drag show host will be revealed soon and the show will also feature performers from across ct, student performers, and other amazing acts.
tickets are on sale now and can be purchased here. tickets are free for current uconn students and 5$ for faculty, staff, and community.
we hope to see you there!
