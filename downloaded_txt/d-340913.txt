the chequered history of pakistan film industry is interspersed with many vicissitudes. starting almost from a scratch soon after the political division of the sub-continent,  it gradually progressed  to achieve  self-reliance and prosperity, and a time came when it could proudly and successfully compete with quality films made across the border in india, matching them in all departments of cinematography.

the golden era of pakistan cinema was the  period  which  spanned the  decades of the 60s and 70s, although a number of good movies had already been produced in lahore studios during the second half  of  the 50s. a large number of dedicated workers and movie-makers, who had made names during their stay in mumbai, like producer-directors  nazir, shaukat hussain rizvi and w z ahmad (and their actress-wives swaran lata, nur jehan and  neena); directors nazir ajmeri, luqman, s fazli and masud parvez; and play-actors of the calibre of shah nawaz, shakir, alauddin, charlie, ghauri, himaliyawala, sadiq ali, shameem, najma and ragni contributed to the evolution of pakistan film industry during the formative years of the new state.
