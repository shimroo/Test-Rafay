today's update 
							and, ...or fishing report

10/1/24  eye doctor 
								appointment in about a week to get my eyes 
								fixed.  hopefully by 2025 everyday updates 
								will resume,

9/19/24  suspending 
								daily updates has taken a toll on my 
								productivity.  for over 20 years updates 
								kept me focused at tasks at hand.  now i 
								have to dig deep for any kind of forward 
								progress.  1sy part of october have an 
								appointment with dr. reimer in ludington about 
								cataract surgery.

/7/24  thanks to all 
								who have visited this website over the years. 
								pause in daily chats is not of my chosing.  
								my body when it entered this world in november 
								of 1946 came with a time stamp that said, ":best 
								if used my july 2024."  ever since it's 
								been a struggle with tasks that now take me 4 
								times as long to do 1/3 as much.

9/2/24  hope you had 
								a safe and enjoyable holiday weekend. today's a 
								toughie for me, because of vision issues.  
								been doing daily chats since the year 2000.  
								that's over 8k,  conservative estimate.  
								until i get cataract surgery, daily updates will 
								happen only once, or twice a week.  

8/29/24 my failing 
								eyesight is making updates nearly impossible.  
								17th of next month have an appointment with 
								reimereye care to get cataract surgery.  
								live long enough, everyone gets cataracts 
								according to the eye doc.  detail work of 
								any kind is beyond difficult.  for now, 
								making tackle under a large lighted magnifying 
								glass to get by. 

8/28/24  interesting 
								photo of the day sent in by larry m.  he 
								was fishing out of harbor beach on lake huron on 
								8/24/24 in over 100 of water and caught a 
								walleye on one of our scented soft plastic rip 
								teezer.  proving that if it looks like food 
								to one type of fish, all species do the same.

								rp walleye

8/27/24  here's a 
								good read about sink holes in lk mi and lk. 
								huron: 
								
								click for article

8/26/24  here's a 
								good lesson on "new" impulse purchases.  
								it's about the old school iconic firedot 
								pattern.  for me? ...this color has worked 
								since 1969 with 1000s of fish meeting their 
								demise.  what would you rather have? "new" 
								or a proven fish killer?  here's 
								testimonial:
								!
"cbull's title, "firedot for the win!

fire dot, with red led 
									blinker and west coast setup; accounted for 
									4 this morning. 2 misses, but those were 
									both doubles and just couldnt hook up 
									solid.  east platte bay, 70 fow to 
									115 ...cbull

8/23/24  it;s easy to 
								have a grin on your mug when you have a 100 
								pounds of kings hanging as today's featured 
								photo of ludington's very own capt. kirk.  
								this past week's cooler than normal temps mean n 
								wind with colder water temps new shore.  
								providing an incentive for the salmon to head up 
								our rivers, streams and creeks. 

8/22/24  here's a kayak 
								fish report on coho action in e platte bay, 17 
								miles n of frankfort, mi by water:

your white spoon with 
									green led and west cost style single hook 
									and barrel swivel, accounted for all of 
									these.  gonna try your firedot led 
									spoonin the am.  75 to 100 fow.  
									chuck b.

8/20/24  finally on 
								track with orders that came in over the weekend.  
								vision issues are no fun, lost depth perception 
								that make tacking building a challenge.
                
								in 2 weeks will get word on cataract surgery and 
								new eye treatment called absmoi that being 
								advertized on tv.,  only wish i could 
								update you on fishing, but feel it's been decent 
								at cantral lk. mi ports.  bad nwes travels 
								faster than good.  tomorrow? ...people 
								looking for bait.

8/16/24  in the 
								nicest way possible, i'm envious of those 
								fishing the great lakes.  feeling the surge 
								of the waves and seeing big kings coming to the 
								net is s sight to behold.  my present 
								physical being makes me more a liability aboard 
								than an asset.  so, enjoy yourself while 
								you still can, before life throws curve balls at 
								you!   

8/15/24  missed a few 
								days.  working with a patched together 
								computer system when win 10 auto update 
								corrupted the hard drive in 2 of my 4 computer 
								network.  murphy's law happened at the 
								worst possible time.
               
								good news is lk. mi has rebounded from the 
								drastic chinook/king salmon stocking cuts.  
								everyone i spoke with lately ordering tackle had 
								good things to say from a variety of ports.
								

8/12/24 doctor's 
								appointment at 10am is going slow down work 
								building and shipping orders.  so, that 
								sucks!  rip teezers long term usage id 
								tomorrow's focus.

8/10/24  received an 
								interesting note in the special comment section 
								during check out from my webstore. reminding me 
								that i got it right making our rip teezers fake 
								bait.  here's what aaron w. from grand 
								rapids, mi had to say:

"the rip teasers that i got last 
								time are awesome, i've went something like 12 
								for 13 with one strip that i am still using the 
								very same strip."
