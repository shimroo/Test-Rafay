anonymous daughter



as an adopted person, i wanted to avoid the potential complications of a reunion with my birth-parents. so, when my biological father sought me out, i kept my identity a secret, using the adoption agency as a go-between. we maintained a long-term correspondence, though he never knew my name. for eight years, i exchanged intimate letters with a faceless alcoholic serving time in a federal prison for bank robbery.  this is our story.

about me





anne ginther


i was adopted.  i could have been stuck in foster care for a very long time (read "my special day" link below), if it were not for a very loving family that took in this tiny seed with no promise, and loved me as their own.  now i am enjoying nurturing the seeds of goodness in all sorts of kids, to help them realize how much value each of them brings to the world!  :)  i am blessed!
