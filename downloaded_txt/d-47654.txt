                          rrc’s abandoned mine program helps landowner reclaim pastureland
                        
february 07, 2025

austin – a central texas landowner is breathing a sigh of relief thanks to an rrc program that restored her property to its natural state.
the rrc’s abandoned mine land (aml) program recently completed a project restoring land that was at an abandoned mine site in rockdale, about 50 miles east of austin. the extensive work over the course of a couple of months involved earthwork, erosion control, repairing more than 450 sinkholes, and revegetation.
the sinkholes had been fatal for some of the cattle on the property when they became trapped in the holes in the ground hidden by brush.

aml has now completed more than 105 projects since 1977 with a distinct high-tech aspect added to the rrc’s decades of expertise.  
“we’ve been leveraging modern technology for our aml projects as the years have progressed, and the rockdale project is a great example,” said joe parks, rrc surface mining and reclamation division director. “we used drones and light detection and ranging (lidar) to examine the land and properly identify sinkholes and previous mining. a lidar created detailed 3d maps of surfaces using laser pulses measuring depth and distances.”
