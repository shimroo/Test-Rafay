a global community connected through systems theory, science, and practice 






 
 

"to gain knowledge, we must learn to ask the right questions; and to get answers, we must act, not wait for answers to occur to us."
 
isss past president anatol rapoport

 
 
 
 
 
 
the isss is a community of researchers, learners, and practitioners who are devoted to transdisciplinary inquiry into the nature of complex systems and the application of systems approaches for transformative change.

 
conceived in 1954, the isss advances systems science theory and application by connecting and enabling researchers and practitioners, and disseminates the knowledge of systems to a global audience. 
 
as an international society we are exploring ways to translate this website into other languages. you can enter the website address here https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=es&op=websites to start a machine translation process.
