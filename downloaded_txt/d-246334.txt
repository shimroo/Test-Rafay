a new vision for church leadership



long-time family friends and ministry partners, neely mcqueen & pat swanson, began a new chapter for overlake in 2020 as co-lead pastors. this is a biblical model - so old, it feels new - where leadership expands beyond one person or personality. multiple perspectives, experiences & giftings are present, while responsibilities & burdens are shared which serves the health of the whole church, including the mcqueens & swansons. it’s cliché, but true - we’re better together! learn more from this sunday message & this podcast interview.

we get it - connecting with others can be hard.here are ways people like you have found community at overlake christian church.










new to the seattle area

being young adults new to seattle, we have loved finding community here. from spontaneous conversations in the hallway to serving on ministries with friends, overlake has made seattle feel like a home and a family.











a refreshing church experience

we're so grateful to have found a place that genuinely invests in a fun and thriving ministry for young kids like ours, as well as older kids and teenagers. overlake is a place with energy, enthusiasm, and passion, but also values sound oversight, stewardship, and integrity. we immediately resonated with the philosophy and realization of the co-lead model, and we are excited to continue to connect and grow here.











spanish-speaking community

at overlake we found a church where everyone is welcomed and can serve equally. we love the celebration of cultures and enjoy working with the hispanic community which is one of the many diverse groups at overlake. we’ve gotten to discover our gifts and put them into action!
