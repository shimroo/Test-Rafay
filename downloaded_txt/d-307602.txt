unlock their potential


wps is a leading independent publisher of educational and psychological assessments and related intervention resources. with more than 70 years of experience, we’ve built a global reputation as assessment experts in the areas of autism, speech and language, school and clinical psychology, and occupational therapy.
 
we develop tests that improve clinical evaluation, inform diagnosis, and guide therapy. in doing so, we foster personal connections between authors and the clinicians, educators, and researchers who use their tests. when we develop a new test, we bring an author’s idea to life, answer a researcher’s question, meet a clinician’s need, and, ideally, change an individual’s life for the better.
