join us for the 27th annual high road art tour september 21, 22, and 28, 29 2024 - always the last two full weekends of september

 

the high road art tour is a destination and an event. each fall in northern new mexico artists on the high road to taos open their studios and galleries two consecutive weekends for the high road art tour. this is when the trees turn yellow and the autumn sky deepens to cobalt so the tour offers one of the loveliest drives in the loveliest of seasons. it is also an historic trip that winds through tiny, old land grant villages and rural countryside.but best of all, the high road art tour allows visitors to see multiple arts and crafts, traditional and contemporary, created by local artists. the tour allows visitors to meet and purchase directly from these artists. many of the studios are open year-round, and some only during the tour.

   




































































































































































































































































































general informationthe high road to taos scenic byway is a lovely, winding road through the sangre de cristo mountains between santa fe and taos. it offers magnificent vistas of snow-capped peaks, alpine meadows, and charming traditional spanish and pueblo villages.this lovely scenery has inspired many artists and artisans who live along the high road, some of whom are featured in our blog:please call or email the artist(s) before you go on days other than the studio tour weekends.please consider supporting our organization, we are a 501(c)3 nonprofit, and your donations are tax deductible.
