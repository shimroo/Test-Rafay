ezra neese
student, class of 2026
“part of why i chose oregon tech is because so many people in my family went, and because it was close to home. once i was there, however, i quickly realized that the small class sizes, the great professors, and the ability of everyone to openly discuss and share new ideas or have a new perspective on old ideas.”




 


morgan owings
student, class of 2027
“with a few years of experience, i plan on going back to school to get my master's degree in software engineering and assess if i am ready for a job in the gaming industry. i may even start my own game company to make my own games.”




 


elsa peterson
student, class of 2027
“oregon tech, for me, was the perfect college to fit my needs. i fell in love with the campus and the school's goal to make learning more hands-on, better preparing their students for their careers.”
