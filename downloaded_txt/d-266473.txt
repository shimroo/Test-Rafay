what our students have to say 
















"i used pdunow services to get the pdus necessary to complete my recertification in a quick and easy manner. pdunow has a great subscription model and the site is no-frills and easy to follow. the only thing you have to do is put in the time to complete your units. i highly recommend using this service if you need to complete many pdus in a short amount of time."

treena, pmp

















“at first i was skeptical because i was used to paying $400 for 60 pdus but i am pleasantly surprised. i earned all my pdus for one fee.”



nancy, pmp













“most companies offer a low price for a few pdus but the pdunow site provided a 60 pdu bundle for one fee. it is a great deal.”
