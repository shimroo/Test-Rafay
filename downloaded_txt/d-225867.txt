mag announces first quarter 2024 production from juanicipio

	 

	vancouver, british columbia, april 24, 2024  -- mag silver corp. (tsx / nyse american: mag) (“mag” or “mag silver”) reports production from juanicipio (56% / 44% fresnillo plc (“fresnillo”) and mag, respectively) for the first quarter (“q1”) ended march 31, 2024.

	 

q1 highlights

	 

	solid throughput: juanicipio processed 325,684 tonnes of ore in q1. despite a routine 4 day maintenance shutdown during the quarter, juanicipio delivered 3,980 tonnes per operating day milling performance confirming its operational efficiency and ability to quickly pick up where it left off.

	continued strong grades: the average silver head grade for the quarter was 476 grams per tonne (“g/t”), marginally higher than the previous quarter. this, together with our robust initial reserve as outlined in the recently released technical report, further reaffirms juanicipio’s status as a high-grade mineral deposit with significant long-term potential.

	improving recovery: recovery for the quarter was higher than the previous quarter across all metals showcasing the ongoing operational enhancements and optimization efforts at juanicipio.

	robust production and guidance on track: juanicipio surpassed expectations with preliminary production estimates of 4.4 million silver ounces and 9,927 gold ounces in q1.

amex to consolidate team zone with 210 and e3 gold zones to form a 1.4 km mineralized corridor and announces further drill results

	montreal, quebec--(newsfile corp. - april 24, 2024) - amex exploration inc. (tsxv: amx) (fse: mx0) (otcqx: amxef) ("amex or the company") is pleased to announce that after continuing to advance its geological understanding on the perron project, further drilling identified similarities between the team zone, 210 and e3 gold zones, therefore making it logical to combine the three. the consolidated gold zones will retain the name team zone, which creates one larger mineralized corridor straddling the normétal fault on the northeastern side of the beaupré block (see figure 1). the decision is geologically driven as all three zones display remarkable similarity in their lithologies, structures and mineralization style (figure 5).

	 

	the company is also pleased to announce further drill results from these zones (see figure 4 and tables 1 and 2). with up to 14 known zones across the perron property, this decision will improve simplicity and will save time in the ongoing modelling process and drill data compilation.

highgold mining drills 33.6m at 12.1 g/t aueq and provides update on advanced exploration plan, johnson tract project, alaska usa

	jt deposit infill drilling returns 33.6 meters at 7.9 g/t au, 0.91% cu, 4.81% zn, 0.51% pb, 7 g/t ag (12.1 g/t aueq)

	 

	vancouver, british columbia--(november 20, 2023) - highgold mining inc. (tsxv: high) (otcqx: hgmif) ("highgold" or the "company") is pleased to provide an update on its 2023 exploration and development program (the "program") including final drill results at the johnson tract polymetallic gold project ("johnson tract", "jt" or the "project") in southcentral alaska, usa. the project hosts the high-grade jt deposit with an indicated resource of 1.05 moz at 9.39 g/t gold equivalent ("aueq") with average true thickness of 40m.

	 

	following completion of the spin-out of onyx gold corp. this summer (see highgold news release dated june 6, 2023), highgold squarely focused on unlocking value at the high-grade jt deposit. in parallel with exploration drilling to expand existing deposits and target new prospects, the company launched on a major program of advanced exploration and de-risking activities to support the evaluation of a potential high-grade, low-impact, underground mine.

amex reports 47.70 m of 16.97 g/t au from high grade zone down strike from drill hole pe-23-710 at perron

	montreal, quebec--(november 14, 2023) - amex exploration inc. (tsxv: amx) (fse: mx0) (otcqx: amxef) ("amex or the company") is pleased to announce a significant intercept of 47.70 meters at 16.97 g/t au from hole pe-23-710, identified during resource-focused drilling of the high grade zone ("hgz"), part of the eastern gold zone ("egz"), of the perron project. see figure 1 for a plan view of the geology of the egz, figure 2 for a longitudinal section of the hgz, figure 3 for images of gold mineralization, table 1 for assay results, and table 2 for drillhole coordinates. as displayed in figures 1 & 2, a north-south trending proterozoic dike cross-cuts the hgz and the related denise zone.

	 

	as part of amex's resource-focused drilling, it was recommended that the company drill west-east to define the margins of a late cross-cutting proteozoic diabase dike, in order to precisely quantify its shape and volume for resource modelling. during this exercise, amex drilled partially along the strike of the hgz and identified spectacular visible gold over a significant width (see figure 3) in an area previously thought to be weakly mineralized. these results showcase the along-strike continuity as well as the consistent high-grade nature of the hgz. amex is currently completing five additional drillholes in this orientation to define the dike from near-surface to depth.

white gold corp. intercepts 5.04 g/t au over 20.85m in western extension of near surface high-grade gold zone; identifies additional gold occurrences in the sulphide domain at betty ford target, white gold district, yukon, canada

	toronto, nov. 14, 2023  -- white gold corp. (tsx.v: wgo, otcqx: whgof, fra: 29w) (the "company") is pleased to announce results for 2023 exploration diamond drilling at the betty ford target on the betty property (figure 1). assay results for hole betfd23d015 include 5.04 g/t au over 20.85 m within the near-surface oxide domain from 18.65 m depth, including two higher-grade subintervals grading 13.34 g/t au over 2.30 m and 11.47 g/t au over 2.05 m. a zone of gold mineralization was also encountered deeper within the sulphide domain of the host breccia unit, grading 0.44 g/t au over 28.55 m from 107.85 m depth, and including a subinterval of 1.38 g/t au over 6.15 m. the 2023 diamond drilling also encountered a second breccia unit approximately 30 to 50 m north of the main gold bearing breccia, with the potential for near-surface gold mineralization in the oxide portion of this breccia remaining untested.
