r.a. salvatore



all readers will find pure, often heart-racing enjoyment as they are drawn into salvatore's beautifully crafted world.

























the witch of whispervale
from the legendary author and creator of drizzt do'urden comes the next installment in the new york times bestselling demonwars fantasy series, about the traitorous invasion by the xoconai of the eastern realms of corona.
however, the heroes of the last war against their demon god may be forgotten, but they are not powerless.
treaties are discarded as the full invasion of the xoncai has begun and war returns to corona. consolidating resistance on land in behren and within the abbeys as a last stand against the golden warriors is the catalyst for the return of the most powerful gem-wielding witch the world has ever known.

yet, as the rumor of a witch of gemstone magic reaches the xoconai they send a hunter, so brutal he is known as the coyote, to find her in this novel set at the beginning of a new war in r. a. salvatore's bestselling world of heroic fantasy.

editorial reviews



publishers weekly (starred review)
on relentless

the exhilarating conclusion to salvatore's generations trilogy (after boundless) illustrates the power of family, both born and chosen … amid epic sword and sorcery clashes, salvatore makes a powerful case for love and compassion conquering even the strongest of evils. fans will be sad to see this fantastic series end.

on the demon awakens

an enthralling epic adventure story, it introduces memorable characters and an intricate scheme of magic the readers won't soon forget.



publishers weekly
on boundless

rip-roaring. [...] magnificantly detailed swordplay scenes and gruesome enemies continue to mark salvatore as a top author of fantasy adventure.
