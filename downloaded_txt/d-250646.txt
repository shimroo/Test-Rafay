the national committee for the history of art (ncha) is the u.s. affiliate of the international community of art historians, the comité international d’histoire de l’art (ciha). both the ncha and ciha aim to foster intellectual exchange among scholars, teachers, students and others interested in art history broadly conceived as encompassing art, architecture, and visual culture across geographical boundaries and throughout history. through the organization of scholarly conferences of varying size and scope, both ncha and ciha promote the communication, dissemination and exchange of knowledge and information about art history and related fields, ultimately seeking to promote a global community of art historians.
