       causeway coastal route~ a travel companion ~


   



   dream, explore, discover...


   welcome to my causeway coastal route travel companion, where new experiences and the possibilities of being unplugged arise. this designated and way-marked route follows the coast of northern ireland between the cities of belfast and derry with nine additional scenic loop drives to explorer by car, bicycle, or foot. you can start the journey from either city or join the route at numerous access points allowing you to tailor your journey. the  causeway coastal route connects seamlessly to the 'wild atlantic way' at muff in donegal and in belfast to the 'mourne coastal route' creating a unique drive around most of ireland and the whole coast of northern ireland.


   landscapes of myth and legends...


    




   enjoy, remember, return...
