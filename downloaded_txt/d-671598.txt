              adk mohican chapter is dissolving by the end of 2024 after 41 years in existence.
              there are other adk chapters in the region which can provide opportunities for you to hike, kayak/canoe, backpack, cross-country ski, and bike; and otherwise fulfill your passion for the outdoors with like-minded people, including adk's north new jersey-ramapo and mid-hudson chapters, whose activities take place primarily in the hudson river valley.
              
              also, the adk website includes a chapter events page listing activities across the entire organization.
              we hope that you will continue to support the adirondack mountain club.
