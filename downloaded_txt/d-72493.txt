orbital motion - kepler's laws


february 19 is the birthday of nicolaus copernicus, born in 1473. with the posthumous publication of his opus de revolutionibus orbium coelestium in 1543, copernicus is credited with starting the scientific revolution by stating that the planets orbit the sun rather than earth. this ran counter to what was taught by the catholic church and led to a series of battles between science and religion that reverberated for centuries. during this period, galileo galilei, johannes kepler, and isaac newton made significant advances in the understanding of gravitation and planetary orbits. 

                  

students can explore how planets orbit the sun using the orbital motion – kepler’s laws gizmo. in the gizmo, students can control the initial velocity of a planet moving around the sun and observe the resulting orbit. they will see that planetary orbits are elliptical, that planets speed up when they are closer to the sun, and that orbits are independent of planetary mass. one of the most interesting things to observe is that, by zooming in on the sun, you can see that the sun actually makes a small elliptical orbit just like the planet. this makes sense when you consider that, just as the planetary orbit is shaped by the gravity of the sun, the sun’s (much smaller) orbit is shaped by the gravity of the planet.

everybody's talking about gizmos


hello, ms. d. i apologize about emailing you during the weekend, but i couldn’t wait to tell you. gizmos is so much fun, and i absolutely love it. i actually learn something and i like the fact that it is interactive. thank you so much for making us do gizmos.

- gizmos student, american international school, abu dhabi



i really love gizmos as they help students grasp difficult concepts that can’t always be seen. they make abstract ideas come to life.

- gizmos teacher, foothills school division, alberta, canada



i’m really a strong proponent of gizmos in science because i have seen firsthand what it does in terms of engaging kids in labs. gizmos really allow students to go deeper in terms of problem solving and critical thinking.

- gizmos assistant superintendent, miami-dade public schools, fl



gizmos stem cases improve students’ content knowledge and critical thinking ability. the kids are putting more thought into things and they’re asking better questions.

- gizmos director of science, gwinnett county public schools, ga



gizmos stem cases is the most engaging program that i’ve ever seen! high-quality graphics and real-world stories make them more thought-provoking than traditional teaching materials. students become more personally invested in the lessons and feel a sense of accomplishment [when doing them].

- gizmos director of science, walker school, ga










gizmos associated with higher performance on ngss-aligned state science assessmentsdata from more than 22,000 students at over 115 schools found that higher gizmos usage led to a higher likelihood of meeting or exceeding proficiency on two different state science achievement tests.middle school study   high school study
