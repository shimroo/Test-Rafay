example

would put their profile in here so we
could keep up with each other. we are all getting older now

don't just read these profiles.....put yours in too!"

your class.

east
high
school,
circa 1967


memories:
"the good ole days" at east. 
   
do
you know ...

        ...
you almost went to prescott high school?
        ...
when the annex was built?
        ...
how many were in east's first senior class?
the answers are here
for you as you look back at east high school   



feeling the east high
spirit by
now? double the dose, listen to a rendition of the east high fight
song that was used in the late 1950s and throughout the
60s and into the 70s. if you know of a better arrangement which sounds
more like our band played it, or have a recording of the east band
playing it, please contact editor@easthigh.org.





historic film of east & east activities



for many years it was hoped that someone would have film of east high
in the early years to document the time long ago. suddenly, about 12
years into the existence of the east high alumni page several films
became available, including one that is believed to be the first day of
school at east high in 1948! through the kindness of alumni who wish to
share memories of these moments with you, these films are now available
for you to watch from these pages. go to our video
page to see what we've got. we should also note there are videos
available from our "in the news..." page as
well, but these are more recent videos about alumni. 
  


east elementary school



the east high alumni page received the fastest responses and one of the most
heartfelt ones when we introduced our section devoted to east
elementary school. for the first 37 years of its operation, east was
home to the first through sixth grades as well as junior and senior
high. many students attended only east high for their entire primary
and secondary education. there were no elementary school yearbooks in
those days but sometimes there were class photos. this section relies
on you very heavily for contributions of photos, facts, and memories.
take a look at our childhood years at east on our east elementary school page. 
  


special honors

the east high alumni page joins a huge majority of the school's alumni
in honoring the school, its faculty and staff, and fellow alumni. it
comes to mind, however, that there are some few associated with east
who stand out even from this august history, those who have achieved
and excelled beyond the norm even among our prominent fellows, and
those who gave their lives in military service to the united states of
america. for these special honors, we have pages in recognition of
their contributions. please visit our hall
of honor and our military memorial.
       
       
       



east high
sports championships
while the purpose of east high school has been the
education of pupils in behavior and academics, athletics have been a
big part of the student body experience. many fine athletes have
attended east. here we recognize some of the people and teams who won
state championships (or finished as runner-up). see
the list.
