ohio railroad page





dedicated to ohio railroads, past and present



this site features photos, images, and info on ohio railroads (and some
western pa and northwest wv), as well as links to other good railroad sites.
ohio is rich with rail, but it used to have a lot more. the erie, b&o,
pennsylvania, new york central, nickel plate (wheeling & lake erie), akron-barberton belt, and the ac&y (akron, canton &
youngstown) all ran through the akron area. now all that's left is csx, norfolk-southern, and the new
wheeling & lake erie. this site
is designed to take you back, and also deals with present operations of
the roads that remain 



b&o color position light signal. enjoy them while you can, they'll be gone before you know it.
