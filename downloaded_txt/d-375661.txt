cio, dine brands



tray, an innovative point of sale and restaurant management platform geared toward enterprise restaurants, today announced a multi-year deal with ihop® restaurants in the us.
in this new partnership, ihop will be upgrading its current pos systems to tray’s system. the new system allows ihop franchisees to leverage more efficient training, and allows for more up to date technology throughout the restaurants. since tray technology uses android-based hardware, it provides an additional cost-savings opportunity for franchisees and allows for rapid conversion with minimal restaurant disruption.
“tray meets the stringent requirements for our business and the business of our franchisees now and in the future,” said justin skelton, chief information officer of dine brands. “tray’s ability for customization allows for continued growth and innovation.”

i have recently switched over to tray from micros. what a fantastic switch. the course of operations within the system is so much more logical and efficient to use. all sub and add options are within the main button or menu item. to get used to this system for employees who have worked for years or employees who are brand new is the same. i believe it is because of the way the system includes all ingredients that make up the order and the fact that all you need to modify an order is within easy reach on the page of your main menu item. at ihop 4667 we love this system.

				what do you want to know?            
enterprise pos system faqs









 
						what is an enterprise pos system?        




an enterprise pos system is one that’s designed expressly for the needs of multi-site operators. whether this is managing prices, items, promotions, taxes or other configuration updates or running reports and conducting analysis across multiple stores, enterprise pos platforms like tray have been built from the ground up to meet these complex needs. enterprise pos systems are built to handle the technical rigors of a large brand – the ability to process the tens of thousands of records every minute with high performance so your data is ready when you are.





 
						what features should i look for in an enterprise pos system?        




the key difference in an enterprise system is the ability to manage large amounts of locations in a simple, easy manner. look for the ability to update an item and evaluate the complexity needed to complete that process. does it give you all the controls you need? are there any single points of failure (site controllers, on premise servers, etc) that could block a store from getting the updated information? how does the platform scale to handle peak business days? these are all questions that tray has answered to meet the needs of the enterprise market.





 
						how much does an enterprise pos system cost?        




the best part of tray is it’s priced market competitively – meaning in many cases you won’t pay more for an enterprise system with tray than you will with other platforms that aren’t enterprise grade. but remember to factor in all the cost elements – are you required to use a specific credit card processor? is there proprietary hardware involved? with tray you can choose your own processor and hardware insuring you’re getting the absolute best deal – and service –  for your brand at all times.





 
						how do i choose the right enterprise pos system for my restaurant?        




first thing, click the button above to get a demo with tray. seriously, there are several choices on the market today. the key is finding one that has the ability to scale with your brand over time. look for a way to establish a solid partnership including a clear process to get product innovations delivered quickly and affordably. do you have the ability to interface with your partners as you see fit? can you select your own hardware and payment options? as your brand grows it will be key to have as much flexibility as possible – and with the pos being the center of the transaction system it is the most critical system to be able to interface and adapt.





 
						can the tray enterprise pos system really integrate with my existing hardware?        




yes! and while that’s important the real key is to find one that leverages a long-term strategy of being independent of hardware. too many times brands have faced significant capital investments or had to delay guest innovation because in order to take advantage of new pos features they had to upgrade hardware. with tray, our customers know they will have the ability to drive innovation, meet guest needs and keep costs low for a long time.
