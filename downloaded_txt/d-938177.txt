we have been coming to villa elegante regularly since 1999.  this is the top vacation rental complex in the santa barbara area.  the units are secure, well furnished and spotlessly clean.  we can walk to the east beach in five minutes and drive anyplace in sb or montecito in fifteen minutes.

we have been coming to villa elegante for our family’s thanksgiving holiday for 17 years, and we can’t imagine thanksgiving week without these wonderful and comfortable surroundings! i cook a complete feast for our sons , daughters-in-law, and grandchildren: the kitchen is fabulously equipped and the appliances top notch! and the beach and shore walking/running paths are just steps away. the werners have always taken good care of us, and are available to answer any questions. we will be back in november for year 18!

you just can’t find a timeshare or rental in a better area or with a better climate than villa elegante. my wife and i have been staying at villa elegante, twice a year, for the last 15 years. mel and tim werner are excellent hosts whose one desire is to provide you with the villa elegante experience.
