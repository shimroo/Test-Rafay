'retirement project'





  all in, all done !! as the saying goes, my part of the project is finished.lincoln coderre, of domain doors, hung the overhead door onwill's carport on thursday, and while he was doing that, i finished up a cornerworkbench inside the shop that i started wednsday, so, i am 'all done'  !!it has been and interesting 6 month exercise. from 1974 to the end of 1979 i worked as a carpenter formark breen builders in the manchester/stratton area. during that time, i think at one point we counted up 30 plus houses that we workedon in that time ... things were simpler then, for sure!for instance, some houses take a little longer these days ...we started doing some work on that one in late 2021 and i'mnot sure if it is completely finished yet! 12.12.2024  i tried the 'retirement thing' once before,back in 2018 ...but for many reasons back then it didn't 'stick',and i spent the next 5 years working with and mentoringour nephew kristian moore, who is now takingon the new furniture projects that come our way ...at this point, he can do anything i can do,only he can do it better !my 'executive function' has left the building, and,i realize that at 77 it ain't coming back. so, what to do with all that free time since my 'last project' well, i guess you can't have too many buildings, and will is taking up quite a lot of space in sam's shopwith the mills and lathes for his banjo business.to be located just outside of sam's shop so, here we go!this one will likely be the last building at the 'west dorset industrial park'below, the rafters will start to go up tomorrow!nothing like three weeks of concrete and carpentryto make you feel all of your 77 years ...more process photos belowslab by ashley waite, of waite foundations ..aka 'hippie foundations' in 1974 ... ashley poured the foundation for our first housein arlington in 1974 ... it was great to work with him again. red mountain road  arlington, 1974this past tuesday 8.27 ... progress has been made ...  we had some professionals here from scott thompson builders for 4 days the week of september 3rd, and they got us going pretty good they got the ridge beam up, the rafters and the plywood and paper on the roof .. they also studded the gables and got the plywood on them ... thanks guys! luke and i trimmed the roof and we are ready for the slate, which should start to happen soon ... first day of rough wiring by brophy electric last friday ...  10/13  update ... 2 months and 10 days since the dydo and company backhoe arrived, things are really happening now.   the siding is complete most of the way around the building and we should be able to wrap it up on the next sunny day . the beautiful purple slate is being installed by dave and zack wilmott of battenkill slate and is complete on the right side and on the carport,and, as with the siding, the roof will likely be done the next sunny day too ...the sheetrock has been hung by versatile drywall, and the taper will be here 'first thing friday' ... seth of longboardlumber.com will be here  tomorrowwith some ribbon stripe mahogany for the the double doorson the front. then, some paint on the walls and floor, the big doors on the front, and we'll be ready for the lights and will's machines!more soon! november 1st ... three months to the day since dydo and company showed up with the backhoe ...the slate is all on now ... dave finished it up last saturday ...  the attic stairway went in yesterdayand the doors are hung with temporary plywood panels ...i have to detail the sapele panels and make 64 moldings to fix them in place ... we hope to move the machines in next week!the heat is on thanks to gsk climate control 11.15. 2024 ... okay!  the machines were moved yesterday and they are in their rough locations now ... thanks tosparky from dydo & co. for his help moving some heavy and sometimes awkward stuff! the super accurate hardinge lathe the spinning lather and horizontal millthe leblond in the cornerand sam has his shop back!with lots more space!and the new brazing station is almost set to goa 360 degree video view here12.12 ... the big sapele doors are done, and allof will's machines are wired up and ready to runfor me about all that is left to wrap this up isa nice overhead door for the car port.we are meeting with the overhead door guy tomorrow.i am hoping to do something on the left there in keeping with the big doors  ... i need to order some sapele marine plywood to match. four buildings plus a sawdust shed .. that should about do it !home stretch on the overhead door, the last piece of the puzzlethe glass is in and the finish is on!there is a hardware part that is back ordered and will not be here until early february.we're ready to go!

2024 vs 2015





 well ... things are certainly different now!above is a to do list from 2015 with about 20 client names on it !click that one to see some images from the list ..and below is this week so far ...my 'last project' left for long island a couple of weeks ago, our completely competent nephew  kristian will be handling the new furniture projects that come in,and i am now back in 'semi retirement ' mode.  i'll still do some smallrepairs and projects for friends and family.  i tried this back in 2018 when i turned 71, but it was (obviously if you scroll through my blog posts since then), too soon to do that ...as recently as november of 23 it was still pretty busy here !  i have a lot to do still ... clean up some stuff in the shop,organize and inventory the 'left over wood'for kristian, peruse and edit two cellars, two atticsand a garage for stuff to get rid of ... and, i will definitely need to reread an article by anne patchett about 'stuff' ... over and out for now !!

another torah cabinet





ok ... out the door a couple of weeks ago ...another challenging project for sure!we made one of these for a holocaust torah for a synagogue in bennington vermont in 2017being that we could not visit the site on long island, the designrequired much back and forth confirming concepts and measurements ...  this is the second cabinet for a holocaust torah that we have made .and, we are now in the process of adding a bookcase to be installedunder the cabinet above ...click the photos to enlarge them ... torah dimension checkhere's kristian with the mdf mockup we made showing the theoretical finished cabinetwe got an eps file with the lettering from a designer there,and kristian cut it on the cnc and painted itthe cabinet, ready to go, with the hanging instructions ..the eagle has landed!hung and ready for the torah !the great neck cabinet and the bennington cabinet below the bennington cabinetwe are honored to help with the preservation and display of these historic pieces ... soon after the cabinet arrived, we were askedto design a bookcase cabinet to go underneath it ..fast forward to 6.24 ...homestretch on the bookcasewe offered two options for the bookcase ... the clients selected the longer option.we had a few questions ... or actually, a lot of questions ...and then there was the outlet for the lights ...although i had the theoretical location for the outlet, we all decided that it would be best to cut the box in on site ... it would have been a project to fix itif i got it in the wrong place ... above is the base with the levelers we needed in place.the cabinet, ready to go, and out the door on monday... it arrived in great neck on the 3rd of julyand will be installed sometime soon ... i admit to being a little anxious about it as the floor is not level,the wall is not perfectly plumb, there's the outlet,and the list of instructions i sent were all completely theoretical.i have faith in major tom, who sent me measurements andagreed to cut the outlet in on site ...i cross my fingers and await some installation photos ... 7/11 ...well, as the auctioneers say "all in, all done!"i am so happy that the installation went well .. thank you major tom! and everyone else who was involved in this project ..as they say, 'couldn't have done it without ya!' tonight i will probably not wake up at 4 am and wonder if everything is going to fit!
