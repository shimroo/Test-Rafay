dorandirect










										01.									
look for the dorandirect label
when you cut out the middle man, you get fresher product.
we order directly from our farms in south america, where product is packed in our branded dorandirect sleeves and boxes, and then shipped to you in the shortest possible time frame.





 











										02.									
eliminate the possibility of rotation in miami
we’ve optimized the distribution system making it faster and keeping it cold.
unlike other flowers that are flown into miami and held in refrigerated warehouses until sold, this product is packed and shipped just for you. flowers will come to you in our special dorandirect packaging as our way of assuring the freshest possible product available.





 











										03.									
the competitive edge
longer-lasting flowers mean happier customers.
when you're a doran client, we're able to ensure that your flowers spend the minimum amount of shipping time from the growers' fields to your door. in return, the life of the flower is enjoyed by your end-consumer, not wasted in a miami warehouse like so many other "direct" flowers available on the open market.
