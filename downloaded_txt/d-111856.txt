research fieldsgerman/european & jewish historygerman/european & jewish historymodern german history and the history of german-speaking jewry have been core research fields at the ghi since the institute’s founding in 1987. german migrations to north america, relations between germany and the united states, and the flight of german jews from nazi germany have been major research topics since the ghi’s early years. more recently, the ghi has given increased attention to the transnational and global dimensions of german, central european, and jewish history.read morehistory of the americas & transatlantic historyhistory of the americas & transatlantic historyfrom an initial focus on north american history and the history of the transatlantic relations, the ghi has broadened the scope of its core research agenda to encompass the americas as a whole. its long engagement with the histories of the united states, canada, and north american-european ties is the point of departure for its new initiatives in the history of the americas. ghi-supported projects are exploring the myriad entanglements linking the societies of north america, latin america, and the caribbean to each other and societies across the globe. the interconnections of the atlantic and pacific worlds are focal point of the research program of the ghi’s pacific regional office in berkeley.read moreglobal & transregional historyglobal & transregional historythe ghi’s engagement with global and transregional history is an outgrowth of its work in transatlantic history and its longstanding interest in comparative history, especially historical comparisons of the u.s. and germany. global and transregional history at the ghi are defined less by subject matter than by analytical perspective. ghi-supported research explores processes that transcend individual polities and entangle disparate states, regions, and continents. the ghi is particularly interested in historical comparison as a tool to illuminate trends and developments at the transregional and global levels.read morehistory of knowledgehistory of knowledgethe history of knowledge analyzes the production and circulation of knowledge, taking into consideration a broad spectrum of actors, practices, and social contexts. it seeks to understand the creation of knowledge orders and systems along with the power relationships upon which they rest. the development of the field has taken different paths in europe and north america. consequently, a central objective of the ghi’s program in the history of knowledge is to spur transatlantic exchange on research methodologies. the history of knowledge also serves as vehicle for collaboration across the ghi’s core research fields and other subfields of history. notably, the ghi’s pacific regional office in berkeley “migrant knowledge” initiative is supporting research at the intersection of migration history and the history of knowledge.read morehistory of mobilities & migrationhistory of mobilities & migrationthe ghi’s longstanding engagement with the migration of german-speakers to north america from the seventeenth century to the present is the foundation for the wider reaching program in migration history it launched in 2015. current ghi-supported projects look beyond the flows of european migrants across the atlantic and analyze migrant groups and receiving societies around the world. the research at the institute also places a focus on spatial mobility and its social impacts and asymmetries by bringing together projects on migration with colleagues working on different mobile groups, objects, information, or ideas. particular attention is given to forced migration and comparative research on the social and cultural integration of migrants. the roles of migrants as producers and transmitters of distinctive bodies of knowledge is the focus of the “migrant knowledge” initiative at the ghi’s pacific regional office. the collaborative project "german heritage in letters" draws on the tools of digital history to explore the ways german emigrants and their family and friends at home created transnational spaces of communication and knowledge circulation.read moredigital historydigital historythe ghi’s digital history program operates at the crossroads of multiple disciplines and professions. one overarching goal is to forge links between seemingly disparate communities and pursuits: digital historians and “book” historians; projects informed by public history concerns versus those motivated by research objectives; and research and academic teaching. in addition to its own digital history projects – german history in documents and images, german history intersections, and german heritage in letters – the ghi collaborates with partner institutions across europe and north america in exchange and networking initiatives to support the development of digital tools and methodologies for historical research.read more
