fahs welcome message:
fahs.org is a home for students of all years that went to frankfurt american high school in frankfurt, germany. we are brats. we all loved our school and continue to do so.  once an eagle, always an eagle. fahs über alles!
whether we were hippies, punks, jocks, stoners or the eagles that didn’t fit into cliches, we are all still members of the fahs family. we are connected by our collective experiences.
we do have a request for your stories about your time at frankfurt american high school.
your story can be funny, heartfelt, sports related, or a whatever story that is connected to our school. got one that you want to share? use the contact page to connect with us. we want to hear from you!
we have our first story from rheal desrochers ’54 and roberta “berdie” socks ’57, read it here.
