driveway installation: solid tips


september 28, 2021

according to statistics, roughly 90% of american households own or have access to a vehicle from the comforts of their homes. ownership of a car is the cherry on top of the american dream, and in all likely hood, you own one too!
but with such a large statistic of car ownership throughout the states, only 70% of us homes have concrete driveways installed. though the difference may not seem much, it’s only a 20% contrast after all. but converted to population, that’s millions of us car owners without driveways of their own!
having your own driveway comes with a lot of benefits. it increases your property value, de-clutters the streets, and makes driving safer overall. but not everyone is equipped with the skills to pave their own driveway. that’s why we have specialists!
having established the value of driveways, here are a few things to consider when hiring a driveway contractor!
collect contractor names
to kick things off, you’re first gonna’ need a list of driveway contracting companies. but with thousands of contractors out there, how would you know which ones are worth looking into?
a good way to go about this is by asking your friends, families, and/or neighbors. maybe you have a few people you know that have a driveway paved on their property. ring them up, ask for recommendations, and you should have a good list to start with.
do your research
have a look at your contractors’ websites and start browsing. have a look at their services, compare their prices, and see if you like what they offer. if you have any questions, check out their faq page and see if people are asking the same thing. base your choice on what kind of job you want to be done. this would take a little bit of research into driveways, but the end result is worth the extra time.
additionally, look for licenses, and qualifications. a contractor who knows their worth will proudly display these on their site. through this method, you should be able to narrow down your list quite a bit.
check their reviews
a company thrives on positive customer reviews.
companies will always be praising themselves on their website. advertising their forte is what they do. this is why you should always take their words with a grain of salt.
the best way to know whether or not a company is, indeed, competent at what they do is through customer testimonies and reviews. a trail of happy customers that received the driveway of their dreams will leave a good word, and companies will wear these like trophies. you can never fully trust what contractors say about themselves, but you can always trust what the customers say about them.

give them a call
congratulations! you’ve narrowed down your list significantly. to finalize your choice, give them a call or schedule an interview.
this is where you assess how professional a driveway contractor is. think of it like a job interview: you are the employer, and they are the employee prepare a list of questions and talking points. express your vision for your driveway, and how you want it made. pay attention to how they answer your questions and how much they communicate with you. interviews are a great way to strengthen your relationship with the contractor and create trust.
once you’re through with this step, then we guarantee that you’ll have that one contractor happy to help you pave your own driveway.





 


selecting the proper roofing material

every house, no matter how big or small, needs a strong and reliable roof to keep its household members safe. it protects us from the heat of the sun, the winds and rain of a storm, and even the heavy snow during the winter. this is why we must clean our roof and maintain it in a pristine condition to ensure our own safety.
today, there are many different types and designs of roofing available, and you might be wondering, “which roofing material is best for my roof?” before that, we must first consider the different criteria we should base upon when choosing, and that includes the following:
size of the rooflocation of your houseweather and climate in your areamaterials used for your house exterior wallsconstruction and maintenance cost
usually, a roofing company will ask you about the things listed above before they would recommend the best roofing material to suit your roof. however, you should also do your own research about the different types so that you’ll have a little background about the terminologies that your roofer will mention. here are 5 of the most common roofing materials used in residential homes:
asphalt shingles
this is the most common type of roofing material for residential homes. it consists of asphalt tiles or shingles that are heavy-duty and can withstand strong winds. construction and maintenance of this type of roofing is also pretty affordable, but these shingles need to be replaced every 20 years. these usually come in gray, but other roofing companies also offer these in other earth-tone colors. 
clay / concrete tiles
similar to asphalt shingles, clay and concrete tiles are also heavy-duty that can handle wind speeds of tornadoes and hurricanes. upfront cost and subsequent maintenance are also low, and this roofing material is best for warm or dry climates. however, these roofing can be heavy, so your house should include extra support to carry the weight of the roof.
metal roofing
metal roofing is best for draining away the rain and snow on your roof, and this roof is lightweight and easy to install. some roofers even install a metal roofing on top of an existing roof in order to increase its strength. however, this roofing can be noisy during windy weather or heavy rains, and may not survive a heavy hailstorm.
slate roofs
if you are looking for a roofing material that will last for several decades, then you should consider having a slate roofing. this type of roofing material is waterproof, so it wouldn’t form any molds or fungi as time goes by. however, installing slate roofs can be pretty expensive, so you should invest in a larger budget if you want this type of roofing for your home.

rubber slate roofing
rubber slate roofing is a slightly cheaper version of slate roofing materials, but it can also last for up to 100 years. although much more affordable, this material may not be as durable, and it can easily break when someone walks on the roof. moreover, not all roofers are trained to handle rubber slate roofing, so be sure to ask your roofing company first before considering this material.





 


tree removal: when its time to say goodbye

your yard looks beautiful with stately trees dotting the landscape. but when the trees become overgrown with dead and decaying branches, those same trees are a safety risk for your family. dead branches are a liability and safety hazard. during extreme weather and high winds, dead branches fall on houses and cars causing expensive repair bills. if you have trees that are dead or petrified, it is time to remove those trees from your property. dead or dying trees detract from the curb appeal of your home or business property. your yard should have beautiful green healthy trees instead of ugly old dead ones. by removing unsightly trees, your property value increases. regular maintenance that includes trimming and tree removal will keep your property safe and attractive.
timely maintenance of your trees will prolong their lifespan. after all, the goal is to keep the trees looking green and healthy for as long as possible. who doesn’t like the look of a beautiful green tree? they provide oxygen and beauty. they are great for hanging up a hammock or an old-fashioned tire swing. on a hot summer day, sitting in the shade of a tree and having a picnic is fun. but if your yard is full of ugly trees that drop branches, none of those fun activities can be enjoyed. when your trees start dropping branches, this is the time to think about calling a professional tree removal company. an arborist, or tree specialist, will review your trees and provide solutions for maintaining and keeping them healthy. the tree specialist will tell you which trees can be kept and which ones should be removed. 
leaning trees are more dangerous than trees that stand vertical. leaning indicates a condition of weakened roots. such a tree is in an unhealthy condition. if a tree is leaning more than fifteen percent from a vertical position, have the tree removed. with trees under power lines, the height of the tree should be less than twenty-five feet. trees that are too tall or overgrown with weak or decayed branches are a safety risk. when the trees are intertwined with utility wires, during storms this situation is unsafe. strong winds cause the branches to break bringing down power lines causing a fire and disruption of electric service. some rural and urban areas still have overhead utility and phone lines. during powerful wind storms, overgrown trees cause a lot of power outages. 
to avoid expensive emergency tree removal situations, be proactive and hire a professional tree removal service to assess your trees. before inclement weather strikes, remove dead trees. during strong winds, trees that lean or have weak branches will fall on a house or car. it is easier for a tree removal crew to cut trees when the weather is dry than during a storm. the safety of your family is of paramount importance. as a homeowner, the best decision to make is to remove dead trees from your yard to protect your family and property.

so you want to install a new fence on your property but you don’t know where to start. this might be a sign that you should consider hiring a pro. now if you are a highly skilled diy (do-it-yourself) expert, and sure that you can handle a large fence installation project, then, go for it. however, if you are not up to the task, even a small fence project can turn into a big hassle. are you skilled with tools and doing a lot of physical work involved with this type of project? if the answer is no, it’s time to call a professional fence installer. building a fence is not about digging a few post holes and sticking in some posts. you need to know about using tools, fence materials, setting posts, measurements, fence height restrictions, property lot lines, permits, hoa rules, and more information. if such a large task is mind-boggling to you, then, hire a professional fence installation company to build your new fence. yes, there will still be decisions and money involved. but in the end, you will have a finished fence that will last a long time. 
to aid in making decisions, ask yourself a lot of questions. what is a stick-built fence and do i want one? should i use pre-fabricated panels? will i need a permit? what should be the height of my fence? what are the rules and regulations involved? do i need permission from my hoa? how do i hire helpers? the list of questions goes on and on. here’s where you need to ask yourself, am i up to the task of making decisions without knowledgeable guidance? if the answer is no, then, hire a professional fence installer. fence installation companies have all of the necessary skills, equipment, and people needed to complete the job. they can provide guidance and advice as you ask questions and make decisions. there are advantages to hiring a pro to install your fence like no physical labor on your part, no people to hire, and no need for equipment or tools. best of all, you will have peace of mind and a finished fence backed by a warranty. in the end, you will save money.

many people who install fences as diy projects, in the long run, end up spending more money. they lack the skills and knowledge needed to complete the fence. many times they quit before the fence is completed wasting their time and money.  when you install your fence as a diy project, you won’t have any warranty. hiring a fence installation company outweighs any of the added costs involved in the project. in other words, if you know that you are not up to the task of installing a new fence, hire a pro. once the fence is done, you will be glad that you made the right decision to hire a fence installation pro instead of doing an expensive diy fence project and ending up without a fence installed.

wondering what to take on your next road trip that will work for comfort and vehicle emergencies? before you start your next adventure, take your automobile in for a checkup on the engine and tires. if you know that your vehicle is roadworthy, you will enjoy a stress-free vacation. make a list of items to pack for a breakdown emergency or a flat tire. check with your automobile insurance company to ensure that you have roadside assistance coverage. some insurance companies offer it for free or for a reasonable price. check the free apps on your mobile phone. think about a program like onstar or something like it. purchase a new road atlas. when you can’t obtain a good signal for your mobile phone, an atlas will come in handy.
at many big-box retail stores, you can find an atlas or a roadmap. keep your load light and don’t overpack. make sure that you have your driver’s license in your possession. ensure that the car registration and proof of insurance are tucked within the vehicle’s glovebox. check the quality of your tires, the tire pressure, the car lights, emergency flashers, wipers, and mirrors. fill up the necessary fluids to keep your car in tip-top condition. in other words, make sure your car is in good working order before you “hit the road”. 
towing st. louis
here is a handy list of items to use for your road trip. take a first aid kit, flashlights, bottled water, travel mugs, toilet paper, and paper towel. other items to take along on your trip should include, a tire iron, jack, tire gauge, jumper cables, maps, pen, pencil, paper, hand sanitizer, bug spray, a few towels, sunglasses, spare cash, and change for toll roads. cash works when plastic (money) cards don’t work. if you are traveling to a cold climate, take along a winter coat, a snow shovel, umbrella, raingear, an ice scraper, and a squeegee for clean windows. reiterating, cold weather trips require heavy clothing and a blanket which are necessities. prescription medicine and over-the-counter remedies are must-have items for headaches and stomach aches.
don’t forget the hats, gloves, mittens, socks, and waterproof boots. if your trip heads to the southern part of the usa to the beach for sun and fun. bring the suntan lotion, flip flops, sunglasses, and a few beach towels and water toys. take the usb cords, phone chargers, a hands-free kit for your mobile phone, portable wi-fi to stay connected, sing-along music, and some travel games to keep the kiddies entertained. if your family likes to read, take along a kindle device, a few books, clip lights, and extra batteries. it might be a good idea to bring along a few travel pillows, and a couple of uv window shades to block out the sun. raisins work well for a quick energy snack and crackers are good for an upset stomach. take along a big bottle of ginger-ale and extra cups. avoid stress, stay alert, well-rested, and enjoy your road trip.
