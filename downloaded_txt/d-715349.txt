7 tips for planning the perfect family summer campsummer campsevery summer is a great opportunity for families to head out on a fulfilling road trip that will take them away from the hustle and bustle of city life. follow these guidelines when planning your next family summer camp.
1.      plan camping accommodation in advance

the best camping hotspots will be hard to get without a reservation. summer campsites are normally fully booked during the holiday season. make sure to book all your stays months in advance to avoid disappointment.
2.      vehicle service and road safety

before you go on a camping trip, ensure that your vehicle is serviced and ready for the road. always have a spare tire and the necessary tools in the car to change the tire in the event of an emergency. have a first-aid kit ready for the journey and the camping trip.
3.      only pack the necessary

don’t overload the vehicle with a month’s worth of clothes and toiletries. only pack the bare minimum for your stay at the campground. don’t pack unnecessary electronics or things you won’t need while you are out enjoying nature.
4.      travel breaks and random stops

don’t travel too long without making a stop at an attractive roadside shop. switch driving responsibilities with your partner to make sure that the person driving remains well-rested and focused on the road.
5.      be mindful of your budget

it sounds like a chore to be worried about the budget all the time if you are on holiday. manage your spending by limiting you and your family to one or two main activities per day. some amenities like pools and waterslides may be included in the camping accommodation.
6.      include everyone in activities

if you are having fun with the family, make sure no one is left out of the daily activities. engage in activities that are fun for the whole family, where everyone can play a role. if it’s not possible to include everyone, make sure to include them in another activity at some point.
7.      don’t leave anything behind

always make sure to leave nothing behind at the campsite when it’s time to leave. let everyone walk around the camping area to take one last look at the site before leaving for home.
everyone can spend some quality time on a camping trip. use these 7 tips when planning a summer camp this holiday season. follow the uk summer camps and courses directory for more information. [...]
