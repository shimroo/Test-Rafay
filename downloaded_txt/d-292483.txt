we are a multidisciplinary department with the size and breadth to address today’s complex scientific issues, while retaining the student-centered focus, an sdsu plant science hallmark. all of our programs feature a carefully designed balance of theoretical principles and hands-on experience to produce a well-rounded graduate who is prepared for the 21st century workplace. as a result, our graduates are in high demand and frequently have jobs before graduation.

our programs














agronomy


this program provides students with an integrated understanding of crop development and management, entomology, natural resource management, plant breeding, plant pathology, weed science, seed technologies, soils and crop production systems with precision agriculture integrated into many areas.



agronomy (b.s.)
















horticulture


this major prepares students for careers in horticulture education, management and marketing. the major focuses on small-scale food production strategies including local food systems, food production in controlled environments and tree care and urban forest management.



horticulture (b.s.)
















precision agriculture


the precision agriculture major prepares students for careers that bridge the gaps between agronomy, agriculture machinery management and data sciences caused by the rapid evolution of high-speed sensor technology.



precision agriculture (b.s.)
















plant science



graduate training includes classroom instruction, teaching experience and meaningful experiences in laboratory, greenhouse and/or field research techniques. sdsu also offers two specializations:

biological sciences (ph.d.) - plant molecular biology specialization
biological sciences (ph.d.) - plant science specialization

            research and hands-on experience
       
if your interests are in the production of specialty crops, local food production or ornamentals, our local foods education center will provide you with hands-on experience in sustainable food production. it is based on a foundation of student learning, ecosystem sustainability and consumer access to a safe and stable food supply.




















hands-on experience



local foods education center


the local foods education center is a novel approach to addressing food security in south dakota. the outdoor classroom is over an acre in size and is fully dedicated to student and public teaching. it emphasizes hands-on field experience, with small-scale food production and distribution practices, ecosystem sustainability and consumer access to a safe and stable food supply.

research



extension activities and research


agronomy, horticulture and plant science is also proud of a strong tradition of research and extension. our research has led to increased agricultural productivity, a better understanding of plant diseases and new plant varieties. our extension activities have translated research advances into useful public knowledge. we continue to develop and disseminate knowledge on topics as varied as the impacts of tillage on soil carbon levels, the genomic basis of grape quality, to crop seeding rates for optimized yields.
