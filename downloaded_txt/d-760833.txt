	 famous men
	 
    


one rule for us, one rule for them.that’s how we cope with famous men.at age thirteen, they drew a sceneof venice with its grand canal.by fifteen, they had met the queen,had fucked mae west and gore vidal.at twenty one they’re having funwith alice toklas on the seine,then off they go to mexico.they hopped the albuquerque train.by twenty two they owned a zooand sailed beam-ends to borneo,sat in with miles on kind of blue,composed an oratorio.at twenty four, they went and sawthe hindenburg come crashing down,then fought the spanish civil war;knew orwell, hemingway and pound.at twenty eight, they found a mate.they took a princess for a wife.with two plays opening at the gatethey settled in to dublin life.at thirty four, another war!they’re on the beaches on d-day.they’re liberating sobiborand flying on enola gay.they joined the nascent oss,assassinated diplomats,beat commies at a game of chesson berlin alexanderplatz.at thirty six, they got a fixwith burroughs at the beat hotel,sold berber jewels to hippy foolsat maxims with coco chaneland in jamaica, took the sun,a novelist at forty one,a chocolatier by forty three;they’re in the car with kennedy.then christmas nineteen sixty three,they turn their hand to poetry.it’s simple, fun and worldly wiseand wins the fucking nobel prizeand then begin the salad days,the soaking up of endless praise,the selling-out for millions,the literary brilliance…and now i turn to my own life -a dog, three children and a wife.it all seems petty, routine, small.as though i sleepwalked through it all.while others travelled wild highways,i settled for mere holidays.they seemed to live a hundred lives -ten children, half a dozen wives.they met with passion each sunrisewhile every dawn i compromise.so much time i feel i wasted.so much spice i never tasted.all the chances i have missed.my whole life’s on my bucket list.i try to think i’m happy nowand justify myself somehow;those other men had different toolsand played their game by different rules.they had more fun. they did more stuffbut i suppose i’ve done enough.that’s how we cope with famous men.one rule for us, one rule for them.

	 a gift from the sun
	 
    


your father taught you how to change a tyreand how to fall and climb back to your feet.the spark he breathed on grew into a fire.i held it for an instant and the heatrewarmed the frozen sun inside of me;a star which spins alone in empty space,that tiny unseen singularity:the lover’s heart beneath a father’s face.now gravity is pulling us apartand draws us back towards our hearths and homes.your fire flies to warm another heartwhile i shall supernova on my ownfor nova always stands for what is newand i am old and old dreams don’t come true.

	 the story
	 
    


there’s a story i have to tell.in galleries we stand aloneto watch the angels holding hands.we finance more machine gun nests,proclaim ourselves the self-made man.with golden hearts in burning fields we talk about the gorgeous flame.when alleycats play cards with mice,we all pretend we’d do the same.in blinding light toward the sun,we search for heaven one by oneas though our life’s a race to winand fellowship’s a mortal sinas every leaf shakes loose its treeand every lonely honeybeelooks happier than you or mebut none of that is true. you see,there’s a story i have to tell.your toaster says you are alone.your money says you are alone.your trainers say you are alonebut there’s a story i have to tell:that every heart you’ve ever knownis just like yours. you’re not aloneand every hearth and every homeis somewhere you can call your own.so let’s hold hands and try once moreto find the rose above the door.as time unravels, we’ll ignorethe smiles of those who won’t exploreor come together; who cannot seethat i am you and you are me.

	 the dream
	 
    


i held you in my dream last night -a dream of overwhelming bliss.two lovers in the fading light,i stole your heart. you stole a kiss.a dream of overwhelming blissthat made me sorry when i woke.you stole my heart. i stole a kissthen watched you fade and my heart broke.that made me sorry when i wokeand so i chased you back to sleepbut watched you fade and my heart broke.i’d held you tight and kissed you deepand so i chased you back to sleepand found you there at midnight’s stroke.i held you tight and kissed you deepand found you with me when i woke.i found you there at midnight’s stroke.i’d held you in my dream last nightthen found you with me when i woke,two lovers in the fading light.

	 devil’s night
	 
    


tonight the devil’s here and god is small -a night for sinners who have never sinnedand out there in the dark i hear your call -the welcome gift of words placed in the wind.you sigh another spell, oh sorceresswhose magic echoes somewhere in the night,and wear your darkness as an evening dress -it falls in waves to keep you out of sight.yet from your throne of skulls and ragged furtonight i hear you whispering for meto cast my spell, to be your whispererof things the lighted world must never see.i sing this song to darkness and i praythis devil’s night shall never yield to day.

	 the mummy
	 
    


forget for once the stupid mummy’s curse,that lame-brain bane of egyptology,for mummies have to deal with something worse:our ignorance of their chronology.i know you know in abstract that egyptwas long ago and went on for a whilebut did you know that tutankhamun’s cryptgot covered up by flooding from the nilea thousand years before the romans came?or that the sphinx was more removed in timefrom cleopatra’s ptolemaic reignthan cleo is from me writing this rhyme?i’m hoping that these fourteen lines of versemight go some way to lift the mummy’s curse.

	 the fox
	 
    


the snow drifts down like gently falling starsas cars illuminate a cardboard box.i know this town will leave its mental scarsbut scars become this sleeping urban fox.his dream brings him an image of a girl,a swirl of words surrounding her in streams;extreme emotions gradually unfurland curl around them both in both their dreams.for somewhere in the night you’re sleeping tooand you are dreaming of the urban fox.you somehow need the fox to dream of youthose nights you want to curl up in his box.when snow is falling from the sky aboveyou know this sly old fox will dream of love.

	 white lunar
	 
    


the more i see of you the more i missthe hand i cannot hold, the more i seethat we shall never lean in for a kiss;the more i see how much you’re missing me.i am that lesser birdwho paints in blots and clots,who paints the blood-soaked moonupon your door.you break into my poetry againdecode a line of sanguine semaphore.“the more i see of you the more i miss”then briefly, softly, sadly speak my name.

	 quatrains
	 
    


her portrait forged in fog and smoke -a dancer dancing just for me.the gentle taps of her pen strokeecho metronomically.the withered leaf, the nightly pain -november brings her some relief.she listens and transcribes the rain -her symphony, her masterpiece.and in my hand i find a notewhich she has written long ago:“don’t love me but don’t love me not.don’t hold on but don’t let go.”

	 grace
	 
    


those lunatics who stare into the sunor shriek at pigeons in the local parkare childhood friends who we have left behindwhen all the games they played stopped being fun.we know they wander somewhere in the darkbut keep them out of sight and out of mind.we eye them cautiously when passing by,say ‘there but for the grace of god go i’as though god chose us as his favoured sonand opted for his other son to die.we notice as the ambulances comeand yet we never stop to wonder whywe didn’t help or what we might have doneinstead of looking down and walking by.

	 love affair
	 
    


i write these lines as if in prayer -on bended knee, i choose a pairof rhymes i think will be okayand suitable for smart wordplay.this endless game of solitaireis one i play with savoir-faireand, though i see you’ve ceased to carewhat unloved online poets say,i write these lines.i’ll call this rondeau ‘love affair’and post it here without fanfare.it’s not a prayer and yet i prayyou’ll notice your sad protégéeand understand that in despairi write these lines.

	 the jester
	 
    


the words retreat into a distant placeand i can’t find a single thing to say.all poets must eventually facethe silence of a thoughtless, wordless day.the bull is sleeping, quiet in his shed.the peevish lover shrugs and folds his hand.the great white shark stopped swimming and is dead.my castles have all crumbled into sand.alone, the jester howls his madcap songfor he’s the part of me that will not sleep;that carries on as though there’s nothing wrong,blows raspberries at me when i want to weep.i know he is the part of me that’s bestand yet today i wish he’d let me rest.

	 the dreamer
	 
    


in poetry we hide our dreamsso nothing’s ever what it seemsand though it feels this meter’s tight,between these iambs, there’s a fight -two lovers sing their sunken themes,his songs are whispers, hers are screams;she shakes him but he still daydreamsof endless lovebirds taking flightin poetry.she has her sensible routines,grows bored of his romantic schemesand yet, too often, in the night,she dreams of fictions they could write,her bedroom lit up with moonbeamsand poetry.

	 ophelia
	 
    


ophelia, your burning heartgives off more light than heatbut even though we are apart,i hear its mad drumbeat.ophelia, i do not knowwhich of us is insane.you beat me up with great gustoyet know i love the pain.ophelia, i think you’re great.you handed me a matchand told me to self-immolateso you could hide and watch.ophelia, my burning lovegives off more heat than light.i hope that it is just enoughfor you to think i’m bright.ophelia, you will not drownif you come swim with me.instead, together, we’ll sink downin love and poetry.

	 the contents of this sonnet
	 
    


it’s fourteen lines, ten syllables in each.it has its turn, obeys those ancient rulesreluctant boys don’t listen to in schoolsbut there are many things you cannot teach -the meanings hidden deep beneath the words,the things which just the two of us can see,the secret story told of you and me.the words themselves are for the fucking birdswho only see the beads and not the thread;who hear the meter, not the beating heart.they only understand what can be readand even if they tore these words apartthey would not ever see what goes unsaid:you’re always at the centre of my art.

	 to bang a nail
	 
    


i see a nail, i bang it in.i contemplate the daily news.a steady hand, a jutted chin,and when i listen to the blues,i only hear a strummed guitarand some old black guy wailing.i drive a boring family car.how i love to bang a nail in!but now i’ve read some poetry,deep water is disturbed somewhere -i watch the wind dance in a treeand find i’m thinking of your hairand how it dances in the breeze.my steady hand begins to shake -why should i stop to look at trees?why does the blues make my heart break?and in a rose i see your face,each passing cloud’s a ship in sail.i find i’m staring into space.ah, who has time to bang a nail?for now i find i’m writing too -at least one poem every day.ignoring what i ought to do,reality drifts far away.it gradually occurs to me,as all these clouds go sailing by,i’ve lost my mind to poetryand when i hear the blues, i cry.perhaps this is the poets’ curse?a fragile mind of grief and woewhich feeds on chaos for its verse.i think of plath or lowell or poewhose dismal stories are so sad.what spectres were they fighting?did writing poems drive them mador does madness drive the writing?

	 the birds
	 
    


i’ve been in love too longwith a scoop of empty airto hear a voice that isn’t theresing tumultuous birdsong.a bird poised at the edge of a woodmade everything a toy.she slit her own throat, singing,to beguile a passing boy.he bent to dip a featherin a drop of her spilled bloodbut when he came to write of herthe words flowed out as mud.i have been swallowed by my own heart,sober and fever-less at lastand everywhereconfused crows on windowsillscontemplate tapping.

	 king of shadows
	 
    


he spoke to me down where the wild thyme grows:‘good fellow, do my bidding in the night.return before the randy rooster crowsat the dismal dullness of midsummer’s light’.so down i danced and heard a silly songsung by an actor who seemed asinine(perhaps i have remembered this all wrongbut he looked to me just like old kevin kline).then as i crept down past the eglantinei spied a sight that stilled my rowdy heart:a fairy on a bank of celandinewith something puckish troubling her heart.i know that our two hearts should never rhymethough we both know they syncopate in time.

	 elephant
	 
    


i choose the wine -a glass of sweat between uslike diana’s mirror,her sunken wrecksthe shoes kicked off by giantsin stupid violent history.you wear the tablecloth -‘friends romans countrymen’and my ss officer, heels tutting,salutes the pepper pot.my smile is carried at the speed of light.you giggle at the speed of sound.after the salad and tsunami,siamese twins joined at their junktotter across a car park,pirouetting around kisses,punching puddles,hunting tigers with an elephant gun.in the barnyard of the night,beneath a gibbous moon,we become drunk pigletsbetween each other’s legs.a conch mouth roughness glowssmooth with a single breath.see how that fingertip reddens -all blood where it belongs.inhaling distaff wisdomat the true edge of the world,two thieves nail themselves to the same cross,broken backed and screaming.in a pinprick of silence,you place your exquisite handinto the willing glove of my throat,cradle the raw egg of my heart -that spoonful of not very muchand squeeze.

the empty streets run round me like a cursei pinch my nose and hopscotch through the deadto find a wall graffitied with some verse,a still-wet message scratched in cherry redwhich fades to brown as it begins to dry.“i love you but i hate love and that’s whyi hate you and i hope you fucking die”.above the words a scribbled evil eyestares down at me as i begin to smilethe broadest grin this empty world has known.despite the flood of vitriol and bilethe message tells me i am not alone.i dance off down the hollow, blood-soaked street,day-dreaming of the poet i could meet.

she settles into her depressionachieves her perfect form in flat still camouflagethe dim farmer cannot knowhow she surveys his laboursbehind beaded spider websthe fox and the hawk care notthat she has taken the earthas her lover. she pushes againsthis silence, his intransigence,feels cold strength spreading to the tips of her scarred earsthe sun is lost in a barley podbut spring will come againwith its frenzy and its terrorin the grip of her loins’ madnessshe will take her place in the windto box and bite their necksthe farmer barks somethingin his tongue and she feels rightto run, springs out across the field,quicksilver in the jelly of his eyesinews packed with surviving fire.she has unanswerable questionsone night she dreamed she was an owl.another night, she swam in warm seas.another still, she grew old and died.she lives by phases of the moon.she holds what she has close.everything else cannot ever matter.

maybe in the dull heat after sweetnessyour body steams, your flank cools and so muchpasses between us with every touchthat we need not speak. on the floor your dressplays murder victim, your forlorn knickersare the white flag announcing armistice;my shirt is fred astaire. you plant a kissin the palm of my hand. something flickersand the moon appears outside the bedroomdoor, filling the house, exerting its vast,crazed gravity on both of us. aboveus now, the air is filling with perfume.i feel the present, future and the pastevaporate, condensing into love.

	 lost and found
	 
    


we lose ourselves in silly dreamsand hatch far-fetched romantic schemes.we love to love what we can’t get -ask romeo, ask juliet,those tragically misguided teenswho met by night beneath moonbeams,explorers out at love’s extremes -he montague, she capulet,both starcrossed, both in love, and yetthey taught us all what true love means:we lose ourselves.as poets, we both love these themesbut love is never what it seemsfor, as we sing our mad duet,we lose ourselves.

in the beginning, we had four legs,four arms, four eyes, two hearts, two heads.we men were children of the sun.we’d fight and shout and hunt and run.you women were children of the earth,baking bread and giving birth,presumably.on mount olympus, zeus got jealousand some might argue over-zealousfor over time he had grown sourcontemplating human power.would we, could we fight the gods?zeus didn’t much like the odds,presumablybecause he called, “fee fi fo fum!ready or not, dudes, here i come!”and before we had the chance to laugh,he split all humans neatly in half!now we’re half as big, with half the strengthand roughly half the width and length,presumably.so now we all feel incompletewith just one heart, two hands, two feet,and spend our lives scouring the earthfor our long-lost other halfand though our partners may be greatthey’re not our actual soulmate,presumably.in fact, we could change our partner nightlyand it would still be statistically unlikelythat we’d locate our special friendso we all settle in the endfor whoever’s lips we’re kissingbut we all sense there’s something missing,presumably?i was content to settle toountil, sweet lady, i found you;my mirrored self, the rest of me,the whole root system of my tree,the ghostly double of my soul.come lie with me and we’ll feel whole!presumably.

‘we have invented happiness’ and blinks.the last man watches nature from his couch,forgets that he’s in fact the missing link.he rises up, does the bethlehem slouch,grazes the butt-ends of his days and wayshunting for what’s left of self-control.all evolution stopped with this malaise;when hominids discovered alcohol.if he could, would he live his life again,promise all the same dull resolutions?that question’s always dragging on his brain.no answers, no acceptance, no solutions.abysses do not gaze or answer backand god’s a hopeless dipsomaniac.

	 love story
	 
    


hold sadly under the palm of my handa moment longer -let’s each cast anotherseventy feet of spellto stay in love. thank mefor our unlipped kiss,for letting my shadowfall across you;this snapped daffodili fetched from your gardenyou can place in your own mouth.keep your sleeping flesh in hunger -your dugong’s dream of perspiration. i might unbutton that dream today,anoint you, pour gasolineinto your dry throat,seed wild flowers between your lipsand loosened breath.hold nothing else with your dominant hand.let a reptile climb across your belly.i could peel this planet earth for you,push my thumb between its segments,rebuild you out of my ribsand the cloying, fattened air.all i ask is everything you have left,to lie in unwatered darknesswaiting for my wasted breath -to shake your dull body each timeto the cry of my name.in between events,i have fastened a silver chainaround your two thumbs.love me and i’ll lead you backto where you started.

	 the story of the human race so far
	 
    


one night a little pip fell on the groundand, luckily, there were no birds around.a breath of wind picked up a maple leafand dropped it with the little pip beneath.that night the pip dreamed she was giving birthand woke to find she’d sunk into the earthand from the clamshell of her little coatthere had appeared a fragile snow-white root.she sat and wondered what the root could benot guessing she might one day be a tree,not knowing she had found the perfect placeas her planet tumbled soundlessly through space.

a ship that’s accidentally run agroundmight day-dream of the previous high tide.a fish that’s beached itself and slowly drownedlies lifeless at the sun-baked waterside.these poems are the dreadful rasping soundi’m making as i slowly get tongue-tied.a tank abandoned on the battlegroundwill rust if it remains unoccupied.i try to be your faithful palace houndbut all the fight in me has slowly died.my poetry has never been profound.i know my protestations are cock-eyedbut i’m nothing much when you are not aroundand you are otherwise preoccupied.

	 the river
	 
    


the river carves its path across the land.it rushes by the ghosts who haunt its banks;two lovesick souls who dimly comprehend that if they touch the water they will sinkand so each day these tragic phantoms standto watch each other on the farther shore;a fascination that shall never endfor all the things they cannot ever share.instead they sing in voices soft and sweetsuch love songs as the river never heard.in melodies these lovers truly meet;they hide a kiss in every rhyming word.perhaps one day our river meets the seabut until then, my darling, sing to me.

the fire churns but i don’t put it out.i do not even step back from the flame.at some point this will hurt, i have no doubt,but when it does, i’ll have myself to blame.you tut and tell me you don’t feel the samewildness, the hopeless wildness that grips meand yet you stick around to play our game.meanwhile the flames grow exponentially.composing your exquisite poetry,not noticing your skirt has caught on fire,you casually enjoy our reparteedespite the tongues that lick up ever higher.come closer, lover, hold my hand and burn.perhaps we’ve both still got a lot to learn.

so much depends on poetry.it’s how we learn to love, you see,it’s where we first interrogateour feelings, how we navigatean often harsh reality -on formal forms, on verse that’s free,on dactyl, iamb and spondee,on how we choose to punctuateso much depends.in this world of uncertaintywhere people mostly disagreeexcept about the things they hate,where heaney’s lost and bieber’s great,on how we value poetryso much depends…

	 where i find you
	 
    


in the full stops of a stolen library bookin the ballet of a bloody boxing matchin the fish that wriggled off my careless hookin the pistol with a broken safety catch.in the tombstone names of endless nameless deadin the small hours when i’m feeling all alonein my heart and in my balls and in my headin the unknown caller on my ringing phonein each flower whose real name i do not knowin the joggers who run past before i wakein the owl, the buzzard, dove and goose and crowin the signpost on the path i do not take.in the deep sea where the haunted dead residein the eyes of lost boys sleeping in the snowin the silence left behind when love has diedin the places where i know i’ll never go.you’re hiding just behind each leafless treeyou’re shadowed at the back of every caveyou’re the hidden hand that writes my poetry,the moon which galvanises every wave.you’re the pulsing, primal singularitythat’s revealed a whole new universe to me.i’m not asking you to love me or to care.i just wanted you to know you’re everywhere.

on the black beach you and ileave doodled footprintsto be lifted by the sea.our bodies understandthe hurricane of whispered witchcraftthe cadence of attractionthe dark salt tasteat the heart of a candied day.we do not hold each otherbut we can each holdtwo cupped hands of waterto sip and say i love you -we can clasp our coin of the tornadoin immaculate burning calmand dream of the oceanlike sightless fishswimming weightlessin formaldehyde.

the drowsy day is at its height.the river flows beyond our feet.with bellies to the sulky sun,our hot hands meet and intertwine.we have loved inside the grass,ate zebra at a grand hotel -we challenged god to strike us downand heard the randy bugger laugh.the river flows out of your eyes.we fold the drowsy day away,reclothe ourselves in silly wordsand stroll back sadly to the carwhile on that bank of celandinetwo fresh-pressed angels slowly fadeand with them goes what’s good in us -the dream we had, the love we made.i feel your planted seed in mewarmed and nourished by the sun.ignition fills the car with rock -we drive and watch the river run.

	 ejaculation
	 
    


my fountain pen is flowing once againand all that’s good in me is spilling out.my hand moves and that works to calm my brainbut will it be a whisper or a shout?and out there in the darkness do you waitto taste each dainty drop of what i write?do you write yourself until you must abate?do you dream about a hot nib every night?will what i write tonight be seminal?will this sonnet penetrate you to your core?will it trigger something neurochemicaland leave you lying gasping on the floor?or will you be more sensible perhapsand volta long before my dull climax?

	 appropriation art #003: lines lifted from other sources
	 
    


dear friend, i sense a darkness settles in.i want you to reach out, to take my hand.you stare, nod, pretend to understand;your eyes dart anxious as a robin.though darkness dwells to keep you from the light,i clasp this moment as though it were a bird.till darkness claims the timbre of my word,this vacant folly beats its wings tonight,my skull a boneyard destitute of dreams;yet what is dream if not a sleeping state?a tangible theme in your quest to create?i sink at dawn in vague subconscious streamsawash with everything we’ve left unsaid,this sonnet cutting crosswinds in my head.

i sail my paltry craft across the seato search for footprints on the morning sand,to faithfully obey her faint command -her siren call a message left for me.my passion’s fuelled by fading vapour trails,my rhythm’s measured by a quiet heartyet from the doldrums suddenly i start -a single breath is billowing my sails.a single breath upon a tiny sparkmay burn a mighty forest to the groundand so i sit and watch the flames spellbound -my meagre craft burns till the fire grows dark.then, from the ash, a poem flourishes.i realise her burning nourishes.

	 the mouse
	 
    


it’s okay for the flag you waveto make no senseor for the universe to stopfor the twitched whiskersof a mouse. it’s okay to write your love lettersin water with an idle finger.it’s okay to draw a blank.sometimes we wish we were robotsor mozartor the great wall of china.of course we dobut late at nightour bodies are so narrowthat we must not ever be loved.where is the universe thenas the timbers moan andour windows fill with rain?where is that childwho could lift us so highin our own strong hands?in the day, our bodiescollect iron ore fromsulphurous depths.we drink the boiling oceaneat handfuls of the sky.we are eleanor rigby and dick turpin,separately huntingthe same bengal man-eater.it’s okay.it’s okaysometimes for a clever mouse to turnto the swollen, howling skyand say‘sometimes it’s okay to stop’.we all need more than we have when it comes to love.

	 headless chicken
	 
    


the following is rather gorybut i think you’ll enjoy the storyof lloyd p. olson and his bird;the strangest tale you’ve ever heard.when lloyd cut off a rooster’s head,he noticed it was not quite dead:the chicken jumped and flapped and danced.old lloyd applauded, quite entranced.his bird had risen quite christlikebut lloyd just named the chicken mike.the next day mike was still alive.the year was 1945and colorado farmer lloydknew what he had and so he toyedwith dreams of local sideshow fameand so gave up the poultry gameand lloyd and mike took to the roadand quickly found the money flowedwherever freaks and geeks sideshowed.lloyd’s rooster was the motherlode!lloyd’s wife clara joined the teamand helped with mike’s daily regimeof droppered water, liquid foodand getting rich and being shrewd.they had to keep their fowl aliveif their careers were to survive.knowing mike was their paycheck,they suckered mucus from his neckwith a sterilised syringeand though that image makes you cringe,i wonder just what you might doas moolah started to accruewith all the sideshow ballyhoo.you’d baste that rooster mucus too.for eighteen months from state to state,with their decapitated mate,lloyd and clara lived like kingsuntil, in saratoga springs,awaking in their hotel roomthey found mike’s neck all full of spume.lloyd freaked but clara freaked out more!lloyd searched their bags. he searched the floorbut only found they’d come a cropper.they’d lost their mucus-sucking dropper!clara watched their bird conk outand, panicked, waved her arms about,truly gutted, truly stricken,flapping like a headless chickenand so the miracle met its end.poor lloyd p olsen lost his friendas mike went up to chicken heaven.the year was 1947but headless mike is not forgotten.no, though his fame was misbegotten,it endures still until this day:in colorado, every maya festival is held for mikewhere people, young and old alike,celebrate their prized halfwit.i recommend you google it.this poem is a formless mess.it’s lousy and pure silliness.that’s plain enough for all to seebut hopefully you might agreeit may not glitter but it’s gold:the greatest headless chicken story ever told.

i stretch my hands - what will i have of younow sweet november races to its end;this month of holes that i keep falling through,unable to reach out to you, my friend.for now i know the silence loss can bring,how empty days will fill with nothing much;how, brokenly, i lift myself to singand feel the press of words i dare not touch.then yesterday i heard an old songbirdwhose chicks had lived and died or fledged and flown.she sang the sweetest song i ever heard;a song which told me i was not alone.my love, for now, let’s stop our sorrowing.let’s find a branch to lift our beaks and sing.

on the cave’s envelopeyour hand is pressed;sent on its mission into mineyour shy woad stara perennial gentian withfingertips of red ochre.a joke that no-one laughs atblown through hollow bone,a shape that only i can see.side by side, apart they lie;to be covered, lost,brushed and excavatedsome day a soul may seetwo hand prints almost touching,tell a story that wenever dared to live.

the house sat quiet.feeling flat but inspired,my mouse mat conspired;he had fiendish plansto eat one of my hands.at easter he struck!the beast started to suck!he feasted, the schmuck!he ate my right fistright up to the wrist.thank god my house catpounced on the mouse mat,trounced it in combat!an unconventional endfor my two-dimensional friend.

“my soul is split in pieces”, she said,overturning our unfinished game of chess.“you could kill me with a shoutat the water’s edge. you couldkill me with a clematis flower.it is called the queen of climbers”.her hands rested on well-toned thighs.“it’s thunderstorm weather”,she said absently.i told her i loved her.“love is an occult powerthat should be exercised responsibly.you wield it like a billyclub”.we drifted noiselessly just then,two corks on the ocean,each in our own scoopof sunlight.“perhaps we’ll meet again”,i called.“let’s meet at the horizon”.and so, with the winds gatheringand miles of dark waterbeneath my feet,full of herand full of the occult magicof thunderstorms and love,i began to swimand i began to sing.
