women veterans resilient during covid-19 pandemic
research brief: veterans' labor market experiences during covid-19

a university of utah study reveals that women veterans maintained employment more effectively than veteran men during the pandemic, contrary to broader workforce trends. economists sarah small and eunice han found that veteran women experienced greater job stability, potentially due to adaptability gained through military service.

the research provides insights into veterans' unique labor market characteristics, highlighting their resilience during economic disruption.

the faces of economics







dave blatter
the economics department played a huge role in my undergraduate education that informs the work and research i do today. it gave me a critical understanding of economics as a field and a strong foundation in econometrics and quantitative analysis.







tao yu
urop provided me the very first research experience and give me the opportunity to have a close connection with professors. professor peter philips at the economics department, especially encouraged me to think critically and gave me a lot of great life advice.







elird haxhiu
i learned a great deal from my time at utah, especially the economics and mathematics departments. the professors engaged me in critical thinking and took time to discuss ideas beyond the coursework.
