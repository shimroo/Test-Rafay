during our shows in the usa and latin america at the end of last year we started playing a cover version of suzi sabotage's song nazi goths fuck off, which people really loved. so when cop international asked us if we would consider releasing it as a single to protest the rise of the fascist right in europe, particularly the afd in germany, and also to protest the right-wing takeover currently happening in the usa, we had to say yes!so here it is, a special rush release for you to dance to, sing along to, and play loudly at any demonstrations you go to :-)the song will be available for general release from feb 7, but you can preorder it right now. enjoy!listen. protest. resist.rodney & paul from the cassandra complex”
