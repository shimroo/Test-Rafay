											how can i get in to see wicked at a discounted price?
									 	

the $25 lottery for "wicked" tickets
cheap broadway tickets are hard to come by. but it does happen, and sometimes in very creative ways. 
take, for example, the broadway musical "wicked." the folks there will place you in the front row for a fraction of the price of a ticket by drawing your name from a hat during a daily ritual at broadway's gershwin theatre called the $25 lottery. 
so if the $50 and $110 price range of "wicked" tickets turns you off or you are simply shut out of a sold-out show, there is still hope. here's how it works: 
"wicked" folks at broadway's gershwin theatre will place your name in a hat 2.5 hours before each show. you must physically be at the theater to place your name in the hat at that time. two hours before the show starts, the theater workers draw 28 names out of the hat to be given $25 front-row seats for that day's show. there is a limit of two lottery tickets per person and you must pay in cash. 
"wicked" is a musical about how the wicked witch of the west and glinda the good witch met and became friends long before dorothy descended upon oz.

											are there ticket brokers that specialize in an area?
									 	

new york ticket brokers specialize in new york shows
some ticket brokers specialize in certain areas of the country, though they can get you tickets to events nationwide. if your heart is set on getting into a hot broadway show, it's a good idea to check with a new york ticket broker that specializes in new york events. this is because these ticket brokers may have a better shot at getting you exactly what you want through their vast circle of inside contacts in a particular city. many new york ticket brokers claim they can get you "spamalot" tickets, "the lion king" tickets and "wicked" tickets on short notice -- all super hot broadway shows that are difficult to get into. 
check the yellow pages in new york or online to find new york ticket brokers.

											how can i get cheap spamalot tickets on broadway?
									 	

cheap tickets to see "spamalot"
if you want "spamalot" tickets on broadway, it's going to cost you. that's because monty python's "spamalot," winner of the 2005 tony, outer critics and drama desk awards best musical is a hit show. for those who don't know, the show tells the tale of king arthur and the knights of the round table and their quest for the holy grail. 
if the show is sold out, you may still have a shot to get inside. the theater offers standing room only seats on the day of the performance. they cost a mere $21.25 and there's a limit of two tickets per person. the show must be sold out for these to be sold. 
for regular priced tickets, it will cost you between $36 and $112 to see "spamalot," depending on where you sit. the back rows on the balcony are the cheapest and the orchestra seats are most expensive. however, you may also buy premium seating, the best seats in the house, for between $251 and $302. 
call (212) 239-6200 or (800) 432-7250 for individual tickets 
to find out about group discounts for 20 people or more, call (212) 239-6262 or (800) 432-7780 
to find out about premium seating, call (212) 239-6270

											how can i get cheap or half price theater tickets?
									 	

how to get cheap theater tickets
a way to get cheap theater tickets is to buy them the day of the show. many theaters sell discounted tickets hours and minutes before a show to get rid of any extras they may have. these are often referred to as "stand by" or "last minute" seats. call the theater to find out if they do this. many theaters would rather sell these tickets for reduced prices than lose money on the seats.
also, check to see if your city has a half price ticket outlet where you can buy tickets the same day as a show for half off. las vegas has one, which helps out a lot when you are looking to see a pricey show there. however, you likely will not find tickets to such hot shows as "blue man group" at these outlets because these shows sell out every night.

											what can i do to get into a sold out show of the lion king?
									 	

when "the lion king" tickets are sold out
when "the lion king" tickets are sold out, you still have some options for getting inside the beautiful minskoff theatre on broadway. here are two options: 
stand in line two hours before the show and you may be able to purchase a cancellation or standing room ticket. keep in mind that only one cancellation or standing room ticket can be purchased per person. pay a ticket broker, but be prepared to pay significantly more for your seat because brokers must charge more than face value for tickets to cover their costs and also make a profit. for example, razorgator.com currently has lion king tickets available for $180 and $255 and coasttocoasttickets.com has tickets for between $130 and $300.
