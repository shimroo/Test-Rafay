    what our guests say

 read some of our guests reviews

   
 just off a wonderful 3 day stay at red rocker and we are already trying to figure out when we can go back! the staff could not be lovelier, the accommodations are like out of a movie, and the food is amazing. the perfect place to unwind, sit out on the porch, and recharge. black mountain has turned into our home away from home and this will be our new place to stay for sure.

 we went here with a group of friends for brunch. i had the eggs benedict with a deep, rich tarragon cream sauce. if it’s being offered when you are there then get the smoked gouda grits. out of this world. oh, and the mimosas! the newish owners, mike and katy, are great hosts.

 we had the greatest easter lunch at the red rocker inn today! they worked our family in early, which we so appreciated with 4 small children. our server dave was so nice and the food was absolutely delicious- everything! we look forward to coming back very soon.
