	 wonder boy schock - neighborhood leader?
	 
    


yeah i bet he was thinking that when we was selling off his properties in the arbors.    it was pointed out to me that he was one of the first to sell to bradley.   his sale was critical to bradley's ability to move forward and critical to undermining a stable, primarily resident owned, and occupied neighborhood.    it is also worth noting that his supporters (some who appear in the tv ad) were right there ready to walk away, in the defense of the arbors.   that's neighborhood leadership !!!!

	 and thinking about beer....
	 
    


forget about the foleout, or iran, or iraq.   who cares about whether north korea drops a nuke.   jobs?   we don't need no stink'n jobs.   pass me a forty.    the republican's need to get their act together and confront a real crisis for a change.   a real crisis that is of deep concern to many a red neck, nascar watchin, republikan.    voter turnout could be severely impacted.yes.. the beer supply is under threat !!!!!! 4% of the u.s. hops crop burns !!!   who is behind this?   al qaeda?   angry terrorist milkmen?   canadians?   democrats?  this is a crisis of monumental importance.

	 guns + beer = ?????
	 
    


while at kroger today... i noticed the new busch beer hunter's pack.   it is basically a camoflaged case of beer.   i had to laugh, because we all know how well cheap beer and loaded guns, go with each other.

	 habanero doritos
	 
    


the new habanero doritos are quite possibly the most perfect 'nacho' chip.   over the years frito-lay has tried to make a 'spicey' chip and failed miserably.   these beautiful little chips are a work of art.   they are what a nacho chip should be.   yum!!!!

	 alkaline batteries
	 
    


where does one recycle alkaline batteries in peoria illinois?   you know.. duracells, everready...etc.i always feel guilty about tossing them in the trash.   indeed, i think it is technically not allowed, not that the trash guys are going to do anything about it.

	 2600 cars a day
	 
    


2600 people pass through the uplands every day.   sitting on my porch, i can easily assess that the vast majority of them speed and or blow our stop signs.   i would put the figure around 75% to 80% of them.   many of them don't even bother to slow down.so i read the other day that they were gonna tack on another $25 in fines to court supervision for people with moving violations.   it seems the pd needs more money to replace their aging cars... that or they want to get their hands on some new hot cop model dodge chargers.   either way it got me back to the uplands.  this whole cut through traffic 'problem' has been simmering for some time, leading neighbors to suggest lowering the speed limit further and adding more stop signs.   yeah... as if that is going to work.    if the pd actually enforced the speed limit and the stop signs and if they actually ticketed maybe a quarter of what actually passes through.   the pd would be leveeing some $48,000 in fines a day !!!   do that for a month and you might be seeing nearly a million in fines.    now.. not all of that million is going to go to the local pd but even a fraction of that would go a long way toward getting some shiney new chargers.   the police presence would do wonders for improving the neighborhood peace of mind, what with all the arsons and robberies lately.   i would link to them, but curiously some of them are not making it into the paper.

	 atm ettiquette
	 
    


if you pull up to an atm machine and there are others behind you, you really only have two choices.   you could either quickly withdraw some money or move along.    why do some people think that a drive up atm is there for all of their banking needs?   why do banks enable these machines to do anything but withdrawl?   it is rude to be sitting there moving money around, taking 5 minutes to fill out and make a fricken deposit, while the line grows n grows.   if you have to do a balance inquiry, you probably shouldn't be withdrawing money.   just snap up $20 and go.
