welcome to holy rosary catholic church
holy rosary parish was founded by the dominican friars in 1913 when they were invited by bishop nicholas a. gallagher to serve the needs of 125 families living in what was then houston’s south side. at the time, the city had only 82,000 citizens. as soon as the parish was established work began on a two-story building on land donated by william h. mccarthy. since its inception in 1913, holy rosary catholic church has served as the physical foundation from which the dominican friars have provided spiritual care throughout the city and nurtured the faith of generations of parishioners.the bishop of galveston blessed the parish in november of 1933.
