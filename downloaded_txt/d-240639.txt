					bonsai tree care				
keeping a bonsai tree alive is not a difficult task, but there are a few things you should be aware of. bonsai trees are planted in small pots with minimal space for water and nutrient reserves. that means you need to water and fertilize your tree regularly. make sure your bonsai gets plenty of light, water, and fertilize when needed and your tree is sure to thrive!

					growing and cultivating				
there are different methods to propagate trees, some need a lot of patience and some offer immediate results. growing a tree from seed means you have full control over the styling of your bonsai plant, but it takes at least five years before you have anything that resembles a tree. buying a tree in a nursery means you can style it right away.

					styling				
a common misconception is that the plants used for bonsai are genetically 'dwarfed' plants. bonsai trees are normal plants, propagated like any other, but trained using sophisticated techniques to keep them miniature. the styling of these miniature trees involves important techniques like regular pruning and wiring.

					popular tree species				
each tree species has specific requirements for its cultivation, training, and care. this means selecting the right tree species for your environment (or identifying which tree species you might already have) is crucial to keeping it healthy. we will help you select the tree that's right for you, or identify the tree you already have. the most popular species include the ficus and juniper.
