what our customers are saying:






we searched all around town and austin stone works gave us the best price along with the options we needed. measuring was perfect. the installation was very quick. they were very careful to clean up any mess. i noticed one minor flaw after they left. they quickly and professionally returned and corrected. they also took time to show me how to care for the stone and what chemicals to use and not to use. very happy.
t. joyner






as a kitchen remodeling contractor i sent numerous clients to asw. the pricing is competitive for the quality of work performed and my clients have been well pleased with the final results. my strongest recommendation is that the people there all care about getting everything right. any issues have been resolved with a professional attitude and great follow up.
