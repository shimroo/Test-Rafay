there is no cost other than having an open mind. keep that wallet 
safely away, there's no charge.
the site is under constant development. no, really. ok, not that constant. ok, maybe only updated once or twice a year. but much of the material about business, working from home,
starting 
up in business,

selling websites and on
buying websites are "evergreen". coming in due course are new sections on
opportunities and reviews of successful online 
business models. 
the most popular pages on this site, though a bit dated, are

101 top ways of making money online,

alternatives to adsense. we also have articles with brilliant ideas on emerging business 
opportunities and tips from people who've started and run successful internet 
businesses
if you've already been running a business for a while, and are looking to cash out, here's how you can sell your business quickly and for the highest price.
we want to excite your interest and show how you can earn money working from 
home. read this site for free or go pay for some half-baked ebook. 
we've also put together a few resources. for example, there are some sample 
documents you might need when buying an internet business (non
disclosure agreement | 
memorandum of sale 
|
contract
for the sale of a website). there are also some useful
website tools for webmasters 
and internet business professionals. and lots more.

enjoy!
