skokie rocks!

awarded 2024 skokie fine arts 
			commission program award!



skokie rocks is our a community-wide, 
			diversity-based, arts outreach program where families and persons of 
			all ages and abilities are invited to paint, hide, and seek river 
			rocks in skokie parks. 
in direct complement to skokie's slogan "skokie 
			welcomes everyone" and with the help of social media and language 
			translation apps, our program is intended to build bridges between 
			different communities helping those who speak different languages to 
			connect and communicate through art.  
rock hunters are invited to seek out the 
			painted rocks, post images and share their found rocks on social 
			media, with the hashtag #skokierocks.
