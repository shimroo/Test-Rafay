named after henry b. plant, who constructed the railroad connecting plant city with the south florida railroad, plant city thrives in its historic role as an agriculture center, but it is also home to a robust manufacturing sector.  its proximity to tampa and orlando international airports, as well as interstate 4, the major east/west artery (i-4 technology corridor) through florida, have made plant city an ideal distribution point for major businesses.  the greater plant city chamber of commerce plays a leading role in community, business and economic development in the area.
notwithstanding its role in economic growth, plant city is proud to be recognized as the winter strawberry capital of the world, producing over three fourths of the nation’s midwinter strawberries.   the annual florida strawberry festival® brings over half a million visitors to the area during february.  while boasting one of the finest community colleges, hillsborough community college, and a high-tech community hospital, south florida baptist hospital, plant city blends the best of big-town amenities and small town charm.
