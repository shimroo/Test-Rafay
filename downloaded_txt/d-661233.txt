products 





 quickview pulse valve
products




the mac patented pulse valve series was developed to replace current diaphragm style technology and create a more robust and reliable valve solution in industrial applications. mac pulse valves are ideal to replace existing diaphragm technology in applications such as reverse jet bag houses and dust collectors, pneumatic conveying and bulk material handling.

the mac patented pulse valve can be ordered in one of two pilot configurations: the integral solenoid pilot combines fast, repeatable pulses with the addition of a manual operator, while our remote bleed version to improve performance and reliability in hazardous locations.  the main body of the mac pulse valve utilizes bonded spool technology for superior reliability beyond existing diaphragm technology. a checked accumulator and a main spool with memory spring are used to ensure a shift back to the home position, for times when air supply may not be adequate. a line of adapter plates has also been released to replace existing diaphragm pulse valves with a direct drop-in, without disturbing existing plumbing.

it is currently available in (3) sizes; the pv03, for ¾” and 1” applications and the pv06, for 1 ½” applications, and pv09 for 2" and 2 ½" applications.

 quickview liquid valves
products


the mac advantage™ features:

2-way, 3-way, variable flow, filling and dosing valves
wetted and non-wetted (media-separated) solenoids
accurate and repeatable dosing
dual-diaphragm d-flex™ technology
reliable operation in extreme environments

 

the mac liquid valve line of products benefits from many of the same innovative features and associated benefits that have become synonymous with mac’s performance characteristics over the years. fast response times, reliable shifting forces and repeatable results are just some of the benefits you can expect from our fluid line of products. proportional flow controls (pfc’s), flow-thru valves, single and dual diaphragm (media-separated) valves, wetted solenoid valves and dosing fluid pumps are a few of the product offerings in mac’s liquid valve family of products. these valves also work great in pneumatic applications that require leak tight performance. the mac liquid valve line of products is designed to last longer and perform stronger in the toughest applications. with fewer wear points than traditional valve technology, these valves are designed to last!

design features of bullet™ technology:

very few parts
long life lifting solenoid
an integrated poppet / armature
balanced design
solenoid isolated from contaminated air
unique mounting options

the bullet valve® (bv) family of products represents yet another evolution in valve technology from mac. the bullet valve® line of products features mac patented bullet™ technology. this “lifting” solenoid configuration is unique in that the valve maintains a balanced design – a signature feature of a mac valve. thus, shifting forces are consistently high and response times are more repeatable despite inlet pressure fluctuations. 2-way, 3-way and 4-way configurations of the bullet valve® are available.
