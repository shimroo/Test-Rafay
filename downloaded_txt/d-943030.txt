some of my upcoming/tentative 2025 plans:tricon @ themuseum, kitchener, february 15-16 (family day weekend)con-g geeks@home free online convention - february 21-23 (based in guelph, ontario)star wars day, may the fourth... tba anime north, toronto congress centre, may 23-25robin in the hood, gibson park elmira, june 7 (sponsored by: red flags in fandom)bruce county comicon, southampton july 12 (heh, i'm currently on their front page)oxford renfest, thorndale fairgrounds, september 26-28 (i was there last year as chanting monk from monty python & the holy grail)halloween, tba(a shout-out to xtra life tg for the awesome lightsaber in the pic above. also i made that jedi outfit with materials from fabricland [outer tabard] and len's mill [inner tunic, not yet hemmed in this wip pic & boot covers], photo taken at hacksmith industries with permission)

it's been an interesting journey, so far so good, and it continues in ways never expected.over 30 years ago i attended my very first scifi convention (at toronto trek aka polaris). as the weekend progressed i realized it was a life-changing experience in a positive way - but not to the extent that it would eventually become. to so many people i owe many more thanks.i've been working on a project called red flags in fandom🚩, seeking to empower fellow members of the community to be aware of the negative aspects in hopes of protecting both person and pocketbook. so far it continues to be a rewarding experience with many positive responses (and valuable feedback).  i've uploaded a bunch of pics and some vids of my costumes and creations from over many years, click here or the six panel photo montage to the side to visit.economic realities have also been a factor, hence why i have scaled-down some of the previous features, such as the nostalgic photo gallery going back decades, as well as the original snake-eyes tribute site. those photos are still archived and can be retrieved if needed, but this also frees up resources for other uses as all traffic/visits should now redirect to this blogspot page. currently i'm using blogger to post here and it's been relatively painless so far.i'm still around and can be found at conventions here and there, or online... i've added links below.be well, be safe, and have fun. walt aka sid> n e o e n g e l @ g m a i l d o t c o m red flags in fandom:redflagsinfandom.combluesky:neoengel.bsky.socialreddit: reddit.com/user/neoengelyoutube: youtube.com/neoengelinstagram: (closed in response to dehumanizing policy changes january 2025)h̶t̶t̶p̶s̶:̶//i̶n̶s̶t̶a̶g̶r̶a̶m̶.c̶o̶m̶/n̶e̶o̶.e̶n̶g̶e̶l̶twitter / x (archived november 2024):t̶w̶i̶t̶t̶e̶r̶.c̶o̶m̶/n̶e̶o̶e̶n̶g̶e̶l̶here's some more stuff i've done:me and a friend having some fun as yipyip martians at conbravo:



those of the old-school crowd might recall an awesome convention called toronto trek (later known as polaris) and my work there over the years. here i am having fun on the job oh so many years ago:



something i did march 2024, a new jedi cosplay using a new xenopixel lightsaber (on flashblade mode) from xtralifetg.com  photographed at hacksmith industries:

my first true effort in putting together a costume was of one of my favourite characters, snake-eyes from the 80s marvel gijoe franchise. i began that in 1999 and it evolved in different forms, here's an example of one of them prior to putting that into semi-retirement:

from bluesky:

i'm fond of cosplaying while playing airsoft.

i've shown up as koobus from district 9, cobra trooper, aliens marine, etc.

probably the most popular & practical outfit is going as a background character from the stargate sg1 tv series. the vest they used is near-impossible to find, so i improvised.[image or embed]— sid 🍁🖖 redflagsinfandom.com🚩 (@neoengel.bsky.social) november 16, 2024 at 10:46 am
