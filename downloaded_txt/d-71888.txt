key component in a desktop publishing workflow

                        gimp provides top-notch color management features to
			ensure high-fidelity color reproduction across digital
			and printed media. it is best used in workflows
			involving other free software such as
                        scribus
                        and inkscape.

extensibility & flexibility

                        gimp provides extensibility through integration
                        with many programming languages including scheme, python, perl,
                        and more.
                    

                        the result is a high level of customization as demonstrated
                        by the large number of scripts and plug-ins created by the community.
