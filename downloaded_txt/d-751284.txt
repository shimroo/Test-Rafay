news from camp! 












				stories of 2024: winning spirit			


since 1996, coniston has partnered with the childhood cancer lifeline of nh to provide a free weekend for families affected by pediatric cancer. families, many at different stages of their cancer journey, come together for a weekend of fun, support, respite, camaraderie, and of course, camp! the success of this weekend hinges on current and previous summer staff members who in many cases donate their time to bring coniston to families that need it most.

testimonials 














						coniston changed my life and who i am forever. i recently attended the 94 cit biannual reunion and we're all still the best of friends. i learned to be independent, resourceful, and kind always. as a counselor i learned to have a hard work ethic, to be patient and to never stop being a kid.					


nicholascamper, staff, and alumni 






						(my camper) had a truly amazing week. he spoke nothing but good. he loved everything about it and everyone. he spoke about how it’s the first time he’s gone someplace and didn’t get bullied by anyone… he made friends. i cannot express the joy that brings to me as his mom. […] thank you so much for giving him this gift. 					


letter to campcamper parent 






						the place that changed my life and gave me the confidence to be myself! the camp leadership constantly works to make coniston better and better each year and to allow more kids the opportunity to have a positive camp experience. the facilities are unmatched and the commitment of the staff is outstanding. proud to be a coniston alumni!					


camp ratingz reviewalumni 






						i spent 9 wonderful summers at this camp. it is the most amazing place i have ever been and plan to send my kids here when they are old enough. i have used camp experiences in interviews and college applications basically anytime i can talk about camp i do. again most amazing place i have ever had!					


camp ratingz reviewalumni 






						camp has been amazing for our family! my daughter has bloomed so much and is so eager to get back to camp for the summer. i would highly recommend this camp to anyone, especially if your child is unsure about camp because coniston has one of the most welcoming atmospheres i have ever seen!					


camp ratingz reviewcamper parent 






						this camp is amazing. it serves as the cornerstones for most of our lives. best friends are made here, counselors and campers. you go there for just one session (even though i went for seven) and your life is truly changed. the environment, the education, the social aspect, the food, the morals of everybody are all better than any other place in the world.
