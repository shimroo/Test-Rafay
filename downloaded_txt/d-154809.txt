the covering kids & families initiative was the nation's single largest effort to reduce the number of eligible but uninsured children and adults through enrollment in medicaid and the state children's health insurance program (schip).
from 2000 through 2007, covering kids & families grantees in all 50 states and the district of columbia worked at the state level to simplify the medicaid and schip application process, coordinate rules governing the administration of public programs, and conduct outreach to enroll eligible families in these programs.  through this work, they helped reduce the number of uninsured children by more that 2 million since the schip program began.
the covering kids & families initiative has come to an end, but the robert wood johnson foundation is proud to continue its efforts to get americas kids covered through cover the uninsured, the nations largest mobilization to find solutions for americas uninsured. for more information, and to access the many tools, templates and resources previously available on this web site, please visit covertheuninsured.org.  if you're looking for the national program office of covering kids & families, the southern institute on children and families, please visit www.thesoutherninstitute.org.
