welcome to bad wolf press!if you've seen a funny musical at a school, chances are it was a bad wolf creation. our snappy scripts and catchy tunes bring curriculum to life and get kids invested in learning and acquiring academic and life skills they didn't even know they were missing. bad wolf plays are extremely affordable, easy and fun to do (no theater or music experience required!), and require no costumes or props. plus our shows have more dumb jokes per page than those of any other publisher -- nine out of ten dentists agree!
