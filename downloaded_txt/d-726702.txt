become an athlete
athletes are the heart of special olympics. our athletes are children and adults with intellectual disabilities from across the granite state. they are finding success, joy and friendship as part of our global community. they’re also having lots of fun!
get started


make a difference
every day we empower athletes to shatter stereotypes and exceed their personal bests on the playing field and in life. but for every special olympics champion, there is another who is waiting for a chance to win. please donate and help us get one more athlete onto the playing field.

get involved
volunteers are the backbone of the special olympics movement. they are coaches, trainers, officials, event organizers, fundraisers and managers. they can also be unified partners—playing alongside athletes with intellectual disabilities—or fans cheering in the stands.
