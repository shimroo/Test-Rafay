john boak
paint
oil paint just feels good. it is in no hurry. oil lingers. it remembers the moment. the daily changes of slow drying oil suggest new pathways while closing off others. oil honors commitment and rewards us with depth of feeling.
digital
bits are agile. digital painting frees development of the idea. layers, color shifts, undoing, brushes, smudges, erasers, layer interactions: all serve the speedy feedback loops of learning. i like low-friction image evolution. can i surprise me?
process
my tools let me be a hunter gatherer of the daily image. i walk & i curate the world. my images are icons of the moment. whispers of feeling. lines with logic. jewels of the earth. the now is quick. it makes digital seem slow and painting glacial. i am grateful for eyes, hands & tools.
