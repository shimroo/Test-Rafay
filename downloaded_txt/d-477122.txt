weight loss medications have been growing in popularity and use will likely continue to increase due to new year’s resolutions. there are a variety of medications that may be used for weight loss, from injections, such as semaglutide, to supplements.

before beginning any medication, be sure to talk to your doctor/s. this even includes over-the-counter and online purchased supplements. as always, prescribed medications should only be taken when prescribed by your healthcare provider.
always read and follow all dosage instructions before taking any medication. whether your weight loss medication comes in a pre-measured injectable pen, a multidose vial, a pill, or a powder, it is important to make sure you are taking the correct dose.
use the guidance and support of your pharmacist for instructions on how to take specific medications. every medication is different and their guidance can help avoid mistakes in taking your medicine.
never take extra doses of your medications. more is not better and extra medication can hurt you. always follow the exact dosing recommendation.
when taking medicine, always monitor your body’s reaction to the medication for side effects and adverse reactions. for long-lasting adverse reactions, call the medical experts at the west virginia poison center at 1-800-222-1222.
remember, many over-the-counter dietary supplements are not regulated and can contain unidentified substances, some of which can be dangerous.
if someone has taken too much of a weight loss medication or is having symptoms beyond normal side effects, call 1-800-222-1222 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.
