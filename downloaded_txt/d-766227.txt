jack johnson's boxing career lasted from 1898 to 1928. at the height of his career, the outspoken jack was crucified by the press for his flashy lifestyle and for having twice married white women. sometimes he would travel with more than one white woman at a time. he further offended white supremacists in 1910 by knocking out former champion james j. jeffries, who had been induced to come out of retirement as a “great white hope.” the johnson-jeffries bout, which was billed as the “fight of the century,” led to nationwide celebrations by african americans that were occasionally met by violence from whites, resulting in more than 20 deaths across the country. acrylic and oil on masonite board, 14x11" 2017. $800

don't worry about me, save yourself.
billy sunday played professional baseball during the 1880's, and later became a religious con man. between 1908 and 1920, sunday earned over a million dollars. an average worker during the same period earned less than $14,000 annually. i find the correlation that those who are successful see between success and religion interesting. when modern athletes point to the sky giving thanks for a home run i wonder whether their actions might speak louder than their public posturing. in this image the jesus fish have turned into piranhas.© 2008 • 24 by 20 inches • oil on masonite panel $1500
