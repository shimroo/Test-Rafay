com-pac yachts began business in 1974 with its first boat, the com-pac 16. the idea then was to build a seaworthy yacht with a strong commitment to value. since then com-pac has expanded its line to twelve models, six cat-rigged sailboats, five sloop rigged sailboats and one power launch. the com-pac line covers a wide range of sizes from a 14' day sailor to the com-pac 27/3 cruising yacht. each model, regardless of size, is built with the same exacting attention to detail and that same commitment to value.
