i've stayed here every time i've been in milwaukee and i love it! the rooms are super clean, the staff is nice, and the location is stellar! each time i've stayed i've been conveniently close to the zoo, american family field, and the state fair. i've also come here a few times as a solo traveller and i've always felt safe and right at home. i highly recommend!

rooms are efficient, and the beds are very comfortable. the most important part is how clean they are. they are so kind to my family. the cleaning lady goes up and beyond. the location is wonderful for brewers' game, zoo, or downtown for conferences or go to outlets or mall.
 catie b.


   


staff is very nice and friendly, hotel has a very good house keeper , rooms are very clean and she was keeping up the hallways and everything, quietly , bright and early. there is no pool or anything. free coffee and tea in the lobby in the morning, but i would definitely recommend this hotel.

     can you tell us more about forty winks inn?

   




  the forty winks inn is a hotel 
that was designed by russell barr williamson, and built by herman weger in 1954. russell barr williamson worked and collaborated with frank lloyd wright from 1914-1918. he had adopted wright's modular system of design, with variations, particularly the compact square (bogk-type) and the bungalow. williamson and wright used the same flow of ideas and decorative motifs. williamson is noted for his work on the bogk house and the imperial hotel 
in japan. williamson's style is essentially an elongated open square plan, dividing it by floor level changes, planters, and fireplaces. all these techniques can be seen at our hotel. this style of architecture is commonly known as prairie architecture.in 1989-1990 the hotel 
was expanded and remodeled from 20 guest rooms to 31 guest rooms. the hallways were enclosed by a glass wall which formed a secure, air-conditioned, and heated atrium. the hotel 
rooms were renovated with new windows, drywall, baths, and furniture.
