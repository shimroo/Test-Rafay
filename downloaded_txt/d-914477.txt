   what
people are saying
 what are our valuable customers are saying about us?




   
“i worked with mike benson of empire to sell my manufacturing company in 2007. mike was very helpful in making the entire process clear and understandable as it is an emotional time. i was always impressed at his availability and follow up. it was like i was his only client. his understanding of this process is really incredible. like anything that you do once (or in some cases a few times) in your lifetime, the thought of actually doing it is intimidating. and picking the wrong team to handle it would have to be devastating. mike's professional approach yet being easy to talk to was very settling and made me comfortable. i trust mike.mike educated me more than i would have ever expected. we all know our businesses, the thing we worked so hard to build but selling it is another thing all together. mike had or found 11 excellent potential buyers and each meeting was interesting, enjoyable and educational. the entire procedure from, "hey, i think i will sell my business" to closing day requires energy, an open mind and strong support. mike did a great job for me. and he made the process enjoyable. he was there for me from day one to closing day. i can only say that if i ever sell my business again (started a new one) mike is my guy.” eric mutschler
 
“i worked with mike at empire for about 18 months and i can't say enough good things about him ...he was awesome. it was my first time selling a company and he was very patient and guided us through the whole process very well. i felt very comfortable with him asking him many questions and with him keeping our information confidential. he also is very motivated he had several buyers for our company within the first month.  he also follows up very well postsale. we sold over a year ago and he still checks in with me. i always love talking to him he has very fair pricing and is a happy, cheerful person.” rene
