unlike steam cleaning, carpets dry in less than 15 minutes using this dry carpet cleaning method. for perfectly cleaned carpets and significantly reduced drying time, trust the professionals at kiwi.same-day service availablewhether you need same-day service for your home or office, our team can provide prompt, professional, and efficient services. our team of experienced technicians is equipped and ready. call us to schedule an appointment, from carpet and air duct cleaning to upholstery cleaning and hard wood floor services. our crews are also on standby 24 hours a day to respond to any water damage emergency, from a catastrophic hurricane-related flood or a bathtub overflow.dallas972-354-0031fort worth817-585-5956houston713-595-0412austin512-381-3405atlanta470-375-9755phoenix602-419-3578denver720-943-2925kiwi800-333-kiwisearch by zip codefind a kiwi services near you enter your zip code*hiddenuid
