fear: by its very nature, snakes incite fear to most people who see them. by seeing them in your dreams, it could mean that there is something that you’re afraid of facing, but it also means that your mind is challenging you to face those fears and hopefully be able to get over the hump.transcendental knowledge: in some cultures, snakes are considered an animal of great knowledge. by having dreams about snakes, one could consider it is a sign that you are seeking greater knowledge, or wisdom that will place at a higher level of consciousness.

water is flowing and continuous, so symbolically, water means life, rebirth as how we get baptized. involvement of water in dreams is widespread among those who are experiencing heavy emotions or anxiety. 
visualizing water flowing rapidly like it’s in a rush or overflowing mans your emotions are been bottled up and badly wants to get out. it demands an expression of your waking life.
dreams of floods
aside from this initial and basic analysis, there are few explanations that can give more detailed meaning based on some details of your dream. for example, the setting, manner of flow of water and how it relates to the situation you’re in.
dreams of floods at home
the place where there is flooding has great significance. if the setting of the dream is in your house, it means your family is suffocating and you or something or someone in the house is feeling like they are drowning. 
floods basically mean you’re getting drowned, overwhelmed, and unable to cope. with the setting or place of the flooding, you can identify which part your life is causing the problem. 
dreams of floods in a school
another example is if you see a flooded school then it means that school or work is drowning or stressing you out too much that you need to take it easy.  
these kinds of dreams can a warning for you to take it easy on some aspects of your life.
dreams of floods in the toilet
there are some settings or places of the dreams that have a positive interpretation and one of them is dreaming of a toilet being flooded. it means that you need to flush away a certain painful memory that has been tormenting you. 
biblical interpretation of dreams of floods
with the christian meaning of water, which is rebirth through baptism or christening, it can also mean that you will have a new chapter or a brand-new beginning in your life. 
for example, if you have dreamt of a flood that took you along the flow of water into a brand-new place, it means that you are about to get a change in your life. a new job, new school, new house or even a new lover are on the horizon. who knows right? but it surely means that a change in your life is bound to happen.
aside from different interpretations of this kind of dream in some aspects of society like how the bible and psychology interpreted it. different cultures also have a somehow similar but different interpretation of this.
islamic interpretation of dreams of floods
in islam, flood in dreams has a negative meaning. it means, harm, lies, hypocrisy, an enemy or an enemy trying to attack you or having dangerous thoughts of you. 
if you end up drowning and dying in the dream, then i guess it means that someone wishes you harm. or if in the dream you are obviously struggling to live or breath. but if the flood flowed and took you to a river then it means that you will be able to escape from your enemy. 
while if it is a flood that destroyed your home, i guess it means the destruction of literally your house. probably a collapse of a part of your house will eventually happen. or it concerns your family that lives in that house.
it can be someone moving out or divorce of a couple in the house. while if it’s someone you know, for example, you have been having a hunch that your husband is cheating on you. if you dream of your husband drowning, it can either mean that he is lying to you, he wishes you harm, or he is being a hypocrite. 
these kinds of dreams can either bring good or bad effect in your actual life. it can lead to expecting too much, being paranoid, and much worse anxiety. 
dreams and readings of dreams are not always accurate and factual. but it can serve as a precaution or a warning just in case we really are caught in between a very bad situation that bothered your mind.

the bee symbolizes hard work, one’s fulfilment with one’s persistence. honey is precious and represents gold, royalty and wealth, according to the egyptians, bees were born from the tears of the sun god.
dreaming of a bee recalls these meanings of royalty, wealth, and splendor, as well as self-realization. it will, therefore, have the positive intention of achieving success, of good results. at the same time, it will express our same industriousness, creative ability, and strength in carrying out projects.
dreaming of a bee can also refer to the same idea of prosperity, fertility, and therefore also fruitful love. it can express diligence, discipline and even teamwork understood as an effort by an entire community to achieve valuable results such as honey. this can relate to practical goals such as wealth, job satisfaction, the birth of a child or the achievement of goals so that your spirit can reach a higher level.

dreams about bees
biblical meaning of bees in dreams
hard work, honey, and wax, the bee has always played a significant role in the christian imagination. saint ambrose, for example, compared the church to the beehive and the members of a community to bees, which can get the best out of every flower. saint bernard of clairvaux considered the bees a symbol of the holy spirit, perhaps based on the idea that bees lived only on the scent of flowers, thus giving an image of great purity and continence.
several saints are compared to the sweetness of honey, an “almost divine” food that symbolizes the compassion of christ, symbolizes purity and sweetness even in the virgin mary. at the same time, the sting seems suitable to symbolize the divine punishment in the moment of the final judgment.
the beneficial character of the insect, its wisdom, and the virtues of its products have been chosen several times to illustrate the human and spiritual qualities. in the christian religion, they also represent purity and innocence; the latter because it was then believed that bees were virgins.
dreaming of bees has a very broad biblical meaning that leads back to serenity, sweetness and purity to something small that leads back to greatness.
we dream of the bee that brings something useful and beautiful into our lives; a divine message of how we are or maybe how we could be if we want to. one of our results can be excellent and indispensable as bees and honey are.
bee sting dreams
dreaming of a bee stinging? it does not have a positive meaning,this dream represents a threat, something that scares you in real life and from which you try with all your strength to escape.
a bee that tries to sting you can represent a person or a situation that worries you, from which you feel “stung” and from which you cannot get rid of. it can also be an obsessive thought or a repressed feeling of anger that you cannot throw out and “stings” you from your inside.
on the other hand, the fear of being stung by a bee is one of those that most obsessed us as children and returns to your dreams when you are experiencing trauma or a vital thought and trouble.
dreams about bees attacking
bees that chase and attack are a vision that represents fear, a threat that scares you probably due to a recent trauma or something that has deeply marked you and for which you must find a remedy.the angry and threatening bees in our dream indicate to us that we are experiencing relationships in a conflicting way, and this does not benefit our well-being.
dreams about honey bees
honey portends the achievement of goals, solidarity and the ability to carry out creative and proactive teamwork. you could, therefore, achieve a prestigious milestone thanks to the joint work, the best, the one that always bears the best fruit.
furthermore, honey can be a symbol of spiritual values ​​ and riches that you have obtained by working on yourself, in your soul. in dreams, honey can represent a spiritual treasure, very high-level nourishment for the soul.
but also fertility and love. in fact, the expression ‘honeymoon’ literally means ‘honey month’. honey is, therefore, a symbol of honest, sincere and fertile love; in dreams, it enhances a happy union with a partner and can also refer to a marriage or pregnancy.
like all dreams in which you eat sweet things, dreaming of eating honey can indicate that you need affection, care and attention. if you eat honey with someone, it probably means that there is a good understanding between you, an honest and fertile feeling, on an emotional level, or even on a professional level, but also marriage or pregnancy.
dreaming of a jar of honey usually represents something very precious that you keep with care: it can be the fruit of your work, the material wealth you have earned, or even your spiritual wealth or even represent your loved one;while dreaming of a jar of honey falling to the ground and breaking is not a good omen, because it could mean material or emotional loss that you cared a lot about or a warning to be careful storing your belongings without ever putting them at risk.
dreams about bumblebees
the bumblebee is often associated with the hornet, but only in dream meanings, they are two completely different insects, but in the dream, they are both negative entities.
dreaming of hornets and bumblebees could indicate the fear of being in close contact with one or more treacherous people who make fun of the dreamer and can emotionally impoverish him. the more the hornets and bumblebees in a dream seem to be large, the more the problem appears insurmountable to the subject by whom he feels overwhelmed in real life.
in particular, the bumblebee is a symbol of anguish and problems that are about to arise and warns us of future slanders but, in other cases, it also indicates that one is a bit clumsy with others.

sigmund freud believed that dreams are a connection of your inner self with the real world, and they are manifestations of your needs. dreams also symbolize strength and power.
dreaming about toilets isn’t that common and could be viewed as somewhat weird. unless you’re a bathroom designer or a plumber, dreaming about toilets can actually be a significant sign. you’ll be happy to know that dreaming about toilets is usually a good sign, although there are different ways of interpreting dreams.
toilet dreams
if you find yourself dreaming about toilets, the reason could be either that you crave privacy in daily life or your might be feeling like you’re being watched. the meanings of recurring dreams can sometimes be rather humorous and the dream of poop meaning is one of those that might make you chuckle. 
using a toilet in a dream could mean you’re about to change directions and you may be in for a career or life change. but if you’re having difficulties flushing your toilet, it could mean you’re seeking a new start and need to flush away the old. a blocked toilet is a sign your life is stuck and you need a new path to discover in life.
flushing toilet dreams
dreaming about flushing toilets symbolizes the need to remove old habits, ideas and beliefs and to wash away the things that have been negatively affecting your life. if you repeatedly dream about flushing the toilet, your subconscious is sending you a strong message that you need to take heed or it could lead to illness and pain.
a dream about toilet flushing is a strong signal to take a very close look at yourself and identify areas that are making you unhappy, then devise a plan to do things differently. the best toilet dreams are often highly detailed and interestingly, many dreamers can often remember the type of toilet, the strength of the flushing mechanism and even the toilet brand. 
if you dream about feces the meaning could be interpreted slightly differently than your dream of urine. the former could mean you’re stuck on a solution to your problem while the latter signifies the situation is fluid.  
dirty toilet dreams
a dirty toilet usually means there’s something toxic in your life, either in your relationships or in your day to day activities. usually, dirty toilet dreams are due to unresolved emotional conflicts that you need to address and overcome.
dreaming about a dirty toilet means you are under duress and if you dream about an entire restroom of toilets, where they are all dirty it could mean that your time is up and you need to make a decision now.
the more toilets you dream about the better because it means it’s time to grow and change and a good result is waiting for you. cleaning a dirty toilet is not a task most people relish but the result, both in reality and metaphorically, can make a huge difference to your life. 
broken toilet dreams
a broken toilet means there’s something missing and when we dream about one, it means that there’s something that is niggling at the back of your mind you have missed. if you’ve been involved in solving a problem, start again and examine the issues from a different angle.
dreaming about a broken toilet could also mean there’s something in your waking life that is actually broken. it could be a relationship with someone close and if you’re dreaming about broken toilets often, think about the people who are causing stress in your life and avoid them, avoid gossiping and avoid emotional turmoil.
the good news about dreaming about broken toilets is it could also mean you have accepted a situation in your life and are ready to move on. like fixing a broken toilet in reality, fixing your problems is something you can’t avoid. 
cleaning the toilet dreams
most people hate cleaning the toilet so if you’re dreaming about cleaning, it symbolizes the need to remove and cleanse negativity from your life.remove yourself from destructive people and don’t allow yourself the luxury of self-destructive behaviors.
one of the best ways of taking a cue from this dream is to spend the day actually cleaning your house for peace of mind. you’d be surprised and how much stress you’ll let go when you do this.
dreams about cleaning the toilet also mean you need to get your relationships in order and remove those that are toxic.
blocked toilet dreams
have you ever dreamed of a blocked toilet? this dream is a signal that there’s something in your life that’s holding you back from achieving success.
you might not even realise you’re stuck in a bad situation or unclear about which way to turn. take a closer examination of everything that is holding you back and make a plan to tackle one thing at a time. small steps is the key and take each day as it comes. a clogged toilet is also a sign that you might have bitten off more than you can chew and you might be trying to do far too much. like unclogging a real toilet, the action you might need to take may not be very nice but the result is worth it. 
if you dream you are in a public restroom, it could mean your self-image is at a low point and this is especially so if the toilets are blocked. if there are many toilets that are blocked it could mean you’re really struggling emotionally and unable to cope with handling multiple problems at once.a clogged toilet also means you have unhealthy relationships in real life and dreaming about pooping means combined with a blocked toilet means you feel stuck.
final thoughts about toilet dreams
toilet dreams are one of the weirder kinds of dreams to have and can be somewhat confusing. they usually symbolize bad relationships, blocked emotions and stressful situations.

astrology is the study of planetary forces and their influence upon the human condition. these planetary forces may be viewed as the gods, with each planet finding it corollary in the greco-roman pantheon as well as archetypal psychology.
psychodynamic astrology
psychodynamic astrology represents a synthesis of archetypal psychology and the age old system of astrology. what makes psychodynamic astrology different from other schools of astrology is its emphasis upon the process of individuation (or the coming to consciousness) as it is mirrored in the horoscope. psychodynamic astrology traces out your own particular path of self-realisation.
these planetary forces or gods do not remain idle, instead they seek to be made real and conscious in the world. this quest for consciousness finds its expression on three planes.
as event – here the gods act as forces of fate, for example, pluto, the god of death, might bring about an ending in one’s life.as character – here the gods find their expression via the individual, for example, a willful or aggressive person may find that they are acting as a channel for the war-god mars.as consciousness – here the individual recognises the archetypal forces at work within themselves and chooses to express these energies. for example, an individual who seeks to develop their creative talents is also serving in the temple of the sun-god apollo. this individual will find that, whilst their innate creativity is mirrored by their sun-sign, their calling is to give expression to this otherwise dormant talent.

classical astrology vs psychodynamic astrology
whilst classical astrology tends to focus on event and circumstance, psychodynamic astrology looks at events as the most basic expression of the urge to consciousness. 
that is, every event has, as its end goal, a greater degree of consciousness. events and our fate our the gods seeking life, if we learn from these events then consciousness has been created.
humanistic astrology vs psychodynamic astrology
humanistic astrology serves to describe the character of the individual. in humanistic astrology the planetary archetypes are viewed as sub-personalities within the individual – the combination of which makes up the whole of personality. 
psychodynamic astrology takes a different slant. in psychodynamic astrology the planets are viewed as inner gods or archetypal forces, whilst the individual is seen as a channel through which these planetary energies seek to be realised. the duty of the individual to develop an awareness of these energies and provide them with the expression which they seek.
psychodynamic astrology reports outline the archetypal forces at work within the individual. these forces characterise your
goals in lifefate and destinyyour seek in relationshiphidden talents and greater potentialpath and challenges in liferoad to self-awareness

dreams of fish normally represent a positive dream, a sign of deep inner changes in the dreamer and a great knowledge about one’s own desires. deeply connected to water in its totality, mirror of our unconscious, dreaming of fish lead us to re-emerge from our depths of the soul.
fish is a psychic symbol, whose flickering in the waters in occult depths, ascending to a new light of consciousness. it is no coincidence that fish have been sacred for millions of years. the cult of the fish represents divine power in india, asia and mexico. 
how to interpret dreams about toiletshow to interpret dreams about floodshow to interpret dreams about beeshow to interpret dreams about snake biteshow to interpret dreams of fishhow astrology predictions work
what do dreams of fish mean?
biblical meaning of fish in your dreams
in the gospel, jesus christ often compared men to fish, and fishing is one of the images with which he represented the work of salvation of men. his four first apostles were simple fishermen whom he met on the shores of the lake, while casting their nets. jesus called out to them and said: “follow me and i will make you fishers of men”.
the fish somehow represents human life and is a dream symbol that leads us to be on guard against the many adversities in which we face while living. it also is a sign of problems that will likely arise and as the fish must be careful of the fisherman’s hook, we must be careful to avoid being hooked in by problems that are unnecessary. 
like the fish that swims through the darkness of the abyss, we must rise to the surface to find light and peace, too.
dreams of dead fish
normally, this dream evokes image of fish floating on the water. it indicates that the dream is not a good omen of problems not yet resolved in a sentimental sphere. 
it can represent the loss of material things or the decline of economy in general. 
in general, the death of fish leads to an impending loss and could symbolize material loss of any size, spiritual loss or the loss of something we strongly care about but don’t know how to let go because it is holding us back. 
dreaming about dead fish sometimes represents calamity but most of the time, it’s merely a warning to change something in order not to suffer any loss.
dreams of eating fish
these dreams are images that must be analyzed, taking into account the real feelings of attraction or repulsion for the fish as food. when we dream of the fish we are eating we must always put it in context with the way we eat them and take into account our true feelings about fish in real life.
for example, if in a dream we are eating food that we hate, most likely in life we ​​are “swallowing” too many facts that we do not like, or we are still experiencing unpleasant situations that we are not able to counter.
on the contrary, if in a dream we are eating fish that we consider appetizing, we are probably experiencing pleasures in reality that gratifies us, such as a healthy relationship. it could also be related to the search for a higher spirituality.
normally, fish is considered a nutritious food and excellent for memory, so dreaming of eating one fried or cooked in other ways assumes the interpretation that you are going through positive things in your life because “food abounds on the table” and that you are is opening up to new knowledge. on the other hand, serving a fish dish to someone else means that you are doing a lot for others, sometimes forgetting your own needs and requirements.
if the fish in your dream is fresh, then you will have vitality and energy to expend. there are many winning ideas that overlap in your mind, all you have to do is grab them and give them substance.
dreams about a fish out of water
if you have dreamed of fish out or jumping out of the water, take this dream as a suggestion that you need to change habits and get out of your normal routine. specifically, then, a fish jumping out of the water could be “an illumination”, an idea that suddenly emerged from your unconscious. also, it can mean that a part of you is struggling to emerge and that you need to give it more space.
dreams about big fish
just as the different breeds of fish that appear to us in a dream have a very specific meaning, different sizes of fish can inevitably imply the manifestation in the dream of the various parts of our daily life. what we are experiencing, in reference to the size of the dreamed fish, can be significantly different. 
so when we dream of fish that are large, enormous or in any case a certain size, those dimensions will most likely have a clear correlation of what is manifesting in the physical and psychic reality. maybe there is something urgent, something “huge”, something big like a change, a transformation or a danger that we must or should face sooner or later.
dreams about black fish
dreaming of white, red, black, orange, blue, pink, yellow, gray colored fish and so on? did you know that identifying a precise color can be important to reinforce the idea that the fish represents?
in dreams the color black as well as the black fish can be the color of protest. you don’t want to be too influenced by the opinions of others andyou cannot accept a certain situation, even if others would like to convince you to do so. you have to react and rebel against something totally unacceptable to you.
this color can be related to the unconscious: black like the darkness given by the lack of light of consciousness. black can also represent the feelings of the unknown, emptiness and lack.
black is also what is secret, hidden, what cannot be understood, the shadow, the mystery, the occult. it can also be the color that expresses anguish and fear.
