 pronounced "tweaker"
the  tweecer provides you the power to modify and substitute a copy of the original eec calibration  to fit your performance modifications, just like the professional tuners.
the  tweecer was the first commercial product to provide a real time data stream along with tuning capabilities for eec-iv supported processors, while also supporting eec-v based vehicles.

the  tweecer will require some study time before diving in too deep. we have a yahoo group that has thousands of registered users, many of whom have been using our product since the beginning.

the tweecer is an invaluable tool which provides you with near the same capabilities of a stand-alone system costing 2-4 times more, but without the hassle of complete harness removal and new sensors!
