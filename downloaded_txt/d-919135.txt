bob todd ~ agency owner
i caught the travel bug early in life, in 1970 traveled with a friend to japan and a month later turned 19 in hong kong. so, my first love was asia and over 7 years i went 6 times around the world, mostly going back to japan, bali, thailand, burma, india and nepal.i spent 4 months traveling alone in india and nepal going from ashram to monastery, ending up in kopan monastery outside of kathmandu to spend three months learning buddhism and meditation.

i really enjoy selling travel and making vacations memorable for clients. i feel very blessed to be in the travel business for so many years and for the opportunity to travel. i have been over 100 times to central and south america. most recently visiting norway, holland, france, spain, croatia, greece, costa rica, guatemala, dominica, cambodia, thailand, nepal, argentina, ecuador and the galapagos islands. i have developed contacts in all these places that make clients' experiences more of an authentic cultural encounter. i am now working with select clients and welcome you to the tribe.

what our clients say








											for the past 38 years, bob todd has tirelessly, efficiently and cost-effectively administered the global travel needs for the artists and staff of blade agency as well as dozens of employees at spinoff software startups. our travel has always been of mission-critical importance! online, agentless âdiscountâ ticketing is simply not an option. our associates deserve and must have a highly skilled, knowledgeable professional advocate when a carrier (all too often) announces that âyour flight has been delayed.â bob todd continues to earn our gratitude, respect and loyalty. we could not have gotten to where we have been without him!!
										

charles steadham






											i wanted to follow-up with you on the trip. it was really great. everything went off without a hitch. the train to seattle was fantastic. thank you for all of your help on the trip. i think the students had a really great time and aside from some minor tweaks, i think this will be the trip we settle on for the near future.

										

dan manley






											we had an amazing time. wow, was it a trip of a lifetime and we were so grateful to have our portion in peru planned. we loved the hotels that were selected - their locations were perfect and the hospitality was wonderful. we enjoyed our guides because they were down to earth and easy to get along with. our favorite city was to visit ollantaytambo. we really appreciated your guidance. i really think we "did peru right" because we saw so much in a short amount of time. again, thank you so much for your guidance and support. this was the best possible honeymoon we could ever have.

										

nicole powley






											for the past 15 years bob todd and world class travel have planned a great variety of trips for my husband and me.

what trips they have been...everything from a two-week peru adventure to a one month scandinavian odyssey.

bob not only knows many locales all over the world, but he also knows the details that are unique to each location. he is an expert at itinerary planning as well as transportation, accommodation and local tips.

bob is a knowlegeable travel specialist who provides invaluable assistance with every facet of a trip.
