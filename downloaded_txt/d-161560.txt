should i stay or should i go now?





tripping down memory lane here ... finding that for most of the people i followed, blogging seems to have taken a back seat to facebook.  quick, easy, mobile ... sound bites instead of a four course dinner.  i must have 8 or 9 blogs that i'm no longer maintaining.  wondering what, if anything, to do about them.

happy new year





hark ... a flashback.

and for good measure, i discovered that somehow i managed to schedule a haircut for the same day (first weds of jan) and time (4:30 p.m.) two years in a row.  and in looking at the above flashback discovered that the weather is the same this year as it was five years ago.

3,073





i've accumulated 3,073 pieces of spam in my gmail account in the last 30 days.  must be a new record.  the only bright spot is that at least all these messages have been filtered out of my inbox and i never had to deal with them.

oprah wants me back





i let my o magazine subscription lapse in 2006.  i had paid for a multi-year subscription and when it ran out i was in cost cutting mode and i just couldn't afford oprah any more.  when she started writing about the things she just couldn't live without and it included $70 sweat pants, i knew she had jumped the shark.  she just wasn't in touch with her peeps any more.guess what?  oprah wants me back!  i got the following offer in the mail today:mmmm, yeah.  i think i'll pass.  even at the reduced 'research' rate of $15 i just can't bring myself to subscribe.  i'll stick with cooking light, thankyouverymuch.

well, hello there!





hi folks - was just making a few entries online and thought i would pop over here and leave a tidbit.  i'm not blogging on a regular basis at all and i miss it in some ways.  i think most of all i miss the freedom it gave me to say what i wanted to say.  but nothing is really anonymous out here on the web, so i really couldn't say anything i wanted to say.  i'm still going through some sort of mid life crisis.  not knowing what i want to do or where i want to go ... i have wonderful people in my life and i'm afraid i'm not appreciating them as much as i should.  i reconnected with high school classmates over the summer and it's been great catching up with them via email and facebook and such.i guess i just need to sort out what's going on in my life.  when i'm not so scattered, maybe i can come back and give you the attention you deserve.  until then, be well.
