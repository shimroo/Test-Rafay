plan a visit.
at kingston baptist church, we believe that people are loved by god more than anything else. our desire is for each person to be the best he or she can. however, it doesn’t stop there.  we realize that it is only when we add the person of jesus christ to our lives that we grow, develop, and live life to the fullest.
we’re not perfect. but we are being slowly perfected in christ – little by little. it means we still have struggles, still have fights, still lose the battle to temptation. 
we hope that you’ll join us, the kingston baptist church christian family, in this exciting adventure.
