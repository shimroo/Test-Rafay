"judy pancoast's velvety voice, phrasing and conversational delivery of a song are all products of years spent listening to the timeless recordings of the carpenters. her passion and joy for the material make judy the perfect vocalist to pay tribute."

now booking summer reading concerts
librarians! judy is now booking summer reading program concerts. she's created a wonderful program for the "color our world" theme entitled judy's box of crayons. this 45-minute concert will feature all-original songs about things that might be pictured in a coloring book, like the ocean, ladybugs, princesses, aliens, and more, and the children will respond with the colors they would use on each picture. no answer is wrong!
judy can also design a concert for just about any summer reading theme you have in mind. contact her to discuss the possibilities at judy@judypancoast.com.

new musical
for the past several years judy has been working behind the scenes writing musicals for the stage, and now her musical for teens "girl on the moon" is ready to be licensed by your school theater troupe or community youth theater. the show is fun and educational, with excellent roles for female-identifying actors, and focuses on a group of girls who get together to watch the moon landing on july 20th, 1969 because one of them wants to be an astronaut. for more information, please click here.

concerts for seniors
judy is now booking shows for older audiences in senior living, rest home communities, and for senior organizations. audiences are enjoying her concerts of popular songs from the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s with a few older standards mixed in, and they love her warm personality as well! reasonable rates make judy's concerts an affordable choice for your facility or group. contact judy today to book a date!

a beautiful thing
dear friends,
i stand for all children, no matter what their ethnic heritage, socioeconomic background or sexual orientation. it pains me to think of the millions of children who are the victim of bullying just because they don't fit "the mold" of the average "normal" person.  i believe that early education about differences will go a long way toward eradicating the ignorance and fear that lead to hatred, bullying and exclusion.  it's time that gay pre-teens and teens are able to live a life free of pain and fear.
toward that goal, i have written, recorded and released a new song entitled "a beautiful thing."  the song tells the story of how i explained to my young daughter back in 1992 that sometimes girls fall in love with girls and boys fall in love with boys. the song was arranged and mixed by grammy® winning producer ricky kej and vanil veigas in india, and the video was directed by nicole girard of rowley, ma.  i hope you will take a few minutes to watch it and, if you are of like mind, please share it.            
thank you very much for your consideration of this important topic.  you will find the video here. 
sincerely,
            judy
