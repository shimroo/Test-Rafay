budapest from on top of the citadella on gellert hill


		i was in budapest in 2007 to shoot 360 degree panoramas of the main set for the movie "hellboy ii: the golden army".
after i finished  the hellboy set i had a free day to run around budapest shooting panoramas.  it was awesome!!
if i’d had a little more time and money i would have chartered a helicopter to do 360 degree aerials, but i had to settle for shooting from a 12’ pole.  :)  i really hope to go back one day to shoot aerials.
oh well - some of the panoramas, like this one from the citadella on gellert hill, practically are aerials!

360 degree aerial panorama of downtown new orleans after katrina.


		aerial panorama of downtown new orleans and the superdome from a helicopter 400 ft. above the pontchartrain expressway at baronne st.  this was shot almost a month after hurricane katrina and three days after hurricane rita, which accounts for the eerie look of the almost empty streets and highways. the greater new orleans mississippi river bridge is normally the fifth busiest toll bridge in the u.s.
(my tale of an earlier disaster - the may 3, 1978 flood:  i lived on the west bank and by the time i woke up my car was half submerged.  i walked from gretna to algiers to check on friends, wading through chest deep water at times, and occasionally even swimming down the street.  at general de gaulle dr. i caught a ride on a semi, standing outside on the steps to the driver’s door.  eventually i had to walk again when the truck stalled and couldn’t be restarted with the batteries under water.)

national museum of the united states air force


		the national museum of the united states air force is the largest and oldest military aviation museum in the world.  more than one million people a year visit the museum’s 17 acres of indoor exhibits.
the museum has over 400 aircraft and missiles in it’s collection, including the wright brothers 1909 military flyer, curtis 1911 model d, the boeing b-17 memphis belle, the boeing b-29 superfortress bockscar (used in the atomic bombing of nagaski) , boeing b-52d stratofortress, lockheed sr-71a blackbird, rockwell b-1b, northrup b-2a, lockheed f-117a nighthawk stealth fighter, and eight presidential aircraft, including the first air force one, which was the plane that took president and mrs. kennedy to dallas the day he was assassinated.
the national museum of the united states air force is located outside dayton, ohio adjacent to wright-patterson air force base at huffman prairie flying field, where orville and wilbur wright developed their airplane and made hundreds of flights.
wright-patterson is one of the largest air force installations, and is the air force’s main research and development base, headquarters of the air force logistics command, and home to the air force institute of technology and the national air and space intelligence center.  which might explain why the fbi was so eager to question us when we landed! :)
