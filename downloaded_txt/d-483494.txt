fertile land is our worlds ultimate limited asset. 

as real estate agents we offer farmland and rural properties in uruguay and paraguay, to a lesser extent in argentina
we are investors in land ourself. we aim to offer properties and investments conservatively and thoroughly.
we can, when needed, offer integrated solutions with legal and administrative services providers involved and we cooperate with a number of local partner realtors and should be able to locate the property most suitable for you


- paraguay arguably offers the best land price/value these days. the highest yielding farms (soya, sugar cane), intensivly operated and close to posessing plants 
currently cost us$4000-9.000 per hectare, cattle ranch land us$500-2500, virgin land, forest covered in the semi arid chaco region with good soil fertility costs us$200-600 per hectare. more on that on our offers land paraguay site.

paraguay has the regions most favorable tax regime, 10% personal income tax, 10% vat.
on the down side paraguay ranks not too high in rule of law or level of state institutions. 

-	uruguay is in many aspects the opposite case. a mature civic society with strong rule of law and a distinctive european air. 
prices are those of a maturer market. with us$7.000-11.000 per hectare for prime crop land (soya, corn, wheat), us$2500-5000 per hectare for good cattle pasture. (which would include some fraction suitable for cropping), operational returns are typically in the 2-3% range. the value purchased is higher though then current returns indicate, farmland in uruguay can potentially yield more and increased land values should lead to further intensification and hence higher yields.
virgin land does not exist anymore in uruguay. 
income is taxed in the 15-30% range, vat being 22%

raw land farmland investment news


buyers of land have a basic decision to make 
-	buy farmland and operate it oneself, be it with more of  a leisure aproach or be it with a professional approach if one has what it takes, or
-	buy farmland and hire a management company to run it, with management fees reducing return to some extent, or
-	buy farmland and rent it out, rental return typically being in the 3% range, requires less attention then any of the above, and income being rather (though not 100%) predictable, or
-	buy raw land that has potential to be converted into farmland (land banking), least attention required, no operational return. 
virgin fertile land is our worlds ultimate limited asset. the purest form of land investment is raw (virgin) land real estate, where no premium is paid for anything man-made (like buildings or an operational farm set up). 
properties with potential for appreciation would have a favorable combination of climate, topograhy, soil fertility, environmental viability for agriculture. 
we list some below offers land paraguay chaco. 
historic estancias - investment in agriculture and gentleman farmer lifestyle combined : in argentina as well as uruguay a few  historic estates, estancias, dating from the 1850s to the 1900s, survive to this day, often quite stately in their appearance, with 100 years old parks, inner courtyards, galleries, heavy wrought iron window bars etc.
it is a rare combination of reasonable agricultural potential and rural gentry lifestyle. 
until recently owners did not ask a premium when an estancia contained stately historic buildings, because they are costly to maintain. this has changed. today a property with a fairly well maintained casco historico (casco meaning farmstead, or if stately, the mansion) and sufficient farmland to make it a viable operation, 300 hectare, grain-cattle combination, should cost us$2m (in both argentina or uruguay).we list some below offers historic estancias.

on operational returns

"1 -2% operational return has usually been associated with agriculture in the uk", writes financial times in todays feb.19th  2015 article uk farmland returns more than mayfair. the headline referred to the steep appreciation of some uk farmland, by 277%, in the decade to 2014. 
germanys handelsblatt wrote a few weeks earlier that rising national farmland values lead to rental returns being at 1,1%, down from 1,3% 10 years ago.

values may be especially high in densely populated western europe and rental returns low, more so then, say, in the us, but still, low returns have been the universal rule in agriculture.

the more stable and eternal the intrinsic value of an asset, the lower the return buyers will still accept. 
in its extreme, gold buyers will accept zero operational/rental return.
farmland may be seen as being half way between gold and commercial real estate.
it shares with gold the fact that nobody can inflate the supply (though gold in the world does increase by some 1% annually thru mining, whereas global farmland rather decreases some 0,1% thru conversion or degrading), it shares with commercial real estate the fact that it is actually of use for something (producing food), you can rent it out and receive money in return.
and indeed farmlands operational/rental return is roughly half way between those of gold and commercial real estate.

then there is the residential/recreational value a farmland property may or may not have, which is diametrically opposite to operational return on investment/roi. what the dollar buys more of the former, it naturally buys less of the latter. 
the tuscany wine estate or the spectacular scenery rocky mountains cattle ranch may cost as much as to just allow for an operational break-even, while the north dakota potato farm may sell cheap enough to generate an roi of 5%, or else nobody would go to live there.
likewise a cattle ranch in benign climate uruguay, that is a 90 min drive from glitzy punta del este may return 1% and the ranch in the paraguay chaco, one of the hottest climate, remotest, most sparsely populated areas on earth may return 7%

and then there is return thru appreciation, appreciation of farmland in uruguay and the paraguay chaco was in the range of 500  700 % in the decade to 2014



on horse meat

as a consumer you should consider to turn to horse meat. it is delicious, tender and lean. but above all, the horse is no ruminant, it does not emit methane while digesting its food the way ruminants do. 

considering to become a cattle rancher in argentina or uruguay, do consider to become a meathorse rancher instead. not that there would money to be made at current stage (2013), but methane emission is an issue mankind must address.
