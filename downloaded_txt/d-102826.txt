a leap forward in handheld scanning
the faro® leap st® is an advanced portable 3d metrology solution that ensures fast time to data and exceptional flexibility. 
get started today







which challenges do you face?










3d metrology 







architecture, engineering & construction (aec) 







public safety analytics 



















 
    										identify quality issues fast
    									


    							the errors and non-conformance issues you don’t catch cause unnecessary waste, rework and unhappy customers. when delays matter, the right inspection technologies help.
    						


improve quality control













 
    										eliminate guesswork in production
    									


    							struggles with alignment and part placement slow down production processes. when speed counts, precision measurement tools are the solution.
    						


bring precision to your line













 
    										bring designs to reality
    									


    							the most innovative designs lose their wow factor if the products can’t be manufactured. when you need to stay ahead of the competition, 3d modeling solutions give you the edge.
    						


enhance your process







 


















 
    										prevent costly construction errors
    									


    							you have to keep your project on schedule and within budget, but measurement mistakes strain productivity. 3d scanning tools bring real-world data to your bim plans to reduce cost, risk and waste.
    						


ensure project quality













 
    										ensure precision during building design
    									


    							manual on-site tape measuring and outdated blueprints of existing buildings can lead to inaccuracies. 3d scans of job sites keep real-world data securely at your fingertips and ensure that your designs can be built.
    						


design with precision













 
    										maintain accurate facility data
    									


    							managing and maintaining a facility is hard if you don’t have accurate data about the building. laser scanning solutions solve the problem by giving you access to an accurate digital twin of your facility.
    						


improve facility data







 


















 
    										catch all the critical details
    									


    							you usually get one chance to collect scene data, and you don’t want to miss anything. but with a 3d scan of the scene, you’ll always have access to all the details.
    						


improve investigation













 
    										clear roads faster and producing better results
    									


    							you’re under pressure to  deliver reconstructions with accuracy and speed. 3d scene scans deliver all the data you need to give clear, accurate and science-backed answers.
    						


improve reconstruction













 
    										present your case clearly
    									


    							evidence presented in the courtroom needs to be clear so a jury can understand it. 3d data and printed models help juries make their decisions.
    						


strengthen your case
