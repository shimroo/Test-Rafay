mood: *sigh*

*sigh*i'm so freaking tired it really isn't even funny. my mom's at work and my dad is playing video games and my sister is... um... watchign tv or playing with barbies or something. i don't know. firgured out something... life is terrible. but i guess that's when it's shaped. my life is waiting. waiting 'til august. when it's sweltering hot outside. it's freezing in here. i'm freaking out. i mean, i'm still at the starting line. we haven't even begun the worst part, where sometimes the first part's last. the first part might be last where i'm going, too, but that's rare. and what about how i'm treated? i mean, i was well treated else where, but you know, when you haven't seen and barely talked to anyone, things can change in the summer. if no one understood that you're probably going to im me (either aim or msn). i dont know.

ehh... well it's 7:33 and my friend just called and she;s coming to my birthday party! wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!! lol. slumber party. fun fun. it's gonna be a scrapbooking slumber party. more fun fun! he he. some of my friends i invited have never been to my house, so that will be interesting. no staying up till 4:30 like i did one time, though. :p but that was fun. we stayed up talking about stuff. i joked with another invited friend and said we would "give each other pedicures and talk about our feelings and boys" which probably won't happen... except the boys! oh, man. i'm sooooo hyper, am i not?

mood: sleepy

*yawn* omfg, i'm feel as if i could just drop in sleep. i can't pay any attention to anything even if you commented at this very second while i sat here. sad, isn't it? oy. i really can't type anymore. i like have exams in a few days and if i keep going like this i'll never make it through. horrid. and one of the teachers that is helping me with this is almost pure evil. i don't make any sense, do i? help me before i fall into a trance...
