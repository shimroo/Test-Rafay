buttock implants can enhance natural body curvatures.buttock implants, also called buttocks augmentation, or butt implants, are usually only performed by a small, select group of plastic and cosmetic surgeons who have performed thousands of these procedures and have the extensive experience required in forming (sculpting), and placing the solid silicone implants that are used in the medical

previously were deficient, and helping them sculpt the select areas they desire. as well, depending on your ethnic background, buttock implants vary in size, style, and surgical technique. what may appear desirable and appropriate for a caucasian patient, may vary considerably in an asian, hispanic, or african-american patient. a buttock lift can be performed sometimes in conjunction with the butt implant procedure.buttockimplants.com is your source for surgeons who are among the best in the field in performing butt implant surgery. while other surgeons perform butt implants, equally

referred to by consumers as gluteal or butt implants, are primarily used for augmentation surgery (enlargement of the buttock region) and occasionally for reconstruction or treatment of asymmetry. buttock implants are usually placed beneath the fascia—or what is termed subfascially—beneath the fibrous lining that encases the buttock muscles. the fascia is commonly looked upon as an encasement for the muscle structure, offering lubrication and protection for the muscle fibers as they expand and contract. the implants may also be placed in the intra-muscular plane (within the muscle such as the gluteus maximus). the intra-muscular plane of insertion is commonly used when the patient is thin and has little body fat. both implantation sites are well tolerated by the body.generally, butt implants are available in 4 styles. the most common design is a round, non-directional implant. these implants can be used in both accepted planes of insertion and provides uniform increased projection including upper pole fullness. non-directional implants virtually eliminate the issue of implant rotation (movement or shifting), which can be more evident in anatomical (directional) buttock implants. directional implants, or anatomical designs, refers to the general shape of the implant, requiring a specific orientation and placement, as they are not dimensionally the same in all directions. and provide an exceptional result when used in the sub-fascial plane to achieve a pre-cast desired symmetry, based on the artistic and aesthetic abilities of your surgeon in achieving the "look" they feel is best for your body style. style 4, is a custom buttock implant with mirrored (left and right) sides. your surgeon, before placement, can manually craft all soft-solid implants.over the past 4 years, gluteal implants have undergone significant improvements. previously, implants used in other body areas were used as gluteal implants. some implants were far too hard and were palpable (could be felt through the skin by others). also, for example, breast implants were frequently used with unfortunate results. breast implants, being gel or liquid filled, often ruptured and deflated at alarming rates. most current implants are made out of "implant grade", soft-solid silicones and the hardness more closely matches the tissue they replace or augment. this provides a more stable implant and offers the natural feel one desires. soft-solid implants, unlike breast implants, do not rupture and deflate. cohesive gel implants have been used for buttock implants, but they have a tendency to rupture and are not currently used in most cases.
