the art of hawaiian hula statehood



transport back to 

downloadable hawaii links sitemap index







hawaiian hula is a dance form accompanied by chant (oli) or song (mele). it was developed in the hawaiian islands by the polynesians who originally settled there. the hula dramatizes or portrays the words of the oli or mele in a visual dance form. there are many sub-styles of hula, with the main two categories being hula 'auana and hula kahiko. ancient hula, as performed before western encounters with hawaii, is called kahiko. it is accompanied by chant and traditional instruments. hula, as it evolved under western influence in the 19th and 20th centuries, is called 'auana, a word that means "to wander" or "drift". it is accompanied by song and western influenced musical instruments such as the guitar, the 'ukulele, and the double bass.

terminology for two main additional categories is beginning to enter the hula "monarchy" includes any hula which were composed and choreographed during the 19th century. during that time the influx of western culture created significant changes in the formal hawaiian arts, including hula. "ai kahiko", meaning "in the ancient style" are those hula written in the 20th and 21st centuries that follow the stylistic protocols of the ancient hula kahiko. there are also two main positions of a hula dance, either sitting (noho dance) or standing (luna dance). some dances utilize both forms.

hawaiian hula is taught in schools or groups called hÄlau. the teacher of hula is the kumu hula, where kumu means source of knowledge, or literally just teacher. often there is a hierarchy in hula schools - starting with the kumu (teacher), alaka'i (leader), kokua (helpers), and then the 'olapa (dancers) or haumana (students). this is not true for every hÄlau, but it does occur often. most, if not all, hula halau(s) have a permission chant in order to enter wherever they may practice. they will collectively chant their entrance chant, then wait for the kumu to respond with the entrance chant, once he or she is finished, the students may enter. one well known and often used entrance or permission chant is kunihi ka mauna tunihi ta mauna.
hawaiian hula dancing is a complex art form, and there are many hand motions used to represent the words in a song or chant. for example, hand movements can signify aspects of nature, such as the swaying of a tree in the breeze or a wave in the ocean, or a feeling or emotion, such as fondness or yearning. foot and hip movements often pull from a basic library of steps including the kaholo, ka'o, kawelu, hela, 'uwehe, and 'ami. there are other related dances (tamure, hura, 'aparima, 'ote'a, haka, kapa haka, poi, fa'ataupati, tau'olunga, and lakalaka) that come from other polynesian islands such as tahiti, the cook islands, samoa, tonga and aotearoa (new zealand); however, the hula is unique to the hawaiian islands.
hawaii's statehood day commemorates hawaii's admission as a state on august 21, 1959. in 1898 the united states annexed hawaii, which was declared as a necessary navy base for the conduct of the spanish-american war. the united states interests coveted the islands for some time. during world war ii, oahu served as the command post for the us operations in the pacific. large portions of hawaii were turned over for the us military bases. after the war, two-thirds of the residents favored statehood.

however, because of the many ethnicities present, there was resistance to hawaii's statehood from the segregated southern states. a primary election took place in hawaii on june 27, 1959, and various statehood propositions received many votes on that day. following the certification of the election results, president eisenhower signed a proclamation on august 21, 1959, declaring hawaii to be the 50th state. this was known as admission day until 2001 and is now known as "hawaii statehood day".
