i am a lawyer with expertise in technology and its governance. while principal identity architect at tucows, i helped to found the  gan. 
previously, strategy lead and counsel to the world wide web consortium (w3c); previously a fellow with yale law school's information
society project, princeton university's center for information technology
policy; the silicon flatirons center for
law, technology, and entrepreneurship at the university of colorado; and
with the berkman klein center for
internet & society at harvard law school.  i was a
visiting fellow with the oxford
internet institute, teaching a joint course with the said business school, media strategies
for a networked world.

i have previously taught at american university's washington college of law,  brooklyn
        law school, and northeastern university school of law,        and served as staff attorney with the electronic frontier foundation. 
        before joining eff, i taught internet law as an adjunct professor at st. john's university
        school of law, and 
        practiced intellectual property and technology
        litigation at kramer levin in new york.

chilling
        effects: i founded and developed the lumen database (formerly, chilling effects clearinghouse), a project to study and combat the ungrounded legal
threats that chill activity on the internet.  in conjunction with the
eff and law school clinics across
the country, we invite recipients and senders of cease and desist
notices to submit these notices for analysis in issue-spotting
faq-style memos and inclusion in our database.  chilling effects offers
resources for internet users who face legal threats, and, through its
collection of data, we hope to analyze the out-of-court effects of
those threats to chill legitimate activity, or, conversely, the extent
to which unlawful activity on the net proves resistant to legal
action. chilling effects has been featured in the new
        york times and boston
        globe, as well as in many academic papers and court filings.

i have served on the board of directors of the tor project, supporting
privacy and anonymity research, education, and technology; the
world wide web foundation; and the open source hardware association. i served on the icann board as at-large advisory
committee liaison.

i helped public interest isp online policy group to win the first case for damages under dmca section 512(f) for abusive copyright claims (opg v. diebold), and defended the privacy of internet users as amicus in verizon v. riaa and charter v. riaa. as amicus in lexmark v. static control, we helped to preserve interoperability, against the threat of overreaching dmca claims.  i led eff's digital television liberation front and the endangered gizmos campaign.

early work at the berkman center focused on the legal issues and
intellectual property questions surrounding free software. i started and led 
the openlaw project, an experiment bringing
the methods of open source and free software development to legal
argument in the public interest.  openlaw's first case, eldred v. ashcroft was
argued before the supreme court october 9, 2002.
the openlaw dvd forum
developed arguments in defense of 2600 magazine's posting of decss code,  
arguing that technological protections for digital media must
accommodate free speech and fair use.  openlaw participants filed an
amicus
brief in the southern district of new york in the decss case universal
v. reimerdes, and i drafted the cryptographers'
amicus brief to the second circuit on appeal.  i worked
with the creative commons project to offer the public a
range of open licenses to promote sharing of creative non-software works.

projects and explorations
lumen database (formerly chilling effects): this pioneering transparency reporting site documents requests to remove online speech and informs internet users of their rights in response. 
cross-cultural partnership template: the partnership template and supporting materials are designed to help collaborators with different backgrounds and interests to converse about their common goals and frame joint work.
endangered gizmos: demonstrating the threat that expansive copyright poses to innovation and creative expression by showcasing some of the devices killed by law. the project included a "build-in" and cookbook to construct mythtv high-definition time-shifting video recorders, one of the endangered gizmos.
openlaw: an experiment in crafting legal argument in an open forum, developing arguments, drafting pleadings, and editing briefs in public, online. non-lawyers and lawyers alike were invited to join the process by adding thoughts to the "brainstorm" outlines, drafting and commenting on drafts in progress, and suggesting reference sources.
icann: from early study of "representation in cyberspace" to service on the board of the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers, helping to shape this multi-stakeholder institution of domain name governance.
tor project: advocate and founding board member for the tor onion-routing secure anonymous communication software.
