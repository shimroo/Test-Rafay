polyethylene wax (pe wax) is polyethylene that is very low in molecular weight. pe waxes are typically used as additives to modify properties of compounds in a wide variety of applications. pe wax can be manufactured directly from ethylene monomer, degraded from higher molecular weight polyethylene or recovered and refined from polyethylene resin production. pe wax can have a range of densities, viscosity and melt points  depending on the linearity and chain length of the backbone ethylene chain and by incorporating other monomers or functional groups onto the polymer. for over 40 years marcus oil has been supplying fully refined polyethylene waxes that have water, catalyst and non wax fractions removed.
