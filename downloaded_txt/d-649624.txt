frequently asked questionsif you have a question that is not answered here, view all faqs or  please contact us.
 





				where can i purchase your products?			




weeks dye works is a wholesale only company and doesn’t sell directly to consumers. to find our products, check with your locally owned needlework shop (lns).






				are your products colorfast?			




most of our thread is colorfast, meaning they retain their original hue without fading or running. to achieve a consistent, colorfast fiber, we top wash our products at high temperature with water and soap, which removes excess dye from the fiber. a select number of our highly variegated colors are not colorfast; these are typically found in our holiday collection.






				can final stitchwork projects be washed?			




while the majority of our thread is colorfast and will not run, we recommend not washing your final project. although every effort is made to ensure our products are run-free, a limited amount of excess dye may still be retained in fibers.






				where do you manufacture your products?			




one hundred percent of our products are hand-dyed in our facility in garner, north carolina.






				how do you develop new colors?			




most of our new colors are generated via designer request or colors inspired by nature. we strive to offer a vast array of products along the color spectrum to make every stitcher’s project unique.
