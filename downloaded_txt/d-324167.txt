this   


site   


endeavours   


to   


provide   


information   


on   


caring   


for   


pet   


chinchillas   


with   


pages   


on   


feeding 


chinchillas,  


their  


general  


care,  


equipment,  


cages  


and  


health  


problems.  


the  


general  


care  


and  


feeding  


of 


your pet chinchilla is very important. 


the  


health  


page  


covers  


the  


more  


common  


problems  


and  


there  


is  


some  


helpful  


information  


on  


hand 


feeding if your chinchilla is sick. 


keeping and looking after a chinchilla is a long term commitment.


there  


are  


also  


photographs  


and  


videos  


of  


chinchillas,  


along  


with  


a  


page  


on  


the  


different  


sounds  


and 


noises that a chinchilla can make. 


i have also included details and photos of the more common colours of chinchillas.


this  


site  


is  


for  


owners  


of  


pet  


chinchillas  


and  


not  


a  


breeder's  


site.  


however,  


i  


have  


included  


some  


basic 


information on breeding with photographs of kits.


along  


with  


information  


about  


the  


general  


care,  


health  


and  


feeding  


of  


your  


pet  


chinchilla,  


there  


are 


pictures, videos  and a page of humour, which i hope you will find amusing.


there is always a competition running, so why not enter and try to win one of the chinchilla prizes.


send a picture of your own chinchilla or pet to display on the site


the cheeky chinchillas challenge has  previously helped to raise funds for chinchilla rescue.


for  


those  


of  


you  


who  


are  


not  


familiar  


with  


chinchillas,  


they  


are  


members  


of  


the  


rodent  


family  


and 


originate  


from  


the  


rocky  


mountain  


range  


of  


the  


andes  


in  


south  


america.  


discovered  


by  


spanish 


explorers  


in  


the  


1500's,  


they  


were  


named  


after  


the  


chincha  


indians,  


who  


through  


necessity  


to  


keep 


themselves warm and have food to eat, used them as a source of food and made clothing with their fur.  


later  


introduced  


to  


europe,  


their  


soft  


luxurious  


fur  


became  


very  


popular  


and  


was  


sought  


after  


so  


much, 


it nearly caused their extinction, as literally millions of chinchillas were killed for their pelts. 


it is very distressing to know that it takes well over a 100 chinchillas just to make one coat!


today,  


hunting  


the  


wild  


chinchilla  


is  


banned  


and  


they  


are  


protected  


by  


the  


convention  


on  


international 


trade of endangered animals.


mr  


m.f.  


chapman,  


is  


responsible  


for  


the  


domestication  


of  


the  


chinchilla.  


he  


worked  


as  


a  


a  


mining 


engineer  


in  


chile.  


in  


1923,  


after  


finally  


getting  


permission  


from  


the  


chilean  


government,  


he  


transported 


11  


chinchillas  


to  


california.  


they  


bred  


successfully  


and  


were  


originally  


sold  


to  


fur  


ranches  


and  


then 


later  


sold  


as  


pets.  


it  


is  


more  


than  


likely  


that  


most  


of  


our  


pet  


chinchillas  


today  


are  


descended  


from  


mr 


chapman's original eleven.


this site is dedicated to 


 whisper


  the chinchilla                                         


always in my heart


i hope you will enjoy your visit and call again soon.
