student and alumni stories










 





                                                        andrew jeter, d.c. (‘93)                                                    

“palmer provided me with the foundation i needed to be confident in my work. the training and expertise i gained there prepared me not just to be a chiropractor, but to be a resource for families looking to improve their health.”




  
  
  
  










 





                                                        cheyanne schmaltz, palmer main student                                                    

“the rigorous curriculum pushes me to grow, while the supportive community of faculty, staff and fellow students makes the journey manageable and inspiring.”




  
  
  
  










 





                                                        makenna maxymillian, palmer florida student                                                    

makenna finished her bachelor’s degree and earned her d.c. degree from palmer just under six years. “at palmer, i’ve noticed that we relate what we learn in every class to clinical practice. they give us examples of what we might see in future practice, which allows us to have a well-rounded idea of what life as a chiropractor will truly be like.”




  
  
  
  










 





                                                         kyle richmond, d.c. (‘21)                                                    

“my favorite part of being a chiropractor is the impact i can have on someone’s health journey. being the person they turn to for pain relief and injury recovery, and seeing them come out the other side feeling better, is incredibly gratifying.”
