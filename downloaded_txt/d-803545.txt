nest protect installed in less than 10 minutes






i've been waiting with excitement for the nest protect
 to ship because any kind of broiling in our apartment results in a fire alarm which triggers all the alarms to go off. then it's frantic magazine swatting and window opening all of which usually occurs when it's freezing outside. the nest protect promised an easy wave to silence the false alarm.



today was the day. amazon prime dropped off two hardwired detectors. the setup was quite simple, i used the qr code to configure the device with the ios nest app. from there it was disconnect the old detector and the mounting ring, switch out the wiring harness, and screw in the new mounting ring. i didn't follow the exact instructions since i ignored the part about powering down the circuit breaker box. i don't recommend this if you haven't worked with live electricity before. next step will be to install the other protect in teddy's room and test both of them. 



from an ease of install, it was a snap. i'm not sure how bright the nightlight feature is but anything to make shutting down a false alarm is worth it with three small kids.

optimum wifi ad overlay





interesting experience this morning at the train station surfing the web. connected on optimum wifi and up pops the ad below, upon tapping you get stats on how much data and how many times you connected in the last 30 days. the big question is wether they will start inserting paid advertising?

our 2012 honda pilot twins plus newborn car seat challenge





with our third child about a month away it was time to prepare for three kids under 2 in our new 2012 honda pilot. we specifically bought the pilot because it could hold four car seats, 3 in the back seat and one in the way back. we used chicco's keyfit 30 carseat and base
 for otto and zachary, but recently they graduated up to a pair of the forward facing britax decathlon. when i went to try configuring the back seat with the two britax and the chicco there simply wasn't enough room.

the configuration we were shooting for was passenger side - [britax] [britax] [chicco] - driver's side.  the base of the britax was too high and too wide for the chicco to securely fit. if you loosened up the anchors maybe they'd fit but we all know that's not acceptable from a safety perspective.

after doing some online research we found the diono radianr100 convertible car seat who's base was lower to the seat which should make getting the twins in easier as well as it is about 17 inches wide vs the 19 inch wide base on the britax.  i just installed all three seats today and thankfully there was plenty of room.
