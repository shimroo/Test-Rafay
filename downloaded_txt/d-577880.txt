mountain dulcimer instructor and performer














tull glazener has been sharing the music of the mountain dulcimer through performances and workshops at festivals and dulcimer clubs throughout the country since 1984.he enjoys adapting all kinds of music to the mountain dulcimer, including aires and waltzes, hymns and gospel tunes, rag-time, traditional/old-time, contemporary, classical, jazz, and more.  let’s just say there is no challenge he isn’t up to, even converting fiddle tunes to waltzes and aires.  he is best known for writing multi-part ensemble arrangements for dulcimer groups.  these can be found in the numerous tab books he has authored. he has also produced a series of “instructional cd packets”, as well as several recordings.   over the years he has contributed articles to “dulcimer player news”. in addition to the mountain dulcimer, tull plays hammered dulcimer and button accordion.  he lives in indianapolis, in where he is the founding director of the ensemble group, “dogs” (dulcimer only group) of the central indiana folk music and mountain dulcimer society.  he is also the leader of the “family reunion string band”,  founded by the late gerry gray.

latest “remembering david” posts






remembering david

























september 2024 - "sarah"






during the 1980s and 1990s, david schnaufer made numerous guest appearances on the popular “nashville now” television show hosted by ralph emery. it was an entertainment/ talk show focused on country music performers, and was watched by millions from all over the country on the nashville network cable channel. shortly after one such appearance in 1987, david received a letter from mrs. wanda parrish, originally from big tyler mt, wv. she included some photos of an old mountain dulcimer built in 1911 by dennis mccown of big tyler mt. as a “courtship present” for mrs. parrish’s great-aunt.


























september 2023 - "i will too" 






around 1983, while splitting time between west virginia and his native texas, david schnaufer made the decision to move to nashville, tn as the next step in his career as a professional dulcimer artist. he was convinced that the dulcimer would fit in well with the recordings that were coming out of “music city” at the time, and aspired to become nashville’s first dulcimer session musician. he also knew that nashville would be the best place to hone his own songwriting skills, and perhaps bring his songs to the attention of music producers, publishers, and artists.


























september 2022 - "all the texas weather has gone to mexico"






in 1984, david schnaufer was finishing up a new recording that was to be released as an ep. an ep ("extended play") was a 7" vinyl album that held a total of 10-15 minutes of music. he had already recorded the two tracks for "side a": "rosie's arms", an original song of his that was to be the title track, and a latin jazz instrumental he had collaborated with alan freeman on called "viper moon". the first cut on "side b" was his arrangement of a traditional fiddle tune called "santa ana's retreat" (one of the tunes he had played when he won the first-ever national mountain dulcimer championship contest in winfield, ks). he needed to decide on one more track to fill out the album, which he had decided to call “rosie’s arms … and other retreats”.


























september 2021 - flop-eared mule






during his years as an adjunct professor at the blair school of music in nashville, one of david’s closest friends, colleagues, and collaborators was jerome “butch” baldassari.  butch was as passionate about the mandolin as david was  about the dulcimer, and they both were true ambassadors and evangelists for  their respective instruments.  one of the many things they had in common  was the unshakeable belief that these instruments should not be "pigeon-holed"  into any one single type of music, and they effortlessly straddled the widest  spectrum of musical genres.


























september 2020 - "brush arbor" 






this month’s tab is an arrangement of another original song by david schnaufer called “brush arbor”. the title refers to the rough, open-sided structures constructed of vertical poles driven into the ground with additional long poles laid across the top as support for a roof of brush, cut branches or hay. they were often used by churches to protect worshipers from the weather during lengthy revival meetings, also known as “camp meetings”.


























september 2019 - "colors"






since 1979, the country music hall of fame and museum has helped students tell their stories through its innovative words & music program. more than 100,000 students have learned to write song lyrics while developing key skills in language arts.   words & music also provides classroom teachers with new resources, tools, and techniques that get students excited about writing.   david schnaufer was one of the artists who participated in that program.   in 1991, he was paired with sharina smith and kelli wiggins, 2 students from one of nashville’s public middle schools who had written a set of lyrics for a song they titled “colors”.  


























september 2018 - "when silence was golden"






this month’s free tab is an arrangement of another one of david schnaufer’s original tunes, “when silence was golden”.  david originally recorded this tune on his 1989 release "dulcimer player", initially available only in cassette tape format. a few years later, he combined that with his other cassette tape album "dulcimer deluxe", and released them as a double-length cd titled "dulcimer player deluxe". david was joined by nashville virtuoso mark o'connor on fiddle for this achingly beautiful arrangement.
