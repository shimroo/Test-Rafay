a to z mysteries
after i wrote the absent author, i knew i wanted to write more about dink, josh, and ruth rose. i looked at those two a's in the title and thought, why not two b's, then two c's? so i began working on the bald bandit and the canary caper. and that's how a to z mysteries were born!

about ron roy





i was born in hartford, connecticut. my parents named me wallace ronald roy, but i shortened the name to ron roy.
i was a shy kid, and spent much of my time studying nature and reading. i loved school and used to win all the spelling bees.
my favorite teacher was mr. ben hancock. he taught me to love books and showed me how to hit a baseball and catch a fish. because of mr. hancock's influence, i decided to become a teacher myself some day.
after college and graduate school, i became a fourth grade teacher. but somewhere along the way i started writing children's stories and sending them to publishing companies. no one wanted to buy my stories, but i didn't give up. each week i would write a story and send it out. each week the story came back with "no, thank you." written on the manuscript.
then in 1978, i sold my first children's book. that was one of the most exciting days of my life. soon i left teaching and became a full time writer.
in 1997 i started writing the a to z mysteries series. now i am working on capital mysteries. millions of children are reading these books, which makes me very happy. but i still remember the day i sold my first book.
