located in newbury park.  sewstudio provides classes for all skill levels in a fun environment. 






every student starts with the same two projects to ensure basic sewing knowledge and skill sets are met before moving on to more challenging projects. the first project is a simple pillow, and then each student will go on to make their beginner bag. students will then use this bag to transport their projects to and from class. as skill level increases, students can go on to more challenging projects.
