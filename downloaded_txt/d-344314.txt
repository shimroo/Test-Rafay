we bring integrity to game-worn jersey collecting.
meigray was formed by barry meisel and bob gray, two sports memorabilia collectors from new jersey who met in january 1997 trading game-worn hockey jerseys. we began selling game-worn jerseys to the sports-collecting public in august 1997.
most of the game-worn jerseys we offer come directly from the pro sports teams with which we sign working agreements. every jersey we sell is registered into the exclusive registry we created to track and protect the authenticity of game-worn jerseys. it's the industry's most powerful stamp of approval.
authenticity is the problem. we are the solution.
