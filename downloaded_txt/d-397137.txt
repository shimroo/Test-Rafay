rcf needs the help of holy priests in chicago

							chicago clergy
							
							we need the help of holy priests in chicago!
						



						by stephen brady
					

						20 years ago, i had a phone conversation with the chicago cardinal. i was told by the cardinal:


								if you keep your mouth shut, you can have a relationship with the catholic hierarchy. i refused his offer.
							

								i was also told that if i did not keep quiet, we catholics in our diocese would be stuck with our predatory homosexual bishop, daniel ryan. i was told that the vatican would not work through the press. once again, we at the roman catholic faithful organization refused his offer and we shouted from the rooftops. bishop ryan was removed!
							



							much of the sexual perversion that has found its way into the hierarchy is centered in chicago. i learned this when we exposed the homosexual clerical website, âsaint sebastianâs angels.â
					

						some clergy have already stepped forward to help us. give us the information we need regarding the homosexual clergy in chicago and, god willing, rcf will again kick down the doors.
					


							to the laity: i need to meet with a core group of chicago catholics to organize to set up a public meeting for rcf. please contact rcf president, stephen brady if you can help.

bishops brom, bernardin and vlazny revisited

we are trying to connect with an informant.
stephen brady is hoping to re-connect with an informant. he was a young man who contacted us in july, 2004 during the lastiri investigation. he lived in the fresno diocese at the time. we will not divulge his name publicly in order do protect his privacy. to the informant from stephen brady: you told me about a priest you knew who adopted several boys and you gave me a few other details about your friendship with him. we want to contact you but are not sure where you're located at present. please contact confidential@rcf.org at your earliest convenience if you are this person!
