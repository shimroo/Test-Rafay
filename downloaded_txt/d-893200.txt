    testimonials



       
  "i could not have asked for a better realtor than eli and cannot recommend him enough! selling our house was extremely smooth. communication was clear, consistent, and his guidance with selling our house was invaluable. eli and his team did not miss a beat and we closed on time during the first few weeks of shelter in place no less."
stephanie l, oakland ca

  "if i could give jules (julie) clark 6 stars, i would! i truly could not have asked for a better leasing agent, and i cannot recommend her enough. jules was professional, knowledgeable, kind, patient, and understanding. her communication was clear, timely, and consistent. i was in an unfortunate living situation, and jules provided guidance and helpful resources to help me get out of my prior lease. she provided above-and-beyond service, and i am so incredibly appreciative of the added time and effort she put in to help make this transition/move so painless and stress-free. she is truly a life saver!  she even gifted me with a thoughtful housewarming gift (a gorgeous orchid!) to welcome me into my new home. if you're looking for a new apartment or home in the sf bay area, reach out to jules!"
camille g, san francisco ca

  "amsi is awesome. sf and the south bay handled our leases to our 100% satisfaction.  they both secured outstanding tenants to move in on the prefect date and made the process easy for us. they know their stuff, are immediately responsive via email text and telephone and are pleasant to work with. gm nathan also provides outstanding service, personally coordinating negotiations and service requests between us and our tenants."
mark b¬†, san francsico ca

  "i had an exceptional experience with julie clarke. i requested a viewing via email and julie responded within a few hours, picked me up from my previous viewing and took me to the apartment. the whole way providing me with points of interest and friendly chat. after viewing the apartment julie then proceeded to then drive me around san francisco, on halloween night! i'm sure she had better things to do, but as a newcomer i really appreciated the tour. it lasted well over 2 hours. julie went above and beyond to make my transition as comfortable as possible. julie even offered to facilitate movers bringing in my furniture as it was during working hours. once i knew i wanted the apartment julie and maureen got all my paperwork done. i saw the apartment thursday and moved in monday.  could not recommend julie enough!!"

  "amsi has been wonderful over the last decade! jennifer berg, is always so responsive whenever i've required repairs in my unit! they're always completed quickly, efficiently and her repair team is top notch! they've gone above and beyond for me including retrieving a coveted item that went down the bathroom drain over a holiday weekend!!! i  highly recommend them.  signed, native sf'er"
l.a., san francisco ca

  "this review is long overdue.  i have been working with eli for more than 4 years for rental of my house and townhouse, for furnished and unfurnished rentals.  he was referred to me by two very discerning friends who also had an excellent experience with him/amsi.  he is professional,  responsive, creative, reasonable, flexible and a problem solver.  i will not hesitate to use him again whenever needed."
