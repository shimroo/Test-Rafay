why does everything feel different now?your weight is creeping up and it doesn’t matter that you’re eating less and working out more.what’s going on?



weight gain in menopause is different




during perimenopause and menopause your estrogen levels start to decline.according to research published in the journal of clinical medicine (2019), this drop in estrogen affects how your body:stores fat (especially around your middle)processes sugar and carbohydratesmaintains muscle massregulates hunger and fullness signalsyou’re not alone, and more importantly…                                              you’re not doing anything wrong!
















why traditional diets fail & what actually works




calories matter, but the low-calorie diet your friend swears by may be making matters worse. research from the north american menopause society shows that restricting calories during menopause can: slow down your metabolismincrease stress (which causes weight gain)makes insulin resistance worseleads to muscle loss
