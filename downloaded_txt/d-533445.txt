‚Äúour stay at the stanford inn was absolutely the best vacation experience that we had in many years. the rhythms of the stanford inn, your very tasty, nourishing breakfasts, your scrumptious teas, your dedicated staff, unrivaled amenities and the high level of comfort has left us longing to return. the healthful, restorative, serene experience that you have both devoted to providing is unsurpassed in our experience. we also enjoyed interacting with jeff and it made it hard for us to depart and we wished that we had stayed longer. there are now a lot more reasons to return to the extraordinary place that you both have created as a joint labor of love, creativity and excellence and it is not only reflected in the surroundings, but also the warmth radiated by returning guests. we are planning on returning by the fall.‚Äù
