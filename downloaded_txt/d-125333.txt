"over the last 60 
          days, you have supplied me with a wealth of information. i have taken 
          the last 2 months off to devise a marketing plan to implement that should 
          totally change my thought process
i truly see myself making 
          a high 6 figure income within 3-4 years, and you have been a driving 
          factor in my thinking. no more roller coaster ride, just steady $$ every 
          month.
thank you so much for all 
          your help, and i will definitely be a customer for life. this is only 
          a start!!"

"doing business over the internet 
        is difficult usually with no personal service, however, kamrock publishing 
        provided the support and personal service which made this a gratifying 
        experience.

        i have no reservation in highly recommending the services of kamrock publishing. 
        it is evident that you are committed to your customers and their satisfaction.

        thank you for going above and beyond the call of service and support."

elijah graham, richmond va
"i am glad that i was able to make the committment 
        to your programs. for my sake, i do hope that not many bankers or brokers 
        buy your systems though...it would make my job tougher to compete. i am 
        the only mortgage banker/broker in my immediate area that truly defines 
        "amazing service". thanks a million.
michael locker, duluth, mn
"thank you so so much for sharing your experiences 
        for all of us in the mortgage industry. i am a new loan officer, and by 
        reading your materials i know that you have cut years off of my learning 
        curve. all my education is going to come from you because i want to do 
        it right the first time. thank you for not forgetting where you came from 
        and all the help you offer."
