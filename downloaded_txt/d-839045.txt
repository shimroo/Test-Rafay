under where?





i got over excited in baby gap today. went right up to the clerk and told him i was looking for "big girl underwear." he sort of stuttered, and it took me a couple of breaths before i realized that the toddler balancing on my hip wasn't really cluing him in too well. "for her," i said. we headed home, got the new underwear on, and within  20 minutes had the first miraculous big girl moment we've ever had in our bathroom. purchasing underwear is a beautiful, beautiful thing.

pickle





bb learned about death this weekend. our beloved pickle, aka the oldest cat in the world, passed away on friday. it was news met with mixed emotion by bb's senior relatives who have been plying pickle with thyroid pills, pureeing her cat food in the food processor, and rigging elaborate ramps and puppy pee-pee pads to her litter box. which is not to say we won't miss her. we will. after 21+ years, it's sad not to hear her little voice when it's dinner time. or several hours from dinner time. or whenever someone enters the kitchen. but she lived a good life, and my parents were amazing when it came to keeping that little cat happy. crushing pills twice a day and providing her with electric heating pads even in summer. pickle was not only the oldest cat in the world, but the luckiest.when bb asked, "where's picky?" i sat down on the floor and pulled her into my lap to tell her picky was gone. "she went away?" asked bb. and i used it, the "d" word. "yes, honey. she died. that means she can't come back, but we can remember her and that's how we can keep loving her." so we remembered things about pickle. like she liked to sit by the heater. and she was nice. and liked to be petted. and she liked to eat. we talked about all the places pickle liked to eat in great detail. at which point, bb decided it was time for a snack, and merrily made her way to the refrigerator.later, when rooster and i googled "what do jews tell kids about death" (and after scrolling through all the nazi references), we found a nice ask-a-rabbi article that gave us hope that we had presented the right thing to bb at this big moment in time. according to rabbi jeffrey goldwasser, "jews believe that death does not mark the end of a person's existence. the people we love who have died continue to live in our memories, and in god's awareness." which is a really lovely way to think of death, i think. so here's to you, pickle. may your memory be for a blessing.

about me





l'chicken


san francisco, california, united states
an avid recipe contester, the chicken spent maternity leave madly entering the pillsbury bake-off. she got in, got disqualified, and is now passionately searching for another life goal. as such, contesting production has slowed but will never, never die.
