one of the biggest reasons i wanted to be part of the la salle community and its honors program was because of the chance a small school provided to build personal, meaningful connections with faculty. in my time at la salle, i have been so lucky to build relationships with several faculty members which has given me opportunities, with their support, to push my horizons, expand my knowledge, and build my resume.
