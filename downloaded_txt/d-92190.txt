           alchemy works is a metaphysical supply shop serving spiritual seekers of all kinds, as well as those who appreciate unique plants, natural fragrances, and handcrafted incense and oil blends. since 2000, we've been a small, owner-operated business focused on offering ritual supplies and carefully selected botanical ingredients. many of our products have roots in ancient and modern earth-based spiritual practices, primarily centered on western witchcraft and sorcery. we're also gradually expanding to include items for buddhist practitioners. whether you're a witch, occultist, mage, healer, kabbalist, pagan, buddhist, or a follower of mystical traditions, we hope you'll find something meaningful here.



            we handcraft our magic oils, incenses, inks, and essences in a consecrated ritual space, paying close attention to seasonal, planetary, and astrological influences, as well as our mental and spiritual states during preparation. our recipes are based on personal blends or historically accurate formulas drawn from sources like the ebers papyrus and dioscorides' materia medica. although ancient texts reference items like "bat's wing" or "dove's blood", many of these are coded names for herbs used to safeguard esoteric knowledge—so most of our products are vegan-friendly, with only a few containing honey or beeswax.


              we love the natural world and honor the interconnectedness of all life on this planet. the enchanting aromas of plants and fungi, which co-evolved with animal life, can activate psycho-physical processes that promote self-healing and well-being, while deepening our connection to nature and the unseen. these natural fragrances link us to a lineage of magic workers and healers whose knowledge has been passed down through the ages.
many of our seeds are home-grown or wild-harvested, and we are diligent in sourcing botanical ingredients we cannot gather ourselves. our ritually crafted products contain no artificial components—no fragrance oils, dyes, chemical extenders, petroleum-based substances, parabens, phthalates, or synthetic chemicals. as spiritual practitioners, we understand the importance of using high-quality, ethically sourced materials. good ingredients are the foundation of powerful magic, and we only sell items that meet our own high standards for ritual practice.

alchemy works does not offer readings, spells, healings, or any other services. instead, our website provides a wealth of information to support your spiritual practice, from folklore to planetary correspondences. we encourage you to experiment and create your own ritual blends, which is why we offer herbs, resins, and essential oils. while we provide examples of how our products may be used in witchcraft, magic, or other spiritual paths—both in contemporary practice and historically—we do not guarantee metaphysical outcomes. we take great pride in crafting our magical supplies, but the real work is up to you.

in an age where distraction drives attention, we see our website as a form of resistance. yes, it's old-fashioned, with lots of text—some patrons affectionately call it "retro"—but it invites you to slow down and connect with what inspires you. we hope the site evokes the atmosphere of a dimly lit occult shop or a beloved used bookstore, filled with dust and potential. though alchemy-works.com is older, it remains a treasure trove of valuable information that has helped many practitioners deepen their spiritual paths—whether they made a purchase or not. we hope it will do the same for you.  top
