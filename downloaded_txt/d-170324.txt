the cybercrime security network (csn) is a non-profit organization funded in mississippi through a ms voca (victims of crime act) grant and partnered with the united way - capital city. csn's mission is to provide victims of cybercrime a resource to help report cybercrimes correctly as well as to help track and record data of these crimes for law enforcement agencies. csn believes that reporting cybercrime isn't just beneficial for the victim; being able to track these crimes makes our whole society more resilient. the more national reporting data that we have around this, the higher chance law enforcement has to catch the criminals and also to decrease cybercrime in general. due to this, csn has partnered with mississippi state university's national strategic planning and analysis research center (nsparc) to develop data gathering and sharing services, including building a national reporting form.

"balance the scales with internet sales" - a tool kit for municipal officials

with the recent u.s. supreme court ruling, south dakota v. wayfair, states are now allowed to tax internet sales for companies without a nexus in the state. with this result, there will be a significant increase in use/internet sales tax collected by the state of mississippi. we believe that this revenue needs to be shared with our cities and towns.
we have created a tool kit with various items your city can use to encourage state legislators to include meaningful funding for cities and towns in any legislation for infrastructure funding that might be considered during a special session. among other items in this tool kit, you will find a sample resolution template that you can use at your town's next board meeting to formally announce your support of this campaign!
