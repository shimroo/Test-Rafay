there's a nice, huge story on the time magazine website about philadelphia television in the fifties. it mentions our website and draws from our material. author richard corliss refers to this site as "invaluable...a trove of early tv memories for delaware valley nostalgiaholics."



our encoding of audio and video has been upgraded for clearer, sharper and less choppy video with better sounding audio. we are using the latest technology and this may require you to download (it's free) the latest version of the real player and/or the latest version of the windows media player. items previously on our website will still work with older versions. all items will play on the most current. once you download the latest free player, you still may be required to download older codes for everything to work. some of our older files of our audio and video rolls. that is, it goes from one file directly into the next segment. this was done for faster loading.
