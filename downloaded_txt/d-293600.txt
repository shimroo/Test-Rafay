circus summer camp - 2025
your children will jump for joy when they learn you've signed them up for circus summer camp, and you'll do a flip or two when you see how much fun and learning your children are experiencing!
circus camp is where your children create wonderful memories, make new friends, and experience a wide variety of circus skills. campers at any skill levels are welcome! ages 5 and older including teens.
throughout the day our highly trained counselors describe which circus skill they will be teaching for that "act", and your child picks the one they would like to learn! the younger 5-6 year olds have a more structured day, and we make sure they get to participate as much as they're comfortable with.

interactive: your children get to participate in real circus activities - including low trapeze and tightrope, juggling, magic, acrobatics, even throw a pie in a clowns face!
entertaining: everyday we present a live show by circus performers to entertain and inspire your children.
safety: we emphasize constant diligence to make sure your children are safe.
