imp e-mail received re: texas millionaire offers support to charity victims of bernard madoff





((((( is there a catch? catch-all? save-savior? )))))from: "schwartzmedia@gmail.com" to: abbebuckpr@aol.comsent: tuesday, december 30, 2008 9:23:13  amsubject: texas millionaire  offers support to charity victims of bernard madoff         for immediate releaseschwartz  mediacontact sid schwartz  cell 917-863-1155or  office 646-781-9469 texas millionaire offers  support to charity victims of bernard madofftexas millionaire and magnetic sponsoring president mike  dillard is coming to new york city in the next several months to assist the  not-for profit foundations that lost millions of dollars in the alleged ponzi  scheme by investment counselor bernard madoff.  dillard is an internet  marketing guru who teaches people how to develop leads and make money on the  internet. he wants to donate his time and internet expertise to those charities  that were hurt in the ponzi scheme. he believes the methods used by barack  obama's presidential campaign to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in small  donations from millions of people on the internet can be used by charitable  organizations. "the old saying of 'if you give  a man a fish you feed him for a day but if you teach a man to fish, you feed him  for life' has never been more true in today's weak economy," said dillard, who  was a waiter in austin, texas just two years ago before making his fortune  online. "the internet is a powerful new way to fish, that charities should be aware of,"" he said. dillard said institutions like the picower foundation  that lost a billion dollars with madoff's company and the betty and norman levy  foundation which also is in deep financial trouble due to the former nasdaq  chairman, and north shore university hospital, which also lost money, can be  made whole again.    dillard said the power of the  internet and it's fund-raising capabilities can be taught. he's reaching out  this week, by sending letters, to more than 500 charities and their executive  boards in the new york metro-area to offer his services.to schedule an interview with mike dillard, contact  sid schwartz at 917-863-1155 or  646-781-9469. # # #

this is a topic for oprah!  now you know why i am not a "crackberry"





 ---and i reckon that i like being married. very married. and a biker babe. yes, a harley riding, vodka-drinking, steak-eating, sinatra fan. i do not own a blackberry. not a curve. not a pearl. not an 8800. ((( memo to lynn --valerie---lisa---hope--- girls, i feel sorry for you. you are -- crackberry's. ))) i believe that they are counter-productive - although their current advertising campaign will tell you the opposite is absolute fact. do not buy that hype! it does not help you if it becomes addiction.in fact, here is what was written about yours truly in washington woman:she writes two pr blogs that instruct clients. she uses two cell phones but draws the line at a blackberry. “if i had one, i’d never stop. finally, i have it right—it’s important to have daily family time and ‘abbe time.’ i had a bad case of burnout—i was such a perfectionist that i ended up redoing things. you want to be available and accessible, [but] 24/7 is impossible.”here's the story - and it is a doozie!http://wcbstv.com/technology/blackberry.pda.sheraton.2.818223.htmltechnology can be 'berry, 'berry addictive':study finds that 35 percent of blackberry and pda users would choose their device over their spouse (!)scott rapoport reporting / new york (cbs) ― of all the possible things that can come between spouses, you can now add blackberrys -- or more precisely -- blackberry addiction to the list.a new study reveals blackberry's are becoming -- among other things -- the 800-pound gorilla in the bedroom.'berry, 'berry, addictive?"i live with it. i can't live without it," one new york city resident told cbs 2 hd.yeah ... there's a reason some call 'em ... crackberrys.but are you having a love affair with yours?"i am on my blackberry more than i see my boyfriend," one woman said.the study of 6,500 traveling executives says 35 percent of them would choose their pda over their spouse."that's a tough call," one said."oh you don't want to go there," another added.and apparently that attitude is being seen in the sack. of those polled, 87 percent said they bring their devices into the bedroom.another 84 percent check their e-mails just before they go to sleep. another 80 percent check them in the morning as soon as they get up."it can actually ruin relationships," said dr. susan bartell, a psychologist and relationship expert. bartell said couples should be interfacing more, but with each other."people are so focused on their pdas, they're not focusing on what might be going wrong in their relationships," bartell said.of those polled, 62 percent said they love their blackberry or pda, and most of them said it makes their life more productive. however, experts suggest, for the sake of your relationship, you might occasionally …"turn it off, spend some time with your partner. have a real relationship with a living human being," bartell said.the study was done by sheraton hotels. among its other findings: more than three quarters of those polled say their gadgets give them more quality time with friends and family... and help them enjoy life more.go figure.(© mmviii, cbs broadcasting inc. all rights reserved.)

starring stockard channing





back in 1987, i was 31. i was singing in nyc. i was stopped on the street, mistaken for stockard channing a lot.i thought about susan stockard channing today. she played "an abby" (the first lady) on the west wing. she and i have never met. we are nothing alike except we have had serial marriages, and have settled in long-term relationships (but i married mine) she kept the name "channing" as i kept the name "buck" from my first marriage.stockard channing is now 64 years old. amazing. here she is at my age, in 1996:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zggn8tzmkr4&feature=relatedand on various talk shows:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imhbgryoir8&feature=relatedtalking about the ultimate freelancer - the actor.six degrees of separation -- you betcha!# # #

and the word of the day is "chutzpah". lee israel has it in spades - and will be making more money from it!





--isn't forgery a crime?and she wrote my favorite two childhood bios: "miss tallulah bankhead' and "kilgallen" and exposed the kilgallen = kennedy assassination! lee israel was the biographer's biographer.but why, what led her to, and meticulously "how" she did the forgeries is a wild thing--why, with my old remington #7 i could do that to, methinks!but i blog, which is what i yam. (lol)the book is called "can you ever forgive me?" and the title is taken right out of dorothy parker! --or lee israel writing in dottie's voice? (see letter above) -- what- ever! but the ny times book review says "now, all these years later, she’s written a slender, sordid and pretty damned fabulous book about her misadventures." so i must go to border's with my discount coupon and buy it to-day!about the book:description: an audacious memoir by a down-on-her-luck writer, "can you ever forgive me?" is israel's story of the astonishing literary forgeries she conceived and successfully executed for almost two years.now, think about this: nobody made that movie that has been in my mind's eye for 20 years of mary steenbergen playing miss dorothy kilgallen (now she is too durn old!) but a movie can be made of miss israel's book as a fraud! doncha just love it!oh, oh, yes, let's do that! let's! xxx's!# # #

thank you, maureen orth, (author, "the importance of being famous"). i believe that everyone needs more than fifteen minutes. they need fifteen months - no, make that fifteen years of fame - or infamy. many cannot live without it!

i am a communications strategist. i have also been referred to as a government agency liaison,  
account manager and a client relationship executive. i do try hard to get "show-biz" type high-viz "pr" for my people, moreover those who are not in the arts (politicos eat this stuff up --and say, spinning is my business, even in a (former) low-key button-down market like dc is -- or was!) see: www.highviz.net for more about "the day job"---i am just happy to have decent customers who trust my recommendations and reap their benefit.
thanks!
abbe b.
ps: all sister blogs are listed in google, bing, blogspot, redduit, linkedin, facebook, twitter--did i miss anybody?
