if you buy somewhere else,you paid too much! 
 
allergy, chemical sensitivity and 
      asthma sufferer's choice! the hepa/gas phase 
      air filter reduces significantly more contaminants and odors faster than 
      austin air, honeywell, 
      friedrich, enviracaire, hamilton beach, 
      bionaire, aireox, 
      norelco, holmes, 
      alpine, allertech, blue air, care 2000, americare, electrostatic, ionizer, electronic, ozone 
      generators and other brand name air filters.*
aller air is simply, the best 
      air cleaner.
solid steel construction does not 
      add harmful by-products to your indoor environment; unlike plastic models. 
      the most true hepa filter media, the largest media capacity, ultra-violet 
      light options, and widest range of media adsorbent choices of any air 
      cleaner in its class ensures the most effective removal of air-borne 
      contaminants available.
it is the most powerful air cleaner 
      available.
it has 3 speeds; on high it has 
      a 400 cubic 
      feet per minute airflow with a 1:1 air exchange ratio for the most "air 
      drawing power" and the largest (124 square feet) true medical hepa filter 
      in any class. it also has the most gas/odor adsorbing media for chemicals, 
      odors and fumes. power consumption is far less than competing brands. why 
      pay extra money when you don't have too? ground shipping included. 10-year 
      warranty, 30-day money back guarantee.
 
this is the #1 rated air cleaner/ everyone is talking 
      about. if you are serious about your health, get the 
      best!
we used to recommend 
      austin air 
      for over ten years, until we found a more effective and versatile 
      hepa/odor air cleaner

at a much better 
      price!
more airflow 400-1,000 
      cfm at 1:1 v.s. 10:1 for 
      austin 
      air,

      carbon and zeolite, or custom filters made to order
a bigger hepa filter (120 
      sq. ft),
less electricity 
      cost,
a prefilter you can 
      remove &vacuum from both sides
