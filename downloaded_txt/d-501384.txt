restart. renew. rebuild.





i finally have my life back. the life addiction has stolen from me.  i value the relationships with my family, my finances and my overall well being again.  seeking recovery is scary, learning how to live day by day without your crutch is very intimidating. make that first step and you will wonder why you did not do it sooner. it saved my life, saved my marriage, it has saved me!
mobile metro treatment center


with taking my buprenorphine each day and meeting with my counselor and attending clinic groups i have been able to see clearly and think clearly. i have attained sobriety and acquired a full-time job, a home, and i am in the process of getting my daughter back from my parents. i would have never been able to do this without the support of concord metro and my local aa groups.
concord metro treatment center


since being in recovery i have been able to put my energy where it belongs. i have been able to revive my business and put more time and effort into my family. i have also been able to find my calling and work towards my goals with a clear mind. i'm able to be a mother and a wife again without fear. my family supported my decision and continue to help me through this so i'm not going to let them or myself down.
