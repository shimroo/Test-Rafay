chris cheney and scott owen met as far back as primary school while both were attending to jells park. both favored 1950s rockabilly and everything from the stray cats, brian setzer orchestra to some newer acts like green day and the whole punk rock revolution launched in california in the early nineties. the core of the band maintained its unity even when drummers came and went.
