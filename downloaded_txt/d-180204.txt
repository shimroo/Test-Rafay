what works for stubborn aches, pains, and injuries?

and what doesn’t? and why? painscience.com explores the surprisingly weird science of many kinds of chronic pain and injury, from fibromyalgia to runner’s knee. the site is a library of a couple deep-dive articles for both patients and healthcare professionals, informal but heavily referenced and constantly updated for 20 years. like it says on the tin, there’s a pro-science bias here, and quackery is kicked to the curb. more.
why the salamander? more mascot than logo, the salamander’s astonishing regenerative biology is a symbol of healing. more.

ruh roh! one way or another, javascript is not working in your browser… which means this form will not work, not even a little bit. hell, most of the internet breaks without js these days. this is a rare problem, but it is sometimes caused by browser extensions, especially ad blockers. if you can’t figure out how to fire up the js again and make this warning go away, no big deal: just contact me and i’ll send you a login link (the same thing this form sends).
