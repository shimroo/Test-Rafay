our missionthe animal refuge center is a 501c3 non-profit animal welfare society. we are a non-euthanasia organization dedicated to caring for all owner surrendered cats and dogs we’ve received into our care.as the largest no-kill shelter/sanctuary in sw florida, we provide interim shelter and medical care to cats and dogs who were once pets, and through no fault of their own, found themselves homeless, injured, or abandoned.  our philosophy avows that once an animal is accepted into our care, it will not be destroyed to make room for another. we place approximately 500 dogs and cats per year into responsible, loving homes through direct and indirect adoptions.  arc’s on-going mission is to provide community education as to the needs and care of animals, and public awareness regarding the importance of spaying and neutering their animal companions, with the ultimate result being the elimination of euthanasia.if you are looking to adopt, surrender, tour, etc - please click here.





















a letter from the presidentwhat an amazing year it has been for the animal refuge center!  2024 has been colored by renewal, heartwarming generosity, amazing teamwork, and the end of an era.we’ve made many improvements to our infrastructure this year.  our small cat “isolettes” are undergoing major renovations as well as simpler but necessary upkeep to a few of our larger cat buildings.  perhaps the most significant upgrade we’ve made was the replacement of all ten of our first-generation lodges with our brand new hurricane-proof design.  this massive update was made possible by the amazing mccabe-walls family foundation.  this remarkably generous foundation was started by husband-and-wife veterinarian dr. micki mccabe and dr. chuck walls.  their organization, “believes that animals deserve to be treated with kindness, compassion, and proper medical care.  therefore, (they) support organizations that provide shelter, medical care and rehabilitation for animals and their families in need.”  after researching arc for some time, they clearly came to the conclusion that the animal refuge center accomplishes all of the above.  we are forever grateful for this wonderful gift!of course, the west coast of florida faced not one, but two, major storms this year.  as always, arc staff and volunteers banded together to prepare for the worst.  trees and brush were trimmed, all loose items throughout the property were secured, and multiple emergency animal housing areas were set up on the off chance the shelter was subject to surge.  arc was all the more ready this year with the addition of two new whole-building generators, providing emergency power to both the brighter beginnings adoption center and the sharon bodenhafer critter clinic.  we were fortunate to only lose power for a short while, but it was very comforting to know that our residents could be kept cool and comfortable in the event of a protracted loss of power.  as always, our animals were kept safe throughout the night by 3 members of staff willing to ride out the weather on property.  to all our volunteers and staff, arc’s board extends its sincere thanks!finally, we come to the end of an era.  on the off chance you missed the newspaper stories or the recent 35th annual starlight auction, it was announced that arc’s treasurer, betty hughes, was stepping down from the shelter’s board of trustees.  if you’re even remotely familiar with arc, chances are, you’ve met betty.  she has been a fixture at arc for nearly 26 years.  she has been singularly responsible for much of the organization’s growth and success.  to me personally, she has been a mentor, supporter, and friend for the entirety of my nearly 20 years on arc’s board.  the animal refuge center would not be what it is today, without her guidance, generosity, financial savvy, and absolute, undying commitment to our animals and staff.  i hope she won’t stray too far, and i and the rest of arc’s board, wish her the absolute best.there are some truly exciting things on the horizon for arc.  stay tuned over this next month or so!  as always, my sincerest thanks to those that continue to support this unique and wonderful organization.  we couldn’t do it without you!very sincerely yours,wayne leinen, jr.arc board president
