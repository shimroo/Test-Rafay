what is the scottishstoryline method?








storyline is a structured approach to learning and teaching that was developed in scotland. it builds on the key principle that learning, to be meaningful, has to be memorable, and that by using learner's enthusiasm for story-making, the classroom, the teacher's role and learning can be transformed. storyline is a strategy for developing the curriculum as an integrated whole.it provides an opportunity for active learning and reflection as essential parts of effective learning and teaching. at the same time it develops in learners a powerful sense of ownership of their learning.

testimonials















jen norman
my training with storyline design has been a transformative and enlightening experience. the methodology is incredibly engaging and joyful, offering a unique way to weave content through a cohesive narrative. the first half of the course allowed me to experience learning through the storyline firsthand, where i constructed the context for the storyline, moved through the content, and participated in culminating projects. this immersive experience as a learner was invaluable.  in the second half of the course, i was placed back in the teacher's seat and learned how to design my own storyline. having recently been in the learner's perspective significantly enhanced this part of the training. the course provides practical skills and strategies to integrate playfulness and a variety of subjects—including social studies, science, the arts, health, sel, and ela—into my teaching practice, all while maintaining high rigor and student expectations.  i highly recommend the storyline design course to any educator looking to make their teaching more dynamic and student-centered. the approach promotes active participation, holistic learning, and a deep connection between different content areas. this training has not only equipped me with new teaching tools but also reignited my passion for education by showing how joyful and meaningful learning can be.

having this opportunity to dig deeply into the the framework of storyline has been so incredibly helpful.  i feel much more comfortable about understanding the "why" behind the structure of things now, and am incredibly thankful for this professional development opportunity. if you are a storyline teacher or administrator and have never had this introduction training then you need to find a way to get to the next one offered! this is easily one of the best trainings i have taken in a very long time.











jenny brouhard
i thoroughly enjoyed the week long storyline i training in bend, oregon. i loved the experience of being the learner and experiencing a storyline experience from that perspective. then being guided through the storyline creation and development process with guidance from such knowledgeable others.











jennifer fetrow
i took my first storyline class in 1995 and can remember how transformative it was to learn about this method. even after decades of experimenting with storyline, this class was very useful. i learned so much! i know that sl is the best way for kids to learn. our brains are wired to make sense of the world through stories. 











kimberlee moore
i found the training to be extremely valuable.  having us be the students for the first few days immersing us in what that looks like from a different perspective was very helpful.
