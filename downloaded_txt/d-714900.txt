dune abstract 20250130-171 . death valley. 2025





dune. death valley. 2025.every visit to the mesquite flat dunes in death valley fills me with wonder. as i was walking out into the rolling fields of sand this year, i found myself wondering if i would see anything new after 40 years of coming here. it was such a naive thought. the quiet predawn light soon took me to another place, one of tranquility and peace. a gentle sensuality became clear in the soft light. as the sun rose, as always, the lines became sharp, the design abstract, and all questions of what new i might see evaporated. i must be “in the world” where the natural seeing is continuously renewed. there are many ways of being in the world, but this experience reminded me of why i keep coming back.i’m offering a 14-inch-wide print of this photograph for $195. larger prints can be ordered. this print at this price is offered through february 28. i'll be taking orders until then, and shipping them out by march 15, 2024. the image reverts to its normal price after that, $800 for an 11x14, $1500 for a 16x20 print.

human marks. lakeside estates aerial, avondale, az (west phoenix). 2015





lakeside estates aerial, avondale. az 2015.flying home after a few weeks out on a canon speaking trip and southwest explore, i was struck by this strange geometry. it ran so counter to the landscape i had seen driving through texas, colorado, new mexico and arizona. i almost felt like i was an alien visiting another planet other than the one i had been wandering through.

flora and form: from orchid gardens to digital lab



apr 24, 2025 – apr 26, 2025



workshops


have you ever visited a nursery or greenhouse, and thought about how great it would be to capture the beauty, color, line and form of an orchid, or unusual succulent that inspires you and preserve it in a photograph? access can be hard, and using a tripod can be impossible and not allowed. perhaps you hesitated because you felt the need for instructional help with the technical, aesthetic and compositional framework to make it happen. this class is a real chance to overcome all of these challenges. come join us.

golden gate park digital field photography class



apr 28, 2025 – apr 29, 2025



workshops


after a few years of working intensely on my urban eden golden gate park project, i am excited to offer a two-day photographic workshop in this complex and beautiful landscape. now 150 years old, this park symbolizes parkland engineering and the earth itself taking its own course of life and fecundity. the park will be explored over two days with a blend of photographic opportunity, assistance, and my growing knowledge of its own back woods. this springtime weekday workshop will avoid some of the weekend crowds.
