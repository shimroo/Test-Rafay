a 529 plan is a flexible tax-advantaged savings plan designed to help families pay for college. earnings on 529 investments accumulate tax-free, and distributions are tax-exempt if they’re used for qualified education expenses including room and board, tuition, books, and much more. 
non-qualified withdrawals are taxable as ordinary income to the extent of earnings and may also be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty.
