why owning a motorcycle is a great choice

there are many reasons why owning a motorcycle is both practical and enjoyable:

a 125cc motorcycle is much cheaper to run, service, tax, and insure than a car.
parking a motorcycle is far easier, especially in crowded cities. plus, multiple motorcycles can fit in the space required for a single car, making it ideal for garages.
commuting on a motorcycle allows you to bypass traffic, use narrower roads, and enjoy a more direct route.
motorcycles are more affordable to purchase, with some models starting as low as £1999 for a 125cc motorcycle.
riding a motorcycle offers a sense of freedom and adventure, connecting you to the outdoors in a way cars cannot.


why choose a 125cc motorcycle?
our 125cc motorcycles come equipped with four-stroke engines designed for optimal power and fuel efficiency. whether you're navigating city traffic or enjoying open-road cruising, these motorcycles offer a perfect blend of agility, speed, and safety. with top speeds of 70 mph, our 125cc motorcycles are ideal for daily commutes or long rides. every model also includes lockable under-seat storage and a 5-speed gearbox for a smooth, versatile riding experience.
can you ride a motorbike on a car licence?
in the uk, you can ride a motorcycle on a car licence under certain conditions. if you hold a full car licence, you can ride a 50cc moped (restricted to 28mph) without taking the motorcycle cbt (compulsory basic training). however, to ride a larger motorcycle up to 125cc, you must complete the cbt. once completed, you can ride a motorcycle up to 125cc with l-plates but cannot carry passengers or ride on motorways. this is a great way for car drivers to experience motorcycles without a full licence.

at motorcycle.co.uk, we offer an array of stylish motorcycles to suit every rider's taste. from the classic thunderbird to the phantom, our models combine performance with eye-catching design. available in a variety of vibrant colours, every motorcycle is built from premium materials and comes with a 12-month unlimited mileage warranty, extendable up to four years for added peace of mind.
