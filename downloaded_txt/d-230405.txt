public justice (formerly trial 
lawyers for public justice) opened its doors 25 years ago to pursue an inspiring 
vision -- building the 
trial lawyers' public interest law firm. we 
have done that and more. over the past quarter century, no public interest law 
firm in the country has been involved in a broader range range of high-impact, 
cutting-edge litigation. so we've become public justice to pursue an expanded, 
inspiring vision -- building 
america's public interest law firm. 

public justice fights for 
justice through precedent-setting and socially significant individual and class 
action litigation designed to enhance

consumer and victims' rights, environmental protection and safety, civil  rights and civil liberties, workers' rights, america's civil justice system, 
and the protection of the poor and powerless. our
access to 
justice campaign  
keeps the courthouse doors open to all by battling federal preemption of injury victims' 
rights,

unfair mandatory arbitration, class action 
bans and abuse, unnecessary 
secrecy in the courts, attacks on the right to counsel and jury trial, and 
unconstitutional legislation.

public justice is the 
principal project of the public justice foundation, a non-profit
membership organization.
we are supported by  and can 
call on  a nationwide network of over 3,500 attorneys and others, 
including trial lawyers, appellate lawyers, consumer advocates, constitutional 
litigators, employment lawyers, environmental attorneys, civil rights lawyers, 
class action specialists, law professors and law students. public justice and the public justice foundation 
are headquartered in washington, d.c., and have a west coast office in oakland, 
california.

public justice objects to unfair 
					"coupon" settlement over sharper image air purifiers














public justice has objected to 
							a settlement involving sharper image's ionic breeze 
							air purifiers, which emit harmful levels of ozone.



arguing that a proposed class 
					action settlement involving sharper image's "ionic breeze" 
					air purifiers "looks more like a marketing tool than a fair 
					deal," public justice has filed objections to the settlement 
					and called on the marketing giant for a "more serious" 
					response to studies that show the devices emit harmful 
					levels of ozone.  

the proposed 
					settlement of figueroa v. sharper image, which is 
					pending in a miami federal court, consists of a $19 coupon that can be 
					redeemed off the sale of another sharper image branded 
					product.  it also gives class members the right to obtain an 
					"ozoneguard" that may or may not ameliorate some of the 
					adverse health effects associated with use of the ionic 
					breeze.  

public 
					justice's objections, which were filed on behalf of a class 
					member who stopped using the devices after learning of their 
					health risks, argue that the settlement is unfair and should 
					not be approved.  attorneys general in 26 states and the district of columbia also filed a brief opposing the 
					settlement.  

"the fact 
					that the only way in which class members can obtain value 
					from their coupons is by spending more money at 
					sharper image raises serious questions about the fairness of 
					this agreement," said lead counsel amy 
					radon, public justice's goldberg, waters & 
					kraus fellow.

	unanimous supreme court to tobacco giant: no federal removal

public justice amici 
	helped argue for decision that reverses corporate advantage
 












						the supreme court unanimously decided corporate 
						defendants cannot remove state court cases to federal 
						court simply because the corporations are regulated by 
						the federal government.




				in a case joined by public justice as part of its access to 
				justice campaign, the u.s. supreme court unanimously ruled june 
				11 that 
a class action 
				against tobacco giant phillip morris cannot be removed to 
				federal court simply because light cigarettes are subject to 
				federal regulation and the cigarette maker asserts a federal 
				preemption defense.  

the decision 
				overturned an eighth circuit ruling that would have allowed 
				corporate defendants to eliminate most state court cases against 
				them by removing them to federal court. in its amici 
				brief, public justice maintained that because phillip morris is 
				not a federal officer and cannot claim it was engaged in federal 
				law enforcement when it privately made and sold light 
				cigarettes, the removal from state court was improper.

 "the 
				question before us," justice breyer wrote for the court in 
				watson v. philip morris, "is whether the fact that a federal 
				regulatory agency directs, supervises, and monitors a company's 
				activities in considerable detail" allows the company to remove 
				cases to federal court 
				under the federal officer removal statute -- which authorizes 
				removal by those "acting under" an "officer" of the united 
				states.  "we hold 
				that it does not."
