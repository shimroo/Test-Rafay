                like it or not, the harsh reality is that the first thing scouts and recruiters at your ‘next level of competition’ will look at is your radar readings. lacking velocity eliminates athletes from consideration immediately and second, a velocity of just 2-5mph above your competitive peers will give you a distinct advantage.

                parents are usually just not aware of the impact and role they play in the whole process of developing their athletic star in both areas of growth - improving performance, and improving character.
                the number one solution we provide to parents of ranch athletes is an understanding of development.

about texas baseball ranch
lots of pro scouts will look you right in the eye and tell you that velocity can not be taught. "you either have it or you don't," they say. but what they really mean is they can't teach velocity. at the texas baseball ranch™ we teach velocity every single day.
