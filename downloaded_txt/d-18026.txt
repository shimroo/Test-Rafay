 what is exothermic weld?
exothermic welding is a process that creates a strong electrical connection
                            by using a chemical reaction to join two or more metal components. during this process, a
                            special mixture is ignited, producing extremely high temperatures, which then melt the metal
                            pieces together, forming a durable and reliable bond.
