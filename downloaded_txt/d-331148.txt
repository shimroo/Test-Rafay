welcome to the official website of the old 
hickory railroad!




the old hickory railroad
features a live steam locomotive pulling two open coaches on a 6.2 mile journey back in time through the historic town of jackson, la. the ride commemorates the clinton and port hudson railroad, established in 1833, including a spur into jackson. 

today 
the old hickory railroad 
stands as a proud reminder of a time when railroads help connect our country and 
transport us from one side of the continent to the other!  for years, 
parents, children and railfans have come to jackson to ride the old hickory and 
relive this special time in america's history!
