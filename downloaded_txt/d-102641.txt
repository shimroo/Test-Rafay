stress free weddings for your out of town groomsmen





























all of the employees at savvi were extremely helpful in selecting colors matches for my wife when she asked because she was still a little undecided about a few things. the most impressive thing to me was, our wedding was on a saturday and we picked up thursday, if something was off there was someone on site to seam/hem it right then and there.

rented my tux here for my wedding and the service and tux were both incredible. i have been in many weddings and the service i received here was far superior than their competitors. i highly recommend!

the staff was amazing. their eye for design and meticulous attention to detail was well appreciated. i had a small dilemma with my shirt two days before my wedding and the staff expeditiously had a new shirt sent to my hotel. i recommend them highly!!

the service was great! the employees were very friendly. they remembered us each time we walked in the store. they allowed me take a vest to match the suit for the ring bears suit. the suits for the groomsmen were awesome.

the staff at this location were very friendly and helpful. they worked with my father-in-law's schedule as he was travelling in late from china. they were very helpful in coordinating all the colors. the fittings all went smooth and the return process was very simple. last-minute touch ups were nice and quick. i'd highly recommend this as your one-stop shop for all the suit rentals of a wedding!

after a frustrating experience at another company, we walked in to savvi formalwear and immediately felt a sigh of relief when talking with daniel. daniel walked us through everything we needed to know when it came to renting formal wear for our wedding and was incredibly helpful. he paid attention to all of the small details and made sure we felt taken care of. he was always available to answer our questions. we were so pleased with the quality of the tuxes and the service we received! we highly recommend savvi to couples planning their wedding!

i highly recommend grooms and their wedding party to check out savvi formalwear for their tux rentals! they gave top notch service from beginning to end, quick to respond, and the suits they offered were up to date with the latest trends. thank you for the great service!

my now husband and i used savvi in order to best accommodate our in and out of town wedding party members with getting their tuxes. i can only say the best about the staff … so helpful and professional! they were very willing to work around our crazy schedules and made the entire process pretty much seamless. in the crazy sea that is the wedding planning process, it was nice to not be worried about the tuxes, because they kept us updated at every turn. the return process was also very simple. thanks savvi!
