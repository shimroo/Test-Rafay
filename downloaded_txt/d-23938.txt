a special message for all those auditioning to be terps this year! #heartheturtle #umdartsforall



rhapsody in blue premiered 101 years ago today, but did you know the piece’s iconic opening clarinet solo was not actually written by gershwin? professor of clarinet robert dilutis shows us how it’s done, and explains the context behind this famous work.

#umdartsforall



join us in april for otto nicolai's adaptation of shakespeare's "the merry wives of windsor"! follow the story of frau fluth and frau reich as they teach notorious drunkard and womanizer sir john falstaff a well-deserved lesson. decorated with a rich orchestration, nicolai’s opera is a tale of love and wit, depicting the triumph of cleverness over folly.
