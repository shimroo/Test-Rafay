welcome california communities!together and individually we can help california communities become useable for every person and every ability!haven't removed your barriers?  i see a werry spensive problem in your future!  on december 30, 2006, six thousand [6000] days will have passed since the passage of the americans with disabilities act. just one dollar [$1.00] a day would have provided over ten thousand dollars of barrier removal when coupled with federal tax credits and deductions. what are you waiting for?

city of san rafael - complaint - access violations - 3rd and lootens parking garage8/18/2005summary:as explained in the attached city of san rafael complaint form, recently, when using the walkway to get to my vehicle after leaving san rafael joe's restaurant on 4th street, i came to an abrupt stop and actually fell out of my wheelchair due to the illegal trench drain at the bottom of the illegally designed walkway (a ramp - the walkway is clearly steeper than 5% - with no interim level landings and no handrails).although i understand that the city of san rafael is under direction from the u.s. department of justice to correct violations within that facility by august 5, 2006, that requirement doesn't respond to my complaint and the fact that the city of san rafael has a very unsafe condition in the non-complying walkway and the connecting gutter at the base of the walkway where the walkway connects to the garage. additionally, although the u.s. doj complaint describes the violations within the garage, apparently the individual who inspected the garage didn't review the walkway that i described in my complaint.-----------begin full report--------re: city of san rafael -

city of sebastopol ada and california civil code violationshollynn d’lil3027 arroyo court, p. o. box 160, graton, ca 95444(707) 829 9440 - land, (707) 829 9021 - fax,hdlil@comcast.netaugust 9, 2005city manager: david d. brennan city administration7120 bodega avenue sebastopol ca 95472dear mr. brennan:thank you for your letter of june 23.i appreciate that sebastopol has made efforts to comply with the ada. however a transition plan is a requirement of the law. by your letter, you acknowledge that the city has not complied with the requirements of the americans with disabilities act (ada), requiring the development of a transition plan. a self evaluation of all city programs and services is also required. has the city of sebastopol failed to complete a self evaluation, also? this should be of concern to you as the city manager, responsible for assisting the city to comply with all applicable laws and regulations.furthermore, regarding the barrier removal you have undertaken, i am very concerned about the quality. for example, you mention the library as a city facility that has received the city’s barrier removal attention. the ramp approach to the library has a severe cross slope. it does not comply with either federal or state code, and is very difficult to traverse.in addition, i have tried to park in the city parking lot on the east side of high street south of bodega avenue. the designated accessible spaces do not have access loading aisles, making them unusable. in addition, the parking lot does not have a tow away sign. furthermore, there are between 50 and 75 total spaces and only two accessible spaces. for that number there should be three total accessible spaces, including one van accessible space. the path of travel from one of the inaccessible spaces (erroneously designated as accessible) requires the occupant of the vehicle to travel behind another parked car to access the side walk. this is a violation of california building code. in addition, there is no accessible route from the designated inaccessible parking spaces to the businesses fronting petaluma avenue, which the parking lot serves.the on-street parking provided for persons with disabilities and marked by blue curbs on bodega avenue and high street are adjacent to benches and trees, making them unusable by not provided a clear loading space as required by federal and state codes.the dangerous curb ramps i mentioned in my previous letter are on north main street. if they are under the jurisdiction of caltrans, please let me know. i will file a formal complaint with the appropriate state and federal agencies.in addition, i am enclosing a letter written to the sebastopol building official, under your oversight, dated june 23, 2005 to which i have received no response. i am very concerned that this letter has not received a response from the person whom you stated in your letter has responsibility for ada compliance and "new situations that come to our attention." i would appreciate your attention to this issue, and the soonest response to my letter.as you do not have a transition plan, please provide for the a copy of the "barrier inventory" completed in 1992. please provide the budget details describing what monies have been spent since 1993 to resolve ada, california civil code and california government code compliance issues.i look forward to your response. thank you for your time and consideration.sincerely,hollynn d’lilattachments: copy of letter sent to city of sebatopol june 5, 2005, andletters sent to city of sebastopol building office,

accessible parking and there is a step before the door.i am forwarding a copy of this letter to the sebastopol building department. the building department is responsible for enforcing state laws requiring accessibility for persons with disabilities. i ask that you seek the guidance of the building department and provide the required accessible parking and entrance as soon as possible.in

excessively steep that i cannot use them without going over backwards. in addition, i have noticed that the city parking lots do not provide compliance accessible parking spaces.please provide a copy of your transition plan for barrier removal to your programs and services as required by the ada to be developed by local governments in 1992. have you updated your plan since 1992? do you have an advisory committee working with the city to bring it into compliance?if you have 50 or more city employees, you should have an ada coordinator. i could not find such a person on your web site. if you have an ada coordinator, is that person empowered to make vital decisions to bring the city into compliance with the ada and california disability civil rights laws? would you please forward to the me

	 report - yosemite national park
    



subject: response to march 17, 2005 letter regarding resolution of access violations at yosemite park-reference #a3615(yose)3/22/05 mr michael l. tollefson, superintendentyosemite national parkp.o. box 577yosemite, california 95389mr. tollefson,i am writing to you to inform you of my disappointment and anger with the most recent response i received from you (your letter dated march 17, 2005, reference #a3615(yose). your letter contained only minimal information and had no bearing to the telephone conversation you and i had approximately a week ago. during that conversation, i went over the many existing and newly created access violations i have found while visiting yosemite park and the frustration i have had with the lack of response by either national parks or the concessionaire, deleware north company as to how those violations will be corrected and by when. as you are painfully aware, my original complaint is approximately three years old and covered access violations at both park and concessionaire sites. when i was in yosemite recently, giving an access training to the california building officials association (calbo) a few weeks ago, i found additional major access violations within a newly refurbished horseshoe shaped trail to yosemite falls and recently remodeled bathrooms at both the ahwanee hotel and yosemite lodge where i stayed during the calbo conference. you and i discussed these newly found violations and the fact that although some of your staff and dnc staff believe that there are accessible parking spaces in the yosemite park valley areas, i couldn't find one that complied with federal access regulations. additionally, we talked about the timing for immediately correcting some access violations while finalizing the parks transition/self-evaluation plan. i have never agreed with what appears to be your decision that no corrective work will take place until the plan is completed in november of this year as your letter suggest. you apparently haven't taken my complaint seriously because your march 17th letter doesn't respond to most of the issues i raised during our discussion.by this email, i am informing you that unless i receive a written (email would be preferred) response from you indicating, in detail, the immediate actions that will be taken by you and the concessionaire to correct at least some of the more egregious access violations, including the newly built path to yosemite falls and the entrance and bathroom at the ahwanee hotel and the bathroom at the yosemite lodge and parking throughout the park, i will be filing a lawsuit against both national parks and deleware north company. i'm sorry it has come to this, but after waiting all this time for a reasonable response from national parks and deleware north company, and then getting a letter from you informing me that i can wait longer isn't acceptable. i'm not prepared to wait any longer.richard skaff303 ashton lanemill valley, ca.

email service to assure that you have received it. the first was sent via the sf chronicle on-line system. it is very disturbing to me (and will be to the rest of the disability community) that you and national parks management are attempting to "gloss over" your failure to assure that national park facilities are really accessible to persons with disabilities. having a picture of a woman with a smile on her face, sitting in a scooter, certainly indicates to me that you are attempting to market this $13 million dollar failure of an accessibility project as one that is really accessible and serves the disability community. you should be ashamed of yourself! i am still expecting a response to my last email to you which was sent (sent march 22nd) as a formal 504 complaint. richard skaff303

rmskaff@comcast.net to: cnolte@sfchronicle.com mr. carl noltestaff writersan francisco chronicle mr. nolte, i have attached my recent email to mr. michael tollefson, superintendent at yosemite national park. although i left a phone message for you after reading your article on the new yosemite falls trail project, i have not heard from you. if you have the opportunity and read my comments to superintendent tollefson about this project and next week's opening ceremony, i would appreciate being given the opportunity to talk with you about the access violations in the trail project and throughout yosemite national park. i would hope that you would be interested in hearing both sides of the yosemite access issues, including mine. thank you for your consideration of my request. richard skaff303 ashton lanemill valley, ca. 94941voice & fax: 415-389-8628mobile: 415-497-1091email: rmskaff@comcast.net====================================united states department ofthe interior national park service yosemite national park p. o. box 577in reply refer to: yosemite, california 95389a3615(yose) april 15, 2005mr. richard skaff303 ashton lanemill valley, california 94941dear mr. skaff:we want to thank you for meeting with jerry ernest, accessibility coordinator for dnc, and marty nielson, nps chief, division of business and revenue management during your most recent visit to the park and expressing your concerns about accessibility to park programs and facilities. we hope this correspondence will be helpful in describing the corrective measures we have taken thus far and outlining our future plans for removing barriers and increasing accessibility in yosemite national park.the following is a list of some of the issues you raised from the abovementioned meeting on march 3, 2005 with mr. ernest and mr. nielson, in your email to don fox, park accessibility coordinator dated march 7, 2005, and also those subjects in your email to me dated march 22, 2005. we are providing an update to ms. dianne spriggs of the washington office of equal opportunity regarding your concerns identified in the formal allegation of discrimination subsequent to your october 2001 visit. ms.spriggs will then forward a response to you.yosemite falls pathway –you referenced the ‘newly refurbished horseshoe-shaped trail at yosemitefalls’. we are uncertain if the trail to which you are referring is the new circular walk to the interpretive exhibits on the western approach or if you are concerned about the accessibility of the entire loop up to the base of lower yosemite fall. although we feel this construction project,funded by the yosemite fund, neither inhibits nor prohibits a person usinga mobility device from reaching the base of yosemite falls from the eastern access route, we will have it evaluated by a third party for any potential inconsistencies.accessible parking at yosemite lodge, curry village, and the ahwahnee -you are right; there are still some discrepancies in the layout of some of the accessible parking spaces at yosemite lodge, curry village and the ahwahnee. we will re-examine the requirements for accessible parking and correct some of the discrepancies when we re-stripe the parking lots this spring. however, the more extensive alterations to the parking areas will be part of the prioritization process that will be addressed in the transition plan.men’s room at the ahwahnee –you commented ‘the lavatory counter is too high in the men’s room’.lowering the counter by 1” to 34” above the finished floor, in compliance with accessibility guidelines, was determined to be a lower priority given the extent of need for accessibility alterations and the limited availability of funding to accomplish these corrective actions.the grab bars in the stall are 34” from the floor. according to adaag4.17.6 (figure30 (c) (d)), grab bars can be positioned 33”to 36”above the floor. there are no handles on the stall door. although according to both adaagand ufas there is no specific requirement to provide handles, handles will be installed this spring on the accessible stall in the ahwahnee men’s room.bathroom at yosemite lodge you reported the flush handle is on the wall side of the toilet and should be on the open side in the family-friendly restroom. a replacement tank with the flush valve on the correct side has been ordered as of march 25,2005.the force to open the door to the family-friendly restroom exceeds 5 pounds of pressure to open. the door closer was out of adjustment and has been corrected since your visit.the soap dispenser requires more than 5 pounds of pressure to operate. the soap dispenser was clogged with dry soap causing the need for excessive force and has since been corrected.path of travel from major facilities– uneven surfaces, puddles we concur with you that uneven surfaces and puddles are often present on some of the access routes. the pathways through the ahwahnee complex were scheduled to be repaved this past fall, but inclement weather postponed this project. we will endeavor to correct uneven surfaces and eliminate puddling as we replace travel surfaces throughout developed areas. signing is confusing, not helpful - no site map available indicating where accessible features are and how to access them. we are not certain to which specific signs you are referring. many directional signs have been added to direct visitors with disabilities to the services and facilities. accessibility maps have been developed and are now available at each hotel registration desk. additional directional signs will be added as needed and identified. a comprehensive sign plan will be completed for each of the locations: the ahwahnee, curry village,yosemite lodge etc. linking interior and exterior way finding to and through the properties. the door hold-open devices provide an obstacle for persons using awheelchair.these devices are not included in adaag, but we realize there are some instances in which their presence could restrict access. this is will be addressed in areas where there is a known interface with wheelchairs and the door hold open devises will be removed.at the ahwahnee the red carpet is not compliant.because this is a national historic landmark, the solution to this deficiency will be combined with others at the ahwahnee in a request for approval to the state historic protection office (shpo).the horsehair mat at the entrance door to the ahwahnee makes wheelchairs slip sideways.the accessibility guidelines require a maximum ½’ pile and the mat at this location is only ¼” thick. the mat will be removed, the sand base under the mat leveled with more sand added if necessary. the mat will be replaced insuring there is no abrupt grade change between the mat and the concrete approach on one side and the threshold on the other. the fire alarm pull stations are too high this matter is being addressed as a component of the ahwahnee fire and life safety project. regarding to your concerns on the park’s mandate to develop a self evaluation and transition plan that covers” public program” access within the park a scoping document will be available to the public at the end of this month describing the range and complexity of programs offered here. the goal is to obtain public comment on how to improve the quality of a park experiencef or persons with hearing, visual, mobility and cognitive impairments. this document will summarize the structural and nonstructural barriers and describe the comprehensive self-evaluation process for each nps organizational branch as well as all park partners including: delawarenorth companies parks and resorts at yosemite (dnc), best studio anseladams gallery, yosemite medical group, yosemite dental clinic, yosemiteassociation, yosemite institute, el portal food market, and el portal fuelstation. based on the public response, the self-evaluation will be finalized,deficiencies will be prioritized, completion dates established, and the agency unit or park partner responsible for correcting the deficiency will be identified; this document also will be available to the public. we will examine the policies and practices that govern the administration of each of the nps and park partner’s programs and activities to insure discrimination does not occur and those findings will be incorporated with the self-evaluation in developing the transition plan. this will be the foundation in preparing future budget requests to eliminate accessibility barriers and correct deficiencies.we sincerely appreciate your genuine interest to insure that persons with hearing, visual, mobility and cognitive impairments are provided the same opportunities and benefits of a visit to this world-class national park.sincerely,/s/michael j. tollefsonmichael j. tollefsonsuperintendent================================5/18/05subject: public document request -

national park and it's concessionaire, delaware north companies parks and resorts at yosemite (dnc) for the many 504/ada violations within the park, such as the newly built, 13 million dollar yosemite falls trail and the concession-operated facilities such as the ahwanee hotel and yosemite lodge.i find your lack of responsiveness to me, a member of the public you are supposed to be serving, to be

russ whitlockchief of staff to the directornpswashington, d.c.mr. whitlock,i just received the most inane and unresponsive letter (see attached) from mr. tollefson, the superintendent of yosemite national park that i have ever received from any bureaucrat in "response" to my may 18, 2005 email to him (see my 5/18/05 email below). if mr. tollefson had taken the time to read my may 18 email, he would have understood that i expected more than the excuses his june 3, 2005 letter, received today, provides. in my may 18th email, i not only asked for a copy of the "scoping" document that his april 15th email said would be available by the end of april, but also asked, ". . . please inform me as to the name and background of the "access" consultant that you had informed me the park was going to hire and use to review my complaint regarding the access violations within the recently completed yosemite falls trail. additionally, please indicate when i should expect that review to be completed. please also be aware that i will expect to receive a complete copy of that report. . ." of course, mr. tollefson's letter didn't provide that requested information. apparently, neither mr. tollefson or the washington office of the national park service intends to respond to my complaint or my request for information unless i take legal action.additionally, a number of the comments in mr. tollefson's april 15th email to me (see below) were unsatisfactory and didn't respond to the apparent violations i found during visits to yosemite. two examples of his inadequate response included his comments regarding the fire alarm pull stations which aren't considered accessible because they don't meet the "operating mechanism" requirements of the ada guidelines and the non-accessible horsehair matt at the entrance to the ahwanee hotel, to name two. now, it seems, as a reaction to my pursuit of resolution to my three year old complaint, mr. tollefson has decided to negotiate with an outside contractor to review my complaints and the apparent access violations. interestingly enough, ever since filing my complaint, the park service has used the excuse of lack of funds as one of the reasons the access violations i brought to it's attention almost three years ago haven't been fixed. now, instead of using the professional staff who are fully cognoscente of the parks access mandates to determine whether the apparent violations exist or not, the park management has decided to go "outside" and hire a consultant. this can only be construed to mean that the park service is "shopping" for the answers it wants instead of accepting it's failures and correcting the clear and present access violations.the course of action taken by the national park service on the many access violations that exist in yosemite park is apparently not unusual and occurs at other national parks sites, based on the case you informed me about - a woman who's child is deaf. you indicated that the child had attended an nps "program" at one of it's parks, but was not provided a sign language interpreter. apparently, none were available. as a public record request, please provide me with the contact information for that parent and child so i may contact them and get the details of their experience, which i'm sure, is not unusual for visitors with disabilities visiting our country's national parks. it's really a shame that the federal agency, created to protect our national parks and assure public access, doesn't!i look forward to your response.richard skaff303 ashton lanemill

this email to you as a formal aba complaint due to the massive number of physical and programmatic access violations that have not been resolved at the yosemite national park in california even though that park's management has known about the violations for the last three years. new construction, subsequent to my initial 504 complaint filed three or so years ago, including one of the most recent project, the new access route to the base of yosemite falls, also has major access regulatory violations. additionally, after almost fifteen years, this park as well as most other national parks (if not all) throughout the country does not have a completed transition/self-evaluation plan.because of the lack of a national parks policy that should be holding each park manager (superintendent) accountable for access failures like those at yosemite national park, these individuals face no consequence or accountability for their park's lack of compliance with federal accessibility laws and the lack of park specific compliance policies including standard operating procedures and protocols for the park staff and concessionaires' interaction with the disability community (e.g. call-in reservations at national park campgrounds - no tty available at the main campground reservation number).please respond via email to this formal complaint (as well as in writing, if you feel the need).

	 cal osha elevator - issue-backing out of a wheelchair lift
    


========january 25 2005=========re: cal osha elevator, ride and tramway approved wheelchair lifts-access issue-backing out of a wheelchair lift  date: 1/25/2005 6:26:07 pm pacific standard time

although i appreciate receiving your reply, i am somewhat surprised that your response didn't include any more information than it did.  for example, if this issue is to be addressed in the rulemaking associated with the ada certification process, when will that process occur?  from what i understand from talking with dsa staff is that dsa has received information from the u.s. access board that there are not a great number of areas within the california access codes that remain a barrier to the department of justice certification of the california building code.  dsa has been aware of the department of justice position on california certification for some time now, but dsa  doesn't appear to be moving forward to have our code certified.  because of the delay in certification, is dsa suggesting that individuals using these approved lifts (by local building departments and cal osha) continue being stuck (trapped is a more correct description) in lifts because they must back out but can't?  is there a specific time frame that this issue will be resolved?  i would suggest that the existing lift regulations that allow the user to back out of a wheelchair lift should be considered a dangerous condition an emergency code modification issue, and probably a violation of state and federal access codes/regulations.  dsa doesn't see it that way?   will this be discussed at tomorrow's dsa access code advisory committee meeting?   i look forward to your reply. richard skaff303 ashton lanemill valley, ca. 94941voice & fax: 415-389-8628mobile: 415-497-1091email:

architectsacramento, ca. 95812 dear mr. conrad, attached is an email describing a wheelchair lift design issue that dsa/cal osha have never resolved.  the fact that our state building code fails to resolve this design issue and the dangerous condition it creates makes immediate action necessary.  as you can see by the attached emails, the chair of the dsa universal design advisory committee also recognized the importance of correcting this problem, but apparently never followed through with the state architect. i look forward to hearing from you with regard to a proposal as to how and when dsa/cal osha will schedule meetings to discuss/develop solutions with regard to this wheelchair lift design problem.  i am sending a copy of this email to mr. jim meyer, chief executive administrator - elevator, ride and tramway unit, cal osha for his review and response. thank you. richard skaff ======may 2003=======from: richard skaff [mailto:rmskaff@attbi.com]sent: wednesday, may 07, 2003

armstrong@icbo.orgsubject: fw: cal osha elevator, ride and tramway approved wheelchair lifts-access issue-backing out of a wheelchair lift  stephan and michael, this is an emergency issue!  i recently completed a site review of a new lift which was permitted and after installation, approved by the cal osha local inspector and the local building official.  the lift is in a shaft and travels between the main floor and a mezzanine to provide persons with disabilities who are not ambulatory access to the public bathrooms which are on the mezzanine level.  if you are using a wheelchair and entering the lift on the main floor, the user enters the lift by opening the full-size fire doors (with the required view panel), and rolling forward onto the lift.  when you arrive at the mezzanine level, you back out! of a second full-sized fire door. these are both manually operated doors, not power operated doors.  although the door locks electrically unlock when the lift arrives at a level, the approved design is difficult if not impossible  to use even when entering the lift in the forward direction because the doors are rated as fire doors which, by code, are allowed to have a force to open of up to 15lbf.  when you are using a manual wheelchair for mobility and are going forward into the lift, that operation is extremely difficult, but if you are in that same manual wheelchair and  trying to back out of the lift while attempting to open the door, the process is impossible.  the user is trapped. the intent of the "code" is to assure accessibility.  the unruh civil rights act, modified in the late 90's to assure that all codes/regulations in california meet the ada at a minimum, mandates accessibility. the ada states, and the california government code and health and safety code imply, that access must be provided in public accommodations and public facilities and that even if you design and construct a project using the appropriate codes and regulations,  when completed, if the project isn't accessible, you haven't met the intent of the regulation and the project is in violation of those codes and regulations.  the wheelchair lift design i have described in this email specifically assures access will not be provided for those individuals in wheelchairs who are unable to twist in their chair to push the shaft door open while maneuvering their wheelchairs backwards out of the lift.  try it sometime!   when i contacted jim meyers, chief executive administrator-manager of engineering services at cal osha elevator, ride and tramway unit, the state agency that inspects and permits the installation of all lifts in california, he informed me  that this type of installation has been permitted all over the state and he is unaware of any complaints.   further, he stated that his agency doesn't inspect for access, just safety!  the local building official hasn't signed off the project yet but has stated that he will, as soon as the project manager/architect can get a disabled person to use the lift and agree that the lift is accessible!  what a process!   as you can see from the attached email, i contacted john paul scott, the newly appointed chair of the dsa advisory board universal design standing committee.  because of his work on design standards in this area, it seemed appropriate to ask for his thoughts on these issues.  his response clearly seems to support my concerns.    this unacceptable design  is apparently being repeated throughout california even though it creates a dangerous condition for the lift user, and must be stopped.  the problem must be acted on by the appropriate state regulatory agencies immediately.  what options do we have?   between now and next week when i will be in sacramento for the dsa advisory board meeting, i would appreciate dsa staff contacting jim meyers at cal osha.   together, both agencies must look into this design problem and have some options available that we can discuss.  also, whatever is done to correct the problem, a dsa or cal osha bulletin should be developed and sent to all building departments throughout california informing them of both the problem and solution.  i would also appreciate your suggestions as to what to tell the local building official on the particular project i described in this email.  should he permit the lift?   please call me if you have any questions.  i can be reached at:work-415-554-6786/home-415-389-8628. richard skaffrmskaff@attbi.com ----- original message ----- from: john scott to: skaff richardsent: 5/6/2003 1:53:29 pm subject: wheelchair lifts   richard i received the asme 18.1 platform wheelchair lift standard.  the standard does not address the door opening force  - so marsha mazz and brian black put it into the icc/ansi a117.1 standard which is then referenced by the international building code.  i include a copy of the proposed final section of the icc ansi a117.1 -2003 version.  basically it would require the doors on a lift to be powered doors, and then there is an exception for when the lift is a drive through one with doors on opposite sides. this does apply to the doors that are provided by the building and not necessarily on the lift machinery itself. so what would be required here is for title 24 or dosh to adopt the same requirement on power operated doors as which occurs in icc ansi a117.1.  a clear statement is necessary that when manual the platform (wheelchair lift doors in series must operate at 5 pound pressure as well.  if they are fire doors they are exempt under title 24 and adaag to 15 pounds or more. so that hole needs to be plugged as well in california building code. "all platform (wheelchair) lift doors or gates shall be low energy powered doors or gates complying with ansi/bhma a156.19.  exception: where a lift is serving a maximum of two landings and has doors or gates on opposite sides of the platform, it shall be permitted to have self opening and closing doors or gates complying with 1133b.2.5 and have a maximum opening force of 5 pounds." "controls for powered doors or gates shall comply with 1117b.6a, and the clear floor area shall be located outside of the door or gate clear floor area.  the clear floor area of the control shall be centered on the control.  controls shall be located 48 inches maximum from the floor or ground level." "where platform (wheelchair) platform lifts are provided in vertical shafts, all doors providing access into and out of the lift shall be operated with 5 pounds maximum opening pressure or they shall be power operated doors complying with ansi/bhma a156.10 for full powered automatic doors or gates or ansi/bhma  a156.19 for low powered doors or gates" the amse a18.1 standard states that the lift shall be operable with up and down switches at all stations and on the platform itself.  now the original a117.1 requirement was for key operated, and operable from all stations.  so the stairway platform lift that you saw that was left open, and thus not operable from the bottom station was not compliant to california dosh . john paul scott, aia

joseph abbott  to:  sent: monday, january 10, 2005 1:07 pmsubject: plumas county   it was good to talk to you friday last after so many months. i have been  pursuing ada issues both in my un-incorporated town (johnsville) and the  county of plumas. this may all seem like a-long-winded story but at least  it will let you know i've been busy.  the problem: can the local agency (special district) have public meetings  (town meetings) in a building with ada access problems?  specifically, an  unpaved parking area, a problematic access ramp, and no disability rest  room hardware, etc.  the local agency: the local public utility district (pud) is a "special  district" exempt from state or county oversight and regulations and as such  is not very interested in ada issues. the entire town has membership in  this group because we are all water users which the pud (an elective  office-the elections are organized (secrete ballot) and performed (by mail)  by the plumas county election clerk's office "as a favor" to the pud. the  pud plans to use a structure in the town for its meeting which up to now  have been held in private homes. reference: see response of california  public utility commission: "districts are formed by the county bd. of sups  if they are within a single county or by state law if they exist in  multiple counties (like ebmud). the cpuc does not have any jurisdiction  over districts. you need to contact your county attorney or ombudsman".  the structure: some of the locals (incorporated as the johnsville  historical society) have organized to rescue (rebuilt it) a dilapidated  building known as the johnsville church and are in the process of renting  it out for social events and use by the pud. they originally neglected to  get a certificate of occupancy or use permit, and that process has now been  playing out with the board of supervisors and the plumas planning  (so-called) department. in this process the planning department has placed  a sign in the building which states that the structure will only hold 49  persons. often the building has more than this number because no one  enforces the restriction. this was done to avoid compliance with state fire  codes and disability access.  ps. the pud never held another meeting in their fire building (which they  own) likely because i made such bad noises over their venue i.e., no  chairs, my pain etc. thus, i never filed my complaint against them. that's  the last time we made contact.  from our conversation of yesterday it seems that my target for remedial  ada action is with the johnsville pud since (as a california special  district) they (pud) are exempt from all state and county oversight.   plumas county: problem list:  (see my letter which is attached as #1) specific issues in plumas county. 1.      plumas county disability coordinator: there was none until i called  the county counsel and then the director of facility services  (grounds-keeper) was appointed as such. but his office building has no  sign, disability parking area, no access ramp and he states he only is  responsible for county buildings not those like the johnsville pud will  use. i have been working with a member of the local grand jury to see it  they (gj) will address this issues (sign, parking, access, etc.) and if  they will not, i have offered to file a formal complaint against the county  regards the disability coordinator officer's non-compliance. 2.      parking on quincy main street (as the result of my above referenced  letter, i was contacted the local caltrans supervisor: her response  "i had  spoken to the caltrans paint crew supervisor earlier, he is the person who  told me that it was the (plumas) county's responsibility. since john kolb  (county works department, who told me in was a caltrans issue) does not  agree, i am now following up with our traffic department in redding to get  more definitive information. i will get more information to you, hopefully  by the end of next week. sincerely, kathy coots, caltrans area  superintendent" . note: i have yet to hear an definitive answer after  several months of waiting for caltrans intervention. 3.      i have been successful in getting the community care council (see  attached email #2) to place my above referenced letter on their agenda for  their january 13, 2005 meeting . my goal is to involve a broader group  including seniors and others with physical limitations to become involved  in this issue rather than attempt to carry the entire burden myself i.e.  consensus building.  finally i have not been able to locate a michel adams of caltrans in the  state phone directory. do you have more contact information on her so i can  make contact? i am eager to attend the meeting in mid-january that you mentioned but i  need a topic, time, place, etc. so i know where to go in sacramento. i look forward to your direction in my attempts to bring plumas county up  to date regarding ada requirements.  joe abbott joseph a. abbott, md. 1870 jackson, st. # 502 san francisco, ca. 94109 ===========reply =========== re: plumas county  date: 1/10/2005 4:18:24 pm pacific standard time from: rmskaff@comcast.net to: jabbottmd@mindspring.com cc: le3293@aol.com, barnonhill@aol.com, cfilc@cfilc.org, mcollins@calsilc.org, longmore@sfsu.edu, wheelchair-access-now-today@cox.net  1/10/05 mr. abbott, it was good talking to you the other day. the simple answer to the question in the second paragraph of your email is no.  a public agency would be a violation of the california brown act which says that public agencies, holding public meetings must hold those meetings in a fashion that is open to the public.  [see link] if the facility the meeting is held at is not accessible by state or federal access codes/regulations, then it's not open and available to a segment of the population, those of us with disabilities.  recently, the town of corte madera, in marin county california, held a town council meeting at a site that wasn't accessible.  they received a letter from mr. lockyer's office warning them that they were in violation of the brown act.  i have attached two letters from the ag's office (i'm sorry, they are both "pdf" files), one, a letter sent to the mayor of adelanto, california about this same issue.  i would copy both to your computer and forward them, along with your complaint to the agency in question.  remember, these are state as well as federal violations (not just federal ada issues).   i would strongly suggest that you do this by sending an email to the special district board and manager with "cc's" to: 1. state attorney general bill lockyer:  email -  piu@doj.ca.gov 2. steve coony-chief deputy attorney general for administration & policy: email - steve.coony@doj.ca.gov3. alberto gonzalez, special assistant attorney general:  email - alberto.gonzalez@doj.ca.gov .  mr. gonzalez can also be reached by phone: 916-324-53694. peter siggins, chief legal affairs secretary to the governor: email - peter.siggins@gov.ca.gov 4. janet blizard, janet blizard, supervising attorney-public access: email - janet.l.blizard@usdoj.gov5. laura williams, president - californians for disability rights, inc (cdr): email: le3293@aol.com .  ms. williams has developed a web "blog" in which she lists complaints that individuals have filed.  i believe that ms. williams is doing this in an effort to show; 1. how many building sites exist with access violations throughout the state, and; 2. the effort and time it takes for our community to get the access that the state and federal laws have required for years that aren't being enforced. in your letter, describe the apparent access violations (unless you are a known "code" expert that has a background of acting in that position in court cases) and that you expect a written response within thirty days with details as to the outcome of their investigation of your complaint, the details that were found that are violations and when they propose to correct the violations.  then, follow up within thirty days if they don't respond with a second email, cc'ing the same people and add a "cc" to a disability rights attorney (i can provide you some names at that time, if you are interested). i hope you don't mind.  i'm "cc'ing" your email to others (activists) in the disability community in california.  they may have additional suggestions for you. good luck. richard skaff303 ashton lanemill valley, ca. 94941voice & fax: 415-389-8628mobile: 415-497-1091email: rmskaff@comcast.net

1/10/05  mr. edwin m.  lee, directorsan francisco department of public workssan francisco city hallsan francisco, ca. 94103 mr. lee,  i have attached emails to this email i am now sending you because i have yet to receive a response from the san francisco department of public works about the complaints i have filed with your department.  just last week, i was in the city and went past the franklin/clay intersection and found that nothing had changed, even though i first informed your department about the violations at this site last year on 5/14/04, almost 8 months ago!.  2 blocks of clay street and the intersection of clay at franklin streets were completely resurfaced after a  p.g.&e. utility undergrounding project was completed, triggering the installation of curb ramps in the "remodeled" intersections.  two curb returns in the clay/franklin intersection still don't have the required curb ramps that should have been installed during that project!  additionally, i have heard nothing from your department with regard to my complaint about the use of dpw manufactured bucket/chain barricades being used at various locations around the city.  are those barricades that don't comply with the department's barricade order still being used and if so, why? although you may not be aware of california regulations that require access violations must be corrected within 90 days of determining their validity, that doesn't excuse your department's non-responsiveness to my complaints and correction of the violations. if i don't hear from you or your staff by the end of this week with the outcome of your department's investigation of all of my complaints and a schedule for correction of the violations that i have brought to your department's attention, i will be forced to take more drastic and aggressive action.  it is quite clear that there are some bureau chiefs within your department who are either uninterested or unwilling to assure that their bureau is in compliance with state and federal access codes/regulations or even the department's own orders.  could this be because there is no clear direction from their director on the issue of accessibility for persons with disabilities? richard skaff303 ashton lanemill valley, ca. 94941voice & fax: 415-389-8628mobile: 415-497-1091email: rmskaff@comcast.net =============11/07/04mr. ed lee, directorsan francisco department of public workscity hallsan francisco, ca. 940102subject: various access violations - public right-of-way - non-complying construction barricade systemsmr. lee,the attached photos describe the numerous access violations by p.g. & e and their subcontractors on haight street last week. the a frame "barricades" being used certainly wouldn't protect anyone, especially a blind/low visioned pedestrian. the second set of photos visually describes the chaos on the sidewalk on page street at the urban school construction project. the project supervisor representing plant construction told me that the city inspector (sidewalk or dbi?) had been by the site just days prior and hadn't been concerned. in june, i had forwarded photos of a previous barricade violation by p.g.&e. at the same location in front of the san francisco urban school site. i will re-send those if requested. the p.g.&e. sub-contractor, annuzi, has had ongoing violations in most of their projects throughout the city and even when fined, don't seem to take this issue seriously. none of the barricades at either project appeared to comply with the san francisco department of public works barricade order even though the dpw ada coordinator has apparently provided training to p.g.& e. staff and to dpw sidewalk inspectors. i will be sending three emails on the same complaints due to the number of digital photos being included.richard skaff-------------august 2004--------8/7/04 mr. kevin jensen, ada/disability access coordinatorsan francisco department of public worksmr. jensen, the attached pictures visually describe three construction sites located on the north sidewalk of mcallister street in san francisco.  the first and second show the same excavation on the north sidewalk on mcallister street in front of hasting law school at an accessible parking space just east of hyde street (which, of course, makes the accessible parking space unusable by many individuals).  the second two photos show two excavation sites, one on the west sidewalk on hyde street and the second, at the corner of hyde street and mcallister street.  all three construction sites have multiple sheets of plywood laying presumably laying over an excavation.  none of the plywood sheets have "cut-back" to assure that the plywood sheet edges don't create a tripping hazard.  presently, all three sites don't comply with either state or federal access code/regulatory requirements and don't comply with the department of public works own construction barricade order and all three sites are heavily traveled by pedestrians, including those who are blind or other types of disabilities. please inform me, at your earliest convenience, when dpw sidewalk inspectors will be investigating these three sites and, if the sites are violations as i have suggested, what dpw will do to have the violations corrected.  i would also like to know if dpw will be holding the contractor or city department responsible for these violations and what that will entail. additionally, the following is a description of an additional public right-of-way complaint that i am formally filing with your office.  although i don't have photos or specific addresses of the sites in question, they will be easily found.  while using the north side of market street yesterday, between mcallister street and grant street, i found two locations with the same "barricade" being used.  it can be described  as a number of plastic buckets filled with cement with a plastic pipe imbedded vertically in the concrete-filled buckets, holding three levels of horizontally strung yellow chain between the vertical pipes, similar to the one apparently dpw operations  installed at the united nations plaza fountain near city hall.  although i have contacted mohammed nuru-deputy director of dpw operations and informed him that this "barricade" design does not meet the intent of local, state or federal barricade guidelines and doesn't meet either the intent or function of the design described in the u.s. access board's pedestrian right-of-way access committee's guidelines, he has apparently continued to allow their use.  in fact, although i have called and left messages for him about this issue, he has only returned my original call but has never returned any of my other calls about this issue.   the reason for my repeated calls to mr. nuru were due to his lack of response to me and lack of action in removing/replacing the non-complying barricade system at the u.n. fountain (his apparent lack of interest in responding to complaints such as those described in this email is not acceptable).  again, i want to reiterate that the barricade system i have described in this email doesn't even meet the requirements in the sf department of public works barricade order which mr. nuru has known about  since his appointment as deputy director! within the next thirty days, please inform me as to the outcome of dpw's investigation of my complaints and, based on the outcome of that investigation, what dpw staff have done to correct the violations.  additionally, i want to be informed as to what efforts are being made by dpw and the city to assure that similar violations will be resolved more effectively in the future and not be allowed to occur on such a frequent and regular basis.  i'm sure one solution will have to be the addition of more street inspectors (and utility inspectors) with ongoing training and auditing to assure their knowledge and competency.  please inform me if that solution is being considered and if so, when will the additional inspection staff be available? thank you. richard skaff ---------------------may 2004--------5/14/04 mr. kevin jensen, ada/disability access coordinatorsan francisco department of public works30 van ness avenue, 5th floorsan francisco, ca. 94102 mr. jensen, the attached photos visually describe the numerous non-complying barricades being used around the city by contractors and utility companies like p.g.&e.  i will send you multiple emails with attachments because there are so many photos.  when i stopped and talked to one of the project supervisors on oak street between stanyan and divisidero, he informed me that the inspector had been to the site that morning and said everything was fine.  the supervisor was quite concerned that he was getting different messages about what the city required as an appropriate design for a construction barricade.  additionally, at the intersection of franklin and clay, another location where i believe a utility did undergrounding, part of the work within the public right-of-way (sidewalk)  triggered the installation of a curb ramp, which was never installed.  it's obvious by the markings on the sidewalk, that someone knew about the requirement to install a curb ramp because there are lines depicting the location of the required installation of a curb ramp on the south east corner of franklin at clay. it's obvious to me that there is a real problem with how dpw communicates what it expects from utilities and contractors with regard to safe and accessible barricade systems and the installation of curb ramps in utility projects.  at your earliest convenience, please inform me as to what dpw will do in the very near future to correct the problem of inadequate, incorrect and inconsistent (or no) information on this subject.  i would also like to hear from you with regard to what dpw requires as far as construction plans for projects proposed by utilities.  from every indication i have seen, detailed (including access triggered by the project) approved project plans which also include proposed barricade design and necessary curb ramp installations, both triggered by the project, are none existent.  i hope that i'm wrong on that assumption. thanks. richard skaff
