calling all dog lovers 
 info august 22, 2019august 22, 2019 


 


dog care is so important to a healthy dog that it is worth working through this advice. whether preparing the home for the dog, organizing a routine or dog training, dog grooming or dog walking, you will find advice here. the dog care is similar to human care. 


the care of our pooch is so important that one will research on the web, speak to dog professionals and even discuss with your pooch. dog care is very similar to the care we give our children. with correct care they will give ten or more years of pleasure. as in our health, the early periods of life are crucial. the professionals who can give help include vets, dog trainers and dog walkers.



dog care should start before you bring him home. you need to prepare the entire family for the pooches arrival. a new arrival can put the nose out of joint of people and animals. you also need to puppy proof your house. to do this well, is to put you in his mind set, crawl around the house, look for where he can fall, that can trap or poison him. if your pooch has health problems, even with the best canine care, it can happen and can be very expensive. so consider purchasing pet insurance.

if you are looking for tips for dog care check out dog lovers monthly asap.

another important decision is to choose whether your loved one should be neutered. most canine professionals advise this, quoting research that neutering leads to longer life and less behavioral problems. in the current credit crisis there are too many dogs in rescue homes. it might be also worth considering choosing your pet from one of these charities.


if your pooch will be near children consider their safety, with twenty percent of the four and a half million people bitten by dogs needing medical attention. to improve the dog safety ensure that your dog has good training, that the pooch has plenty of exercise. if you cannot give the pooch enough exercise consider using a professional dog walker, who will normally help you with the obedience training and dog care as well.to help your puppy, set up a plan for puppy socialization so he will be able to deal well with humans and other animals. similar to us humans, dog care requires vaccinations, so choose a vet and get the injections done for your canine friend.

he will need a place to rest and sleep. the use of a crate or cage is often a good investment to give him a safe place to rest. to give good care you will need brushes, collars, leads, beds and blankets. for good dog care, set up a good regular routine. include some dog training, starting simple obedience training, just 10 minutes a day of say clicker training is enough. feed your canine at regular times and with a variety of foods. similar to you avoid too many treats, apart from as part of dog training. never feed at the table, it is difficult to stop afterwords. in the routine, ensure exercise for him, dogs originally walked long distances and most can walk for more than ten miles a day. to keep him healthy you need him to be exercised enough, depending on the breed one to two hours a day is needed. this regular dog walking often reduces problems such as separation anxiety.


dog grooming is also important for your pooches care. wild animals can groom and wash themselves. ensure that you program this time in, it is not a chore, but a pleasure where you can have some quality time together. many people think that dog bathing is required. there are those who say it should be frequent and those who only do it when they get dirty. the right frequency depends on the breed and hair type and length and their lifestyle. i favor longer periods where the skin is protected by their essential oils that shampoos can wash out. so in summary dog care is key to having a wonderful relationship with your dog, so plan it and spend time on it, with it you both will have fun together.
