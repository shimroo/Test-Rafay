about
                            this
                            domain:
                          long
                          before there was an ipad or an android phone,
                          i saw the promise of
                          portable tablet computing combined with open
                          source and unix-based
                          software. in the late 1990's i, along with
                          others,
                          did some work to modify existing xfree86
                          pen tablet drivers to support fujitsu, ricoh,
                          and ibm pen-based
                          pc's.

                          software.
                          today, all android phones and tablets are

15 december 2023
the linuxslate.com website has moved to new hosting and a new format.

linuxslate.com has been hosted for several years at very little to no cost. linuxslate.com, and my other website, carcynic.com, are the only sites left on the previous hosts' servers, and i was informed that those servers were to be shut down.

welcome to the new site of linuxslate. please bear with us during this transition. content from the old carcynic.com, and linuxslate.com has been saved, and selected forum articles will be re-posted in the coming weeks. expect missing data and other errors during the transition. we look forward to new features, and a vibrant new community on both carcynic.com and linuxslate.com. please read the faq to learn how to register and share your thoughts and questions here on carcynic.com.

eventually, the venerable hand-written html of linuxslate.com will be replaced with a new and more robust site.  please note that this will happen slowly.  in addition to the linuxslate.com forums, users will be able to comment on the articles on the home page.
note: if you previously had an account on the old linuxslate.com forums, you will have to re-register. registration will be available shortly. we appologize for this inconvenience.

thank you for being with us through this great journey.

review: unbranded chinese radiation detector


				in what i am calling the "second generation" of chinese portable geiger counters, they have really upped their game with stylish cases, color displays and more functionality than the offerings from former soviet countries -- but do they have the durability and features for use in an actual civil defense emergency? 
read the first linuxslate.com review of an attractive rad meter/dosimeter from china.

tooobs!linux supports high bit rate audio files and once configured correctly, it will make the most out of high-end digital to analog converters (dacs). but once that sound becomes analog, there's no better way to appreciate it than pure vacuum tube audio*. 
   
i repair vintage high fidelity vacuum tube amplifiers, and design and build modern hi-fi amplifiers using new production tubes and modern switch mode power supplies.
regulated smps power allows operation from 100-240 vac, and maximizes tube heater life while maintaining exact tube bias.
large value, high quality coupling capacitors. combined with the nearly sag-free smps, this produces low-end power that exceeds expectations for tube amplifiers.
some designs incorporate internal high fidelity dacs.
my designs never pass audio through a potentiometer wiper or slide switch contact.  scratchy volume controls are a feature of vintage audio that i don't miss.


you can read about some of these projects on the forums under audio and pro sound.  others are discussed on the audiokarma.org tube audio forums. just look for articles posted by linuxslate.
in addition to building vacuum tube amplifiers, carcynic sound provides professional sound services in the central florida area.
* yes, before you send me a nasty-gram, i will point out that the speakers are the most important part of any audio set-up.

don't miss out on new content! it's true that the venerable raw html of the linuxslate.com home page is rarely updated these days. but new articles, reviews, and project logs are posted on the linuxslate.com forums frequently.
                            here are some popular articles on the forums:
                            -->  my brand new broken fnirsi-1014d 100mhz digital storage scope - the issues, repair, and a review.
                            -->  the malachite dsp - sdr  radio receiver - malachite is an open source hardware sdr reciver with a 3.5 inch touchscreen developed in russia. click the link for english firmware release notes, english language manual, an easy diy case, and reviews and comments.
                            -->  in the "review discussions" section, you can read about suprisingly radio active things i've found, and places i've been with the radiation detectors i've reviewed here.  examples include a radioactive room in the smithsonian national museum of natural history, the "bit of hyperactive nature" i found buried in a box at a flea market, or what happened when i tried to take a russian geiger counter on a commercial airline flight.

                              	fear not!! check back soon for a review of a very unique, new, and inexpensive linuxslate coming soon.so what will be reviewed? well, here is a hint: keep in mind that all android phones are linuxslates.ok, so it is a mobile phone. that's not much of a hint!
ok, so here is a bigger hint: this includes devices running android 9 "go". what's android go? maybe you should read up here or here before the review.

                            review the much i5/i5s either.)  why is
                            linuxslate.com not
                            reviewing these really cool android gaming
                            phones?  because there

                            did review the much g2 just a little...
                            read my comments after deen0x's in this

                              disappoint you even if you are accustom to
                              phones from the major manufactures. you
                              also get some game controls (basically for

                              occasional game. just don't expect it to

                            usb charging isn't actually evil, it's just
                            misunderstood.  let's learn a little
                            about these so-called wall-warts, and we'll
                              answer a few questions like:

    why does it
                                sometimes seem to take
                                a phone hours to charge, and other times
                                it seems to charge up rather
                                quickly.
    what's the
                                difference between a
                                slow charger and a fast charger? 
                                will a "fast charger" charge all
                                phones more quickly?
    will i burn out my
                                phone or it's battery if i charge it
                                with the charger that came with my
                                tablet?
    can i use my
                                friend's charger for his htc phone on my
                                samsung phone (or vise-versa)?
    can someone steal
                                the pictures and other personal data
                                from my phone if i use an unknown
                                charger?

                              screws stuck in it), what what good is
                            a ww3ssii?  it helps you
                            take over the world.... ok well, it probably
                            won't really help you do
                            that, at least not directly, but it will
                            help you make cloverleaf
                            antennas that are closer to commercially
                            built ones.  cloverleaf
                            antennas are used for fpv
                              flying of radio controlled aircraft.

                            the first new

                              rca 7" android internet music system.
                            the best way to
                            explain it is to simply list out why this is
                            such a
                            poor android tablet -- and then i will
                            explain why it doesn't matter. this unit,
                            combined with an hd tv,
                            and

                            spare room media
                            masterpiece.
                                    it's not quite ready for joe
                                    consumer, but it's a must-have for
                                    the
                                    true android affectionado.

                            buying one of these devices can be an
                            intimidating step, especially
                            if you are not an android "pro".  this

an ipod
                              nano can be worn like a watch, but what if

                              connectivity and customizability? 
                              you'd need android on your

                            is a linux slate, there
                            are now hundreds, if not thousands of them,
                            and they are the sold in
                            the largest quantity of any platform.
                            thousands of sites provide
                            reviews, forums, and advice.  this site
                            was the first (that i know
                            of), and it's time has passed.  we
                            really do live in an linuxslate
                            world now. 

                            i'll keep maintaining the site, and when i
                            have something to say, i
                            will.  i'm also on google
                              plus,
                            so ad me to your circles there for quick
                            updates and news.

                            i also want to give one last (for now) bit
                            of advice.  when
                            deciding what android device to buy, make
                            sure that there is a mature
                            and well maintained community firmware, such
                            as cyanogen(mod)
                            available or in serious development for
                            it.  unfortunately, with
                            things like carrieriq, and so much bloatware
                            being installed by the
                            carriers, this is a necessity.  it does
                            not mean you have to use a
                            community firmware, it just means you should
                            know you can fall back on
                            it should you need to.  a
                              list of devices currently
                              supported by cyanogen(mod) is listed here.

                            lastly, i want to mention linuxslate.com's
                            new sister website,
                            carcynic.com.  like the tag-line says,
                            "modern automotive
                            technology, and other absolute
                            nonsense".  there's not much there
                            now, but hopefully we'll have some fun,
                            humor, and just a little bit of
                            actual useful information.
                            please hit carcynic.com.

                            * so what android devices are not
                            linuxslates?  there are several
                            android set-top boxes and media players that
                            do not have their own
                            screens at all, so they are not slates.

back
                            in the days when i was a laser tech, i
                            worked on a
                            500 mw air cooled argon laser.  i
                            remember being impressed that it
                            plugged into a standard outlet, and did not
                            require water cooling. the
                            laser head and the power supply could both
                            fit on a moderately sized
                            table.  back then, the idea of a hand
                            held
                            laser that could run on a single, small
                            rechargeable battery and
                            produce
                            nearly twice that much power was pure
                            fantasy. but in one of the most
                            impressive cases of science fiction becoming
                            reality i have seen in my
                            lifetime, it's now true. the wicked
                              lasers arctic sypder iii 1 watt blue hand
                              held laser is a
                            revolutionary product, but as is often the
                            case with such cutting edge
                            technology, the first generation (g1) of
                            these products are widely
                            reported to
                            suffer from early failures.  mine was
                            one of the first ones
                            shipped, and it lasted only a few days of
                            sporadic use before failing. rather than
                            deal with the cost and time
                            involved with returning the laser to china,
                            as well as the risk that a
                            replacement laser may be delayed or
                            confiscated by us customs, i
                            decided to attempt to diagnose and repair
                            the laser myself.  my
                            findings, and a technical description of
                            part of the circuitry of this
                            controversial and revolutionary product can
                            be found in this
                              technical
                              paper (pdf format).

a
                            brand new dell
                              streak
                            home dock has gone under the screwdriver in
                            the name of science.
                             based on this tear-down,
                            linuxslate.com can confirm that the dell
                            streak is using pdmi
                            as mentioned
                              below. pin-to-pin
                            testing shows that the dock connector pinout
                            is in agreement with what
                            is shown in this pinout
                              diagram.
                            i cannot confirm presence or absence of the
                            usb 3.0 pins as these are
                            not brought out to any connector on the dell
                            home dock. with the
                            exception of one tiny 6 pin component
                            associated with the hdmi
                            connector, a few small filter capacitors,
                            and some 0 ohm protection
                            jumpers, there is no actual circuitry in the
                            dock.  click on the
                            picture for a larger view, and click here for
                              a closeup of the board.  --- oh,
                            and how did the story end?

it's
                            good to be wrong.  my local kmart just

                            android tablet, and i just picked one
                            up.  i have a quick
                              review here,
                            which i'll update as i gain more experience
                            with this unit..

as the dell
streak
                              us launch fiasco continues, i get news
                            of more cool
                            technology you can't buy,  kmart
                            is advertising this augen 7" android tablet
                            in this week's sales flyer,
                            but you can't order it on line, and the
                            local kmart has not seen
                            them. 
                            no one else has yet either,
                            apparently.  kmart says they are
                            issuing "rainchecks"
                            for the so-far nonexistent unit at a sale
                            price of $149.99.  
                            even at the non-sale price of $169.99, it
                            would be a great deal if
                            true.  the
                              specs
                            are much better than similar
                              units sold through the direct from
                            china
                            places: 800mhz processor 2mb of internal
                            storage, sd card slot, and
                            android 2.1 on board --  i sure hope
                            i'm wrong, and these units
                            actually show up at the store.  if they
                            do, you'll see at least a
                            mini
                            review here, but until then, count me as a
                            skeptic.

                            first glance the dell streak
                            seems to have the same
                            30 pin connector as the iphone/ipod. 
                            however, this
post
                              on streaksmart
                            shows that such is not the case.  so
                            what sort of connector is
                            that?  is it proprietary?  why use
                            it instead of mini or
                            micro usb? what signals are available? 
                            can we home-brew some
                            cables and adapters?  well, i don't
                            even have my streak yet, but i
                            have a suspicion.  i think the dell
                            streak is one of the first
                            major devices to use the pdmi standard, or
                            at least a variation of
                            it.  pdmi stands for portable digital
                            media interface and is an
                            ansi/cea standard. it defines a 30 pin
                            connector with the following
                            features:

usb 2.0 port, including limited
                                current charging and
                                usb otg
high current charging (for faster
                                charging of devices
                                with higher capacity batteries)
stereo analog audio
usb 3.0 port
2 lane display port (digital video and
                                audio, with
                                aux channel)


                            the page on the right from the cea pdmi
                            technical overview shows the
                            pin-out.

                            of course this does not mean that the streak
                            supports all of
                            these.  in addition, 1080p video
                            requires a 4 lane display port,
                            so the streak is hardware limited to
                            something less i.e. 720p.
update:  a reader points out
                            that 2 lane
                            display port is capable of
                            1080p (albeit with certain color and scan
                            rate limitations), but the
                            overall point is still the same -- the dell
                            streak is still likely
                            hardware limited to 720p video out.

why
                            am i so anxious for a dell
                              streak when dell is getting another
round
                              of bad press from the capacitor issue? 
basically,
                            there are 2 aspects to this.  first is
                            the issue of
                            trust and goodwill toward the company, and
                            second is the streak itself.
                            i believe dell did not behave properly when
                            the capacitor issue hit.
                            but who exactly am i going to buy a phone
                            from?  apple has had issues
in
                              the past, and arguably is not doing
                            the right thing now with the
                            iphone4 antenna
                              issue. then there was the sony
"rootkit"
                              debacle. there's hp's little spying
                              scandal;
                            and how about motorola and possible gpl
                            violations? i could go
                            on.  to be clear, i am not saying any
                            of these actions are ok, but
                            it's not a choice of dell vs. "good
                            company", it's buy or don't buy,
                            and i want -- arguably need -- a
                            phone.  as far as the capacitors
                            themselves, it's true that this was not just
                            a dell issue.  i know
                            because i've replaced bad electrolytics in
                            many devices.  i expect
                            that the build quality of the streak will be
                            better than off-brand
                            chinese stuff, and probably better than htc,
                            but less than the motorola
                            milestone or the iphone3gs. building one of
                            these things is not like
                            building a pc.  in a device with this
                            high a parts density, and
                            this type of smt,
                            there is just not that much variation in
                            build. the story is the same
                            for the parts suppliers. the device has also
                            shown
to
                              be pretty durable.
                            i think is is very nearly as nice looking as
                            the motorola milestone,
                            but has better specs, and is likely to be
                            cheaper than i can get a
                            north american version of a milestone
                            for.   i like the slate
                            form factor (i wonder why?), and if i am
                            going to have nearly 4x the
                            pixels of 1st gen android phones, i'd
                            actually like to be able to see
                            them. i almost always wear cargo pants, so
                            carrying it will not be a
                            problem.  if i want a large screen
                            android phone with replaceable
                            internal
                            storage, and a front facing camera, my
                            choice of alternatives pretty
                            much goes to zero. will i look silly holding
                            something so large to the
                            side of my head when i make a call? 
                            nah... i have a bluetooth
                              banana, so i won't
                            look silly at all!

the
dell
                              streak is now on sale sim-free in the uk. 
the
                            cost is \a3449 with vat and uk shipping
                            (\a3365.11 without vat or
                            shipping.)  as far as a us price, the
                            number $500.00 has been
                            circulating around the 'net based on a
                            comment made in a video
                              posted on
                              all things d.  a dell media
                            contact has informed
                            linuxslate.com that dell has not
                              announced a price for an unlocked
                              streak in the us.  what was meant
                            in the video is that typically,
                            unsubsidized, unlocked, smart phones cost
                            about $500 more than the
                            subsidized price  (2 year contract,
                            locked phone), and that the
                            streak would likely not be significantly
                            different. (watch the video
                            and see what the dell guy actually says.)
                            so, if the streak is (my
                            example) $99 w/ a 2 year plan on at&t,
                            them we might expect
                            it to be $599 unlocked on dell.com, if it's
                            $199 with a 2 year plan, it
                            may be $699 unlocked (my numbers
                            again).  as of this
                            writing,  \a3449 is approx. $678, so
                            those figures are in line with
                            the uk pricing.
                            additionally, the uk version has only
                            900/2100 mhz umts support. 
                            this means that  if you buy a unlocked
                            uk dell streak and try to
                            use it on at&t in the us, 3g will not
                            work. (edit: removed
                            possibly incorrect t-mobile statement) rumor
                            has it that the us version will have
                            850/1900/2100 mhz umts.
                            oh... one other thing about the dell
                            streak... i want one !!

                            banana sold by dealextreme:
                            essentially
                            a bluetooth headset in plastic banana, it
                            can be paired with anything
                            that supports the bt handsfree or headset
                            profile.  yes, it's
                            silly, but its useful too.  

                            advantages:

so
                                realistic looking, i've reached for it
                                thinking it was a real banana.
                                 the slightly rubberized paint
                                makes is almost feel real too.
buttons work well; not likely to make

                                status/pairing, etc.
good range and battery life.
people who see you use it will think
                                you are crazy.
