message from the president
i have so much gratitude to have the ability to connect with youth in schools and communities to make positive impacts in their live for over 20 years.
since our inception, we have been able to provide meaningful programs focusing on leadership & education, developing healthy lifestyles and serving our communities with our ludacares® program. in addition, we have been able to respond to communities all over the world due to devastating disasters.
we value the relationships that we have held with our youth over the years that have transitioned into adulthood. many of the youth who have benefitted from our programs reach back to give to the communities we continue to serve. it is our greatest achievement to touch communities in an authentic way while our youth and adults share their stories of their compelling experience.
as we persevere in growing and developing our programs and introducing new technology with partnerships like microsoft, we persevere in connecting to the right partners to get to the right people to serve our communities.
a special thank you to our supporters, partners and participants. i am humbled at the things that we have accomplished in support of my vision for the success of the ludacris foundation.

ludacris is known as a hip-hop icon, film star, and entertainer. but for the families who have benefited from the philanthropic works of his charity, the ludacris foundation, christopher "ludacris" bridges is known for bringing joy and support through the holidays.

ludacares thanksgiving

thanksgiving is a time for gathering with loved ones and sharing gratitude. however, for many underprivileged families, this can be a time of hardship. through ludacares® thanksgiving, the ludacris foundation addresses this need head-on by distributing turkeys and food baskets filled with nutritious food to families in housing communities.

ludacares thanksgiving ensures families can come together and enjoy a wholesome meal with their loved ones—without additional financial stress.

ludacrismas

ludacrismas is one of the oldest and most cherished programs under the ludacris foundation’s ludacares initiative. since its inception, ludacrismas has touched the lives of over 10,000 families across cities like los angeles, chicago, miami, atlanta, the bronx, ...
