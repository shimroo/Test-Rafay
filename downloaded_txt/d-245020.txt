how to spot fake coach handbags





spotting a fake coach handbag could be difficult but i hope this guide will give you enough background to allow you to make a educated choice when purchasing multiple coach purses. i will start with the obvious things to look for, especially if your shopping of the auction sites like ebay, yahoo auctions or msn. lets start from the top time.first, take a look at the feed back for the seller. ebay has a great system to allow patrons to leave feedback about their purchase. check out the comments made. if the majority of the comments are negative then this is a good indication that you don’t want to deal with that seller. obviously, the seller is not conducting a reputable business. also, stay away from sellers with very little feedback. i characterize these sellers as only have 10 or less feedback. these sellers are just starting out and they may not know if they have a fake handbag or not. even if they think that they truly have an original.next, take a look at the pattern on the outside fabric. the majority of the coach brand has a logo of c. the c brand logo should start at the center of the bag and go out. the middle seem should go straight through the middle of the c. take a look at the side seems. the “c” pattern will be cut will be cut off on fake handbags. also, on authentic bags the tip of the c should touch the tip of an opposite c.another sign that a coach bag is fake is that the logo is incorrect. some distributors change the logo to include gg instead of cc. this is a tall tail sign that the bag is fake. pay close attention the fabric, it can tell you a lot about the quality and authenticity of a bag. also, take a look at the stitching of the bag. coach does not deliver authentic coach bags with poor stitching. stitching that is off line or overlapping. both are examples of very poor stitching.have you seen the style of bag that you are thinking of buying before? distributors of fake material try to release brand new styles that have never been released by coach in any way shape or form. this is why it is good to take a stroll around the high prices stores and take inventory of what coach is releasing and compare your findings to what sellers are trying to push to you.take a look at the inner lining. does the inner lining have the signature logo of coach? if so, is the cc touching as the outside. once again, how about the stitching? is it sloppy? look for a serial number inside the bag. the serial number is stamped on the inside on a square patch of leather sewn into the lining. don’t be surprised this your smaller purse (the clutch, swingback, or mini) does not have a serial number. these bags don’t come with them.let’s look at the outside again. now let look at the hardware. coach only uses the best hardware for their purses, case in point, the zipper. coach only used that highest manufacturer of zippers. the brand stamps their mark on all of their zippers with “ykk”. if you don’t see the “ykk” you know you have a fake coach handbag.how about the made by tag? coach does have bags made in china. but coach does not have handbags made in korea. if you get a bag that says make in korea take it back or return it immediately. this is not an authentic coach purse.i hope this article has put all the tools that you need to make a educated decision about purchasing a authentic coach purse. if you want more information take a look at: how to spot a fake handbag. this is a in depth book that highlights all the sign of a fake handbag.about the author:coach outlet store is constantly looking for deals that could save you significant money. for a authentich coach handbag visit today.

good evening and thank you for spending some time reading this article that i have spent so much time thinking about. here i will give you some material about the coach brand and were to purchase a coach handbag (coach outlet store). so lets get started. i wanted to discuss the coach brand and how the marksmanship has taken the brand to far outreaching levels. i will not try to sell you anything. i just express how well made these bags are and let them speak for them selves.so, lets get started. i pose this question to you. have you ever owned a coach handbag? if you have not then you are missing an experience. here is another question. have you ever owned a bag that last for a significant number of years. if you haven’t had this experience then you are not purchasing the correct bag.i know what most people would say. these bags are too expensive. well, let take a look at this. why would coach handbags be so expensive? that is a good question. i would say it because of:1. the material used2. the time that it take to manufacture each handbag.3. the premium of how long the bags last.now, lets take a look at the material of these bags. coach only uses the best leather on the market. coach knows that when you use a cheap material you get a cheap bag that will not last. take a look and fill the leather of these bags and feel a cheaper bag. you will feel a difference. a coach bag has softer leather. while fake leather product is hard and brittle. also, take a look at the latches. some are real gold. do you see a difference from a cheaper bag?how about the manufacturing process? coach designers take their time to manufacture every single handbag. if a handbag has a flaw it does not make it to the show room floor. it is mostly destroyed on sold at the coach outlet stores around the world.how about how long people actually keep these bags? you know coach handbags actually get better the more wear you put into them. this is true because the leather has time to mature and become softer. just like a baseball glove. the more time curing the glove the better it gets.now that i have explained why the coach brand is so great. lets take a look at were to purchase a authentic coach handbag. i have to confess that i believe that coach outlet stores are the best places to purchase these gems. i guess i am looking for a deal also. coach outlet stores usually carry all the collections but at significant prices. but these stores are not stationed like a walmart. you will have to travel to find just one. if you want to find one, check out prime outlets on the net. prime outlet has an exhaustive directory of these locations across the united states.i hope this helps in your decision making about purchasing a coach handbag. hope to talk with you soon.about the author:kenneth elliott is the proud owner of coach outlet store. a resource for coach purses, coach shoes and many other handbags. also see: gucci handbag
