"i found my pulse beating with suppressed excitement as i 


    threw the mooring buoy overboard. it seemed as if that simple action had 


    severed my connection with the life on shore; that i had thereby cut adrift 


    the ties of convention.

the unrealities and 


    illusions of cities and crowds; that i was free now, free to go where i 


    chose, to do and to live and to conquer as i liked, to play the game wherein 


    a man's qualities count for more than his appearance."

maurice griffiths, the magic of 


      the swatchways.

site dedicated to 


    the memory of barry sturrock
this page and its 
predecessors by barry and john were one of the first ever websites back in 1992.
before almost anyone else had 
internet or e-mail, sounds impossible today.
helping our fellow boat 
owners for over 25 years, bringing pleasure to many and enjoying doing it!
