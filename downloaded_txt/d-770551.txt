in an uncertain world, a new generation of artists, designers, and communicators are using stencil art on the walls of towns and cities to voice thought-provoking messages and ideas. exploring the medium’s applications within grassroots activism and the contemporary craft scene, tristan manco returns to the streets and brings this thriving art form to life.exploring both process and results, this book delves into stencil art’s essential elements—place, space, technique, and subjects—before taking to the streets to see how, where, and why stencil graffiti is exhibited. having accumulated an extensive network of street art contacts through more than two decades of immersion in the scene, manco has scoured the globe for today’s most interesting stencil artists—those who operate outside the mainstream market of “urban art” and beneath the radar of everyone but the truly aware.featuring studio visits with artists and step-by-step instructional illustrations by the renowned colombian art collective stinkfish, the stencil graffiti handbook is a must-have for anyone with an open mind and rebellious spirit.to buy the book – uk – thamesandhudson.comto buy the book – usa – thamesandhudsonusa.comgerman language version published by prestel verlagto buy the in book germanfrench language version published by alternativesto buy the book in french
