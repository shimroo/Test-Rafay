              "i have worked on many location productions and have required extremely timely delivery of assets.  262 five has been the only third party outfit that has been able to meet our exacting standards and as a result i would be ecstatic to work with them again."

“we are always happy when our artists do a 262 five produced show.  we know they will receive first class production and be treated great.  they manage to do that while thinking of every detail and taking even better care of their clients.  with corporate shows it’s always a delicate balance to keep the buyer and artist happy, and these guys get it done every time.  i admire these guys for what they have done and the reputation they are building for doing projects right.  we highly recommend 262 five.”

              “whenever one of our artists is performing at a corporate event produced by 262 five, we always breath easier knowing all production and logistic issues will be handled first class.  they really know how to get the job done.”

              “you guys are incredible. you anticipated every need and want for our event (including building a helipad in the middle of a golf course). you should be very proud of all of the hard work, commitment and unqualified success that you and your staff brought to this event!”
