when m.l. leddy first began crafting handmade boots and saddles, he did so with a passion driven by his life as a young, energetic texan in the 1920s. he and his brothers set out to make only the very best products, and with a deep commitment to customer service. as their legend grew, so did their texas footprint. now a fourth-generation family business, leddyâs iconic storefronts in the fort worth stockyards and downtown san angelo are so much more than retail establishments. itâs a step back to a time when a handshake was as good as a contract, and folks still went out of their way to make sure the job was done right.
 
we still handcraft boots and saddles in the same time-honored way m.l. did when he first began. we also strive to have the most impressive selection of menâs and womenâs fashions, jewelry, belts, buckles, hats, and tailored clothing anywhere in the western world.
 
we invite you to come in for a visit, and weâll show you the passion that goes into every pair of leddyâs custom, handmade boots.











we love to see you in the store, and all over social media! tag us: #mlleddys
