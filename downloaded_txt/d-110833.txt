bs your ways through things. and you can’t slip under the radar. so
you’ll leave here knowing yourself better, liking yourself more, and
prepared to excel at whatever you choose to dosmaller classes. bigger success.when academics matter, you learn more than facts.while too many schools teach to the test, we prepare you for the biggest test of all: your life. not only will our small classes make sure you acquire the knowledge you need for the future you want. but our hyper-personalized teaching will also help you discover your strengths, get a glimpse of your dreams and move forward with confidence.our jrotc honor unit with distinction opens more doors.we have a direct line to the service academies.only a handful of military schools offer a jrotc honor unit with distinction. but fishburne is proud to be one of them. that means we’re one of the few military schools in america that can nominate select cadets directly to the united states service academies. and that means this is your best choice if your goal is attending a service academy.
winter weather update12-feb-2025winter weather updatefms parents –
the local waynesboro weather forecast is showing a chance for snow tomorrow.   current forecast however only indicates  a  50% chance of snow starting in mid-morning amounting to ~1 inch.
therefore, at this time, we plan to have normal school operations tomorrow with same class schedule.    if forecast changes, we will send out additional updates.    as always, local parents should use their discretion if safe to travel to school.
thank you.   – steve wilson

play your sportno sitting on the sidelines. cadets can play whatever sport desired.
 
cadet : teacher ratio12:1smaller classes allow cadets to have the opportunity to actually do the work rather than just learn about it.more feedback from instructors results in a better, more effective learning experience.there is more incentive to pay attention and become involved in a small class, because it is obvious when they don’t.
 
international cultures9we offer young men from across the world a structured, safe environment that strongly encourages honor, integrity, and respect for everyone.fishburne features small classes where students from all cultures, exchange ideas and benefit from fishburne’s focus on academics.we understand the challenges international students face and provide patient help to students.
 
★ honor unit with distinction
jrotc excellenceus army's highest level of accreditation maintained for over 40 years.fishburne has earned the us army’s highest level of accreditation and is designated as a jrotc honor unit with distinction, which makes us one of the few school that can nominate qualified candidates directly to the united states service academies.we also host one of only four summer jrotc programs in the nation, accredited by us army cadet command.
 
college acceptance rate100%we have a 100% college acceptance rate of the cadets who apply to college.we also have the know-how to get boys into highly competitive (like, ivy league competitive) apprentice schools, too.
 
individualized learningan opportunity school.we pride ourselves by offering an individualized style of learning and education for each cadet.fishburne wants to help you build a skillset that will prepare you for the future you desire. just because we are a military school doesn’t mean our graduates always join the military. from partnership programs, to taking college classes, or getting extra tutoring on classes that may be more challenging, our faculty and staff are here for you.

“there’s been a lot of leadership opportunities for josh… and that puts him outside of himself. something i’ve always wanted to see more of, and something i knew would have to come from within him. taking him out of his comfort zone, and helping him be responsible for other people.”
