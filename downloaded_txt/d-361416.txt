what to take on a sea cruise

what trip is without gadgets these days? you can take a laptop or tablet, for example, to spend time on a sea day watching your favorite tv series. in the cabins of most cruise ships there are modern flat screen tvs, some of them can be connected to via hdmi cable. but the number of outlets in the cabins is limited (1-2 per cabin), we advise you to take a tee for charging gadgets. there are both american outlets (110v) and european outlets (220v) on most cruise liners, but the european sockets may be thin, so to charge the laptop or camcorder you'd better take the adapter. it will be possible to access the internet via ship's wifi, if you are not afraid of the rates. the average cost per minute of internet on the cruise liner is about 75 cents. the pleasure is not cheap. don't forget your camera.
