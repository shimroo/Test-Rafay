polished stone technique - variation 2
try this for a marbling effect:daub metallic ink randomly onto glossy cardstock. take a large cotton ball, dampen with rubbing alcohol, then add a drop or two of re-inker in the color of your choice. daub over the metallic ink - and watch for interesting effects! seal your project when dry.

											polished stone technique?
									 	

polished stone technique - variation 1
try this technique for a multi-colored or tie-dyed effect:take two sheets of a non-absorbent material such as acetate, wax paper, vinyl report cover...lay one sheet down over a well covered work surface.select three colors of alcohol based re-inkers, and randomly drop inks around on the sheet. lay the second sheet over the top, and press or brayer until the inks have covered the entire surface of both sheets. now separate them, lay each flat and place a sheet of glossy cardstock over each. press to ensure full coverage of the cardstock. lift cardstock off carefully - straight up to the best of your ability, and set aside to dry. buff with tissue paper. stamp and embellish to your heart's content!

											uses for solid stamps?
									 	

solid image alternatives
try this technique with either a pattern stamp or pattern stencil, and your favorite solid image.ink your solid image very well. turn it over and press it firmly onto your pattern stamp or stencil (if using a stencil, be sure to have a blotter underneath.)now, without re-inking, apply your solid stamp to paper. your solid image will have taken on the pattern, as the pattern stamp or stencil will have lifted ink off the image.this is a great way to add texture to your solid images.

											how do i create the effect of motion?
									 	

streaking/trailing
use this technique to create the illusion of motion. ink up your stamp, stamp onto your paper, and, without lifting the stamp move your image in the direction opposite the direction your want your image to appear to be moving in. when you lift your stamp, you will discover that the ink has left a trail behind the image. this trailing effect is a common technique for creating motion in drawing, cartooning, etc., and now you can create this effect with your stamp!

											what is the spotlight technique?
									 	

spotlight technique!
here's a fun technique that will yield a great card! choose a line design image, and stamp it twice in black on white cardstock. set aside one, and with the other, choose a focal point you want to concentrate on. trim away all but that focal point, and paint or color it as your creative spirit dictates. mount your colored image directly over the coordinating area on the first, and still complete, black and white image.mount the entire image on coordinating cardstock and then onto a card front.for an excellent illustration of this technique, visit the stamper's mall at http://www.stampersmall.com/classes/spotlight_stamping.htm
