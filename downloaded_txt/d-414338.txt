what homeopet customers say













 
i am so pleased to tell you that your anxiety product has been enormously helpful to my beagle who was attacked by two large dogs at a charity and afraid to attend doggy events. he won 2 grand champion awards after using homeopet anxiety. thank you for this added dimension to our animal care.


e.i.
 /  email






















 
my male cat blocks and gets utis all the time. i’ve tried many different remedies and diet changes over the past year to no avail. i came across this new product and thought i would give it a try. i give my 21lb. kitty 5 drops a day and so far no blockages. wish this would have been available sooner as this could of saved him a lot of misery and me a lot of money. hope this helps someone.


susan zimmerman
 /  email






















 
your homeopet for coughs has truly been a godsend for us. our 17-year-old chihuhua has been suffering from a collaped trachea and your product has helped him immensely. thank you from the bottom of our hearts for having created such an exceptional product. truly grateful!!!
