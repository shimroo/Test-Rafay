	additionally, we are in the final stages of  planning our lobby expansion. and continuing plans for our new educational theatre space!  lots going on!!!  be part of it!


thanks to the town of new canaan, big things are happening at the powerhouse performing arts center!





	in 1984, the town players of new canaan proposed doubling the size of our crowded powerhouse theatre lobby space, but those plans were put on hold... until now.  with the support of the town of new canaan, it's now the perfect time to revive the dream.  in addition to the increased lobby space for our ruth lapham lloyd theatre, and two new ada compliant restrooms, we are extremely excited to establish a new theatre space (in the adjacent annex) to house our new youth programs, educational workshops, and establish a black box theater for edgier theatrical experiences.  we look forward to this dream becoming a reality.... with your help!  please donate to our new theatre fund so we can give back by entertaining you!  (naming rights to the new theatre may be available to you!)



	        please help us grow!   donate here

tpnc radio network
				



	town players of new canaan's mission is always to keep you entertained!  so during those times when we couldn't gather in the theater, we turned to radio. we created original shows with local writers, and recreated classic old-time radio shows starring local actors with a variety of drama, suspense, comedy!  so while our theater was dark, we were still entertaining!   enjoy listening!
