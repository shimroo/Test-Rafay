revolutionaryrenuvion skin tightening


renuvion can be utilized as a standalone treatment and in combination with other procedures like liposuction or surgery. when used independently, it tightens loose skin on various areas of the body, from the face and neck to the abdomen and arms. this makes it an ideal choice for individuals seeking to rejuvenate their appearance without invasive surgery.
furthermore, when used alongside liposuction, renuvion plays a crucial role in preventing skin laxity, a common concern after fat removal. applying helium plasma energy and radiofrequency beneath the skin’s surface encourages the formation of new collagen, enhancing tissue contraction and improving skin elasticity. this ensures the skin retains its tight and youthful appearance, resulting in a comprehensive aesthetic transformation. dr. mir, our cosmetic facial surgeon nyc, is here to answer your questions about renuvion. call us today to book a consultation.

pdo thread lift:


with pdo thread lifts, you can instantly lift any sagging skin, give your nose and jaw the necessary non-surgical contouring, and produce results that last for a very long time. pdo thread lifts encourage the body to naturally produce collagen and elastin, which keeps the lift in place long after the threads have disintegrated. she uses a highly special approach for nonsurgical rhinoplasty in which she can really inject filler into the thread to avoid unnecessary surgery and provide a secure alternative to liquid rhinoplasty.

thread lift for eyes & eyebrows:


the skin begins to droop and lose its suppleness as we get older. this causes drooping eyelids and sagging brows, which age and make a person seem fatigued most of the time. in the past, the only way to mimic an eyelid or brow lift was through surgical facelift treatments. at mirskin, with our cosmetic facial surgeon in nyc, we now offer pdo thread lifts that can provide those exact results without the need for any surgery or lengthy downtime.
