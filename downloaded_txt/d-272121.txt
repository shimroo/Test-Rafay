the tradition of the san rocco festa was brought to the aliquippa area by immigrants from patrica, italy, where st. rocco is the patron saint. they settled primarily in the plan 11 section of aliquippa, where the original festa began in 1925.this year we mark our 99th celebration continuing the tradition of our forefathers. not only to honor the tradition of our patron saint san rocco and the memory of our ancestors, but also to preserve italian heritage and culture in america.we look forward to having you celebrate the festa and italian culture with us!viva san rocco!
