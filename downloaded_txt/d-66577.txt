                    don't just find a lawyer ‐
                    find the right lawyer




                            when you need to
                            find a lawyer, our
                            no‐cost system provides you with access to
                            pre‐screened lawyers through a quick and
                            painless process. immediately after you present your
                            case, email notifications are sent to lawyers that
                            match the geographic location and legal practice
                            area you specify. within 24 hours, your case is
                            reviewed, evaluated, and when a lawyer is interested
                            in taking your case, you'll receive a full
                            attorney profile and their background information.
                        



                            we'll also provide you with a full breakdown of
                            their fee structure as well as user ratings by other
                            legalmatch clients to help you decide if
                            they're the right lawyer for you.
                        

                            within a few hours after you submit your case, you
                            may receive responses from local attorneys by phone
                            or email. we recommend waiting a day or two to allow
                            the majority of attorneys to review your case
                            thoroughly. then, it's up to you to select the
                            right lawyer near you based on the responses you
                            receive and the legal qualifications you're
                            looking for.
