welcome!

thank you for visiting simpsoncity.com, the former online home of dan simpson and family.


we moved. yup.

when i launched the website back in 1999, the internet was a very different place than it is now. if one wanted a website, it required web developing skills, familiarity with html, ftp, site hosting, domain registry, etc. very few families had a custom web presence unless they used one of those cheesy sites on geocities or aol. and there was no social networking.

but now, anybody with a digital device and the ability to click a few buttons can have a web presence. so bottom line, if you would like to visit us online, find us on facebook, instagram, twitter, pinterest, flickr,  google+, etc.

thats it, simpsoncity.com is now a ghost town...with one exception...and a huge one at that:





take a hike - visit dan's hiking pages






its been a fun ride.
