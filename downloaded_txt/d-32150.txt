jim williams:1/16/25  we are currently in the process of re designing hurricanecity.com, as you notice on the map below the red dots indicate each city in the database. when clicking on these dots a link will pop to a close up version of the area with a a stat link near the location. when finished this map will be larger with thumb nails images below as clickable to the embedded map. you will know the new look is live when you see a white background which is currently black.
