						the creation of the service nation allows contractors from all over the globe to share information and experiences, all with the common goal of bettering ourselves and our respective businesses. in many instances, however, there exists a higher level of self-satisfaction in helping others with answers to their problems as opposed to receiving answers to our own questions. either way, the service nation is the best investment any contractor can make.
