sometimes our light goes outbut it is blown again into flameby an encounter with another human being. each of us owesthe deepest thanks to those whohave rekindled this inner light.albert schweitzertis no other than thyself that rekindles the inner light, by accepting the helping hand that comes forth to help, the hanky to wipe thy tears,the shoulder that offers itself to cry on,summoning the courage to have another go at life...

03.12.2005 07:53 am32 bahadur ak regimentbalakot, mansehraalways came up north during the summers.saw snow on distant mountains. it's so freezing that my fingers refuse to move over the keypad. first time ever, inside a tent. army men even bloody fold their blankets so technically, they're tough to unfold. blankets and beds are so cold, they seem wet. only one girl in the tent is smoking, but we all seem to be, as the flimsy tent won't keep the cold out.people who are reduced to calling these tents home ...we just cannot relate to it

a very very good morning.cold like the natural temp control's busted or something, but the invincible summer i possess within, keeps a warm air to the ambience. life gives way, now i shall breeze along the path to what may be unknown but certainly not intimidating.

energy is eternal delight-- william blakeenergy to me, is ... i.unquantifiable vigour, struggling to break loose, overwhelming my own self.outgrowing grief and dodging tough spots. does all this verve help?sometimes it does. others, it cuts you in halves, when you want to cry and all you could do is laugh. could give anything to wipe that smile off your face and be able to cry, endlessly.there's nothing that hurts more than the tears that only come up to the corners of the eye and then jab their way down the throat.yet... energy is eternal delight 'coz william blake's a dead poet and i'm a nobody and still alive!

men are nobody.i don't like them.they are like corns under your feet, they begin to hurt a little into the journey, ending up hurting you more than you can imagine little pieces of skin can be capable of.women only tolerate creatures as outrageous as men coz they're the absolute father figure. they father their kids.

seems like old times when women used to do the crying...am i truly satan personified, the way they make me feel?do i commit a sin saving myself from falling into the pit of darkness?i'm so bloody sick of being a freak magnet, or is it my skill that i turn men into freaks.where did the oh-so-chivalrous men go? or am i too caught up in the fairy tale-ish think bubble of a prince charming riding across the wilderness and saving me from the demons?hell, no more! won't take this any more...i am my own prince charmingtime out!

losing trust ... lost it altogether.gone to the either extreme but my own self outshines the grotesque experienced and weathered reflex of my brain every now and then. and then it hurts. inside me i still feel like trusting everyone who approaches me with a smile. my brain almost beats me up to a coma when i try doing that. i don't trust them, if i tell them, it'll come to them as a blow and i can't be so cruel.used to being cruel just to myselfmy own self...

no flowery prose, just what i couldn’t hold back…god, i’ve never felt this greedy in my life. a greed for his sense of prescience and foresight. wish he was my own true brother. maybe god didn’t give me one because he was taken already. the big guy up there knows me, won’t settle for second best!i wish i had his sense of knowing what people are made of. this is one thing i lack. he is such an inspiration. my dreams, my tantrums and seemingly stupid visions since childhood, today’s session tells me, i’m not brewing a pot of stones, not building a cobweb of fairytales to keep my fantasy land alive. tantrums come to life if you work on them. work work work. just gave me a boost. i can achieve what i dream of. i can, and i will. and one day i’ll go up to him and tell him, i owe this to you.

hey big guy up there? makin everythin' go round;is this it?we all have our own thresholds, our own limits, our own set of rules eh?why do some people get away with so much and the rest?run off with the gringotts' gold medallions and move on, try sneaking off with a dime and ye gets caught right by the collar that's ready to fall off on its own!but then the gold taketh thy glee and the torn collar keeps the glint in the eye alive... not a bad deal!

what you see, you believe notwhat it seems, it deems notyou see and cower from it, pass it by like a pebble by the roadside, talk of the weather instead. when it comes blowing down the building, you stand and watch in remorse. why the awe, why the surprise, why astonishment? you saw it coming you un-saw it. it breaks your back, suits you well enough.thy shalt not get what thee did not give out, baby!i'm being cruel? why who isn't? isn't that what life's all about? being thrown down here, out of the heavens.butthat too was a punishment wasn't it ... ?

such a pot pourri of thoughts, bubbling in the cauldron of what i hold high upon my shoulders. i don't know what to think. what i should be thinking, stifles and chokes me, harrowing me to the coming alive of some darkest possible consequences. however, what fancies my attention is what i shouldn't be thinking. but why shouldn't? i don't know, this guilt, this unknown feel of ... but it's not wrong... does everything that makes me happy, have to be wrong?

i exist for myself and my allah. whatever, whoever comes in my way, i'll help them, love them if it doesn't unlove me. but nothing will hinder me ever again from keeping myself and god happy.satan will keep a close eyeand maybe at times, he'll win too, but from this day forth, two will play this game!

iron jawed angelsthis movie based on nothing but sheer history today, gives me a reason to live. what do i bawl my eyes out for? i stood up to my husband, put my foot down, breaking loose because i found out he wasn’t exactly the person i had perceived him to be? a few suitcases of clothes gone to waste, some matching shoes to go with them and jewels for the big day. and i have the audacity to call myself in trouble? i declare i’m the one in pain, betrayed by the man i loved to bits and that life seems meaning less, bull shit! alice paul, physically hurt, force fed through her hunger strike. 218 women in jail for obstructing traffic while they stood a quiet protest at the pavement outside the white house for the women sufferings and a demand for women votes in the united states. the senator’s wife, emily layton survives hunger strike, toughest possible situations in jail and custody of her two daughters by her democrat husband who does not approve of her siding with the suffragists.they accomplished what they set out for. they lived for their cause and were willing to die for it.“suffering women are worse than anti-suffragists” said alice paul. today, as i raise my voice against something i feel is not fair to me and i don’t feel like succumbing to it, i side with the suffragists. i stand next to alice paul, lucy burns and those 30 women that took it to their heart and soul to win the right for women to vote. to be part and parcel of the nation, not just for healing wounds and rolling out bandages but for taking pleasure in being a citizen of the united states. to ensure the comprehensive adaptation of democracy irrespective of any gender prejudice. all leading to the liberation and empowerment of the young girl, who grows up learning to take care of all around her but herself. making her realize, she has to take care of herself too. she deserves a place she likes in the play pen, she’s worthy of the front seat she wants at school, she ought to have the right to study what she wishes and be who she wants to be one day. she, earns a position befitting a man in this vicious gentleman’s world. she is human too.

man plans and god laughs at it. life slips away as if that's the way to be. but that's when you truly begin to live, once everything seems to be over and the little butterfly of hope flits out of sight. life begins when you actually think you're through with it.

something i scribbled quite some time ago ..."life is to endure what you loathe & to yearn for what you desire. your dreams are nothing but an infamy of your subconscious where your wants emerge and are eventually buried unfulfilled."
