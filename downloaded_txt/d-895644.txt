you'll learn to express yourself

shakespeare may have said that “all the world’s a stage,” but perhaps it’s also true that the stage is all the world. visual and performing arts education builds empathy, fosters teamwork and confidence, and encourages the kind of creative and collaborative thinking that students need to succeed.

you'll be part of the team

one of the great benefits of small school athletics is the chance to play a large role. fostering teamwork and a cooperative, but competitive, spirit, our athletic program allows for students to participate in ways they might not be able to in a larger program. we field eight sports, with teams at the varsity and jv levels. we also offer a wide array of pe courses, encouraging all students to be physically fit.

you'll find you

our students have a way of describing the unique, ineffable qualities that define our school. whether it's the tradition of "tea and toast" in the commons dining area, the sound of snapping that can be heard in community meeting to signify agreement, the piles of backpacks in the central plaza, or the ways that students feel welcomed and supported in being who they are, we just know it when we see it.

we believe
learning occurs best in the context of connected community 




 things are changing 
teenagers profoundly influence, and are influenced by, their classmates




wired to learn
during adolescence the mind is primed to absorb information, and the natural drive to take risks promotes learning. 




teachers are the difference
teachers can make or break a teen’s natural curiosity about the world  




exploration makes explorers
it's not practice makes perfect anymore. opportunities to stretch, be challenged, and take healthy risks are the foundation of deep learning 




now's the time
high school is too important a time to leave up to chance. teenagers have extraordinary capacities that are ready to emerge or could go dormant
