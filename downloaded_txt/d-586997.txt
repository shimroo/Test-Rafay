sara grew up in mill valley, ca in the foothills of mt. tamalpais, also known as “the sleeping lady.”



























doctoral candidate & sleep advocate



in her early childhood, sara developed severe chronic insomnia. in her search to find support for her own condition, she dedicated a lifetime to exploring techniques that were said to support sleep. she has been teaching these practices since 1995. in 2021 she developed a class called “sleep for peak performance,” which she taught as a credit class at the university of southern california for 3 years. with permission from the institutional review board, she gathered data on the efficacy of the course on the undergraduates. her doctoral dissertation, titled “in search of sleep,” analyzes the data of this study and provides historical and cultural background on yoga, breathwork, and meditation for sleep. in the spring of 2024, sara began teaching the course at stanford university in the department of living education (sled). she hopes to defend her dissertation spring of 2025.
