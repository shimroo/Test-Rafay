            do you think indiana should pass the proposed bill that would ban student ids as a form of voter id?










a bill moving through the indiana legislature proposes that the state no longer allow student ids to be used to obtain a ballot. according to campusvoteproject.org, only 12 states do not allow the use of some student ids as voter id. and georgia, indiana, and wyoming only accept state university and college id cards, and indiana’s public institutions’ ids must contain expiration dates.
