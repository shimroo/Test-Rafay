  thank you to our partners  










canada, as we know it today, is steeped in rich indigenous history and modern traditions. from coast to coast to coast, we acknowledge the ancestral and unceded territory of the first nations, inuit and métis people, who call this land home, and thank them for being stewards of the traditional territories that now comprise canada.
