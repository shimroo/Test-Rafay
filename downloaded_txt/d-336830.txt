student testimonials
 







my experiences at pickens have been very exceptional. here is the place you want to be because the professors take their time in teaching the material and prepare us for when we get into the real world. the professors make sure they are available when help is needed and provide a great source of information on what respiratory therapy means.


                            cynthia auguste-brooks - post secondary, respiratory therapy                        











i promise you, although it may not be a university, this technical school is a huge milestone to include. the professors are amazing and lead you towards your educational goals. if you are unsure or afraid, trust me this school will lead you in the right direction.


                            alejandro bernal campos - post secondary, respiratory therapy                        











my experience at pickens has been great! when it comes to education the instructors go above and beyond to make sure you gain the education you signed up for.


                            jessica anderson - post secondary, multimedia graphic design                        











i have thoroughly enjoyed my experience at pickens. i have already gotten so much value from my time here. as a student still in highschool pickens has truly set me up for success. there is so much value in each program here at pickens, because each instructor is astounding in their respective career field.


                            samuell zornes - high school, multimedia graphic design                        











getting to see the class in person and learning what it means to be a machinist really caught my attention. being a machinist is much more than what it sounds like. plus the amount of money you can make in this industry is insane!


                            scarlet montano - post secondary, advanced manufacturing                        











i chose this program because i've always had an interest in making things and i am very excited to learn and start my career in this field.


                            nick engblom - post secondary, advanced manufacturing                        











it’s a good school, i like my teacher, and it’s helpful. thank you for making good students and helping people with everything.


                            tigist nega - high school, cosmetology                        











it's very helpful that pickens gave me the opportunity to take the class while still in high school, it’s going to benefit me very much and give me a head start to my career. i enjoy it very much.


                            caterina palazzolo - high school, cosmetology                        











the program is definitely hands-on, and you get to see the work once it is done. you also get to interact with the tools that are used to create the buildings as well, so you know exactly how it was actually built. both your interaction and knowledge will be useful in the work field in the future. me entering this workfield makes me feel a lot better than working with something like computers since i definitely prefer working with my hands, and most of the program is hands-on and most of the time we’re working in the field.


                            david eastwood jr. - post secondary, construction technology                        











if you come to the school, if you want to learn, you can come here to learn it. when people come here, they know what they want to do. they have a lot of programs here, you can build your knowledge, you can take whatever you want and learn.


                            merhawi mogos - post secondary, technology                        











i really enjoy this class. it offers everything i could ask for and with the hands-on experience it really helps better my learning.


                            tanner wells - post secondary, automotive technology                        











the motorcycle technology program is a great hands on program, you get to do things in the first week coming here. and you get to meet other people like you and might become friends with them.


                            izaiah kelly - motorcycle service technology                        











during my time in the motorcycle technology program, i have gained many skills and techniques that i otherwise would not have gained without my professors' help and ingenuity.


                            bryce riggen - post secondary, motorcycle service technology                        











as a year 2 student at pickens dental assisting i’ve had the pleasure of meeting tons of new people and it's an exciting new experience every day. the dental class is the start to a new beginning and it is very exciting and fun!


                            ivan ponce silva - post secondary, dental assisting                        











as a high school student being able to have this experience is great, especially with the help of our teachers! knowing that once i'm out of high school i will be guaranteed a job within the field i chose makes this experience even better!


                            yendy flores - high school, dental assisting
