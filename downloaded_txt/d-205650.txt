your gift to the young marines will help strengthen the lives of america's youth. it's a gift that will help our young people learn the importance of self-confidence, academic achievement, honoring the contributions of america's veterans, good citizenship, community service, and a how to live a healthy, drug-free lifestyle. no matter the size of your budget, you can make a difference by providing financial support or contributions-in-kind.

living healthy & drug free
the young marines “closing the gate on drugs” initiative focuses our drug demand reduction efforts on raising awareness of common gateway drugs (tobacco, alcohol, inhalants, prescription drugs and marijuana) that are either in homes or neighborhoods and are most often encountered and easily accessed by children and young adults. 

closing the gate on drugs!




our history 

since the young marines' humble beginnings in 1959 with one unit and a handful of boys, the organization has grown to 236 units with over 5,000 youth and over 1,950 adult volunteers in 40 states, the district of columbia, japan and affiliates in a host of other countries.
