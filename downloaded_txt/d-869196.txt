rebates on home loans

              normally a borrowerâ pays fees, loan pointsâ and costs up front. a   rebate is a fee paid the lenderâ to theâ real estate broker involved in   brokeringâ a loan resulting in aâ higher interest rate on the   loan.â 

              we can transfer part of theâ  rebateâ to you   theâ borrower to cover the closing cost for a home purchase loan or home   loan refinance. 

              rebatesâ are also used to compensate the real estate broker   instead of the borrower paying the fees directly from their own bank accounts   for their home loan.â  

              using rebates along with a good strategy allows   borrowers to cover closing costs and fees.

an example of a rebate;for a 30 year fixed rate on a fha home loan of $350,000 at 3.25% (3.85apr) would provide a rebate of 1% rebate or $3,500 to cover closing cost. the same loan at 3.5% (4.05apr) would provide a rebate of 2% or $7,000 to cover closing cost and fees. in this example the borrower could get $7,000 to cover closing cost at rate of  3.5% verses  $3,500 at 3.25%. the difference in payment is $48 per month.
