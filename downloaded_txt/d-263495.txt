testimonial



 
“it’s great to have a pool that keeps on top of new joints while giving the same attention to classics and deeper cuts from many eras and styles. the beat junkies pool reminds me of the things i have in my own record boxes, as well as what i forgot about or didn’t even know. it’s the beat junkie sound, you already know!”

- nick bike


 
“there is no other record pool in the game providing its members quality digs, rare gems, and specially curated content like beatjunkies.com. it’s like uncovering your favorite dj’s hidden crates, i feel like i score every time!”

- bella fiasco
