my miracle son was born at 26 weeks, weighing only one pound 2 ounces and barely 12 inches long. after four months in the nicu, he came home on oxygen for his first year. this was before the internet, so i was extremely isolated. as the internet evolved, i became more and more involved in providing in online support so other parents would not have to endure this isolation. i have had wonderful interactions and  provided support through a wonderful, very active former group preemie-l, my preemie-child group for older preemies, and my websites. my son been effected by almost every possible result of prematurity. as a result of intense research and interactions with parents, older preemies, doctors, nurses, authors, nicu personal and many other professionals while i raised my son, i learned a tremendous amount about premature birth and its aftermath. this website takes you through the gamut of prematurity impacts - from the nicu through childhood and adulthood. the companion site children's disabilities information provides information on many of the special needs diagnoses preemies may experience as they grow up.
