silver is a natural, universal antibiotic.

 today, the multiple properties of silver have never been so sought after: in the 2000's more than 500 tons of nanosilver were produced each year in the world in the form of silver ions, silver proteins or colloids in order to be used in the cosmetic, medical or industrial field.
