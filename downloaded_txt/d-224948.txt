								total landscapes client testimonials
								

had an entire front and side yard landscaping re-do and design - excellent! ... very responsive, honest, and works hard to do what you want. when crew came to do the work, they were fast, friendly, efficient and neat. impressed with the turnaround - most places you have to wait for weeks in between communication. here - you have a thought or question? boom - response, answer, action. very happy with the entire process and beautiful result! - julie p.

									my front yard, walkway and stairs look absolutely awesome. you can tell they take pride in their work.  they were great with all our changes and add-ons.  -  jane p.

									i called 2 weeks ago for an estimate for a winter clean up and 5 yards of mulch to be spread. the men representing total lawn & landscape arrived this morning to do the work. they were professional and courteous and did a great job! i would recommend total to anyone!  -  elaine t.
