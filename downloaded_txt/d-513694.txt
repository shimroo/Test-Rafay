colin datewe are very sad to announce that colin date our trustee and one of the founders of risc’s parent charity world education berkshire has passed away.colin’s work in education in the u.k. and abroad in africa had led him to work for risc. the charity was formed in the 1980’s to raise issues of global citizenship with communities across berkshire originally in a double decker bus before establishing a permanent base in london street, reading. after his retirement, he continued to be a trustee of risc in addition to volunteering in the world shop. his support for risc continued till the end. risc would like to offer their condolences to the family and friends of colin. may he rest in peace.
