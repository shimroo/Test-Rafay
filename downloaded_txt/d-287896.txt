fund a hero is the in-house fundraising platform of the peace officers research association of california (porac), specifically developed for law enforcement, by law enforcement. it is free to use for porac’s members and, unlike other crowdfunding platforms, charges no fees for launching a campaign. porac makes no profit from the fundraisers, meaning that 100% of the proceeds go to the officer or family in need.
