veterans transition house (vth) helps homeless and at-risk veterans and their families across southeastern massachusetts. we provide shelter and services, with a focus on healing from substance abuse and learning new life skills. vth is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit founded in 1990 by a group of vietnam veterans and community leaders who recognized the vital need for housing and supportive services for homeless and at-risk veterans. our goal is the rehabilitation, self-sufficiency and reintegration of each veteran into the community. it’s our belief that the veterans we serve seek a hand up, not a handout.
