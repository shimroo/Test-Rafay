machinery & equipment for the wire, cable and tube industries














we are a uk based company who manufacture and supply machinery and equipment for the wire, cable & tube industry. established in 1966 with nearly 60 years of experience, marldon provides a wide range of solutions, including traverse units, air wipes, chalk applicators, winders, take-ups, and coilers. our products are designed to provide reliable performance, consistent winding tension, and high-quality output. marldon's products are known for their durability, low maintenance, and ease of use with our key products airwipes and traverse units offering key distinctive advantages over other manufacturers in the industry.



key benefits of marldon productsat marldon, we take pride in producing high-quality air wipes and traverse units that offer unparalleled performance and efficiency for cable processing operations. here are just a few key benefits of our products:air wipesflexibility: our air wipes feature variable cable path orifice diameters, allowing a single unit to accommodate a wide range of cable diameters with equal effectiveness. this eliminates the need for multiple units, reducing costs and streamlining operations.efficiency: our air wipes are designed to blow debris and moisture from the surface of a material as it passes through a production line. this helps to ensure the quality of the product and prevents damage to the machinery.traverse unitsdurability: our traverse units stand out from the competition with their unique solid one-piece housing, which includes load-carrying bushings fixed onto the shaft. this design feature ensures maximum durability and reliability, even under heavy loads.flexibility: the driving system of our traverse units is independent of the housing, providing enhanced operational flexibility and versatility.we offer a wide range of air wipes and traverse units to suit the needs of various industries, including food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, and printing. in addition, we have a team of experienced engineers who can design and build bespoke solutions to meet the specific needs of your production line.if you're looking for high-quality air wipes and traverse units that offer flexibility, efficiency, and durability, look no further than marldon. contact us today to learn more.

traversing units

traversing units are equipment or mechanisms used for the movement of wire, cable, or tubing during manufacturing processes. these units traverse back and forth along a path and perform functions such as guiding, winding, coating, extrusion, and cutting.

airwipes

airwipes are devices used to remove or wipe excess materials such as water, oil, dust, or other contaminants from the surface of wire, cable, or tubing. air wipes use compressed air to create an airflow that surrounds the material and removes any unwanted substances on its surface.

chalk applicators

chalk applicators, also known as chalkers, are devices used in the wire, cable, and tube industries to mark or coat material with chalk or other marking materials. they are typically used during the manufacturing process to indicate points of interest, such as where to cut, bend, or splice a wire or cable.

payoff systems

payoff systems are devices used in the wire, cable, and tube industries to unwind and feed material, such as wire, cable, or tubing, from a large spool or coil onto a production line. these systems are an important part of the production process, as they ensure a continuous supply of material to the manufacturing equipment.

winders & take-ups

in the wire, cable, and tube industries, winding and take-off systems are used to manage the production of long lengths of material, such as wire, cable, or tubing, by winding them onto spools or take-off reels. these systems are an important part of the production process, as they help to efficiently process and package finished products for storage or shipping.

what our customers say





















"we have worked with marldon for over 15 years having purchased various machinery and equipment during this time. the quality is always excellent and the service we receive is impeccable!”

colwyn parry – operations manager cqr





just installed two marldon model 674 air wipes on a jacketing line for a cabled product. we run a different product od every day. this design is fantastic for adjusting to our needs. additionally, the hinged feature is perfect for start-ups and splices. a clever design that solves a lot of common problems. great product! 

russ johnson process engineer southwire company





we had still been using our original marldon traverse unit that was amazingly purchased way back in 1966 until it was unfortunately damaged, resulting in our production line having to be stopped. production downtime is highly costly to us here at autac and carries huge implications for our customers and supply chain which meant we needed to find an urgent solution. on speaking with michelle and the team at marldon, they were able to manufacture a new unit with the same bespoke roller assembly as our original one and all within a quick turnaround which meant our production was back up and running within a week. we would highly recommend michelle and the team.
