modeled math lessons
we have spent a lot of time spontaneously modeling lessons in classrooms. content knowledge allows us to take over a class and demonstrate the techniques we recommend.

 
years of experience
all of the years have been spent teaching k-8 grade mathematics. the ceo has taught every grade from k-8, for one full year each. we understand all the issues pertaining to each grade. our knowledge of the common core standards is based on putting them to action.

 
percentage of repeat customers
every customer that originally signed on for one day, or even a half-day, has asked us to come back for additional days.
