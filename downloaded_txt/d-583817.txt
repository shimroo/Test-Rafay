products
























band pass
band pass filters allow signals within a certain frequency range to pass, while rejecting or attenuating frequencies that fall outside that range. to meet customer specifications, timeframes, and cost requirements, k&l microwave offers a full line of band pass filters, that can be customized to meet varying frequencies, bandwidths and q requirements.

band reject
band reject filters pass most frequencies unaltered but attenuate those in a specific range to very low levels. typically, the width of the band reject is 1 to 2 decades. however, in the audio band, a notch filter has high and low frequencies that may be only semitones apart. all band reject filters or band stop filters made by k&l microwave are available as a wideband or narrowband components and can be customized to user specifications.

low pass
a filter that passes signals with a frequency lower than a selected cutoff frequency and attenuates signals with frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency. the exact frequency response of the filter depends on the filter design. the filter is sometimes called a high-cut filter, or treble-cut filter in audio applications. a low-pass filter is the complement of a high-pass filter.

high pass
a high pass electronic filter allows signals above a certain cutoff frequency to pass and attenuates signals with frequencies that fall below the cutoff. high pass filters can be used for multiple applications, such as blocking dc from circuitry sensitive to non-zero average voltages or radio frequency devices. mpg can customize a wide range of rf high pass filter topologies to meet multiple applications across industries.
