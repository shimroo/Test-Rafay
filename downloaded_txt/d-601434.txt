"we don’t take a trip. a trip takes us."– john steinbeck
many of us look to travel for a chance to discover not only the mysteries of our country, but also to find out something about ourselves. a quest for peace and quiet in a stressful world, a search for the beauty of nature not seen from our kitchen window, and the opportunity to meet new people are all part of the journey.

at phoenix usa we strive to produce a motorhome that will take you on that journey with comfort, safety and ease. by emphasizing quality craftsmanship and an attention to detail, our product serves as a way to experience the rv life you’ve dreamed about – all this while enjoying luxury features such as corian countertops, surround sound and solid wood cabinetry.
