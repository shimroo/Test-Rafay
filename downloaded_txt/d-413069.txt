serra’s objectives and purpose
founded in 1935 in seattle, washington, the apostolate contains over 12,500 members in 35 countries on 6 continents. with over 195 clubs (âministriesâ) in the us and 7,300 members, we are united with members around the world towards the following objectives:
to foster and promote vocations to ministerial priesthood in the catholic church and to support priests in their sacred ministry.
to encourage and affirm vocations by men and women to consecrated and religious life in the catholic church.

prayer for our priests
oh god, who wills not the death of a sinner, but rather that he be converted and live, grant, we beseech thee, through the intercession of blessed junipero serra and all the saints, an increase in laborers for your church – fellow laborers with christ to spend themselves for souls, through the same jesus christ, your son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the holy spirit, one god, forever and ever. amen.
