my clients are seekers, someone who is working on themselves to become more self-aware, or perhaps trying to understand how they fit into the craziness of the world. they may be experiencing "spiritual emergencies," nde's, having out of body experiences or psychic episodes. most of their issues go beyond day to day problems. they may also have the desire to find the "root" cause of their health problems, and/or attempting to heal and bring their body into balance.working with your unconscious through relaxation and imagery is a rich process that enables you to discover a deeper level of who you really are. at the same time you are learning to relax and to control your anxiety.if you are willing to step into the unknown, to uncover the shadow parts of yourself, to learn how everything is connected, and to take control of your anxiety and worries, i invite you to join me in exploring the vastness of the universe within yourself.  i often tell people that i am just the flight attendant. the journey is theirs to explore.



my journey toward self-awareness began in the early ’80s when working as an analyst for the virginia attorney general, i had a precognitive experience that was so detailed and accurate that it changed the way i saw reality. this single event ignited my search to discover who and what i am and to question the nature of reality. to this day, i continue that search. along the way i have taught medical intuition and the intuitive process. currently, i co-facilitate the course "medical intuition and dreams that can save your life" at the monroe institute in virginia.  the process that i use with my clients comes from personal experience, beginning when i was a research subject in the exploration of consciousness. my belief is that talk therapy is limited. it merely helps us stay sane. it is a way to prepare the ground but that's all. by using simple tools (relaxation, dreams, imagery) we uncover the richness of who you are and we go beyond therapy.

i can’t keep silent



dec 26, 2021




winter solstice is that time of the year when the sun and light, return to the earth. maybe this year the return of light will shed light on our shadow, that part of ourselves we try to ignore—keep hidden from ourselves. i’ve been thinking about this a lot recently and i am beginning to think that these days we are collectively seeing more of our shadow, that part of ourselves that is selfish, mean, narcissistic, angry and controlling.

intuition is inconvenient



may 11, 2021




lately, i have noticed that my pace of life is out of step with my inner core. i always seem to be too busy to stop and read, or sit watching the birds. with spring on our doorstep life has become even busier with the outside world straining to gain my attention. i have gardens to prepare and plant, chickens to protect from foxes, and lots of cleaning, painting and discarding of the old that needs to get done. i can easily justify that i will get around to paying attention to my intuition once “x” is done (and we all know that “x” is never ending).that said, i have been revisiting the concept of intuition and how i manage to ignore her. how many times have i had a clear hit about something i needed to do but didn’t, either because i just didn’t want to or it was inconvenient at the time? or more likely, my intuition was advising against something that i really wanted to do.
