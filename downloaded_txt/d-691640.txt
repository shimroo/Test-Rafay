the racing post 
was a monthly magazine dedicated to
    those who ride bicycles and like to ride them - fast.  from 2005 to 
	2017:  event coverage
    includes road racing, off-road racing, track racing, triathlons, bicycle rallies,
    and all levels of bicycle training.  it contains everything about the
    bikes and equipment people use while riding them.
