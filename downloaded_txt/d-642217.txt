why choosereal wood?
choosing the right flooring is a big decision so it’s important to get it right. there are plenty of reasons to choose a real wood floor, but these are our top 3.





                                                    it’s beautiful                                                







it might sound obvious, but as the foundation of any room in your home we believe that flooring has to be beautiful before it is anything else. real wood is arguably one of the most beautiful flooring options available. it ages beautifully too, looking even better with time – something that can’t be said for many other flooring options.






                                                    it’s practical                                                







in a busy family home, flooring that’s practical as well as beautiful is a must. we’re often asked whether wood floors are durable or difficult to maintain, and we’re pleased to say that ours are both hard-wearing and easy to care for. our high-performance finishes will only need a little tlc to keep them looking showroom beautiful for years to come.






                                                    it’s sustainable                                                







wood is arguably the ultimate sustainable resource so long as the forests it comes from are managed responsibly. as a natural material it requires relatively little processing, and as well as lasting for generations, it can be reclaimed or recycled easily. all of our timber comes from sustainably managed european forests, most of which are pefc or fsc certified and have been visited by us.

cosy season is certainly upon us this week with the arrival of colder, wetter weather and shorter daylight hours.it’ll soon be time to turn on the heating (if you haven’t already) so we thought we’d share a few tips about underfloor heating and wood floors.if you have a wood floor over underfloor heating, don’t be tempted to wait until it’s really cold and then turn the heating on full blast. this can put your floor under stress and cause abnormal movement. turn it on a little earlier, and increase the temperature gradually over a couple of days to give it time to adjust to the change in seasons and humidity levels in the house (which reduce as the air is artificially heated and the windows stay closed).we also find this helps the humans in the house adjust to the change too 😀we’ve been successfully making floors to be fitted over underfloor heating for over 20 years, so if you have any questions about combining the two, please feel free to drop them in the comments or give one of our showrooms a call..pictured: burford vintage parquet, cotswold collection.#broadleaf #broadleaftimber #parquet #parquetflooring #parquetfloor #oakfloor #oakflooring #underfloorheating #flooringadvice #flooringexpert #madeintheuk #interiorinspo #interiordecor #interiordesigner #interiordesign #herringbonefloor #readyforautumn #underfloorheatingtips #vintagefloor #solidwoodflooring #solidwoodfloor #heating #underfloorheatingadvice

we are often asked whether our floors will be cold to walk on in bare feet, especially by clients who are considering replacing carpet or upgrading from laminate which they’ve found cold.we’re pleased to say that wood is a natural insulator so our floors won’t get cold like stone or tile and will stay a comfortable temperature to walk on. underfloor heating will make them a little warmer, but you certainly don’t need this to stop them feeling chilly on your toes.real wood is also wonderfully tactile, even without added surface texture, so it feels lovely under bare feet. most people find that they walk barefoot more often once after they fitted one of our floors.if you’d like to order some samples to try for yourself, please visit our website or head to your nearest broadleaf showroom, where you can also walk on our floors in-situ......#broadleaf #broadleaftimber #parquet #parquetflooring #parquetfloor #oakfloor #oakflooring #underfloorheating #flooringadvice #flooringexpert #madeintheuk #interiorinspo #interiordecor #realwoodfloor #realwoodflooring #interiordesign #herringbonefloor #woodflooring #solidwoodflooring #solidwoodfloor #flooringshowroom #flooringideas #flooringquestionsanswered # #biophillicdesign #walkonwood #renovation #restoration

gyms and fitness studios need to be practical, but in homes and hotels we also want them to be inviting and have more of a wellness feel about them. in this case, real wood is the perfect choice of floor.it creates a sense of warmth and luxury that can’t be matched by tile or vinyl, as well as sense of well-being now widely recognised through our inherent connection with nature and natural materials.it’ll take the impact from workouts, stand up to dings and scrapes from dropped equipment and easily bear the load of heavy machinery like treadmills and rowing machines. it’s also very stable underfoot so makes a fantastic platform for functional and strength training.our favourite part is that it’ll also improve acoustics which can otherwise be difficult to achieve in rooms with no soft furnishings or textiles to soften sound.if you’d like to discuss an upcoming project, please get in touch. for commercial projects, contact commercial@broadleaftimber.com...#broadleaf #broadleaftimber #plank #plankflooring #plankfloor #oakfloor #oakflooring #flooringadvice #flooringexpert #madeintheuk #interiorinspo #interiordecor #interiordesigner #interiordesign #woodflooring #solidwoodflooring #solidwoodfloor #woodfloor #engineeredwoodfloor #engineeredwoodflooring #commercialwoodflooring #boutiquehotel #gymfloor #commercialflooring #hotelgym #homegym #wellness #biophillicdesign

this wonderfully tactile floor is quarry bank from our old house collection. it is made in our factory in west wales and combines two of our favourite ageing techniques to create its authentic vintage style.first, we add cross-sawn markings to the face of the boards reminiscent of those that were once created by rustic production machinery. it’s a skilled process to get them looking right, but we think its worth it.each board is then gently aged using our unique brushed & burned treatment to create a soft patina on its surface and a natural darkening from edge to edge. this responds to the grain and depth of the timber so that no board is exactly the same and the completed floor has a really natural feel that we love.we named it quarry bank after the fabulous cotton mill in cheshire, preserved by the national trust that inspired its design.if you’d like to see some samples, please visit one or our showrooms or order some via our website....#broadleaf #broadleaftimber #plank #plankflooring #plankfloor #oakfloor #oakflooring #underfloorheating #flooringadvice #flooringexpert #madeintheuk #interiorinspo #interiordecor #agedfloors #agedwoodfloors #reclaimedoakfloor #reclaimedoak #interiordesign #woodflooring #solidwoodflooring #solidwoodfloor #woodfloor #engineeredwoodfloor #engineeredwoodflooring #reclaimedstyle #quarrybank #nationaltrust #heritagefloors

buying a real wood floor can seem a daunting prospect, especially if you haven’t done it before. here are our expert tips on how to get it right.start with what you like.do you instinctively prefer plank or parquet? what tone of flooring are you more instantly drawn to ? do you want a rustic or more elegant style in the room ?next think about your architecture.you can’t go wrong if you choose a floor that suits the architecture of your property – it’ll be timeless and work long term regardless of whether the decor changes around it.buy the best you can.with wood flooring as with most things, you get what you pay for. responsible sourced, expertly dried and machined timber isn’t cheap, and nor are beautiful, durable finishes. flooring typically takes more wear than anything else in a room and is more difficult to change, so its worth paying for quality. it also costs the same to fit cheaper and more expensive flooring, and which means that often a headline difference in price per m2 is not as much as you might think when you look at the project as a whole.if you’ve got any questions about buying wood flooring, contact one of our showrooms or pop them below in the comments......#broadleaf #broadleaftimber #plank #plankflooring #plankfloor #oakfloor #oakflooring #underfloorheating #flooringadvice #flooringexpert #madeintheuk #interiorinspo #interiordecor #flooringdesign #floorchoices #interiordesign #homesandgardens #beautifulhomes #biophilicdesign #woodflooring #solidwoodflooring #solidwoodfloor #woodfloor #engineeredwoodfloor #engineeredwoodflooring

we always recommend visiting a showroom before choosing your wood flooring, and here’s why:1.      find inspiration: our showrooms showcase plank, parquet, solid and engineered wood floors in a fabulous choice of colours and styles. you may go in with an idea of what you want but find you’re drawn to something completely different. keep an open mind and see where inspiration leads you.2.     walk on in-situ floors: this is the easiest way to understand how different options look, feel and evolve over time, and the best way to truly appreciate their quality.3.     view large sample boards: they’re a fantastic way to help you visualise what the floor will look like at scale once it’s laid, which can be tricky to imagine from images and hand samples alone.4.     receive expert tips and advice: our experienced showroom teams are wood flooring experts and love sharing their knowledge. they can advise on products and design, help you make the most out of your budget, and provide useful guidance on all parts of the process from selection to installation and beyond.5.     experience quality customer service: our team take pride in delivering excellent service and will make sure your broadleaf experience is enjoyable, smooth and as easy as possible. they’ll listen to your needs and help you find the right floor, organise samples, arrange quotes, and look after your order from start to finish.we have beautiful broadleaf showrooms in multiple locations across the uk. to find your nearest, please visit our website.#broadleaf #broadleaftimber #plankfloor #parquet #parquetflooring #parquetfloor #oakfloor #oakflooring #underfloorheating #flooringadvice #flooringexpert #madeintheuk #interiorinspo #interiors #interiordecor #interiordesigner #interiordesign #flooringsamples #woodflooring #solidwoodflooring #solidwoodfloor #engineeredwoodfloor #engineeredwoodflooring #showroom #reelsinstagram

“how difficult is it to look after your wood floors ?”. the answer is “not at all” thanks to our high-performance finishes and specially formulated maintenance products.caring for our wood flooring is very similar to looking after tile or natural stone. simply sweep or vacuum to remove dust and grit, then wash with our nourishing wood floor cleaner. designed to feed the floor finish as it cleans, this maintains resistance and doesn’t dry out or strip the natural oils like more aggressive mass produced floor cleaning products designed for varnished or lacquered floors.follow from time to time with our quick and easy wood floor wax to restore lustre, fix small scratches and protect your floor finish from day to day wear and tear.it really is as simple as that, and you can pick up wood floor cleaner and wax from our showrooms or order them on our website – link in bio.if you have any questions on looking after our wood floors, or about their durability, do pop them in the comments or drop us a message.
