special needs dobermans!



















we 
  are an all-volunteer organization of people with a common goal of helping senior 
  and special needs doberman pinschers. that need may be financial for doberman 
  rescue groups, or it may be only information and/or moral support for the owner 
  of a doberman with a serious illness or injury. we will also aid rescue groups 
  in rehoming and fostering senior dobermans they may place under their care. 
  the financial aid we provide may come from donations, occasional online auctions 
  or snd store sales. every precaution is taken to assure that the need is real. 
  snd maintains an "every penny" rule which guarantees that 100% of 
  donations to the care of dobermans is used only for that purpose. administrative 
  costs are covered with proceeds from our online store, by designated donations 
  and by occasional auctions specifically for that purpose.

the 
            senior doberman project
special 
            needs dobermans recognizes the difficulty in placing aging dobermans 
            in loving homes. doberman rescue groups have worked tirelessly to 
            save and care for these precious creatures, and we would like to help 
            you find them forever homes. we publicize the plight of senior dobes 
            in addition to creating a national database and website dedicated 
            to senior dobes in need of families. special needs dobermans senior 
            doberman project provides the website for rescue groups for publicizing 
            their senior dobes’ needs. the doberman community is truly reaching 
            out to address this crucial cause. please visit our page at www.doberman911.org/seniors.

 meet 
            mr. bubba !!
 
bubba the brave, stick hunter !!
click 
            my picture above and visit my page!! 
            and... he'd love sponsors while he's enjoying life!!
this 
            gem is a forever foster request from his owner because she became 
            ill and is in hospice care. his previous owner is a long time doberman 
            advocate and rescuer. his best friend is mr. bean and they go everywhere 
            together. he has become quite active since arriving and is looking 
            good. his hair is also starting to grow back. bubba is quite bonded 
            to papa now and is very attentive. bubba had a reputation for behavioral 
            issues but he’s had no issues here. it was said he is protective 
            and will approach strangers and secure their hand or arm with his 
            mouth until told to release. he’s been a dream here at the rescue..  
            visit him here: https://doberman911.org/seniors/cases/nm_bubba.html 
            and then send him some sponsorship love!!! 
you 
            can learn more about bubba
and many other 
            seniors who need your support by going to https://www.doberman911.org/seniors/cases. 
            here you can also help doberman rescues across the country with their 
            seniors by sponsoring a senior doberman for $40 per month or $480 
            per year. our goal is to encourage rescues to take in more seniors 
            by helping them with the day to day expenses for routine medical care 
            or just extras like nice comfy beds and toys to make their golden 
            years the best yet. it's a great way to honor the lives of these older 
            dobermans, many of whom never knew  love or care 
            during their younger years.
if 
            you have any questions about bubba 
            or any of our other beautiful seniors, please email us at seniors@doberman911.org. 
            thank you for your support !!

the 
            senior medical assistance program

 

special 
            needs dobermans has placed a special focus on fundraising efforts 
            to assist senior dobermans with their medical needs. having provided 
            a lifetime of love, devotion, and loyalty, these seniors now find 
            that they are faced with increasing debilitating medical problems. 
            these loving seniors may be with a rescue group and seeking a forever 
            homes or they may be in hospice care with their rescueangels. since 
            the financial burden of providing necessary medical treatments is 
            sometimes beyond the means of their caregivers, they apply to snd 
            for financial assistance. while snd lists seniors in need on our general 
            fund page, we must help seniors by reaching out to the doberman 
            community by raising funds for the seniors 
            medical fund.  this fund is exclusively for senior dobes 
            in the care of rescue groups.   here are four beautiful seniors 
            who have benefited from this great program:
