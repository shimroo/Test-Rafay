fused & painted glassannouncing the launch of our new fused and painted glass!
relkie art glass is proud to announce the launch of their new, innovative hanging art glass!  taking glass into a totally new dimension!
having had to work within the borders of rectangles and squares for 40 years, (doors, windows) i have decided to break those barriers and use irregular shapes for a more exciting canvas. 
hang them in front of any window or sidelite.  have that horrible privacy glass in you bathroom, spice them up with colour and design! all glass purchased come supplied with 2 mounting hooks. (two hooks are used to prevent the artwork from twirling and swaying.)
prices include shipping within canada.
measurements are length x height, as seen in the picture.
now you can own a original relkie artwork! call 250-714-6399 to order, or neil@relkieartglass.com
