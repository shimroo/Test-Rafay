"christmas is a dark and disturbing time for me..."

dave t takes us back to his childhood, when he was given the special responsibility of keeping his sibling’s christmas gift a secret. but, true to his nature, young dave couldn’t hold back and accidentally blurted out the surprise! this mistake led to a surprising twist—adults started lying to him about the gifts so he couldn’t spoil the fun anymore.

"to stalk or not stalk..."

when lauren stumbled across nick’s instagram, she couldn’t resist going on a date with him because of his picture of him playing the trumpet and tree climbing. intrigued, she decided to meet him—just for the story.

but when nick showed up in disney gear, smelling… off, and revealing he didn’t have a job, the story took an unexpected twist. what happened next? you’ll have to see it to believe it. 👀
