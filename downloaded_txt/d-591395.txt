if you have a bee problem, you may need to contact a professional bee removal services company. these services offer relocation of bee hives that are causing problems. unless you have the proper equipment and knowledge, it’s very dangerous to attempt to try to remove problem bee hives yourself.
professional services offer safe removal at reasonable prices. to find professional removal services, you can search online, talk to local farmers or gardeners, or ask friends or family for information on who to call. it’s important to make sure that you call someone certified and licensed to remove bees safely. professionals expect to be asked to see their certifications or licensees, and you’re not offending them by asking for their credentials. you’ll also want to make sure that the removalists are properly insured. this is important in case there are any damages done to your home during the removal process.

it’s also wise to contact several different removal services and get quotes. ask them what their services entail, whether the bees are destroyed or relocated; reputable companies will relocate bees rather than exterminate them. if the company you contact isn’t willing to give you answers, it’s wise to go on to the next company.
bees can be very aggressive when they think that they are being threatened. it’s important to know what to expect as well as any safety measures during the removal process. how does the removal company protect the residents of the home during the removal process? do they require everyone to be out of the home? what safety measures are in place to protect others on the property during the removal?
get everything in writing. you’ll want a removal contract, and you’ll want to read over it very carefully before you sign it. not all removal companies are the same. understand the steps taken to remove the bees and our costs. if you don’t understand something, ask for clarification before you sign the contract.
find out if any special preparations are required before the removal date. understand whether or not you’ll need to be out of the house. if you have to be out of the house, can you be elsewhere on the property? a good bee removal services company will be fully disclosing in the details.
read reviews of other customers of the company that you choose. customer reviews are important. you’ll be able to learn if other customers were satisfied with their services. you’ll also be able to learn about any complaints that the other customers have had. this is a great way to avoid a disreputable company. if there are complaints about the services, did the company make any effort to resolve the complaints? this should be readily seen in the review.
does the company offer emergency services? if you have someone in the house who is allergic to bees, you may wish to have emergency services rather than wait until such a time as the company can schedule the removal for you. consider all of your options before you make your decision.

live bee removal process

the live bee removal process

bees play a significant role in the environment. they pollinate our crops, allowing food to grow. beehives are usually rented by growers to help with pollination of their crops. honey bee numbers have been decreasing for many years. hence, in case you are going through a bee problem it is recommended to eradicate them while not killing them. live bee removal is necessary in this situation.
bee removal as well as relocation services for live bees will remove the bees safely out of your yard and take them to a bee farm or apiary where they will flourish. it’s not just the best strategy to control the bees but also an economical way to safeguard your family as well as belongings from the possible threat of getting bees in your garden.
what does a live bee removal service entail?
bee removal experts – live bee removal – remove bees from your roof, chimney, cavity wall or any other area of your home. these live bee removals are usually done on-site and shift the live colony to a more conducive spot, such as in hives or an apiary.
to do these live honey bee removals, several sophisticated techniques will allow the technicians to remove entire colonies from their location without harming the bees or destroying the structure.
live honey bee removal also includes the removal of the comb and honey, aside from the bees themselves. this is very important as when left in place, the residual mass, which includes honey stores, brood (bee larvae), and wax comb can cause problems in the future. without the nurse bees to look after them, the brood will die as well as decompose if not taken out, and this could cause foul odor and potential staining.
in addition, the honey stores that remain may also run and likely add on to the mess. down the road, you may encounter other pest problems like clothes moths or carpet beetles or you may encounter mice, ants or something even worse. if the colony and dead bees have gathered under the hive, they must be removed completely and thoroughly to prevent this from happening.
the live bee removal process
during removal, most of the first defensive bees are put in a bee box and the remaining nurse bees and worker bees are kept on the brood. the brood is then cut out with the nurse beads and placed into special boxes.
the brook is kept at the correct temperature during relocation as a result of this. occasionally, heat pads may be used when it’s too cold. the remaining colony is removed and the walls are scraped down to eliminate as much wax as possible. the colony area is vacuumed as often as possible to remove any fallen or dead bees. any remaining flying bees around the area are vacuumed into the bee box.
professional live bee removal services are your best option in case you have bees living on your property. all our clients receive fair prices with no hidden charges. we also provide a rapid response time and emergency removal service during the weekend and after-hours hours.

advantages of bee keeping

posted on january 16, 2024 by shannon hoffman 

of late, bees have come into the spotlight and become a hot-button issue. our natural honey-making creatures are dying, and their numbers are steadily dwindling. with the survival rate of bees being that low, epa has taken legislative action to safeguard bees and other essential pollinators from dangerous exposure. beekeeping enterprises like us are environmentally conscious and aim to preserve the livelihood of bees by using conscientious bee keeping methods.
some people may not fully comprehend what makes beekeeping so essential to the ecosystem. here are reasons why we are serious about the handling and conservation of bees.
health benefits
it’s common knowledge that bees are much loved because of their ability to make natural honey. honey is among the best-tasting natural things in the world. however, most people are unaware of the health benefits associated with consuming honey, including persons with allergies. taking honey can help people boost their immunity during allergy seasons.
pollination
bees can be an invaluable asset for your garden. if you grow flowers and veggies or harvest fruits, bee keeping can be an activity that greatly benefits your endeavors. honey bee pollination is perfect for any garden space and also assists the ecology to stay diverse as a result of external pollination. bees pollinate the majority of the vegetables and fruits ideal for human consumption. so, it’s only logical that beekeepers continually maintain a thriving environment for bees to multiply and do what they do best.
bee wax
with the massive traction around products such as burt’s bees, people have come to discover other diverse applications of beeswax. by taking up beekeeping, you could set yourself up to save more cash on a beneficial commodity that can be expensive at most farmer’s markets and stores. top applications for beeswax include making lip balm, candle making, soaps, hair care products and wood polish.
chemicals affect more than bees
extermination chemicals are specifically made to kill bees and essentially solve your bee problem. even though they are effective in their intended purpose, the lingering chemicals may have an adverse impact on more than simply the bees involved. using extermination tactics to get rid of bees can potentially cause some severe health complications for you, your kids, or your pets. at the same time, the fumes will remain in the air for a couple of hours after application, which is sufficient time to cause serious health problems for other occupants.
what do our beekeepers spray?
we actively work towards preserving the lives of bees, so we don’t use some of the conventional chemical products that are known to kill bees. our bee technicians stay up-to-date with the latest bee removal techniques to ensure bees are transported from your place to our apiary safely.
