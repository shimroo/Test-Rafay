having recently required the need of a high performance car on hire; i have used the services of pch, the level of service and expertise has been of the highest order , the vehicles provided were top quality and the response time superb. as the former owner of a premier league football club and the founder of octane car magazine i’m well versed in having high expectations and well experienced in high end cars and this experience with pch exceeded my expectations and i would not hesitate to recommend them on all fronts from price through to service.
