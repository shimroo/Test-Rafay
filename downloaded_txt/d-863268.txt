welcome to
toadman's tank pictures!
on this page you'll find a small portion of the more than 120,000 pictures of afv's, artillery, and soft skins that i have taken during the past several years.
please feel free to download the pictures posted on this site. if you like what you see, many of these photos are for sale as a downloadable file.  sometimes i have model kits and various model related materials for sale too.  see below.



update 9aug23
i'm officially retiring from my real job in 9 days!  this will allow me more time to travel and take more photos.  as usual, i'm still posting 
a steady stream of photo on facebook toadman's facebook and 
on instagram:  toadman's instagram.  i'm looking to rebuild this website sometime this year along with producing new
photo detail downloads.

in the meantime, i've also added a couple of more online shops featuring toadman's tank pictures merch:  toadman's printify shop and
"toadman's place" on etsy.  these shops, along with the others listed below help fund the photo trips
and equipment that are used to provide you with the photos you've come to enjoy during the past 19+ years.  i'd appreciate you taking a look at them.

also, if you want to see more of my latest photos, many are available via patreon:  toadman's patreon.  subscriptions 
start as low as $1.00/month.  your subscription will gain you access to 1000's of photos not published anywhere else, a monthly drawing, and various merch depending upon your 
subscription level.  click on the link and take a look!




update 22nov22
hello and welcome to toadman's tank pictures.  sad to say that it's been over 4 years since i've added anything new here.  as of now,
i've been posting my new pictures in albums on facebook, toadman's facebook and on instagram:  toadman's instagram.
per my last update, i've decided to discontinue selling the cd version of "toadman's photo detail cd's" as they are no longer a viable product.
however, i'm still offering the downloadable version.  the links for the downloads are about halfway down this page and are still functioning.  please keep in mind that i will email you the download link within 24-48 hours of your purchases.
i'm hoping to rebuild this site next year.  i need to find a new photo hosting service that will allow for unlimited downloads without killing me financially.  you can help support me in this
endeavour in one of several ways:  shop amazon using my portal, toadman's amazon shop.  any purchase you make on amazon
after entering via my portal gives me a commission which i use to help fund this site and future photo trips.  it doesn't matter what you purchase!  so remember to book mark my amazon site for all of your future purchases!
the other ways in which you can help are by purchasing toadman's tank pictures merch through anyone of my two shops:  toadman's tank pictures teespring shop and
toadman's teepublic shop; .
each shop has a variety of tank related t-shirts, stickers, mugs, etc.  your purchases from these shops help support toadman's tank pictures.
and last, but not least, i've started a patreon page:  toadman's patreon.  for as little as $1.00/month, toadman's patreon  click on the link and take a look!
