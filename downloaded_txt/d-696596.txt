katie woo lives here too!






right before the birth of our second child five years ago, we moved back to the philip roth suburbs in which i grew up. back when i was a kid in the 1980s, if you weren't jewish, you were either irish or italian, with the exception of a dozen or so asian families. and if you were asian, you were probably filipino. and all the filipinos knew each other either from church or through our parents who probably worked at the same hospital. 



fast forward a quarter century, and the demographics are quite different (49% jewish, 20% asian, 4% latino, 2% african american). there are so many asian kids that i have a hard time keeping track of my own kids at the playground. i even yelled at a chinese kid who was throwing sand because i thought he was my son.



anyway, my second grade daughter brought this book home today:







apparently this is standard reading in these woods. and it turns out this series has been around for at least the past four years. and the next book in our daughter's reading schedule is actually red white and blue and katie woo.  i think we will add these to our amazon wish list: 








hmmm, i wonder if the author fran manushkin is a neighbor of ours :)

help the alphabet rockers fund their tv pilot!






my friends stefanie liang and kaitlin mcgaw, along with their collaborator tommy shepherd, have been entertaining and educating crowds of children for the past several years as the alphabet rockers -- and are now trying to make the jump to tv!

they've been writing and performing positive, educational hip-hop songs for live audiences around the country, and amassing fans of all ages along the way. one key feature of their songs is that they make tolerable the endless repetition that your toddler will inevitably demand.

they're about halfway into a $30k kickstarter fundraising campaign to fund their pilot and have just over a week to raise the rest. please visit their page and pitch in a few bucks -- or even a few thousand! it'd be great to see these guys on tv.



here's their kickstarter video:

for janet liang and for all our children, be one of #170in7












janet liang, a vibrant 25 year old ucla graduate and a leukemia patient who spent years championing leukemia awareness and asian american bone marrow registration, passed away last week. in janet’s memory, this site is partnering with a network of other prominent asian american sites to host 170 in 7: a bone marrow cyberdrive in memory of janet liang.


twelve years ago this month, years before i had children, i registered to be a bone marrow donor at an asian american community festival in los angeles. after seeing plea after plea over the years from young hapas in desperate need of a match, i knew that i had to sign up, because if i was ever in their shoes, i too would be dependent on the kindness of others like me. in the intervening years, i became the father of two amazing young multiracial, multiethnic asian american girls (and we even banked our first-born's cord blood), those pleas from young asian americans and multiracial people have kept coming, and i continue to check my email for the message that some stranger who looks like me or my daughters needs my help. i keep checking because i know that one day, it could be me or my girls who need help. i took that small step 12 years ago—now, in janet's memory, and for all our children, it's your turn.



about



leukemia is a type of blood cancer and the most common cancer to affect children and young teens. treatment to save a leukemia patient’s life often requires a bone marrow transplant from a “perfect match” donor – a donor whose blood matches a recipient’s blood for 10 separate genetic markers.

unfortunately, asian american and other non-white leukemia patients are much less likely to find a “perfect match” donor than white leukemia patients. this is because asian americans and other minorities are significantly underrepresented in be the match, the national bone marrow registry used to search for and match potential bone marrow donors with recipients.

janet made it her mission to register asian american bone marrow donors, and thanks in part to her efforts, at least 18 bone marrow matches were made to recipients nationwide. however, last week, janet passed away without finding a perfect match for herself. today, many other asian american leukemia patients are still waiting to find their perfect match, like 2-year-old jeremy who was recently diagnosed with leukemia. to celebrate janet’s life and her legacy, we want to register 170 new potential bone marrow donors in janet’s name in just 7 days.



be one of the 170 in 7:



registration is free for the donor, convenient and secure. here’s how to be one of the 170 in 7:


click on the link: http://join.bethematch.org/teamjanet. fill out the forms to request a free, do-it-yourself cheek swab kit.
tweet about it using #170in7 to be counted!  click the button to send a tweet to your followers: if you don’t have a twitter account, send an email to jenn [at] reappropriate [dot] co to be counted!



and that’s it! less than ten minutes of your time can help you save a life!



donor faq



in about one month, a cheek swab kit will be sent to you in the mail, along with instructions and a pre-paid return envelope. follow the instructions to swab your cheeks and return the kit. if you are matched (only 1 in 540 registered donors are ever matched), you will then be contacted and asked if you would like to donate your bone marrow. registering is not a commitment that you must donate; it is only to help match recipients with potential donors.

most donors are never matched. but if you are matched and if you do choose to donate your bone marrow, that donation is likely to save a young person’s life.



other ways to help out: donate to aadp and/or to the liang family



donor registration is free for the donor because aadp and other non-profit organizations cover the costs of donor registration through charitable donations. if you are unable to register as a bone marrow donor, please donate to aadp to help fund registration costs for other donors, or to the liang family (paypal account using helpingjanet@gmail.com as the recipient, or checks payable to “janet liang” sent to po box 1526, pleasanton ca 94566).



other ways to help out: spread the word



if you are already registered, please help spread the word about the 170 in 7 bone marrow cyberdrive through twitter and facebook. if you would like to join your site to this partnership or if you would like more information about the 170 in 7 bone marrow cyberdrive, please go here.



partnership



170 in 7 is a partnership between the following: 8asians, aarisings, angry asian man, asia pacific arts, asian american donor program (aadp), channelapa, jeff yang (columnist, wall street journal online), reappropriate, rice daddies, schema magazine, and a special partnership with team janet and jeremy needs you.

to add your site to the list, please go here.



***



about the drive



170 in 7 will be running from september 17, 2012 to september 24, 2012. our goal is to register 170 new potential bone marrow donors in 7 days in memory of janet liang.



to partner



we would love to add more partners to this week-long bone marrow donor cyberdrive. to join, please contact jenn for more information.

jackie chan in the eagle dad's shadow





when i think of jackie chan, i usually think of a kung fu fighting harold lloyd. jackie's the bumbler, the well-intentioned but clumsy "nice guy" who's just happened to save the day. off the screen (from the interviews i've seen and read and the out take footage at the end of his movies), jackie seems to be just as nice and well-intentioned as the characters he's played.

up until recently, i hadn't put much thought into how jackie might be as a father. i guess i just assumed he would be bob ho from the spy next door.as it turns out, he isn't. according to channel news asia, jackie is donating his entire fortune to charity when he dies. his son, jaycee, is not getting a dime. his rationale: "if he is capable, he can make his own money. if he is not, then he will just be wasting my money."

but it's not this decision that has me wondering about jackie: the father (as opposed to jackie: the comedian, the actor, the kung fu star). it's his reaction when his son jaycee called concerned about his rumored death. i acknowledge that jaycee may be exaggerating a tad and that jackie's reaction is not atypical for the older generation of chinese parents. but still, i imagined jackie being a little more "progressive" than that. according to channel news asia, jaycee said, "my dad scolded me 'do you wish i were dead?' that was when i knew it was all false."

i don't think i'll ever get tired of russell peters' "beat your children" monologue.









it's brilliant! it's funny because as the child of asian immigrants, i can totally relate (i laugh now but it was terrible at the time) and as an asian parent, i have already caught myself more times than i would like whipping the same criticisms my parents beat me with __ "an 80 is a good score, if that's the best you can do…", "the teacher wrote you are creative and imaginative. imagine all you can achieve in this world if you stopped daydreaming and focused on acing those tests…" and so on. chinese parents are masters of the art of the backhanded compliment.

tiger mom, amy chua, wolf dad, xiao baiyou, and eagle dad, he liesheng, have been elected the 21st century ambassadors of modern chinese parenting by the news media-at-large. happily, at each instance of this so called " traditional asian parenting" there have been as large a chorus of asian outcry as there have been american ones.

it's been half a year since duo duo's famous run around the park, dressed in only his underwear, on a cold and snowy winter's morning. his father, the eagle dad, had forced him into the cold and then posted his run on youtube because he wanted "to show that if a child can accept this kind of extreme education when they are young, they can overcome any difficulties the future might hold." he says, "i did it because i want duo duo to be strong."

the video of little duo duo's wintry run might not have seen any controversy had there been a golden harvest or shaw brothers logo in front of it. parents who spent their adolescent years in the 80s will remember a young gordon liu in the 36th chamber of shaolin enduring a battery of imaginative (sometimes fantastical) but harsh training regiments on his path to become a "shaolin master killer".









chose any jackie's early films and you will see the same ludicrously rough lessons. but while this form of training makes for great drama and fantastical action sequences, parents need to know that these movies are make believe and you cannot hope to apply the same tough love tactics they depict and expect to garner the same results in reality.

by kung fu movie standards, i am spoiling my children. but i like to think that they work as hard as they play. i also like to think that given the advantages i didn't have, they will be more successful than i have been and able to do more good. i don't believe i coddle my children. instead i think in the amount of time i spend with them, i model positive problem solving strategies and social skills for them, while telling them they are the most cherished and important part of my life. i don't have to be the high paid executive or the biggest star as long as i ensure they can be.

in homage to the movie that inspired the title of this post, here's a trailer for jackie chan's snake in the eagle's shadow (it includes clips of jackie's character learning and training in kung fu):

vincent chin, danny chen, and coping with betrayal





originally posted at http://cranialgunk.com/blog/2012/06/30/vincent-and-danny-and-coping-with-betrayal/









last weekend marked the 30th anniversary of the murder of vincent chin. the week that lead up to it was filled with posts from across the blogosphere about vincent and the legacy of how little judge kaufman valued the life of a chinese american versus the lives of the two white men murdered who him. he said, "these weren't the kind of men you send to jail." and if he were alive today, i would ask him, "was vincent the kind man that deserved to be bludgeoned to death?"

bao phi's opinion piece in the star tribune has been one of my favorite references when thinking about vincent. another favorite reference is curtis chin's documentary, vincent who? released several years before, curtis' film addresses the legacy of vincent chin and judge kaufman's verdict.
(i think the opening of the trailer says it all.)








and of course, there is christina choy's who killed vincent chin? it was the first film i saw about the case and (as far as i know) for a very long time the only film made about the case.



i was in high school in '82, the year vincent was murdered. billy idol and duran duran, i was dealing with my own issues at the time. but as much taunting and teasing as i got for the clothes i wore and the songs i listened to, race was rarely an issue. i grew up in racially, ethnically, religiously diverse queens. it wasn't until i meet curtis several years after college in the '90s that vincent chin became an "issue".
but even after meeting curtis and others since and learning more about vincent chin, i don't know that i would have answered any differently if someone were to come up to me and ask me, if i've heard of vincent chin?

judge kaufman's betrayal of justice ignited a national asian american movement that positively changed the way i saw myself but vincent chin is not part of my daily psyche. i imagine, if approached, i would try to identify someone i might know personally before i would identify someone from modern history.

as a father, it my duty to tell my children that there are people out there who will hate them simply because they "look" chinese. but my children are young, so i am just as responsible for imparting to them the faith that overall people regardless of race or religion are good. among my challenges in fatherhood is maintaining the balance between my children having a strong sense of what the "real world" is like with what the "real world" could be. i want them to believe in their neighbors, while at the same time cautious with how quickly they embrace them.









i didn't know danny chen but his death has had a lingering effect on me. danny chen, 19 years old, enlisted in the us army (despite the protests of his parents), allegedly committed suicide after enduring months of humiliation and torture at the hands of his brothers in arms.

it definitely has something to do with how young he looks in the picture that the news uses whenever they speak about him. i know he's 18 or 19 in the photo but with a little more fat on his face, he could be the same age as my kids (maybe a little older but not much more). his growing up in chinatown and his parents speaking the same dialect as mine only adds to the sadness i feel and the worry -- the worry that my kids might be the next victims…

as disappointing as it is to have to teach my children that inevitably they will have to endure racist comments, i'm confident i can manage it. but how do i teach my children about betrayal? what makes the danny chen case so much more upsetting -- and why it lingers -- is his tormentors were people he was supposed to be able to rely on -- his brothers in arms…

have you ever been cheated on? have you ever felt betrayed? how do you teach that? how do you teach your children to deal?









i dug around online but the closest i came to "professional" advice was this post at scholastic.com. it details the stages of friendship but does not offer any advice on coping with betrayal or when "clubs" shift. the author does say the parent should be supportive of the child and if there are problems go to the child's teacher but there is no instruction on talking to your child about betrayal before it happens.

that's why i like nikki's song so much. in addition to being musically good on its own, its lyrics are offer good advice on coping with betrayal.

and while the chorus is

the one you love might be the one to let you down every time.
that ain't right, no, that ain't right.
so just be sure you can survive without no one by your side.
'cause in life, the strong survive.

i don't interpret it to mean "prepare yourself for a life of loneliness and antisocial behavior." i interpret it as a statement on resolve -- be resolute and confident in who you are. be yourself. cultivate yourself. and live.

they hurt you, they sliced at the threads of your life but what's tearing
you apart is holding on to being right.
forgiving is hard, like breaking through prison bars but the healing
wont start til you let go of the scars.
strong people forgive and get the pain out their system
weak people relive and they keep playing the victim.
people always told us keep our enemies close, but i'd rather keep my
distance than be phoney to a foe.
best wisdom to own is knowing when to let go, but that's something u
already know.

an asian american summer book list for kids





though not a rice daddy, she is definitely a rice mommy. mia wenjen has compiled an impressive bibliography of asian american literature for young adults on her site jadeluckclub.com. i asked her if she would provide us with some summer book recommendations.


in her own words: mia wenjen blogs obsessively on children's books and young adult literature at pragmatic mom and creative asian americans at jadeluck club when she's not chauffering around her three kids.




it was about twenty five years ago when amy tan
published the joy luck club and i remember how excited i was to
finally be able to read a book that reflected my culture that i actually purchased
the hard copy which was a splurge for me at the time. i was too young to
realize as a child growing up that i felt marginalized watching the one hour of
tv a day and never seeing an asian face. it was as if looking asian was
something slightly embarrassing and certainly not an asset.



asian american children's books did not exist at all so it's
been very exciting for me, as a children's and ya book blogger at pragmaticmom, to watch it emerge and even,
dare i say it, flourish? !to keep this genre alive and well, we all must read,
read, read these books and others. it's wonderful to read books with my kids
that reflect their experiences, whether that means they balance their cultural
heritage easily or with a struggle like some of these characters in the books
below.


i chose these books, most are published this year, because
they truly tell an authentic and important story of being asian american. many
of these authors have won prestigious awards as well for their work as well.


what are your favorite asian american authors and books?
please share.



10. vanished by sheela chari



eleven-year-old neela dreams of being a famous musician,
performing for admiring crowds on her traditional indian stringed instrument.
her particular instrument was a gift from her grandmother—intricately carved
with a mysterious-looking dragon. when this special family heirloom
vanishes from a local church, strange clues surface: a tea kettle ornamented
with a familiar pointy-faced dragon, a threatening note, a connection to a
famous dead musician, and even a legendary curse. the clues point all the way
to india, where it seems that neela’s instrument has a long history of
vanishing and reappearing. even if neela does track it down, will she be
able to stop it from disappearing again?



sheela chari’s debut novel is a finely tuned story of
coincidence and fate, trust and deceit, music and mystery.



sheela chari's first book is masterful mixing a
multi-cultural experience of growing up indian american in boston with a well
paced and difficult-to-put-down mystery. her character, neela, is named after
her niece, and gives the reader a realistic and sensitive understanding of what
it's like to grow up as a second generation indian american with parents who
also try to walk the fine line between embracing their culture and fitting in.
[chapter book for ages 8 and up]



i have a book review plus our skype author visit here.



9. the year of books by andrea cheng



in chinese, peng you means friend. but in any
language, all anna knows for certain is that friendship is complicated.



when anna needs company, she turns to her books. whether
traveling through a wrinkle in time, or peering over my side of the
mountain, books provide what real life cannot—constant companionship and
insight into her changing world.



books, however, can’t tell anna how to find a true friend.
she’ll have to discover that on her own. in the tradition of classics like maud
hart lovelace’s betsy-tacy books and eleanor estes’ one hundred dresses,
this novel subtly explores what it takes to make friends and what it means to
be one.



anna's strategy when her best friend trades up the social
ladder leaving her friendless is to turn to books and family for company and
solace. it works pretty well but there is a price to pay for social climbing
and her friend feels like she may have made a mistake. should she take her
back? [easy chapter book for ages 8 and up]



8. hot, hot roti for dada-ji by f. zia



aneel s grandparents have come to stay, all the way from
india. aneel loves the sweet smell of his grandmother s incense, and his
grandfather, dada-ji, tells the world s best stories. when he was a boy,
adventurous, energetic dada-ji had the power of a tiger. hunh-ji! yes, sir! he
could shake mangoes off trees and wrangle wild cobras. and what gave him his
power? fluffy-puffy hot, hot roti, with a bit of tongue-burning mango pickle.
does dada-ji still have the power? aneel wants to find out but first he has to
figure out how to whip up a batch of hot, hot roti overflowing with family,
food, and a tall stack of fun, hot, hot roti for dada-ji is sure to warm the
heart and tickle the tummy. hunh-ji! yes, sir!



superheroes need not be young or wear costumes. sometimes
even one's beloved grandfather can be a superhero too! and it turns out that
eating hot, hot roti is grandfather's version of popeye's spinach. the good
news is that it also tastes good! [picture book, ages 2 and up]



7. jojo eats dim sum by james kye



jojo eats dim sum is the first in a new and exciting series
of children's books with the aim of introducing children to the joys of various
asian cuisines. the star of the book is jojo, a young girl with a sense of
adventure and a daring appetite. in stark contrast is her baby brother, ollie,
who prefers to eat pea soup at every meal. the story encourages children to be
more open to foods that are unfamiliar, thereby opening doors to other
cultures. in jojo eats dim sum, jojo eats her way through some of the most
popular dim sum dishes, culminating in chicken feet, which are unfamiliar to
most westerners or unappetizing to those who have encountered them. but jojo
loves chicken feet, as she loves most dim sum dishes. each story in the jojo
eats series leverages a fun narrative to carry the young reader through the
culinary journey, which is interspersed with lessons on how to pronounce foods
in the local language. jojo eats dim sum is an irresistible book that children
will want to read over and over again. each beautiful book is in the shape and
size of a menu, adding to the charm of jojo's culinary adventures.



asian culture revolves so much around food and family to the
point where the two are almost one and the same. we eat communally and this
strengthens our bonds. in this charming picture book, jo jo, who isn't asian
american, enjoys the unusual delicacies found at dim sum. i think the message
here is that asian food is good (and nothing to be ashamed of even if it looks
weird or smells funny) and kids with well developed palates like it too.
[picture books, ages 2 and up]



6. money boy by paul yee



ray liu knows he should be happy. he lives in a big suburban
house with all the latest electronic gadgets, and even finds plenty of time to
indulge in his love of gaming. he needs the escape. it’s tough getting grades
that will please his army veteran father, when speaking english is still a
struggle. and he can’t quite connect with his gang at high school — immigrants
like himself but who seem to have adjusted to north american life more easily.
then comes his father accesses ray’s internet account, and discovers ray has
been cruising gay websites. before ray knows what has hit him, his belongings
have been thrown on the front lawn, and he has been kicked out. angry, defiant,
ray heads to downtown toronto. in short order he is robbed, beaten up and
seduced, and he learns the hard realities of life on the street. could he
really sell himself for sex? lots of people use their bodies to make money —
athletes, actors, models, pop singers. if no one gets hurt, why should anyone
care?



a gritty young adult novel, money boy doesn't pull
any punches about what it's like to grow up asian in canada when your father
finds out that his son is gay. sadly, this is someone's reality. [young adult,
ages 15 and up]



5. clara lee and the apple pie dream by jenny han



clara lee likes her best friends, her grandpa, kimchi, candy
necklaces (her signature look!), and the idea of winning the little miss apple
pie contest. 



clara lee doesn't like her mom's fish soup, bad dreams (but
grandpa says they mean good luck!), speaking in public, or when her little
sister is being annoying. 



one day, after a bad dream, clara lee is thrilled to have a
whole day of luck (like!). but then, bad luck starts to follow (dislike!). when
will clara lee's luck change again? will it change in time for the little miss
apple pie contest?



that clara lee is korean american and living in the mostly
caucasian mid-west is a subtle point in this story and that's the beauty of
this easy chapter book for ages 6 and up.



4. dumpling soup by jama kim rattigan



marisa gets to help make dumplings this year to celebrate
the new year. but she worries if anyone will eat her funny-looking dumplings.
set in the hawaiian islands, this story celebrates the joyful mix of food,
customs, and languages from many cultures.



perhaps it's because my kids are all mixed up being of mixed
ancestry including chinese, japanese and korean, but that is increasing
becoming more and more common. again, it's the food that connects everyone to
each other and to their culture, even if it's a mixed-plate. [picture book,
ages 4 and up]



3. alvin ho: allergic to camping, hiking, and other
natural disasters by lenore look



alvin ho is back, and this time he’s facing his biggest
fear: the great outdoors.



alvin ho is back and his worst fear has come true: he
has to go camping. what will he do exposed in the wilderness with bears
and darkness and . . . pit toilets? luckily, he’s got his night-vision goggles
and water purifying tablets and super-duper heavy-duty flashlight to keep him
safe. and he’s got his dad, too.



lenore look’s touching, drop-dead-funny chapter book about
an asian-american second grader—with illustrations by new york
times bestselling illustrator leuyen pham—is perfect for beginning and
reluctant readers alike, and has tons of boy appeal.



lenore look's book have wide appeal that break down barriers
of race. her alvin ho series is just plain humorous and if alvin ho is a
quintessential geek, that's beside the point. [easy chapter book for ages 7 and
up]



2. ting and ling: not exactly the same by grace lin



ling and ting are twins. they have the same brown eyes. they
have the same pink cheeks. they have the same happy smiles.



ling and ting are two adorable identical twins, and they
stick together, whether they are making dumplings, getting their hair cut, or
practicing magic tricks. but looks are deceiving--people can be very different,
even if they look exactly the same.



this is a pitch perfect easy reader for kids who are just
starting to read on their own. it has asian references like making dumplings
but ting and ling have wide appeal to any child of any ethnicity. i think of it
as the heir to the little bear series. [easy reader for ages 4 and up]



1. the great wall of lucy wu by wendy shang



in this humorous and heartfelt debut about a split cultural
identity, nothing goes according to plan for sixth-grader lucy wu.



lucy wu, aspiring basketball star and interior designer, is
on the verge of having the best year of her life. she's ready to rule the
school as a sixth grader and take over the bedroom she has always shared with
her sister. in an instant, though, her plans are shattered when she finds out
that yi po, her beloved grandmother's sister, is coming to visit for several
months -- and is staying in lucy's room. lucy's vision of a perfect year begins
to crumble, and in its place come an unwelcome roommate, foiled birthday plans,
and chinese school with the awful talent chang.



wendy shang is the heir to amy tan in children's literature
and the great wall of lucy wu is a spot on realistic portrait of what
it's like to be third generation asian american with all the pressures of high
expectations but with the self identification of being just like everyone else.
[chapter book, ages 8 and up]


thanks mia! i would also add both of lisa yee's bobby books (bobby the brave , bobby vs girls ) and lawrence yep's cockroach cooties to the list.

additional reading suggestions welcomed! add them to the comments below.

asians in the movies.

116 of hollywood’s greatest stars on one stage at one time to celebrate paramount studio’s 100th anniversary. it's interesting to see which stars were actually chosen. i guess in some respects you have to be happy to see at least three asian faces in the group, from left to right: tommy chong, george takei and john cho. the interesting part to me is the under-representation of asian females in the group (perhaps lucy liu and sandra oh were booked that day). anyway, photographically speaking it quite a feat to have such a large group together and apparently not that much photo-shop trickery involved. for those of you photo geeks out there (like me) here's the set up info, the shot was taken by famous celebrity photographer art streiber:



the 40-foot stage, 116-person photo needed flattering, even light all the way across. this setup used no light stands, no c-stands and no medium or high rollers. instead, art’s crew of 10 assistants used 57 profoto heads, and gridded 34 of those heads with magnum p50 dishes as the key light. because the stage was so wide, he couldn’t use a big side light. instead, art would have to light from above. he decided to mimic the “broadway” style stage lighting, which is a fairly hard light source, up high above the audience.

63 frames on a hasselblad h2 camera with the new phase one iq-160 back and a 150mm lens, provided by his digital tech, eric vlasic at with technology. he shot the photo in three sections, and his retoucher, angie hayes at the happy pixel project, seamed the images together in post.

however, it’s important to note that all 116 people were on stage at one time. nobody was stitched into the photo, nobody was added in post. 
thanks to fstoppers for the post.

how the cdc can help you shop for next winter






summer is around the corner, so the local sporting goods store is clearing out their children's winter gear at 50% off. one of the things the kids will need for next winter is some snow pants. but with kids growing so fast, it's hard to figure out what's going to fit them next winter. so even though we might be saving 50% on last season's gear, there's no guarantee that what we're buying will still fit by next winter.



now thanks to these charts provided by the centers for disease control (cdc), you can take some of the guesswork out of buying seasonal clothes ahead of time. and for a cheap ricedaddy like me, that means i could buy the previous season's gear for half-off and still be sure that the gear will fit next year!

if you've ever looked through your kid's file at the pediatrician's office, you will notice that their height, weight and head circumference are all plotted on these same charts. here's how it works:

find your child's height on the y-axis. in this example, the child is 42.5" (107.5cm) tall.
find your child's age on the x-axis. in this example, the child is 5 years, 4 months (metric equivalent unknown :).
find out where those coordinates meet, and find the closest percentile curve upon which your child's measurement lies. in this example, the child is on the 25th percentile (the line right below the heavy red line which represents the 50th percentile).
since the child in this example will be about six years old next winter, trace that age from the x-axis up to where it intersects with the percentile curve your child is on. on the 25th percentile in this case, it appears that the child will be about 44" (111.5cm) tall by this coming winter. that's a growth of about 1 1/2 inches.


note that there are different charts to track length/height, weight, head circumference for boys, girls, birth to 36 months, and from 2 years to 20 years old. be sure you are using the appropriate chart for your child.

cd giveaway! mista cookie jar's ultramagnetic universal love revolution







in honor of today's release of the sophomore album by los angeles kindie rock family band (and rice daddies fave) mista cookie jar and the chocolate chips, we are happy to be giving away 5 autographed copies of the new cd to rice daddies readers.

if you're not familiar with the music of mista cookie jar, a.k.a. c.j. pizarro, he calls it "urban-island-funky-rock-n-roll for the inner child." his first album, the love bubble, has been on repeat in our house for a long time, and it definitely makes children of all ages get up and dance.

case in point: i just hit "play" on the video below for "happy place," off the new album, while writing this and my three-year-old daughter just ran over to the computer for the other room where she was playing with my iphone.



cj is one of the scant handful of asian american kindie artists i've been able to find, and i'm so happy to be able to support him not only because he provides an asian american face and voice for my kids but because, also, he's really good! it was honor to share the stage with him last november at skylight books in la when he came out to perform at a reading for rad dad: dispatches from the frontiers of fatherhood.

enjoy the "happy place" video then scroll down for how to enter to win your own signed copy of ultramagnetic universal love revolution:




to enter to win one of five signed copies of ultramagnetic universal love revolution by mista cookie jar and the chocolate chips, send an email with "mista cookie jar" in the subject line to daddyinastrangeland@mac.com by this friday, may 11, at midnight pdt. to purchase your own copy now on cd or download, go to cdbaby or itunes.

that's someone's child





i’m an avid road cyclist, and my riding buddies fit the stereotype: tough, quiet, spandexed. before eliot was born, i liked to soften these guys up by telling them how excited i was about my imminent fatherhood. i remember one of them—one of our team’s tougher, quieter, more spandexed members—telling me that after having his first child he could no longer watch law & order or csi, or any of those procedurals whose drama revolves around the killed and the killing, or the dead and the dying. “that’s someone’s child,” he said. “i just can’t handle it anymore.” it’s a simple sentiment, perhaps, but the force of its generalization still moves me. even if i felt then that it was somewhat overstated, it feels considerably less so now that i’ve made the transition from expectant father to father. at the very least, it’s become far more difficult to handle stories about children dying—and almost impossible to hear about them being killed. there’s nothing i can say about trayvon martin, or his case, that hasn’t already been said. ta-nehisi coates and his atlantic monthly colleagues have been our best guides to his story's twists and turns. bruce reyes-chow at hyphen’s blog has even tried to make sense of the overlap of asian american privilege and what he calls “white” privilege that he sees lurking beneath the “lack of privilege” that marked trayvon as a body to be targeted, pursued and shot down. numerous others have attempted to see themselves through the lens of trayvon’s death, and to mourn the persistence of racism. but the voices that have affected me the most aren’t the angry ones, or the historical ones, or the legal or political ones, though each of these have played a crucial part in how i’ve come to understand trayvon’s death. the most affecting voices have been the ones that see their own children in trayvon, or even their own hypothetical children. i’m not in the habit of being moved by the emotional ploys of politicians, but i really did believe in the pain obama was trying to convey when he said that if he had had a son, he would have looked like trayvon. trayvon’s death hurts in many ways, not least of them historically, so of course the old divisions have been busy policing the authenticity of pain and identification. black commentators have criticized white commentators’ claims that trayvon reminds them of their own children, and confessionals of white guilt have flooded the airwaves and blogosphere. these discussions certainly have their place and i think we owe it to trayvon to think through them as carefully as possible, in all their uncomfortable complexity. but the reason i’m writing this post is not to add to any of that.the reason is because… well, it’s because i thought i'd ask us to pause for a moment and look at trayvon's face. i think most of us have already done this, but there's something important in that pause. there's a feeling i get that i think most of you get as well, and i'd venture to say it's the powerful feeling of the general and specific coinciding. he belongs to us—and that matters tremendously.just look at him.
