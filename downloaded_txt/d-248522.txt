kivgiqsuat,
            messenger feast, 
   inuit of 
   alaska

"after the separation of the summer months the villagers begin socializing with other village groups. during the latter part of december and early january a social and economic gathering may be held in one of the villages. this gathering is called kivgiqsuat, the messenger feast. the umialit
            (whaling captains) and their crews host these gatherings. an umialik and his crew usually spend a few years preparing for kivgiqsuat. food is gathered and stored, gifts are made or hunted for, new clothing and numerous other preparations are made for the gathering. during kivgiqsuat partners from different villages exchange gifts. the umialit show the extent of their wealth and power through kivgiqsuat, the celebration which brings ieupiat from different villages together and strengthens their social ties (spencer,
            1959).


"the last messenger feast on the north slope of alaska was held in wainwright (alaska) in 1914. presently the people of arctic alaska are revitalizing the tradition of the messenger feast. january 1988 saw the first celebration of the messenger feast in barrow in eighty years. true to the spirit of kivgiqsuat several pledges were made that were directly related to social and political alliances. additionally, one village vowed to use the memories of their elders to enhance the celebration for the following year. this cultural revitalization can only add to the richness of the lives of contemporary ieupiat."

   solveig larsen, with much thanks.


armistice day, 
   also known in australia as
   
   remembrance day
also known as 
   remembrance day (and
   
   poppy day) , this commemorates the armistice signed between the 
   allies of 
   world war i and 
   germany at compiègne, 
   france, for the 
   cessation of hostilities on the western front of world war i, which 
   took effect at eleven o'clock in the morning - the "eleventh hour of 
   the eleventh day of the eleventh month" of 1918. while this official 
   date to mark the end of the war reflects the cease fire on the 
   western front, hostilities continued in other regions, especially 
   across the former russian empire and in parts of the old ottoman 
   empire ...

                      	 death of wilhelm reich
	                       
                          







1957 death of wilhelm reich, austrian-born
pseudo-scientist who lived in new england, usa, and convinced thousands of his
ability to cure with quack remedies such as the 'orgone accumulator'. one
owned by junkie writer  william burroughs is shown in 
this photograph.



he was hounded by the us government, which had
his books burned. on 
november 3, 1957, wilhelm reich died of a heart attack in
the federal penitentiary at lewisburg, pa, 
usa.





"he claimed to
see microscopic 
bions
develop from lifeless matter and organize themselves into living cells. 
and he eventually came to believe he had discovered a primordial energy
essential for life, which he called 
orgone energy, 
and which he was obsessed with for the rest of his life.  along the way of 
making these various 'discoveries,' his works were either ignored or heavily 
criticized by the mainstream scientific community.  reich seemed to take 
every criticism of his work as a personal attack.  he was convinced he had 
made the greatest discoveries in the history of humanity, next to which the 
discovery of electricity or the law of gravity or the wheel or fire were 
insignificant."

                      	 the  death of tomás de torquemada
	                       
                          

 






1498
 death of tomás de torquemada, main player in the early part of the
spanish inquisition.


the spanish inquisition ran from 1478 until  1834. contrary to popular belief, its
inquisitors only condemned about 25 spanish witches to be burned at the stake.
however, it wrought a horrible toll on heretics, muslims, jews, reformers and
the intelligentsia. some 114,350 citizens of catholic spain were tried in the
inquisition started by ferdinand and
isabella of castile. torquemada was responsible for 2,000
burnings and the expulsion of thousands of jews (1492).

                      	 sep 15, vincent lunardi
	                       
                          

 







1784

   vincent lunardi
made the  first (acclaimed) aerial journey in
england, flying in a balloon from the artillery
ground, at moorfields, in the presence of the prince of wales, lord north, william
pitt the younger, charles
fox, edmund burke, the duchess of devonshire, various other distinguished personages,
and about 150,000 common folk.



lunardi reached a height of some four miles (so he said). he finally touched down safely in a
field near ware, in hertfordshire, so frightening local labourers that no
promises of reward would induce them to approach the craft.
 


for
two years, the italian aeronaut 
barnstormed england, until an accident in which a
young man became entangled in a rope and fell to his death. one satirist wrote:
 



behold
an hero comely, tall and fair,
his
only food phlogisticated air, ...
now
drooping roams about from town to town

collecting
pence t'inflate his poor balloon.


robert
chambers wrote: 
"mr. lunardi's publications exhibit him as a vain excitable young man, utterly carried away by the singularity of his position. he tells us how a woman dropped
down dead through fright, caused by beholding his wondrous apparition in the air; but, on the other hand, he saved a man's life, for a jury brought in a verdict of not guilty on a notorious highwayman, that they might rush out of court to witness the balloon. when lunardi arose, a cabinet council was engaged on most important state deliberations; but the king said: 'my lords, we shall have an opportunity of discussing this question at another time, but we may never again see poor lunardi; so let us adjourn the council, and observe the balloon!'




"ignorance, combined with vanity, led lunardi into some strange assertions. he professed to be able to lower his balloon, at pleasure, by using a kind of oar. when he
 subsequently ascended at edinburgh, he
 affirmed that, at the height of 1100 feet, he saw the city of glasgow, and also the town of paisley, which are, at least, forty miles distant, with a hilly country between. the following paragraph from the
 general advertiser  of september 24, 1784, has a sly reference to these and the like allegations. 





"'as several of our correspondents seem to disbelieve that part of mr. lunardi's tale, wherein be states that he saw the neck of a quart bottle four miles' distance, all we can inform them on the subject is, that mr. lunardi was above lying.'






"lunardi's success was, in all probability, due to the suggestions of another, rather than to his own scientific acquirements. his original intention was to have used a montgolfier or fire balloon, the inherent perils of which would almost imperatively forbid a successful result. but the celebrated chemist, dr. george fordyce, informed him of the buoyant nature of hydrogen gas, with the mode of its manufacture; and to this information lunardi's successful ascents may be attributed. three days before lunardi ascended, mr. sadler made an ineffectual attempt at shotover hill, near oxford, but was defeated, by using a balloon on the montgolfier principle.


"it is generally supposed that lunardi was the first person who ascended by means of a balloon in great britain, but he certainly was not. a very poor man, named james tytler, who then lived in edinburgh, supporting himself and family in the humblest style of garret or cottage life by the exercise of his pen, had this honour. he had effected an ascent at edinburgh on the 27th of august 1784, just nineteen days previous to lunardi. tytler's ascent, however, was almost a failure, by his employing the dangerous and unmanageable montgolfier principle. after several ineffectual attempts, tytler, finding that he could not carry up his fire-stove with him, determined, in the maddening desperation of disappointment, to go without this his sole sustaining power. jumping into his car, which was no other than a common crate used for packing earthenware, he and the balloon ascended from comely garden, and immediately afterwards fell in the restalrig road. for a wonder, tytler was uninjured; and though he did not reach a greater altitude than three hundred feet, nor traverse a greater distance than half a mile, yet his name must ever be mentioned as that of the first briton who ascended with a balloon, and the first man who ascended in britain.


"tytler was the son of a clergyman of the church of scotland, and had been educated as a surgeon; but being of an eccentric and erratic genius, he adopted literature as a profession, and was the principal editor of the first edition of the encyclopaedia britannica. becoming embroiled in politics, he published a handbill of a seditious tendency, and consequently was compelled to seek a refuge in america, where he died in 1805, after conducting a newspaper at salem, in new england, for several years.


"a prophet acquires little honour in his own country. while poor tytler was being overwhelmed by the coarse jeers of his compatriots, lunardi came to edinburgh in 1785, and was received with the utmost enthusiasm."

                      	 sep 10, feast day of asclepigenia
	                       
                          







feast day of 
  asclepigenia

asclepigenia (flourished 430
      - 485 ce), a priestess of the greek eleusinian mysteries
      and philosopher of the neo-platonist school, is commemorated today. 



asclepigenia lived in 5th-century
      athens, daughter of plutarch the younger who ran the neo-platonic school
      there till he died in 430, when she, her brother hiero and a colleague
      inherited its management. the school's philosophy was syncretic, merging
      platonic and aristotelian philosophies.


asclepigenia's interests were in the esoteric principles
      of metaphysics that control the universe. she applied magic and theurgic
      principles to affect fate, applying her knowledge of plato and aristotle
      to the great religious and metaphysical questions raised by christian
      ethical theory. she believed that there were five realms of reality,
      namely: the one, intelligence, matter, soul, and nature. we do not know
      her work from original sources but from references and influences in those
      of her pupils.
      

believing that fates
      might be affected by the means of metaphysics, cosmology, magic, and theurgy, asclepigenia tended more toward mysticism, magic, and
      contemplation of the mysteries of platonic and aristotelian metaphysics.
      her most famous student was the philosopher, proclus (february
      8, 412 - april
      17, 487).


according to  nigel pennick (the
      pagan book of days, destiny
      books, rochester, vermont, usa, 1992), if the weather is good today it
      will continue for another 40 days.


asclepius                                                          
      

asclepigenia was
      named for asclepius 
  (aesculapius; asklepios; asklepius),
      the son of apollo by coronis
      (or arsinoe), the celebrated
      physician/deity who had been so successful at preventing mortal death that
      he was accused of encroaching on the preserve of hades. as a consequence
      of his bad behaviour,  zeus killed him with a thunderbolt, and in revenge,
      apollo killed the first generation of cyclopes (the
      children of uranus and gaia) who had forged the
      thunderbolt. zeus placed asclepius in the sky as the constellation
ophiuchus
      ('serpent-bearer').(more
      on asclepius.)

                      	 ket's rebellion
	                       
                          







1549
today marks one of the days in 
history on which were forged some of the human rights enjoyed by a proportion of 
people in the world. 
regrettably, though, today we remember a bloody defeat rather than a victory for 
those who bravely asserted their liberties.


on this day, the norfolk rising (or 
commotion), otherwise known as 
ket's rebellion, 
came to an end when the overwhelming military power of the 

earl of warwick (john dudley, 1st duke of northumberland) crushed

robert ket's rebels.


on july 20, 
at mousehold, england, a herald of the king had been turned away, his message of 
conciliation – or, demand for compliance – from the monarch to some 20,000 rural 
insurrectionists rejected. the herald had promised the king's pardon to all who 
would depart quietly to their homes.


the 
rebellion of farmers and farm workers was aimed at bringing attention to the 
economic problems faced by agricultural workers in east anglia. 
like the diggers
(founded exactly one century later, in 1649 by 
gerrard winstanley) and even the rather more conservative 
levellers, the rebels demanded the abolition of land enclosures, the end of private ownership of land, and 
the dismissal of counsellors. a commonwealth was established on 
mousehold heath.

the 'commotion' was led by robert ket (or kett), a 
fairly prosperous tanner and landowner (he held the manor of wymondham in norfolk), 
who with his followers occupied the city of norwich, but were defeated on august 
25 by warwick's superior firepower.

the rebels had met daily under 'the oak of 
reformation', upon which many of them were later hanged.
