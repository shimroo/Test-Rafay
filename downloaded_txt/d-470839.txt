georgia organics is a dynamic statewide nonprofit investing in organic farmers and community allies to cultivate a strong local food movement.while georgia organics was officially founded in 1997, its roots go back to the 1970s as an association of growers that recognized the power of collective action. today, georgia organics continues to champion this ethos in support of their mission to invest in farmers for the health of our communities and the land. this effort is achieved through a host of farmer services, conferences, and convenings; community collaborations, including farm to school and early care, family farm share, and farmer champion programs; and farmer advocacy. these programs are driven by a strategic plan for a lasting and systemic impact on farmer prosperity, equity, and healthy land and communities.  thank you for joining us in building a more resilient and equitable local food movement in georgia!
