ten tips for better thinking
 and 
stimulating creativity at work













"well funded work fails; impoverished work succeeds: it may not be about resources."
"is the need intelligence or imagination?"
"unconscious belief colours perception; so..
..what you believe, reveals how you learned to see."
"practice works - in sport. so why don't we do that with our work?"
"is it about technology, or about using our minds?"
"are we thinking or just exercising old habits of thought?"
"it is hard to see clearly what you deny exists."
"just as learning the alphabet enables us to communicate, learning to think develops our human potential."
"once recognised, it's hard to see it any other way."
"certainty is just an emotion - don't be overcome by it."
"starting with what we already know, we limit our future."
"if you don't design your own strategy, you'll be a part of someone else's."
"to use our minds effectively, we need to direct thinking towards a focus."










what we do

we help companies, organisations, research groups, and individuals make step-changes in their thinking effectiveness. people naturally enjoy proactively organising and building their futures together. we help them do that, using systematic approaches to creative, effective, and skilled collaboration based on our model of mind.
we do this through  learning events and  facilitations delivered face-to-face or online to address different thinking situations. 
facilitated sessions are bespoke designs to address client needs and include such topics as business strategy, the interface between academia and industry, innovation, personal organisational effectiveness, helping groups thrive, collaboration, vision planning, team strategy and development,  decision making. 


" people: understand similarities, appreciate differences; work with people and change."
our core training interventions applicable in all sectors are on foundational subjects such as "practical thinking -  for the purpose of doing"; "problem solving & decision making"; "working with  people"; "getting organised for life"; "creativity & innovation".

our  "secrets of researcher success" is a programme developed specifically for academic researchers delivered online or face to face, and covers:

1 - thinking
2 - organising yourself
  3 - people
  4 - becoming a star researcher


why this matters


innovation performance gains, gov. auditor's report.

what problems keep you awake?
how are you going to find ways to solve them? 
how will you inspire people to rise to the task and relish working together on the challenges facing you all?
how can you create the future amidst change, whilst managing the present? 
what if small changes could make a huge difference in your organisation or company's performance? how could you identify what those might be?
if you could all be 5% more effective and engaged tomorrow, what would that mean to you?

success depends more on finding ways to think more effectively, and to shift our perception, than it does on an it upgrade. 
      we can help you do that.

rasoul karami, phd student, university of strathclyde delegate on a research sandpit
virtual learning has been incredibly challenging during the past ten months - the sessions with company of mind were invaluable. they helped me to think and work more resourcefully. i found a new way to display my research and see the overarching contribution and design. although simple to do, it supercharged my thinking and moved me from literature to a research design that addresses some of the gaps being problematised in the literature.
