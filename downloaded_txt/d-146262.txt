    miss sunshine


 by concerns of police survivors
•
february 5, 2025

"miss sunshine" was an appropriate nickname for new york city police detective shantay neal-baker, eow 8/14/2021. her sister trina neal-mitchell explains how she had an undeniable ability to see the positive, flip the situation, and convince you to see the positive. she always saw the good in everybody.                                    when trina talks about her sister, she is most proud of how she set out to change the narrative of policing, especially in the rougher areas of new york city. trina said, "she wanted to go into the troubled communities and be the person who built bridges and established trust. she wanted to erase the negative stereotypes that certain communities had about law enforcement."                                    when her sister succumbed to complications from covid-19, trina made it her mission to make sure that everything that was good about her sister lived on. “tay day” was created and is now held around september 17th, shantay’s birthday.                                    "tay day" is a day for the community to gather and gain resources that empower people of all ages. some of the resources available are reading circles sponsored by the department of education and public library, wellness screenings from the american cancer society, and a lupus walk held in shantay’s name as she was once an ambassador of the lupus foundation.                                    trina started attending her local metro new york c.o.p.s. chapter meetings, now serving as trustee. “when we get that call that another officer has fallen, we go to the family and let them know we will cry with you and be there with you. we are proof that you don’t ever forget, but you can take your pain, and you can get to the other side of it,” trina said. “we empower each other.”                                    trina has also taken on the role of committee chair for “friendsgiving”, which is an event that invites all local law enforcement personnel who play a role in lifting up survivors to gather for a meal and allow the survivors to say, “thank you.” trina said, “we want to make them smile.”                                    to her fellow survivors, trina says, “you owe it to your hero to put one foot in front of the other. i want you to love on yourself and do something that your hero would want you to do for yourself. they want you to be happy and healthy. you’re not being disloyal to them to hit pause on the pity party. leave it there for a moment and laugh again. do something beautiful for you as a gift to you from your loved one.”                                                          trina neal-mitchell                        surviving sibling of                        detective shantay neal-baker                        new york city (ny) police department                         eow 8/14/2021                        #survivorstories

i was overwhelmed with the amount of support available throughout my entire experience, from our honor guard from cook county taking care of every need to the illinois cops program making sure that my family and i were ok. without illinois c.o.p.s., there's no way that i would have been able to attend such an exceptional emotional event honoring my late husband, allen giacchetti.                                    i also need to extend my sincere gratitude to caitlyn and debbie from illinois and the entire c.o.p.s. organization; none of this would have been possible without them.                                    i will be forever grateful.                                                          angela giacchetti                                                                    surviving spouse of                        officer allen giacchetti                        cook county (il) sheriff's office                        eow 4/30/2021                         #survivorstories

my brother, deputy brandon j. nielsen was a police officer for st. john the baptist parish in laplace, louisiana. he was killed in the line of duty on                                                                               august 16th, 2012. brandon was a cops’ cop, loved what he did, and loved being a part of his community. brandon loved his motorcycles and always                                                                               said he was making it do what it does, in his louisiana accent. brandon was a jokester and can be so crude, but so loving at the same time. he was and                                                                               still is the best brother i could ever ask for. anyone would be so lucky to have met and been a part of his life. he left behind 2 daughters who were 6 and                                                                               13 when he was killed, 3 step-sons, our parents, and 1 niece who was 3 at the time of his death. there isn't a day that goes by that he is not missed                                                                  or talked about. i hope i am making him proud every day.                                                                                                                         i was introduced to the c.o.p.s. organization exactly 1 year after my brother was killed. i attended sibling's retreat in 2013 for the first time and                                                                               at first, was not wanting to be there. i am such a people person, but being there thinking i was the only one who suffered such a great, tragic loss                                                                               was not something i wanted to re-live again and again. being there in 2013, i realized that i was not alone, i was no longer the "only child", and i met                                                                               other siblings who were going through the same thing i was. my brother's death was felonious and having to go through the court system was not fun,                                                                               but knowing others were going through the same thing, really did help me. i have attended siblings retreat every year after that and found my group                                                                               of siblings my brother left me after his untimely death. each year i went with different feelings, and my "siblings" were there every step of the way to make                                                                  sure i was not alone in those thoughts. they really helped me through my healing process and some of them were even at my wedding in 2021, attended my wedding, and even officiated my wedding. i felt as though my brother was there the entire time because i was able to share that special day with my newfound siblings that came from my brother.                                                                                                                         without the c.o.p.s. organization and the hands-on-programs of siblings retreat, i do not know where i would be physically, emotionally, and spiritually.                                                                               i cannot thank this organization enough for healing me when i needed healing, protecting me when i needed protection, and helping me navigate through                                                                               this new life i was given. i cannot thank this organization enough for having me not be the "only child" anymore, and for bringing me the people i needed                                                                  the most to go through life together and love on and be loved on. thank you c.o.p.s and all my siblings for saving my life.                                                                                                            jj granger                                                                   surviving sibling of                                                                  deputy brandon j. nielsen                                                      st. john the baptist parish (la) sheriff's office                                                      eow 8/16/12                                                      #survivorstories

i’m the daughter of officer charles d. cole jr., a long time officer at the nassau county police department in new york. my dad helped with rescue and recovery at ground zero after 9/11 and succumbed to 9/11 related brain cancer that spread throughout his body on august 14, 2011.                                                                                                              before his cancer diagnoses, my dad was full of life, had an amazing sense of humor and was always referred to as a cops cop. he was always making jokes and pulling pranks, and loved his job with a passion. not only was he a police officer, but he was also a firefighter and started off as an emt in nyc, so he did it all. once he became sick, the strong funny guy we all knew and loved slowly faded away, the hardest part of this all was watching him turn into another person, practically helpless. it was heartbreaking, especially when you’re only 15/16 and have your whole life with him ahead of you. i often think about the what if’s and how life would be with him here. it’s hard, but i know he’s with me every day.                                                                                                 i’ve met so many amazing people after my dads passing and c.o.p.s has also been a huge support system for my family. it’s a beautiful thing to have a family in blue also, i appreciate every one of them. i will always honor my father and will always proudly back the blue.                                                                                     meagan cole                                                      surviving adult child of                                                      officer charles cole jr.                                                      nassau county (ny) police department                                                      eow 8/14/2011                                                      #survivorstories

"to all, i am so sad to tell you that june murdock, surviving co-worker of alexandria (la) police officers jeremy 'jay' carruth, david ezernack, eow 2/20/2003 and patrolman brian coleman 2/21/2007, passed away last night around 9 pm.  june was an incredible lady who gave so much of herself to others.  she spent her whole life in service to others. her goal at national police week (npw) was to find the new survivors who looked the most lost to make them more comfortable and to make it just a bit easier for them.  and she did. what a gift she was to c.o.p.s. and many of us personally. she will be so missed. i know                                                                               many of you worked very closely with her and the volunteers at npw.  my deepest condolences to all who knew and loved her, especially her husband rusty,                                                                                             ﻿                          her family, and her best friend ms. pat."                                                                  - dianne bernhard, executive director of concerns of police survivors

growing up, gabrielle (leon) and wyatt woodrell shared a bond that many youths in america would never think about; both had their father die in the line of duty. gabrielle and wyatt met each other while in attendance at c.o.p.s. kids camp.                                                                                     the pair have always been close and knew that they could always reach out to one another for support when they needed it. knowing that they had a peer who truly cared and understood what they were going through made all the difference in their respective grief journeys.                                                                                     “in every different phase of life there is always this unspoken thing," gabrielle said. "you hit a new life milestone and dad’s not here. while this is happening, i think it is a very special thing that when i hit these milestones, i have someone next to me who understands because they are going through the same exact things.”                                                                                     since meeting at kids camp in 2005 their relationship has blossomed and the happy couple find themselves building their lives together as they are now married. through c.o.p.s. and their relationship, gabrielle and wyatt have been able to find support and continue to build their lives. both have begun mentoring at c.o.p.s. kids camp to assist the organization, and child survivors in any way they can.                                                                                     “i just felt the need to give back, it was something i knew i needed to do," wyatt said. "kids camp had and still has such a significant impact on me. i remember having amazing mentors to look up to and lean on and that’s what i want to be for my groups, i want to provide them with hope and encouragement.”                                                                                     moving forward, both gabrielle and wyatt want to continue to be involved with c.o.p.s. kids camp                                                                                     gabrielle and wyatt woodrell                                                                   surviving children of                                                                  cleveland (oh) police officer wayne leon,                                                      eow 6/25/2000                                                      &                                                      pawnee county (ok) sheriff dwight c. woodrell, jr.,                                                      eow 10/13/2001

  it was the first place where someone truly understood my pain without me saying a word.  it was an atmosphere where i could cry and laugh all in the same place and everyone understood and no one judged the way i was grieving.  it was the place where i first found hope.  thank you c.o.p.s.!!!

  it's more than just "another memorial."  it's the start of healing and the hugs and the support you receive from the moment you step off the plane are worth the miles and tears it takes to get there.  no one looks at you out of pity when you cry, or looks at you like you're crazy when you laugh.  it's all accepted as normal, and when you are accepted, healing begins.
