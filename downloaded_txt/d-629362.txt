welcome aboard jetpiedmont!




on a cold day in february, 1948, a small dc-3 took to the skies over wilmington, north carolina enroute to cincinnati, ohio with intermediate stops in southern pines, charlotte and ashville, north carolina, tri-cities, tennessee and lexington, kentucky.
piedmont airlines flight 41 was carrying one paying passenger, piedmont's founder t.h. davis who was not yet 30 years old and a handful of local dignitaries.







from this humble beginning, piedmont airlines grew from the smallest of 17 local and trunk  airlines to become the 6th largest airline in the united states in terms of passengers carried, flying over 200 jet aircraft from los angeles to london and more revenue passengers annually than british airways, pan am or twa while consistently placing in the top 3 u.s. flag carriers with the fewest passenger complaints according to the u.s. department of transportation. in recognition of its outstanding success, piedmont airlines was named air transport worlds' "airline of the year" in 1984.


     
              




august 5th, 2024, marks the 35th anniversary of the merger with us airways (formerly usair) and the end of scheduled operations as piedmont airlines. on september 27, 2005, us airways was purchased in bankruptcy by america west airlines. a merger of the two airlines' faa operating certificates occurred on september 25, 2007 (the us airways certificate survived), ending the 24-year history of the america west airlines name. on december 09, 2013, us airways purchased american airlines in bankruptcy and us airways and american airlines merge to form american airlines group, operating today as the new american airlines since october 16, 2015.

will the real piedmont airlines please stand up

in 1931, richard "dick" henson established a fixed-base operation known as henson aviation in hagerstown, maryland. over the years, the company operated as an allegheny commuter airline. on july 29, 1983, piedmont airlines received regulatory approval to acquire henson aviation, inc. as a wholly owned subsidiary, marking a historic moment in aviation as it was the first instance of a certified airline fully owning its regional affiliate.
consequently, the airline was rebranded as "henson, the piedmont regional airline". between 1983 and 1989, henson experienced significant growth, quadrupling its size. following piedmont's merger with usair in 1989, ed colodny, the ceo of usair, rebranded "henson, the piedmont regional airline" to "piedmont airlines," operating under the usair express brand to safeguard their $1.59 billion investment in the legacy piedmont airlines.
currently, the "new" piedmont airlines operates as one of six american eagle regional airlines flying to over 50 destinations in the eastern and midwestern united states, along with toronto, montreal and quebec city in canada.
