                            radio provides your music 
                            access to many listeners 
                            in many places - quickly. 
                            it can be utilized in several 
                            ways. the most obvious is 
                            the ability to reach thousands 
                            of listeners at the same 
                            time all over the globe 
                            (or more locally). having 
                            your cd played on radio 
                            several times per week will 
                            only help make a greater 
                            impact with the listeners. 
                            the more people hear your 
                            music, the greater opportunity 
                            to cultivate new fans, drive 
                            sales and help take your 
                            career to the next level.
