how?
backintyme makes history come alive. we don period dress to perform stories and songs of the 19th century. each performance piece consists of an anecdote drawn from historical research, interwoven with a related song of the time. the stories tell what folks did and thought back then -- their acts and ideas. they form the source of our knowledge of the past. the songs reveal what they felt -- their emotions. they weave the fabric of our understanding.
backintyme performs at the florida folk festival at stephen foster folk culture center state park, ormond beach celtic festival, ocali country days at silver river state park, pioneer settlement jamboree at barberville, and at reenactments and schools throughout florida.
