jo horn, president & ceo, the hope foundation for cancer research


      our goal
significantly improve lives through cancer clinical trials and translational research.
we test new ways to prevent and treat cancer.
we study ways to improve the care cancer patients receive, and improve quality of life for survivors once initial treatment ends - relieving pain, promoting physical and mental health, and creating better end-of-life care.
