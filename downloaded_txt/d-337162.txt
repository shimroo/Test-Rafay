    2024 fias canceled due to hurricanes milton and helene


 october 14, 2024

air show canceled due to hurricanes milton and helene                                                      [punta gorda, fl] –  in light of the significant impacts of hurricane milton and hurricane helene on the community, organizers have made the difficult decision to cancel the 43rd annual florida international air show. the dual hurricanes have caused widespread damage and disruption across the region, making it impractical to proceed with the event.                                                                                     "our community is facing tremendous challenges as we recover from the destruction caused by these two powerful storms," said denise dull, president of the air show. "the safety of our attendees, vendors, and volunteers is our highest priority, and at this time, it is clear that the best course of action is to focus on supporting our community’s recovery efforts."                                                                                     both hurricanes have resulted in extensive damage to homes, businesses, and essential infrastructure, with many residents still experiencing the impact of these events. as the region continues its recovery efforts, event organizers believe the community’s attention and resources are best directed toward rebuilding and aiding those affected by the storms.                                                                                     while the air show is an annual tradition that brings joy and excitement to the area, the decision to cancel was made out of an abundance of caution and care for the community’s well-being. organizers are committed to bringing the event back stronger once recovery efforts are complete and the community is ready to come together in celebration.                                                                                     "we are incredibly grateful to our sponsors, volunteers, and vendors who have worked tirelessly in preparation for this year’s event. our community partners, pgd, charlotte county sheriff, fire & ems, are all committed to the safety of charlotte county and its residents and we would not want to do anything that would create a larger burden on their workload during post hurricane rebuild," added dull. "we look forward to the november 2025 air show hosting the us navy blue angels, where we can provide an amazing event in a way that reflects the strength and resilience of our community." tickets will be refundable or may be exchanged for the 2025 air show. *note the lower ticket price will be honored as we expect ticket prices will increase.                                                                                     for more information on how to assist in relief efforts, please visit www.coadfl.org                                                                                                  about the florida international air show                                                                  the florida international air show’s mission is to deliver a wholesome family entertainment event celebrating aviation past, present, and inspiring its future.                                                                                                  ﻿                        for further information or media inquiries, please contact: steve lineberry 941-626-0551 media@floridaairshow.com
