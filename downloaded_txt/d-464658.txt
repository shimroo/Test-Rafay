   testimonials
   
  "on several occasions, javeler has provided my company with subsea excavation services in the form of toyo pumps and personnel. on each of these occasions javeler has consistently proven themselves to be one of the most professional and technically advanced companies in the current subsea excavation market. not only does javeler provide quality equipment and service, they go out of their way to understand our particular needs and make modifications to their equipment, in many of these cases these modifications have led to a significant reduction on overall project execution and subsequent cost for my projects.”
c. webb, director of projects


 
  “i have used javeler extensively over the past 4 years and have always been satisfied with their exceptional performance and attention to detail. the entire javeler team is dedicated to the project’s success. i would certainly recommend you talk to them about your dredging needs and give them a chance to show you what they can do.”
