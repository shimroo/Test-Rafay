frequently asked questions

the north carolina railroad company (ncrr) owns and manages the 317-mile rail corridor that stretches from charlotte through the triad and the triangle to the port in morehead city. click here for an interactive map of the north carolina rail network.





how do i apply for right of entry (roe) application?



a right of entry (roe) is permission granted by an operating railroad for passage into a rail corridor. you must apply for a right of entry permit to obtain access to the rail corridor.





i want to report a malfunction at a railroad crossing.



for health or safety emergencies at a railroad crossing dial 911 first. if you are currently at the crossing, look for the blue sign on the crossing signal pole. this sign will give you the telephone number to call and the crossing number to provide. in north carolina the crossing is most likely operated by norfolk southern (1-800-946-4744) or csx (1-800-232-0144). tell them the city and street name when you call if you do not have the crossing number.





does ncrr run the trains? does ncrr have a rail yard?



the north carolina railroad company does not operate freight or passenger trains. norfolk southern operates the freight trains on the ncrr and amtrak operates the passenger trains. the rail yards on the ncrr are also operated by norfolk southern.
