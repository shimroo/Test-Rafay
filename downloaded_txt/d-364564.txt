    i love my church: 
february sermon series

february is the month of love. there are many things we love: god, our family, our faith, and our church. we love our church because it provides us with relationships where we are loved when life challenges isolate and overwhelm us. during life’s messy moments, the church provides hope for the future. jesus says, “i came that they may have life, and have it abundantly.” we believe that abundant life is experienced when we live a life with god, a life in community, a life of generosity, and a life of impact.god has called us to love one another as his church. over the next four weeks, in our, i love my church, series, we explore what it means to love snellville community church, begin to experience the abundant life jesus promised, and how we can practically express our love for our church. we are more than an institution or a building and a place we “have to” visit. we’re called to be a movement that guides people to the abundant life of christ in a thriving community.
