 "for assuredly, i say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law (torah) till all is fulfilled." 




matthew 5:18


























































who we are





we are a messianic community that is diverse in age, background, ethnicity and nationality dedicated to "balancing the goodness of torah with grace and mercy." this was a recurring theme that messiah expressed to his chosen people during his ministry, and so, we have come together to worship in a style that follows his 1st century mode of worship.we meet at 11am on shabbat (saturday). we start with a worship offering to the lord then we have a torah reading and after that a message for the day and after services, we enjoy a fellowship meal together. please join us.can't make it to congregation?we have a shabbat conference call number... (253) 993-3413, no access code is needed.thank you for considering congregation t'shuvat yisrael for donations and tithe giving. we are happy to offer you an online donation option by debit or credit card.thanks again and may the lord bless you and keep you!

what is a messianic synagogue?







"a rose by any other name would smell as sweet" is a quote by william shakespeare from his play romeo and juliet. what he means here is that the names of things do not matter, only what things are. many messianic believers wish to reinvent themselves by looking for another descriptive label, for varied but misguided reasons. a messianic synagogue is the coming together of believer's in yeshua (jesus) of nazareth, which is foretold by the hebrew prophets.

fruits of the spirit...                                           do you know god?







when the spirit of god is present in someone, it shows up in our character. in other words, the holy spirit changes the way we live our life so that it benefits the people around us. yeshua calls it the 'fruit of the spirit', and just like the fruit grown by a tree, it can nourish and sustain people all around it.it's easy to criticize someone who is not showing us their fruit, but what does that say about our fruit?

should we mock prophesy?





evangelist, pastor and teacher have become the acceptable roles in the ecclesia, but on whose authority was the role of apostle and prophet denied? was it the same "authority" that determined the church replaced israel? was it the church leaders who denied the validity of g-dâs holy days? are we to believe anything from those who dismiss âthe lawâ even though yeshua (jesus) said, âif you love me, then keep my commandments?
