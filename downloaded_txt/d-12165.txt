about flood® wood finishes
the wood care specialist®
founded in 1841 by the flood family of painters, the flood® brand has earned its reputation as the wood care specialist by creating products that protect, preserve and beautify any wood project. we understand the time and effort involved in exterior wood care and the pride and satisfaction felt in a job well done. that’s why flood products can be trusted to deliver consistent and quality results, long-lasting performance and peace of mind.

our story 
under the leadership of earl d. flood, the flood company introduced penetrol®, a high solid, durable paint oil used as a protective coating for wood and metal or as a paint additive to assure smooth and easy application of oil based paints and varnishes. in 1970, with the growth of pressure-treated lumber, the flood company, using penetrol additive as a key ingredient, developed a clear finish for pressure-treated lumber, which came to be known as cwf® (clear wood finish). today, penetrol additive and the cwf product line is still sought after and recognized among professionals and homeowners.
