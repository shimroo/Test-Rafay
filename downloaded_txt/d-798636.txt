this blog might be dead.it will be even dead-er for the next three weeks. i'm going on a mystical journey to find myself. which really means i'm going to go on a mystical journey to shop in other parts of the world. don't wait up for me.*the general specific - band of horses*

well, you know what they say. the way you spend new years eve, is the way you'll spend the rest of the upcoming year. if that's the case, i'm going to spend all of 2008 alone, baking cranberry muffins, and listening to 'q' on cbc. i suppose there are worse things. like spending the year drunk and making out with a stranger. but is that really worse? i really think the jury's out on that one.happy new year, suckas.*warning - incubus*

	 oh santa i've been killing just for fun
	 
    

almost christmas! typing this is painful. i cut my index finger with a pair of scissors a child would use whilst opening a box of goodies from a land afar. each time i use that finger to type a letter, which is quite often, as i use it to type y,u,h,n,m and the lesser used j, pressure is put on my finger tip, right at the epicenter of the injury. my first christmas related injury to date. injuries which can be expected in the week or so of holidays to come include: burnt tongue from too-hot cocoa, f(l)at ass from too much movie watching, and exploding bellypants from way too much poppycock, nanaimo bars, cookies/cakes/whathaveyou. i also expect a severe depression to ensue post holiday season as i come down off of an extensive sugar high, and finally emerge from the daze to realize they stopped making my so called life thirteen years ago, and that jordan catalano is really old now, and wearing eyeliner. and p.s.? i would way rather make out with brian krakow. minus the high pants.did this have a point? oh, the cut. from a box. a box from lands afar, which i had to pick up at the bus depot. the bus depot, where i saw the cutest boy ever! that is the point. i saw the cutest boy ever at the bus depot. for the fifteen minutes i stood in line to get my package, i stared at the back of his head and wondered if he cleaned behind his ears, because it was spotless back there.now it's 8:11 pm, which is sufficiently late enough for me to have a bubble bath, and then crawl into bed, watch the rest of 'love actually' and wish that i could have colin firth as a husband.*don't shoot me santa - the killers

	 is it my imagination or have i finally found something worth living for?
	 
    

i love boys that work in video stores. so much. and on that same note: i think if i could write a note to the past - say 1995 - and send it in a time machine, it would definitely consist of the line: "in the future, there will be no late charges at video stores"i think that, above anything else, would shock the world. *oasis - cigarettes and alcohol

	 there's always other boys, there's always other boyfriends
	 
    

i refuse to believe that women are the more complicated species. we're not that hard to figure out. just don't piss us off, and you'll be fine. boys on the other hand? someone needs to write a manual. and none of that 'he's just not that into you' bullshit. now, i'm sitting alone drinking a keith's. i. don't. even. like. beer.as you can see, i'm having issues. *you can make him like you - the hold steady*

	 i've got a hunger twisting my stomach into knots
	 
    

it's 10:06 pm. i opted out of a movie date with a friend because i was so tired i could hardly stay awake - which resulted in me falling asleep on the couch for an hour, waking up to an old episode of survivor on tvtropolis, and subsequently having a boring saturday night alone. and now, it's bedtime and i'm not tired. what a waste of a perfectly good evening. boo. hiss. grey cup sunday tomorrow. i've got cold beer in the fridge, and chips and dip. i think that's what people like when they watch football. i have nothing of importance to say. i'm really just trying to pass the time until my body agrees with my mind and i can go to bed. i will say this though. i re-watched the royal tenenbaums this week, and i forgot how much i love it. this was incredibly boring. i apologize for wasting your time. and internet space. i'll post again when i figure out if the things i find interesting in my life at this exact moment turn out to be actually interesting.*the sound of settling - death cab for cutie*

	 you will pay for your excessive charm
	 
    

so, the riders won! i imagine everyone at work appreciated my green cupcakes which i proudly adorned with the rider logo. people at my work have no shame. i'm sure i could have emblazened the cupcakes with pictures of noriega and they would have been gobbled just as swiftly. and despite the cupcakes getting the day started right, it was a crazy busy day at work today. you know you're stressed when you start telling people you're going to stab the next person who ticks you off with a rusty spoon. and why a spoon? because it'll hurt more. *details of the war - clap your hands say yeah*
