shooting hoops…in hong kong 


if you were asked to guess which city in the world has the most basketball courts…you probably wouldn’t say hong kong. this dense urban area has a surprisingly hidden secret – and that’s it plethora of places to play and enjoy the game.

how, exactly, has anyone come to this conclusion?  this discovery comes from american photographer austin bell, who spent three years documenting every basketball court in the city, capturing over 58,000 photos of 2,549 courts.
the prevalence of these courts stems from hong kong’s unique urban planning policies dating back to the 1950s and ’60s. public housing guidelines mandated one basketball court per 10,000 residents—a higher ratio than any other outdoor sports facility. the courts’ compact size made them ideal for hong kong’s space-constrained environment, allowing them to be creatively integrated into the urban fabric: on rooftops, between skyscrapers, and even in remote island communities.
bell’s project, showcased in his exhibition “shooting hoops,” reveals how these courts serve multiple purposes beyond basketball. from choral practices to pet tortoise walking and drying orange peels, they’ve become vital community spaces in one of the world’s densest cities. the courts represent hong kong’s innovative approach to urban design, where efficiency meets community needs, creating what urban design expert jeroen van ameijde calls a “hyper-dense mix of both life and work, commerce and efficiency.”
shooting hoops will include a book launch and exhibition at the blue lotus gallery until february 23rd. located at 28 pound lane, tal ping shan in hong kong, it’s definitely worth a visit if you are there. and the book will be a fascinating one to own and enjoy for basketball lovers around the world.

tips to stop procrastinating 


research shows that procrastination is fundamentally rooted in emotion regulation, with people delaying tasks as a way to cope with negative feelings about those tasks. this avoidance behavior can lead to serious consequences including physical health problems, anxiety, and deteriorating relationships, according to research from durham university.

the underlying causes of chronic procrastination vary significantly. some people procrastinate due to fear of imperfection or failure, while others may have neurodevelopmental conditions like adhd or unresolved trauma that makes task completion challenging. understanding these root causes through therapy or self-reflection is essential for developing effective solutions.
with that said, what are some quick ideas that can be offered to help people when they procrastinate?several practical strategies can help break the cycle of procrastination. creating manageable schedules with realistic timelines helps prevent overwhelm. using positive rewards rather than self-criticism provides better motivation. breaking large tasks into smaller pieces makes them less daunting, while techniques like the pomodoro method (25-minute focused work intervals) or the eisenhower matrix (prioritizing tasks by urgency and importance) help with time management. additional approaches include mindfulness techniques for emotion regulation, ensuring adequate sleep and exercise, and utilizing social support systems for accountability.
success in overcoming procrastination typically comes from implementing a personalized combination of these strategies while maintaining realistic expectations for progress.

a guide to the best cities…and streets…for 2025 


as travelers plan their 2025 adventures, two key questions emerge: which cities offer the most compelling experiences, and within those urban landscapes, which streets capture the true essence of local life? recent rankings from time out shed light on both, offering a comprehensive guide to the world’s most vibrant urban destinations. so if you’re thinking of exploring cities in the year to come, here are some great suggestions.

cape town claims the crown
cape town has emerged as 2025’s must-visit city, offering an unmatched combination of natural wonders and urban excitement. where else can you encounter african penguins, sample world-class wines, and gaze upon one of the new seven wonders of nature all in one day? the city’s blend of historical significance and affordable experiences makes it particularly appealing for international visitors, with areas like trendy kalk bay and the food-centric east city leading the charge in urban innovation
global cities making waves
following cape town’s lead, bangkok secured the second spot, earning praise for its legendary food scene, with 86% of locals rating it as exceptional. new york city, though dropping from its top position last year, still commands attention as the third-best city globally, with an impressive 92% of respondents celebrating its world-class cultural offerings.
melbourne, securing fourth place, proves itself a double threat – not only is it among 2025’s top cities, but it’s also home to what’s been crowned the world’s coolest street for 2024: high street.
with all of this in mind, here is the rundown of the top 10 cities to visit this year:

cape town, south africa
bangkok, thailand
new york, us
melbourne, australia
london, uk
new orleans, us
mexico city, mexico
porto, portugal
shanghai, china
copenhagen, denmark

what about the best streets?
it’s interesting to evaluate places to visit based on which ones have the coolest streets. undoubtedly, if you have one cool street, you probably have other places worth seeing. high street in melbourne exemplifies what makes a street truly “cool” – a perfect blend of epic restaurants, hidden bars, live music venues, and boutique shops, all wrapped in a warm community spirit. this vibrant thoroughfare, crossing through the suburbs of northcote, thornbury, and preston, showcases everything from portuguese custard tarts at casa nata to innovative pasta at 1800 lasagne.
hong kong’s hollywood road claims the second spot among cool streets, featuring michelin-starred dining at tate dining room and cultural landmarks like man mo temple. meanwhile, austin’s east eleventh street packs remarkable variety into just a quarter-mile, with highlights including the unique vintage bookstore & wine bar and the perpetually festive kenny dorham’s backyard.
here is the list of the top ten streets to visit, as covered by time out.

high street, melbourne, australia
hollywood road, hong kong
east eleventh, austin, texas, usa
guatemala street, buenos aires, argentina
commercial drive, vancouver, canada
jalan petaling, kuala lumpur, malaysia
rua da boavista, lisbon, portugal
arnaldo quintela, rio de janeiro, brazil
chazawa-dori, tokyo, japan
consell de cent, barcelona, spain

this certainly offers a lot of suggestions as you plan your 2025 travels!

a sustainable health plan idea 


yes, the new year just started and people are always talking about new year’s resolutions at this time. hopefully, you’ve already created a sustainable food and fitness plan that doesn’t have to be modified or started again just because the calendar turned to january 1. but if you haven’t yet created a fitness plan – here is a great way to start.
you don’t have to join a gym (although you certainly can!) or exercise for hours a day in order to see results and health benefits. here are two very simple ways to start to incorporate fitness into your regular routine. two fundamental elements – core strength and walking – can form the foundation of a sustainable fitness journey.

your core is more than just visible abs – it’s a complex system of muscles that includes your entire midsection, from abs and obliques to lower back and pelvic floor muscles. this powerhouse stabilizes your body, enables movement in all directions, and transmits power through your limbs. the plank exercise stands out as an excellent way to strengthen your entire core, offering modifications and variations to suit any fitness level. here is an article that explains more about the plank and about how to get started incorporating this into your life!
complementing core work with regular walking provides remarkable benefits with no need for a gym membership or equipment purchases.  starting with just five minutes of walking per day can build momentum toward a more active lifestyle. to maximize benefits, try increasing intensity gradually, perhaps by adding weights or incorporating stairs. walking also offers mental health benefits, reducing anxiety and depression.
for optimal results, combine both elements: maintain a strong core for stability and power, while using walking as your daily cardiovascular foundation. remember that consistency trumps intensity when starting out – small, sustainable changes lead to lasting fitness improvements.

what happens to those dresses after the gala? 


have you ever wondered what happens to those incredibly fancy gowns worn to the oscars, golden globes and other awards shows once the night is over? certainly most women would never be caught in the gown again – and they wouldn’t exactly loan it to their friend to wear for another occasion. so what happens?

cnn recently covered this topic and their findings were quite illuminating. the afterlife of a red carpet gown is far more complex and carefully orchestrated than you might imagine. immediately after an event, these garments undergo a cleaning process to remove any traces of makeup, perfume, or body products that could damage the fabric over time. this preservation step is crucial, as even invisible residues can oxidize and alter the garment’s color and texture.
most gowns then make their way to specialized storage facilities, either owned by fashion houses or private archivists like the wardrobe. these aren’t ordinary storage units – they’re more like museums, with carefully controlled temperature, humidity, and lighting conditions. each piece receives individualized treatment: some hang, others rest in boxes, and some require custom dress forms to maintain their shape. the storage method depends entirely on the garment’s construction and materials.
these preserved gowns can follow several paths. some are selected for museum exhibitions, becoming historical artifacts that document both fashion evolution and cultural moments. the logistics of moving these pieces are incredibly complex – some require seven-foot-tall custom crates for transportation. other gowns become part of fashion house archives, preserved for future reference and inspiration.
occasionally, celebrities purchase their gowns, as kim kardashian has done with her met gala outfits. in rarer cases, gowns take unexpected journeys – like elizabeth taylor’s dior oscar dress being discovered in a friend’s suitcase years later, or lady gaga’s golden globes gown allegedly ending up in hotel lost and found. some garments, like tyla’s 2023 met gala balmain creation, are even deliberately altered or partially destroyed after their red carpet moment, becoming part of the evening’s performance art.
this careful preservation of red carpet gowns reflects their evolution from mere clothing to significant cultural artifacts, worthy of museum-quality care and documentation.
