the keys to your heart
you are attracted to those who are unbridled, untrammeled, and free.
in love, you feel the most alive when your lover is creative and never lets you feel bored.
you'd like to your lover to think you are stylish and alluring.
you would be forced to break up with someone who was emotional, moody, and difficult to please.
your ideal relationship is open. both of you can talk about everything... no secrets.
your risk of cheating is zero. you care about society and morality. you would never break a commitment.
you think of marriage as something that will confine you. you are afraid of marriage.
in this moment, you think of love as something you can get or discard anytime. you're feeling self centered.
what are the keys to your heart?
