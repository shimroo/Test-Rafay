 visioncare & medical insurance
we often have patients that have both vision insurance (for example, vsp, eyemed, spectera, davis, and others) and medical insurance (for example, blue cross, aetna, blue shield, or medicare). they are very different in terms of the services they cover, deductibles, and co-pays, and it's important for our patients to understand these differences.vision insurancevision insurance is designed mainly to cover determining a prescription for glasses, to help pay for glasses or contact lenses, and to cover a yearly routine screening of the health of the eyes in a healthy patient that has no particular problems or symptoms. it is not equipped to deal with and does not usually cover medical conditions of the eye or that affect the eye, eye injuries, and/or medical or surgical treatments.medical insurancemedical insurance is designed to cover you when you have a medical problem, including one in your eyes or one that affects your eyes. medical insurance does not cover routine eye care services or examinations for glasses, or routine vision problems such as nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. those are only covered by your vision insurance. when you complain of a medical problem, have a medical diagnosis, or medical condition is present that affects your eyes, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes, to name just a few examples, or you have an eye disease or eye problem such as an infection (pink eye), dry eyes, allergy, glaucoma, or cataracts, again, just to name a few, we must file the claim with your medical insurance, and the coverages, co-pays and deductibles for that insurance will apply. your vision plan does not cover these kinds of problems. our office does not make these rules, they are made by the insurance companies themselves, and we must comply with them. if you have an hmo, such as kaiser, or blue cross hmo, you may have no coverage for these kinds of problems in our office, and you will have to call your hmo to see a doctor if you want covered care for these conditions. there is often no way to know prior to your examination which type of insurance will be the right one to file your claim with, because often we do not know what or if anything is wrong with your eyes before the examination. we make every effort to join as many insurance panels, both medical and vision, as we can for your convenience. if we are on your insurance company's panel we will file those claims for you. in the event that we do not accept your medical or vision insurance we will provide you with an itemized receipt so that you may file a claim for reimbursement with your insurance company yourself. if you have any questions, please let us know.aboutreviews  i was impressed with my experience visiting dr. panzer's office this morning. i found everyone very helpful and professional. dr. panzer gave me a thorough check up, explained my problem very clearly and i think the solution he explained for my problem is on the way to be fixed after the first treatment and now i am anxious to have two following treatments and i am sure this procedure will be successful. his office has all the latest equipment, i was very impressed. i will surely recommend dr. panzer to all friends and acquaintances.jacqueline k.my first experience at this office was exceptional! from the ladies at the front desk when i walked in the door to dr. panzer, i cannot compliment them enough. they are so friendly and they genuinely care about their patients and it shows.jackie fullerour family had a great eye exam! you are warmly and professionally greeted the moment you arrive in the office. dr panzer is very friendly, giving a thorough exam with the most current techniques available. the eyeglass frame choices are current trends.dana si always enjoy seeing dr panzer and his staff. dr panzer is always thorough! sorry you all flooded but the remodel is so nice!rhonda orazio    mapcontactinterested in our services?request an appointment with this form to schedule a time with our professional staff!        form submitted successfully! you are missing required fields. dynamic error description there was an error processing this form. brandsbrands we carry   monday8:30 am to 6:00 pmthursday8:30 am to 6:00 pmtuesday - wednesday8:30 am to 5:00 pmfriday9:00 am to 5:00 pm    4760 beechnut st. houston   tx 77096 usa      (713) 664-4760     © 2024 houston dry eye clinic   - all rights reserved -  accessibility statement -  sitemap  notice of privacy practice  powered by         × appointment request   at houston dry eye clinic , we provide the highest quality eye care to all our patients. schedule your appointment today.       8:00 am9:00 am10:00 am11:00 am1:00pm2:00pm3:00pm4:00pm   thank you. we will connect with you shortly. you are missing required fields. dynamic error description there was an error processing this form.            close        × login        forgot password?
