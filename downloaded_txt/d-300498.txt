	 day 19 - symbol challenge 4
	 
    


the da vinci code quest on google walkthrough answers and hintsday 19 - symbol challenge 4this is the fourth symbol challenge and this time it is a 6 x 6 grid with 6 distinct regions. mine seemed particularly difficult this round and i think it was because there were only 6 symbols placed at the beginning. if you have experience doing sudoku puzzles, then you should be able to complete this puzzle in due time. if you do not have experience with this type of puzzle, i can offer few hints other than what has been posted in previous symbol challenge posts. if anyone can offer some assistance, please leave a comment.after solving the puzzle, the following question was posed to me:in the italian renaissance in england, author lewis einstein discusses florentine bankers and the wars of which king?a - edwardit is likely that different questions will be asked requiring the use of google book search. do a search for the title of the book and the text in bold to find your correct answer. leave a comment revealing the question and answer you were asked.

	 day 15 - curator challenge 3
	 
    


day 15 - curator challenge 3the da vinci code quest on google walkthrough answers and hintshang the paintings as the instructions ask you to do so, remember that not all hooks will necessarily be used. a very straight forward puzzle, simply click and drag the paintings to where you think they belong. i would recommend starting with the largest painting and going from there. each new puzzle layout differs. as in the 2nd curator challenge, there are a total of 7 paintings to be hung.once you have successfully repositioned the paintings (as above), you are presented with the following hidden query, another translate question:translate flight to italian.a. vololeave the question and answer to your puzzle in the comments section to help others.

the da vinci code quest on google walkthrough answers and hintsday 14 - restoration challenge 3this is a fairly straight forward challenge again. there is more complexity as there are now 12 splotches on the piece of art. if worse comes to worse, simply click until all of the spots merge into one. start from the outside and work your way in as it is possible to not solve this puzzle (it was always possible to solve in the first phase of this challenge). you can only merge debris that is separated by one space.after solving the puzzle, the following question was asked to me:translate nzm from atbashatbash is a cypher language. here is the key for atbash:a=z | n=mb=y | o=lc=x | p=kd=w | q=je=v | r=if=u | s=hg=t | t=gh=s | u=fi=r | v=ej=q | w=dk=p | x=cl=o | y=bm=n | z=amy answer will be : mann=m , z=a, n=mvery cool puzzle today. best of luck with yours.
