“this stuff works amazing! i always make sure i have some on hand. this stuff is spendy but it is worth every penny! works better than any other sunburn treatment on the market.”   tayler h






“it is a staple in my home. tried it in hawaii and brought it home. love it so much that i’m happy to be able to buy it here.  invaluable for skin and hair/scalp. no breakouts!” tapita l






“i use this oil on my face and neck. i also add it to my foundation so it isn’t caked on. it can also be used on hair, nails, skin, etc! i found it in hawaii and when i ran out found it here. it doesn’t break you out!!”pam d






“i ordered the kukui oil after finishing a bottle i had purchased in hawaii a year ago. i use the oil for a dry skin condition on my hands and arms. the product ordered is a light oil with no fragrance. it spreads easily, is quickly absorbed and does not leave a greasy film. it is the best kind of treatment i have found for consistently dry skin.”  sharon s 






“my husband is prone to night time hives. kukui oil helps relieve the itchiness, and starts to work almost immediately after being applied. we live in canada so we do pay a premium for this product. but we apply the oil sparingly as that's all that is needed, and my husband doesn't get hives often, so it's worth it for the relief it brings him. do note that this is pure kukui oil; there are many products that have kukui oil in them, but are not 100% kukui oil. this product has a pleasant mild scent, and a little goes a long way.”   “wanderdlust”






“my mother used to buy this from hawaii for my son when he was a child, now he is 24 & continues to use it to help with his eczema, so when the surgeon i work for was saying his infant has eczema issues, i immediately ordered this oil from amazon. him & his wife thanked me stating that they use this everyday on their son and his scalp and they even purchased another bottle. it truly helps with eczema & it is pricey but worth it.”   masina  






“our family was introduced to kukui oil on our last trip to big island.  my son got a bad burn..”  “[he] bought a bottle and within seconds of applying it he already felt better.  we all had reason to use a little over the next week or so and since then we keep it on hand. by far the best ointment we have found. not only soothes immediately, but has really helped the healing process…”ac  






“love oils of aloha products beautiful cold pressed oils that do what they say on the bottle.”   avril h
