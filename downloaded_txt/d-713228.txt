posted on july 4, 2024the role of colors and patterns in baby mobiles and cot toys 

colors and patterns play a significant role in the development of babies, especially in the context of baby mobiles and cot toys. these elements not only attract and engage babies but also contribute to their sensory and cognitive development. in this blog post, we’ll explore the importance of colors and patterns in baby mobiles and cot toys and how they can benefit your little one. for a variety of stimulating baby mobiles and toys, visit babycotmobiles.com.au.
how babies perceive colors
newborns have limited color vision, initially seeing only in shades of black, white, and gray. as their vision develops, they begin to distinguish primary colors such as red, blue, and yellow. by around five months, most babies can see the full spectrum of colors.
the importance of color contrast
high-contrast colors, such as black and white or bright primary colors, are particularly effective in capturing a baby’s attention. the stark differences between these colors make them easier for babies to see and focus on, stimulating their visual development.
patterns and visual stimulation
patterns are equally important in engaging a baby’s senses. simple patterns like stripes, polka dots, and geometric shapes are easier for babies to recognize and can help improve their visual tracking skills. as babies grow, more complex patterns can provide additional stimulation and interest.
benefits of colors and patterns in baby mobiles and cot toys
1. visual development
high-contrast colors and bold patterns help to strengthen a baby’s eyesight and improve their ability to focus. mobiles and toys that incorporate these elements encourage babies to track moving objects, enhancing their visual acuity.
2. cognitive stimulation
colors and patterns can stimulate a baby’s brain, promoting cognitive development. engaging with visually stimulating toys helps babies learn to differentiate between shapes and colors, laying the foundation for future learning.
3. emotional comfort
certain colors can have a calming effect on babies. soft, pastel colors like blue and green are known for their soothing properties, while warmer colors like red and yellow can energize and uplift. choosing the right colors for your baby’s toys and nursery can create a comforting and nurturing environment.
4. motor skills development
brightly colored and patterned toys encourage babies to reach out, grasp, and interact with their surroundings. this not only improves their hand-eye coordination but also helps develop fine motor skills.
choosing the right colors and patterns
when selecting baby mobiles and cot toys, consider the following tips to ensure they are visually stimulating and beneficial for your baby’s development:
1. opt for high-contrast colors
choose toys with high-contrast colors, especially for newborns. black and white combinations, as well as bright primary colors, are ideal for capturing a baby’s attention.
2. incorporate simple patterns
look for toys with simple, bold patterns like stripes, polka dots, and geometric shapes. these patterns are easier for babies to recognize and can help improve their visual tracking skills.
3. mix and match
variety is key. choose a mix of toys with different colors and patterns to keep your baby engaged and provide a range of visual stimuli.

posted on january 28, 2024tiny sex dolls 

sculptor matt at sinthetics says that doll lovers are “normal people craving connection.” he has seen couples use dolls as sexual surrogates, especially those who cannot enjoy sex with a partner.
however, sex dolls often get linked with men’s violence against women through the use of value-laden language. most of these articles pathologize users by claiming they are the result of objectification and sexualization of women.
portability
if you like the idea of having a sex doll at home or on-the-go, tiny sex dolls are a great option. they take up less space and weigh far less than a full-sized doll. they also make clean up easier and faster.
this partial sex doll offers a symphony of sensations including suction, vibrating, and simulated anal stimulation. it also boasts a flat back that’s ideal for missionary-position thrusting and remains sturdy during vigorous stimulation. the doll is easy to clean using mild soap or a specialized sex toy cleaner.
realism
due to their smaller size, mini sex dolls can be more realistic than traditional dolls. most are made from silicone or thermoplastic elastomer, which have a skin-like feel and offer a lifelike touch. many also have an articulated skeleton to mimic human movements and provide a more realistic experience.
they may also come with embedded moaning or sound features for an even more realistic feel. some even have heating elements to simulate body warmth and a sense of touch.
sex dolls can help people explore sexual fantasies and experiences. but it is important to choose a doll that aligns with your personal goals and preferences.
customization
many cheap sex dolls are customizable to match buyers’ expectations and creative visions. this feature enhances the doll’s intimacy and aesthetic. it also allows owners to craft clothing and accessories for their miniature companions.
the customization options for love dolls include skin tone, eye color and hairstyle. some manufacturers offer various facial types including cute, mature and teenage faces.
in addition, sex dolls can be equipped with a built-in heating system or a heating rod to simulate body heat. the latter option is particularly useful for couples who want to enjoy intimate sensations with their partners.
versatility
this small sex doll is ideal for couples’ play and also works well as a beginner’s toy for stamina training. the dual penetrable canals and suction options of this product set it apart from others in its category, making it a good choice for beginners or advanced users alike.
the high-quality thermoplastic elastomer of this doll mimics the texture and softness of human skin, adding to its lifelike feel. it is highly lubricious, making it easy to slip into orifices for stimulating penetration. its flat back also makes it ideal for some missionary-position thrusting fun.
safe sex
sex dolls can provide a safe, convenient way to explore sexual desires and fantasies without the risks or complications of real-life sexual encounters. however, it’s important to choose a high-quality doll that meets your needs and to properly care for it during use. regular cleaning with warm water and mild soap is recommended, as well as the use of lubricant to enhance the experience. it’s also important to store the doll in a cool, dry place when not in use and to avoid exposure to extreme temperatures.
while some experts warn that child-like sex dolls may encourage pedophilic behavior, others counter that proving a causal link would be nearly impossible. moreover, they note that sex offenders who have access to mainstream pornography report lower levels of societal sexual aggression than those who don’t.
sexual exploration
dolls can be used for a variety of sexual exploration scenarios. to ensure a safe experience, it is important to use plenty of lubrication and to practice proper technique. it is also essential to keep the doll clean and well-maintained. it is recommended to regularly wash the doll with mild soap and warm water, and avoid exposing it to extreme temperatures or direct sunlight.
some people worry that sex dolls promote sexual fantasies about minors and could lead to more child abuse. however, research has found no evidence that dolls increase the risk of sexual violence against children.
stress relief
loneliness can be harmful to your mental health and physical well-being. severe loneliness symptoms include depression, low self-esteem and anxiety, as well as difficulty sleeping. having regular sex with a doll that looks and feels like the partner of your dreams can help relieve stress and reduce loneliness.
aside from sexual pleasure, sex dolls can also be used to practice techniques with your live partner. for example, a study found that men who regularly ejaculated on their love dolls had a lower risk of prostate cancer than those who only ejaculated 3 to 7 times per month.




posted on january 27, 2024choosing a deck builder 

a bespoke deck can improve the look and feel of your home. it also adds value to your property. it’s important to find a builder who is specialised in the kind of work you want done.
matakana’s coastal enclave, green paradise and thriving artisan food scene make it easy to while away a weekend or two (or more). visit the village farmer’s market, sample wines at brick bay or walk the sculpture trail at heron’s flight.
materials
a well-designed deck improves your outdoor living space, increases the value of your home and adds functionality to your life. but choosing the right materials is crucial to ensure that your deck will withstand a range of conditions, including direct sunlight and regular exposure to water.
wood options include cedar, which weathers to a soft yellowish-gray or pressure-treated pine (pine infused with chemicals that protect it against rot). many homeowners choose kwila, a tropical hardwood that starts out reddy brown and fades to driftwood gray over time. some hardwoods, such as ipe (ee-pay), require no staining and are extremely dense and rot resistant.
you should find a local decks, patios & outdoor enclosures professional who has experience working with the type of material you want for your deck. ask for referrals from friends and family, or use houzz’s handy wizard to be matched with local builders who specialise in the kind of work you need done.
design
choosing the right deck builder is a key part of getting your project completed on time and within budget. look for recommendations from friends and family or speak with your architect or draftsperson. once you’ve found a few potential builders, browse their profiles on houzz to view photos of their past renovations and builds.
a qualified deck and patio professional can help you determine the best size, height and construction materials for your deck. they’ll also consider regional factors like climate and weather patterns. a deck builder can also help you create hardscapes, such as driveways, retaining walls and pool coping. they’ll also advise on maintenance and staining options to ensure your deck lasts a long time.
installation
a well-designed deck is an easy way to open up your house, improve indoor/outdoor flow and add value to your property. the team at th construction are experienced warkworth builders that can build you a quality deck to suit your existing home or a new architecturally designed new build.
wood decking matakana options include cedar, which is naturally durable and weathers to a soft, yellowish-gray color; and pressure-treated lumber, which is less expensive but still durable. both types require periodic refinishing to maintain their beauty.
if you’re installing a staircase on your deck, make sure the stairs are properly supported to ensure stability and safety. measure and mark the height of the stairs with a tape measure and framing square, then lay out the first stringer with a level. repeat with the remaining stringers, making sure each step has a small overhang on either side to channel rain away from the structure. once all the stringers are in place, fit them into joist hangers and fasten with lag screws.
maintenance
as with any other structure, regular inspections of your deck are necessary to ensure its longevity. start with a walk around the entire deck and listen for squeaks. feel for soft spots and look for cracks that could indicate rot. you can also poke around with a screwdriver to see how easily the wood is penetrated. if it feels soft or is easily punctured, that’s a sign of rot and needs to be addressed immediately.
underneath, check the ledger board and any other sensitive areas where moisture may collect. make sure there are no stains or signs of water damage, and that all metal connector pieces like nails, screws and bolts are free of rust.
the spacing and alignment of support posts is another important factor. if these are misaligned or not tight enough, they can lead to instability and potential safety issues. a hammer test can help with this — hitting a fastener with a hammer will indicate whether it’s loose or not properly installed.




posted on september 11, 2023buying a sex doll 

a sex doll is a great way to explore your sexual desires without the risks of real-world encounters. often, they’re designed to look like a celebrity or porn star, and specialist love doll stores offer a variety of choices.
while it may be a bit controversial, many people find sex dolls enjoyable and fulfilling. however, it’s important to take proper care of your doll in order to maximize pleasure.
types
sex dolls come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. some are made to resemble a celebrity or porn star, while others may be oversized or feature fantasy proportions. they can also be programmable to include personality traits like jealousy or shyness, which can add to their kink factor.
while it would be easy to dismiss sex dolls as simple carnal tools, they can offer unique types of sexual stimulation and provide an outlet for people who are not ready or able to have physical relationships. they can even help alleviate symptoms of mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression.
choosing the right doll can make all the difference. there are different models, including silicone and tpe adult dolls, which can have a realistic feel and be more durable. they can be full-body or created in parts, such as the breasts, nipples, and vagina/penis. some can even be used for oral sex and anal sex.
materials
the material used to make sex dolls is one of the most important aspects to consider. medical-grade silicone is the best, as it is non-porous and latex-free. it also rejects odors, is highly durable and stretchy. it’s often reserved for premium dolls, but can be found on less-expensive models as well.
tpe and silicone are the most common materials for sex dolls, but each offers distinct strengths and weaknesses. tpe is softer and cheaper, but the body paint fades quickly, making it difficult to clean. silicone is more expensive, but it looks more realistic and offers a satisfying sensation when touching.
for individuals who have specific sexual fetishes that can’t be satisfied with real partners, a sex doll is an excellent alternative. it can help them feel comfortable in intimate situations, and can fill a void left by loneliness and isolation. they’re also great for practice, so that when they do find the right person, they’re ready to go.
tips for maximizing pleasure
in addition to the options for materials, there are several other features that make a sex doll feel more or less realistic. some dolls can stand up, while others are designed to lie down on their back. they can also come with either a built in or removable vagina. the more realistic models will likely have a tighter fit, which can be more arousing.
some sex dolls are even made to simulate oral sex, something that men and women alike can enjoy. some are also designed to be used with a partner, making them perfect for couples who want to experience new pleasures together.
regardless of the model you choose, it’s important to use a doll responsibly to avoid injuries or complications. proper care includes regular cleaning, avoiding harsh handling, and using plenty of lube. it’s also a good idea to store a doll in a cool, dry place and avoid places with significant temperature changes.
storage
sex dolls are toys used by adults with sexual fantasies that do not involve real people. they may be a sexual outlet for people who have non-normative sexual preferences or monogamous couples who want to experiment with different positions without causing physical harm to the other person.
it is important to store your sex doll properly to avoid damage or wear and tear. do not leave it sitting in a chair or on your bed because this can cause damage to the skeleton and indentations to the tissue and skin. you should also avoid storing it in direct sunlight because this can discolor the doll’s skin.
some sex doll lovers prefer to store their love dolls underneath the bed because it is convenient and private. however, this method requires a lot of care and consideration because the back and buttocks of your doll will flatten over time and ruin its realistic posture. you should also place some foam or soft cushions to protect your doll from the sharp edges of the mattress frame.




posted on july 7, 2023march 24, 2024new zealand flowers 

new zealand’s unique isolation has allowed the country to develop a wide variety of native plants and flowers. here are some of the most distinctive.
the kowhai is the unofficial national flower of new zealand. it appears on local artwork, folk tales, and new zealand postage stamps and coins. it has a short blooming season so be sure to catch it while you can.
kowhai
the bright yellow bloom of kowhai, new zealand’s national flower, is a striking feature in the landscape. it’s a common sight alongside streams and on forest edges in both the north and south islands, but is particularly associated with riparian forests.
this is because the species are generally fairly generalists in their habitat requirements, thriving beside rivers and streams, on forest margins, and in open mountain tussock land and lowland areas. the leaves are also notable in having crowded and overlapping leaflets, unlike other new zealand native plants that tend to have more elongated leaflets.
the kowhai is frost hardy and moderately wind and drought tolerant. it grows well on a variety of soil types, but prefers sunny conditions. its distinctive seed pods, which appear after flowering and resemble segments of a banana (although the seeds are actually black in sophora prostrata), make it very easy to identify on the ground. the pods contain abundant, hard-coated seeds that need to be abraded before germination can take place.
pohutukawa
pohutukawa are one of new zealand’s iconic summer flowers. they bloom in bright red throughout the summer months and are often seen on christmas cards and stories. they are also popular among bees for making delicious honey.
‘vibrance’ is a fast-growing, compact cultivar with bright scarlet flowers and orange foliage. its erect growth habit makes it a good choice for coastal gardens and adding to mixed plantings. it can also be grown as a specimen or trimmed into a hedge. it performs well in poor soils, dry periods and coastal conditions, and can tolerate frost once established.
unlike many of our native species, pohutukawa have not developed protective leaf scales to withstand winter snow or frost – instead they cover their leaves with a fine coating of pale hairs, known as tomentum. this helps regulate humidity near the stomata, where air, carbon dioxide and oxygen are taken in for photosynthesis and respiration. the tomentum also prevents leaf burn from salt spray and windburn.
mount cook lily
this beautiful flower, known for its large fragrant cherry pink blooms, is a stand-out in the perennial garden. a carefree plant that returns year after year. this lily will grow in full sun or partial shade and thrives in moist to gravelly soil that drains quickly.
endemic to the south island and stewart island. found in sub-alpine to alpine herbfields and along creek sides. this flower has evolved a clever mechanism that aids survival in the harsh alpine environment. as it grows among rocks that often heat up during the day, its stomates (pores that let water in and out of leaves) have been adjusted to have stomates on both surfaces of the leaf. automatic controls close the lower stomates when they are hot and open the upper ones to prevent the leaves from losing too much water.
it is also one of the few native flowers in new zealand that produces pure white flowers. the other native flower with similar colour is hectorella caespitosa, which is found only in the high country.
veronica
veronica is hardy in most zones and provides a beautiful splash of blue, pink or violet to any garden. it features tall flower spikes that attract bees and butterflies, and is a good choice for a rock garden or as a ground cover. veronica is also used in traditional medicine, and many of its uses are believed to have antimicrobial properties.
several studies have demonstrated that extracts of several veronica species exhibit cytotoxic and/or anticancer activities in vitro against cancer cells. however, little is known about their in vivo bioactivity or the molecular mechanisms of these effects.
in a recent study, the methanolic and aqueous-acetone extracts of three veronica species (v. teucrium, v. jacquinii, and v. urticifola) were analyzed for their ability to protect against ccl4-induced liver injury in rats. these extracts were found to increase glutathione content and reduce tbars levels in the liver. they also displayed antiangiogenic activity in a matrigel assay. these results suggest that veronica could be a promising source of new hepatoprotective compounds.




posted on june 12, 2023pre-moderation of user-generated content 

user-generated content can boost marketing campaigns by offering a fresh voice for brand messages and building trust through authenticity. however, all ugc must be vetted to make sure it isn’t toxic or offensive.
to do so, business must employ ugc content moderation, which consists of scanning ugc for text, video or images that violate rules such as sensitivity or nudity. this can be done manually or using automated methods.
1. pre-moderation
brands need to ensure that their communities are protected from harmful content, and this is where pre-moderation comes into play. this moderation method requires a moderator to approve all text, images and video content before it is displayed online. this safeguards your community against legal ramifications and provides you with high control over what content ends up online.
however, the drawback of pre-moderation is that it slows down the pacing of conversations in your community as comments are not posted in real time and remain in a pending state until they have been approved by a moderator. it is also a more expensive option than other ugc moderation methods.
it’s important to remember that the ugc generated by your customers is often highly personal and can be incredibly damaging when it’s misused or misinterpreted. that’s why it’s essential that you work with a company that has both trained professionals and artificial intelligence that can detect and quickly remove inappropriate content in real time.
2. post-moderation
when a brand uses user-generated content, it must ensure that all submissions are safe and comply with community guidelines. otherwise, the company may face legal ramifications and a damaged public image.
moderation can be done by human beings, automated software or a combination of the two. companies that conduct numerous campaigns and rely on online consumers must have a scalable moderation process in place.
reactive moderation relies on community members to flag content they deem inappropriate, which is usually accomplished via a reporting button that alerts the site’s moderators. this method offers quick scalability, but it can lead to a delay in removing offensive content from the website or community platform.
reactive moderation can also cause problems when a certain type of content is constantly reported, such as sexually explicit images or abusive language. this can overwhelm a moderator team and reduce the overall quality of the platform’s content. alternatively, an organization can use a real-time content analysis tool to prevent toxic content in the first place.
3. manual moderation
when companies rely on their customers to create content, they give up some control. but that relinquishing of power also carries some risk that the content may be inappropriate or offensive. that’s why many savvy brands prioritize having a scalable moderation process in place.
a well-trained moderator can quickly identify whether a piece of ugc is problematic or not. they can then flag it for review, or decide not to publish it altogether.
this allows brands to benefit from the engagement and trust that comes with user-generated content moderation, without allowing offensive or inappropriate content to harm their brand. in addition, it gives them the ability to uncover interesting customer insights, like how people are using their products or services. in short, ugc can be a powerful marketing tool if it’s done correctly. but without proper moderation, it can become a liability that alienates customers. learn more about how to use ugc effectively in your 2022 strategy by downloading our free checklist.
4. automated moderation
when you don’t have the resources to monitor ugc in real time, the best solution is automated moderation. this involves a system that scans comments and images for keywords or expressions that are prohibited, then filters out or flags content that contains those words.
this method is not without its drawbacks, however. it can be difficult to identify and remove specific kinds of images or text – and it may flag legitimate content. and it’s important to understand that even a well-designed system can be fooled by new tactics used by users to evade detection (for example, by reworking a banned expression or changing the context of a message).
the best way to mitigate risks and ensure that your ugc campaigns deliver on their promise is with a combination of live human moderation and intelligent automation. the right team will be able to identify the nuances in language, photos and videos that ai cannot. this can prevent toxic, fake or inappropriate content from being published and avoid costly lawsuits or brand damage.




posted on june 8, 2023choosing a phone holder for bike 

while it’s possible to carry your phone in a pocket, bag, backpack or pannier, a phone holder is the best option for cycling. it is durable, inexpensive and easy to use.
some mounts require you to attach a magnetic adapter to the back of your phone, while others have silicon corner bands that stretch around your device. both types are compatible with all phone sizes.
durability
many cyclists are turning to smartphone mounts to keep their phones in reach while riding. these mounts can be used to map routes, track fitness, listen to music, and more. but it’s important to choose the right bike phone mount for your needs. these mounts should be durable enough to withstand frequent use and abuse on the road. they should also be easy to use and secure.
bike phone holders are available for all sorts of different bike models. some of them require a case, while others are compatible with any phone. these mounts often feature a click-in mechanism to secure your device, and some even come with a slip-on cover that works like a poncho.
most bike phone holders are designed to be easy to install and remove without tools. they can be attached to the handlebar or stem using twisting knobs, elastic materials, or hex keys. some even give you the option to tighten them with a hex wrench, which makes them more difficult to steal.
easy to use
whether you’re commuting in busy traffic or riding off-road, a phone holder for bike can make all the difference. unlike keeping your phone in a bag or using an armband, a holder gives you full visibility of your screen while allowing you to stay focused on the road ahead.
a holder that snaps onto your bike’s stem or handlebar is easy to use and can be easily removed when you’re finished. the best options feature quick-release technology to prevent your phone from accidentally falling off during a crash or hard corner.
for the most secure option, look for a mount that uses a two-stage locking mechanism. this is a little more expensive than the types that simply click on to your device but will keep it safe from theft. for example, the quad lock stem/handlebar bike mount kit comes with a device-specific case that you can attach to your phone or a universal adapter that you can use with a cheap throwaway phone case.
convenience
the best bike phone holders are durable enough to withstand cycling conditions and secure enough to prevent your smartphone from falling off. they are also lightweight to help you stay comfortable while riding. they also allow you to view the screen without having it obscure your vision. some mounts have a design that allows you to rotate your device, which can be helpful if you are trying to use it during a race.
bike mounts can be as simple as plastic webbing that wraps around your phone, while others are designed to accommodate a wide range of phones and sizes. some are compatible with a specific case for added protection and security. others, like the quad lock stem/handlebar bike mount, have a mounting system integrated into a proprietary phone case for even more security.
choose a mount that is easy to install and remove, especially for those rides where you may need to leave your bike. many of these options include a quick release lever for fast removal when not in use. they also offer multiple adjustment options for optimal stability.
security
many cycling garments have pockets that can be used to store a phone, but accessing them requires taking your hands off the bike and looking down. a phone mount offers clear visibility that aligns with your field of vision and is safe to use while riding.
bike phone holders come in a variety of types and prices, but it’s important to consider how securely they hold your phone. some require special cases to secure the phone in place, which can make them more expensive. others, like the quad lock front mount pro bike cell phone holder, offer a patented locking system that’s one of the most secure in the market.
another option is the nite ize wraptor rotating smartphone bar mount, which can be secured to any handlebars and doesn’t require hardware or tools to install. it’s also easy to adjust for optimal positioning and can be easily removed for security purposes. it’s compatible with most 4.7-6.8 inch smartphones, but it can be difficult to see the screen with a bulky case.
