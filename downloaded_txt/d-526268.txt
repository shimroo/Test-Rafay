gmc classics motorhome club
















welcome to 
            the gmc 
            classics motorhome club









the gmc classics
        club is dedicated to the restoration and preservation of the
        1973 thru 1978 front wheel drive gmc motor coach. these timeless
        coaches are truly a delight to own, tinker with, and of course
        travel in.




speaking of traveling,
        our members travel from four states, oklahoma, arkansas, lousiana,
        and texas to four rallies a year. these rallies, hosted by volunteers,
        are a time for socializing, entertaining, sharing ideas, technical
        sessions, flea markets, crafts, fish fries, dancing, barbecues,
        costume parties, card games, dominoes, repairing coaches, showing
        off coaches, a little bragging about family and anything else
        fun to do!




the classics family
        is made up of wonderful folks from all walks of life brought
        together by one common interest, "gmc motorhomes".
        yes, i said "family", those streamline little coaches
        are our vehicles to life long bonds of friendship. we are truly
        a family.



if you own or want
    to own a 
    classic gmc motorhome
you've come to the right place!
