supporting grassroot communities
 

northern area community network operates as a membership-based organisation overseen by a voluntary board of directors elected from among member organisations. located in cushendall, it serves the catchment area spanning mid & east antrim, antrim & newtownabbey, and causeway coast & glens borough councils.we provide assistance, resources, and opportunities directly to local groups and organisations that operate at the community level. this support can take various forms, including:

1. capacity building: offering training, workshops, and skill-building sessions to empower community members with the knowledge and tools they need to address local issues and drive positive change.2. networking and collaboration: facilitating connections and partnerships between grassroots organisations, community leaders, and other stakeholders to foster collaboration and collective action.3. funding and grants: providing financial support through grants, funding opportunities, or resource allocation to enable grassroots initiatives and projects to thrive.4. advocacy and representation: amplifying the voices and concerns of grassroots communities by advocating for their needs and interests at higher levels of government, policy-making, and decision-making processes.5. access to resources: ensuring that grassroots organisations have access to essential resources, such as information, technology, infrastructure, and expertise, to effectively address community challenges and promote community development.6. mentorship and support: offering mentorship, guidance, and ongoing support to grassroots leaders and organisations as they navigate challenges, develop strategies, and implement solutions.
