what people are saying
just a few testimonials about us






"pool tech installed our therapy pool in 2011, which includes 4, 5 and 6-foot depths as well as jets for rehab. if we need something or have a question, we call and we get what we need. they’ve done a great job for us.”
paul fraise
pool maintenance technician, fort madison community hospital





"each backyard environment is unique. an architect looks at the relationship of the components to one another creating a better, more functional design. i prefer working with contractors who are very knowledgeable in their fields, like pool tech. i rely on their expertise of pool construction techniques and operations to provide guidance for the overall design.”
greg sundberg
architect





"building a pool was the best thing we ever did! we open it very early—it’s heated! we also have a fireplace, pergola, and barbecue pit. we spend more time outside than inside in the summer. many nights, we’ll have a drink by the fireplace and enjoy the poolside atmosphere.”
iowa city pool owner
