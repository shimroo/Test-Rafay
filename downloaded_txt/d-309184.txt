homer kizer ministries 















the church of philadelphia is commended for doing one thing and one thing only, [rev 3:10 because you have kept my word about patient endurance, i will keep you from the hour of trial that is coming on the whole world, to try those who dwell on the earth.] a new series begins on the endurance.

called to reread 



on thursday, january 17, 2002, about 10:12 cst, in an audible calling that temporarily left me too weak to walk, i was called to reread prophecy, with the evidence of this calling being similar to the evidence of paul’s calling: “you can perceive my insight into the mystery of christ, which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations” (eph 3:4–5) … you can perceive my insight into prophecy by those things i have written since thursday of that second full week in january 2002, the calling coming forty years to the hour and to the day from when garner ted armstrong, on behalf of his father, herbert w. armstrong, rejected additional biblical revelation. the work i now do is not a continuation of armstrong’s ministry, which brought to an end the last elijah’s [the glorified christ’s] second attempt to breathe life into the dead corpse of christendom … consider what the author of matthew’s gospel records jesus telling his disciples when they ask what will be the sign of jesus’ coming and of the end of the age. jesus tells his disciples, see to it that you deceive no one (matt 24:4), that many would come in his name and deceive many (v. 5), that they will hear of wars and rumors of war (v. 6), that nation would rise up against nation (v. 7), but that all of this would be “the beginning of the birth pains” (v. 8). matthew’s jesus continues: then they will deliver you up to tribulation [bad news] and put you to death [bad news], and you will be hated by all nations for my name’s sake [bad news]. and then many will fall away [bad news] and betray one another [bad news] and hate one another [bad news]. and many false prophets will arise [bad news] and lead many astray [bad news]. and because lawlessness will be increased [bad news], the love of many will grow cold [bad news]. but the one who endures to the end will be saved [good news]. and this good news [gospel] of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come. (matt 24:9–14) the endtime gospel that will be proclaimed throughout the world as a witness to all nations is the good news that all who endure to the end shall be saved. all will be saved because all will be baptized in spirit (joel 2:28; matt 3:11) when dominion over the single kingdom of this world is taken from the adversary and given to the son of man (cf. dan 7:9–14; rev 11:15–18; 12:7–12) halfway through the seven endtime years that consist of the 1260 days of the affliction, the doubled day 1260 of the kingdom, and the 1260 days of the endurance in jesus, with the affliction and the endurance forming non-symmetrical mirror images of one another, but with the adversary remaining as prince of the power of the air in the affliction and with christ jesus being the prince during the endurance. as there was a first adam, there was a second or last adam (1 cor 15:45; rom 5:14). as there was a first nation of israel, circumcised in the flesh, there will be a second nation of israel, circumcised of heart. and as there was a first passover liberation of israel under moses, there will be a second passover liberation of circumcised of heart israel from indwelling sin and death under the two witnesses who will be types of moses and aaron—and this second passover liberation of israel will be of such importance that the exodus from egypt will no longer be remembered (see jer 16:14–15; 23:7–8). the texts on this website advance the argument for a second passover liberation of israel.  no one test of whether my prophetic and scriptural understanding is of christ is possible until after satan comes as the antichrist 1260 days prior to christ’s return. but one test will certainly rule in or rule out my prophetic understanding: the occurrence or non-occurrence of a second passover slaughter of firstborns not covered by the blood of christ. the test is as simple as that, and every disciple holds the stakes of his or her bet concerning whether i am right or wrong. if a disciple refuses to cover the disciple’s and his or her household’s sins by taking the passover as jesus left us an example and as paul taught the saints as corinth, the disciple bets, knowingly or unknowingly, that i am wrong, that god wouldn’t again slay firstborns, that a third of humanity won’t be slain on a specific hour, day, month and year sometime in the future.
