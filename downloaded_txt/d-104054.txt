gallery is going into hibernation
submitted by bharat on fri, 2014-06-20 23:19


need gallery help? try the new community support forum: https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/gallery3/info
the gallery team has decided to take a step back from actively maintaining this project. truth be told, most of the core team got busy with their lives over the past few years and we haven't had the time to really actively maintain the project in a long time. the forums have continued to be lively and helpful and there is still plenty of good conversation there - but no new code has been written in the past 6 months and that's not likely to change.
so after over 14 years, 3 major revisions of the project, many tens of releases, hundreds of contributors, tens of thousands of lines of code, almost a hundred thousand forum topics and almost four hundred thousand comments, it's time for us to shutter up shop.
why not just leave the site up and operational? unfortunately - it takes time to actively maintain and police our site. the gallery website is constantly under attack by spammers and our servers require maintenance. we've been doing that for years, but it's time to call it quits.
so what's next? sometime soon we'll make the website read only. all the forum posts and topics will still be there, but we'll stop letting people log in and add new content. this will greatly prevent the spread of spam through the site while still allowing search engines to find useful content. then we'll put the whole site into a very low-overhead maintenance mode until we run out of money to keep it up. then we'll shut the site down.
while the site is hibernating, some systems will continue to work. you'll be able to download translations for gallery 3, for example. but at some point we'll stop accepting translation uploads. and when we run out of money, translations will go away. sorry about that.
it's been a great ride. i'm glad that you could join us with it. but now it's time to move on.
regards,
bharat
ps: if you're interested in taking over the project - email me and we can talk. you need to be serious about it though because i'm not handing this over to somebody who just wants to use it for seo purposes. my email address is easy to find. also, i won't be reading private messages.

gallery needs linux package maintainers
submitted by ckdake on wed, 2013-02-06 14:41


we need you! (or maybe someone you know.)  gallery 3 is not available in many major linux distributions via their package managers. we think it should be, but we don't have the time or know-how to make it happen. if you know a thing or two about linux package management and have been itching to contribute to gallery, now is your chance:

redhat/fedora/etc have access to gallery 3 via epel already. hoorah!
ubuntu seems to only have gallery 2: http://packages.ubuntu.com/quantal/gallery2
debian is missing gallery 3 due to some licensing things that we need help sorting out. see the bug and the discussion for details.
gentoo seems stuck on gallery 2: http://gentoo-portage.com/www-apps/gallery.
and of course the 1000s of other linux distributions out there...

if there is a way that you are not able to get gallery where you would like to, or if you can help out with any of the above, please let us know here or hop on the gallery-devl e-mail list and let's make it happen!
