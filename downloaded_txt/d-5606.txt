newest recipes:


buffalo chicken dip - layered, baked dip with buffalo 
                chicken, cream cheese, ranch dip, and cheese. serve with chips 
                and celery.


cheesy garlic bread like black anguss® 
                - i've used this recipe for ten years or so, and guests always 
                love it. it really adds class to any plate of pasta and sauce.


				chicken tortilla soup like max & erma's®
                - ive seen the other recipes out there in the web, but once i 
                tasted this soup in the restaurant, i knew what was in it and 
                knew those recipes were wrong! this is so much simpler and, i 
                guarantee, closer to the original taste.


chicken tikka masala - chicken marinated in yogurt and 
                spices and then served in a tomato cream sauce. serve with rice 
                and/or warm pita bread.

                chile con queso like carlos o'kelly's®
                - this dip is so smooth and mild with a delightful tex-mex 
                flavor that even the most tender-tongue will lick the bowl 
                clean!

                chicken marsala like carrabba's® - 
                sautéed chicken in a savory sauce of mushrooms, prosciutto, 
                shallots, garlic and marsala wine.

left-over rotisserie chicken roasted chicken broth - not 
                only is this an awesome way to use something that would 
                otherwise be considered waste, it makes the most tasty broth 
                you've every tasted, let alone made! goodbye canned broth!!!

lemon chicken scaloppini like t.g.i. fridays®
- creamy lemon and white wine sauce over sautéed chicken, 
                mushrooms, and artichokes served atop a bed of angel hair pasta, 
                and then sprinkled with pancetta and capers.

                sticky fingers like winger's® - 
                breaded chicken strips coated in a sweet and savory sauce like 
                wingers® original amazing sauce and baked 
                to create a sticky coating.


                tortilla soup like cracker barrel's® - 
                tex-mex soup loaded with cilantro, tomatoes, and cumin served 
                with chicken, tortilla strips, cheese, and avocado.
