how we worship



every sunday, our community unites in worship, rest, and fellowship. we celebrate with song, scripture, and prayer, embracing our shared faith and the assurance of forgiveness through christ. our service culminates in communion, open to all baptized believers, followed by a mission to live out our faith. additionally, we enjoy a weekly sunday potluck, reinforcing our values of family and feasting.

we believe god has blessed decades of faithfulness to him and his word, and now the second generation of members, who were once children in our aisles, are now stepping up and taking their place in the running and governing of the church. we would love for you to join us!
