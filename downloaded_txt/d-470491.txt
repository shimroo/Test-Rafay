rspa slo-pitch switches to nsa for 2025

it is with mixed emotions that i announce that rspa league and rspa tournaments are switching to nsa for 2025. 
    i have been with spn from the beginning, even before the beginning, but times change and we must change to move forward. 
    i am proud to bring rspa to nsa, to bring nsa to the gta and even to bring the gta to nsa. 
    there should be nothing bad said about either organization. 
    i admire both associations for what they have done to promote the game of slo-pitch. 
    we are working on what rules we will adopt, but rspa rules will be rspa rules. 
    with the merge of spn & spoa and the new harmonized rules, they are not so different. 
    i welcome all team reps, players and umpires to join me on this journey.
