the 
          drone cycle was a monthly series of ambient drone 
          concerts dreamstate performed in 2000 with a different special 
          guest each show. in 2024 dreamstate are releasing a 12-track 
          album with music selected from each show. a piece will be added each 
          month from the original recordings to celebrate the drone cycle's 
          2nd "chromatic anniversary". each track will have a unique 
          cover embroidered by fiber-artist lynn harrigan. you'll find all the 
          details on bandcamp 
          now. 
please 
          note that each monthly digital track will be free until the entire album 
          is complete in december 2024 and then the price will be $6 effective 
          january 2025.
there 
          will also be a cd release with all 12 tracks available in late december 
          2024. 
dreamstate 
          want you to join them on this journey in sound throughout 2024. the 
          original drone cycle was a significant period in their musical 
          growth, as they improvised each month with amazing special guests. come 
          along for the trip...

the drone cycle is also being released to 
          spotify,

the 
          ambient ping returns to handlebar 
          in toronto on monday august 19th, 2024 for its 25th anniversary show! 
          (doors at 8pm, 1st set 9pm - pwyc)

          featured are the first three artists who ever played the ping, way back 
          in 1999, and all are still active sonic performers: wally 
          jericho will bring his horn, ipad synths and live-looping 
          to open the show, then dreamstate 
          will weave an electronic sound tapestry with their special guest kurt 
          swinghammer, and finally, planet 
          of the loops leader andrew aldridge will 
          launch into a high orbit and then will be joined by the other artists 
          to create a canadian space station. 
all 
          of these artists are also dreamstate's special guests in the 
          drone cycle - recorded live at the ambient ping in 2000 and 
          being released throughout 2024. dreamstate's piece with andrew 
          will be released on august 22nd.
