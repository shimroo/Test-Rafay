september google adsense earnings & proof



i've become a little bit more serious with attemping to make money with google adsense. my traffic on this blog is very low and i've had so few adsense clicks that it's not even worth mentioning, but i do have another site up that earned me $17.92 in adsense in the last three weeks of september. so far, i'm at $3.14 for the month of october, and that's with my site being down oct.1-3 for maintainance.

here's a screenshot taken of my google adsense account for september. i had to blur out some of the information as it's against google's tos to post specifics about earnings. click on the image for a larger view. 



anyway, the site in mention is an experiment site - an idea that came to me in the middle of the night. so far, it seems to be working, and the amount of clicks i get is based on how much work i put into the site. as it stands right now, i've put about 30-45 minutes into researching & building the site. since this is just an experiment for now, i didn't bother registering a domain and am instead hosting the site for free at blogger.com.

more to come.

quick update



just a quick update to say that i still haven't found a legitimate way to make money online. everything that i've tried has failed, miserably. i'm currently on a year-long vacation in south africa, so i haven't really been too motivated lately. if i ever do find a way to make money online, i'll be sure to let you know!

roulette systems



i've come across so may roulette systems in the past few weeks - each claiming that by using that particular system, i would win more often than i would lose. i've since found out that that isn't true. technically, you could keep betting on red, for example, and keep doubling your bet each time you lose, but you would either reach the table betting limit, or lose your bankroll. this method did work for me for a little while, until i got a run of reds for sixteen spins. i gave up on betting red/black after that. you could spin without betting until you saw ten reds in a row, and then bet on black, but you'd be waiting around for quite a while and might only make a few dollars. that still wouldn't guarantee a win, though, as your chance of getting a black on the 11th spin would still be 50%. here's how the red/black system is supposed to work:- spin the wheel without betting until you get one color (red, for example) for 10 spins.- bet $1 on black.- if the ball lands on black, you get $2 back, which is a win of $1.- if the ball lands on red again, double your bet to $2 to cover your previous loss. if the ball lands on black, you get $4 back, a win of $1.- if the ball lands on red again, double your previous bet of $2 to $4. if the ball lands on black this time, you get $8 back, which is a win of $1 since the rest is used to cover the previous losses.- you keep doubling your bet until the ball falls on black, and then you start all over again by watching for a run of the same color for 10 spins. you would then bet on the opposite color.chart:spin#-----bet-----profit11----------$1------$112----------$2------$113----------$4------$114----------$8------$115----------$16-----$116----------$32-----$117----------$64-----$1most tables have a limit of $100 per bet, so if you were using the above chart, you would need a black to show on the 18th spin to avoid losing your money. you would also need to start with a bankroll of around $150 to cover previous losses if you were to get a long run of one color. even by using a betting system such as the one above, you could and probably would lose as the longest run of reds ever observed was 24 in a row. you could start betting after 20 spins to minimize losses, but the chance of getting 20 in a row of one color is pretty slim and you would probably end up waiting for hours to see it happen only to win a small amount.

roulette killer scam?



i've been reading up on online roulette strategies and came across a piece of software the other day that claims you will walk away with profits regularly. it's called roulette killer and currently goes for $49.95 usd. you can view the sales page here. as with everything i find online, i always do a search to see what other people think of the product. i came across numerous forum posts that claimed roulette killer is worthless and will make you lose. every so often i did come across someone who claimed to be making thousands of dollars with it every month. being the skeptic that i am, i wasn't willing to pay $49.95 for something that i wasn't fairly certain would work. the site offers a 100% money-back guarantee, but from what i read on the forums, the owner of the product could not be reached to grant the refund and emails were ignored. i ended up finding a free copy on the internet and testing it at casino-on-net in the practice play mode. i started off with $584 of play money and after about an hour was down to $572. i did win a bit , but i always lost a bit as well and can't really see how anyone could make thousands of dollars with roulette killer. i will probably do some more testing, but for now i don't recommend the software.

online roulette



the program i was referring to in my last two entries is the roulette game at online casinos. i still believe you can make money with this, but you have to go really slow and only bet after a certain color or column doesn't show up for many spins. you basically spin the wheel without betting until you see a certain number of reds show up in a row. after getting a number of reds in a row, you would bet on black as the chance of black appearing would be greater now. you'd bet $2 for example, and keep doubling that until black appears. by doubling your bet you win back everything you have lost when the black finally appears. you do the same thing with column betting. there are three columns - low, medium and high, and you would only place a bet after a certain column did not show up for 9 spins.  of course there is still a chance that you could spin 20 times and you would not see a certain column, but that chance is quite low. it has only happened to me once. as for colors, i have not seen a run of more than 9 reds in a row.  it could definitely happen, but again, that chance is small.here are two free e-books that explain the system in detail:http://www.easyfreeincome.comhttp://www.easycasinoprofits.com

too good to be true



i came across a flaw in the program. after a few days of using it, it didn't work like the author of the free ebook promised. yes, i made some money, but i eventually ended up losing what i had made. i still believe you can make money with this program, but it would take hours to make a few bucks. by going really slow you decrease your chances of losing by almost 100%, but at the same time who wants to make $2 an hour? you can make more with the advanced version of the program, but it would take forever to get there. anyway, i'm putting this one on hold for now.

i guess it's true when they say that when something seems too good to be true, it most likely is.

on to other things. i'm thinking about purchasing the silent sales machine, an ebook that tells you how you can make money on ebay. i'm still determined to work from home, even though so far i've only encountered failure. i'm not giving up.

easy money?



after two days of testing out the new program, i'm still a bit skeptical. i guess i just can't believe how easy this is. i'm only making an average of about $15 per hour with the beginner program, but that's still better than what i was making when i was working as a receptionist. plus i get to work from home and set my own hours! once i move up to the advanced stage i'll be making about $50+ per hour.  but that won't be for another week or two. even though i can do this whenever i want, i think i'd like to set some regular hours. i was thinking maybe 8am-12pm monday-friday. it boggles my mind that something like this exists. i'm waiting to find a flaw, but so far haven't found a single one.

new money making idea



wow.. just wow. i stumbled upon something that could easily make me money. this won't make me filthy rich, but it's enough for me not to have to work a real job. hopefully. i'll talk about this program in a bit, but i first want to show you what my financial situation is like. for the past few months i've been surviving on $800-1000 per month and working 25 hours per week. this is what my monthly bills have looked like lately:rent and food: $300cellphone: $100 (this is for two phones. i pay for my brothers phone as well and in exchange i get access to a car whenever i want.)credit cards: $200misc: $100as you can see, i only had about $100-300 left over each month. since steve and i are moving to south africa, i had to quit my job. i have zero income right now and won't be able to work the entire year that we're going to be in south africa. my rent bill is erased as our food and rent will be paid by his company. i got rid of my cellphone the other day and also managed to lower my minimum monthly payments on my credit card by transfering it over to my line of credit where i'm only going to have to pay interest every month. my interest is something like 8% per year, so my payments are only going to be $25. the only other periodic bills i have are domain hosting and domain name renewal, but that's only about $24 every six months. not bad at all. plus, i have some money saved up, so that will definitely get me through the next year.anyway, about the program. earlier tonight i randomly stumbled upon a website. i'm constantly stumbling upon websites as my search for a home based money making system is endless. the site had impressive graphics, an interesting presentation, nice layout, etc. i viewed the entire presentation twice and tested the methods they talked about and wow. the methods actually worked! i was and still am amazed by this! i did a little test run of the the program and made about $25 in thirty minutes! like i said, it won't make you rich, by how else can you make $25 in half an hour by sitting on your couch and simply clicking? no, it's not a "get paid to click" program. it's a lot more fun than that! and it's proven to work!i must be dreaming. i'm overwhelmed by how easy this is. i will look into this quite a bit more when i wake up and if it indeed works as well as it appears to so far, i will let everyone in on this "program."

clicks and impressions



only 21 impressions for my one ad, and one click. i paused my other campaign because i think i may have messed up the link. the impressions and clicks i was getting weren't being mirrored on the site i was promoting. i may have to build a landing page for that one. still contemplating the cash123 system.too tired to fiddle around with internet stuff right now. i fell asleep at 6:45am and was awake by 10am.
