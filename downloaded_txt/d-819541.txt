dmu images wanted!
do you have photos of first generation dmus? the more images we have the better we can tell the dmu story and make it more useful to visitors. images can be loaded directly onto the site - just register as a user and upload! alternatively if you have images on flickr or another website i can do the uploads for you - just let me know.

scope
this website contains details about the first generation dmus. this includes the 4-wheel diesel railbuses, acv / but railcars, the battery multiple unit (bmu) and blue pullmans. it covers the period from their introduction to british railways in the 1950s till their withdrawal and disposal from main-line use, but not preservation.
because of the vast amount of data that this covers and the amount of information i have still to process i cannot include the demus introduced on the southern region in the same era, nor second generation or later types.
