in 1920, a century ago, top flight, then known as atlas paper box, began operations in chattanooga, tn. originally a supplier of paper boxes to the local hosiery mills, the company expanded its manufacturing capability to include tablets of paper, paper caps for milk bottles.
fast forward several decades the product offering was broadened further with the purchase of top flight paper out of nashville. the result is today’s top flight. we celebrate our 100th anniversary of serving customers with innovative products and a commitment to inspiring people to preserve, communicate, and organize their world.
