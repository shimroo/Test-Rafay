john roberts takes pride in being a consistent top producer and full time real estate salesperson throughout his career selling properties in his native ottawa and surrounding areas.  at a young age, john already had experience running his own business during high school and college before moving on to commission sales in a competitive home based ottawa industry before being drawn to the real estate industry.   with the exciting changes, challenges and new technologies,  john has embraced, invested and eagerly adapted to benefit his clients and customers first when it comes to selling.  he was one of the first ottawa real estate sales people to hire a personal assistant and launch his own website to promote his properties give more details and photos to the consumer.   do you remember remax tv on rogers cable?  john saw an opportunity to get the most exposure possible for his properties and it paid off.  john is forever exploring new ways to be a leader in his field and in technology.   this is one of the many reasons john works at remax to get cutting edge tools to sell his properties and why john works for the number 1 real estate franchise in the world and in canada.
