                mission statement
      
transfer and reentry center (trc) assists all transfer students (junior college or community college to uc davis, uc to uc davis, out of state to uc davis) and reentry students (25+ years old, student parents or caregivers). at the trc we address the needs and concerns of the whole student. whether your questions focus on academics, adjusting to uc davis, or finding a referral to address specific issues and concerns, make the trc your first stop and consider it your home while at uc davis.
