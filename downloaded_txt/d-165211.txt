according to the us department of labors bureau of labor statistics, in october of 2003, 77 million people in the united states 
used a computer at work. almost six years later, we dont have to tell you how many more employers rely on their workers to be 
computer and internet savvy. what better way to study, practice, learn and apply your education than with computer-based online

for corporations
in these tough times, staying ahead of the competition is crucial. business strategies and operating plans are designed to 
give companies a competitive edge and increase profitability, while meeting complex compliance and certification requirements. 
once those strategies are implemented, its up to individual employees to execute them. but what happens if the strategies are 
not well communicated throughout the organization? what if employees lack essential skills to accomplish their work? what if 
cultural barriers stand in the way of progress?
keeping your staffs skill set and knowledge up-to-date is vital to the strength and success of your company. partnering with 
cbt direct will allow you to provide the employee training you need on tightened budgets, without interrupting their daily work 
production.
for individuals
competition is fiercer than it ever has been, with the unemployment rate at record high, corporate companies going bankrupt, 
employees desperately trying to keep their jobs, limited new jobs available and millions of potential employees searching and 
competing online for the same jobs as you. regardless of your occupation or background, todays employment market is a 
war for talent, and its difficult to stand out in the crowd. what can you do to not only get noticed, but be in high demand? 
what can you do to ensure your job is safe?
upgrading your skill sets, improving your professionalism and gaining in-demand certifications through cbt directs online 
courses will help the success and longevity of your own career.
