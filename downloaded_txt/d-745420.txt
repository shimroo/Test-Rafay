benefits of membership

                        the western front association was formed in 1980 with the purpose of furthering interest in the history of the first world war of 1914-1918. we also aim to perpetuate the memory, courage and comradeship of all those who served, on all sides, across all theatres and fronts, on land, at sea and in the air and at home, during the great war. the western front association is non-political and does not seek to glorify war.

for a modest annual subscription, our members receive a wide range of benefits including our regular, high-quality publications stand to! and bulletin six times a year, access to the stand to! archive, gun fire archive, military factsheets and pension records database. in particular, belonging to the western front association provides you with the opportunity of meeting like-minded people to learn, share, explore and exchange information and knowledge of the first world war in a friendly and welcoming atmosphere.
