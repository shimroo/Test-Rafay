the glengarry bhoys
described as bold, unorthodox, vibrant, and evocative, the "glengarry bhoys"
 hybrid of canadian highland scots and french canadian musical idioms has evolved
into a sound that is weighty, authoritative, and extremely entertaining.
their energy and good humor, as much a part of the show as their musicianship, crosses all
cultures and ages. many things have been written and reported about this world renown
canadian alt-celt group over that last decade, all depicting their musical and entertaining
prowess with varied audiences the world over, but their ability to marshal large enthusiastic

audiences show after show is legion and recognized.
their objective is simple yet evocative, as stated by their lead singer graham wright in a
cbc "fresh air" interview: "if our audience can only get 10% of the satisfaction
we get entertaining them - then we surpass objective". accordingly and repeatedly, they do!!
from a small scots-french-canadian enclave in eastern ontario, these celtic-stompers,
always pushing the musical envelope but never straying too far from the traditional whence
they came, have earned a reputation as entertainers that challenge you to sit still during their
engaging performances.
go ahead and try!
