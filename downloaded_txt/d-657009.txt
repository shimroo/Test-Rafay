       devries designswhere modern technology meets classic design principles.














tony dear wrote a fantastic article about mike in the links 2020 summer issue.“unless you’re in his home state or halfway around the world, you’ve probably never seen a devries design. the 56-year-old michigander’s best work (so far) is at private clubs that don’t seek publicity. but his last major project—cape wickham, which opened five years ago on the shores of king island, australia—is the 21st best course on the planet (and rising) according to golf digest. were it in the u.s. or uk, his name would be cropping up in the same conversations as bill coore and ben crenshaw, tom doak, and gil hanse.it should be. devries is that good.”thanks, tony!read the rest of the article here
