​wdi, inc. wdi was founded in 2009 by robert johnson to address the unmet need for developing leaders, supervisors, staff and volunteer boards. good and pretty good are no-longer good enough. wdi is committed to developing “difference makers”. “to get what we’ve never had, we must do what we’ve never done.” defining clear goals, developing principle centered skills and establishing habits of accountability are some of the things that separate wdi from other types of consultative/training organizations.
