training coursesour company mission is to set a recognised standard in plc training to ensure companies know their engineers are working safely and efficiently.  the majority of shop-floors in today's industries use plcs and itâs now becoming a requirement for any engineer that works on the shop-floor to have experience in working with, maintaining and troubleshooting the plc, however, weâve noticed that the standard of training that has been provided over the years from companies and individuals has been catered around simply understanding what a plc is and how to program one but not how to work with a plc, safely and efficiently, this has resulted in large increases in downtime as well as accidents on the shop-floor which could have been prevented from correct training, which is why we have been working closely with city & guilds and eal to develop our unique training. learn moreelcas approved plc trainingwe are an approved learning provider for the ministry of defence enhanced
