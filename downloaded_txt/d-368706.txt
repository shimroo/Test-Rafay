what our clients are saying  



"extremely professional, knowledgeable and caring.   there is no other choice when listing, buying or selling here at the port"
 

    
~ r rondini



"with the only office here at poi, and a very warm, welcoming, high visibility one at that, listing with these fine folks is the smartest move when selling here.    have also had great success when shopping and purchasing with port of the islands realty.   a committed and very pro team.   thanks for being here and all you do for the community (and those delicious muffins!!)!   it only makes sense to support our local neighbors like these folks, particularly when they do an outstanding job and support us... a 'no brainer'."
 

    
~ j farina



"l'endroit très agréable et accueillant. vraiment sympa."

translated:  "a very nice and welcoming place. really nice."
 

    
~ witold jasion



"what a terrific and capable team at poi realty!   every document was perfectly executed and delivered immediately with complete and thoughtful follow up.   we wish half the brokerages we deal with nationwide were half as good!   keep up the great work and thank you for your business!"
 

    
~ north american title and servicing



"honest, loyal to our community."
 

    
~ j. brownlee



"very efficient in scheduling showings of the best properties suited to us!    thank you for the time spent and all of the knowledge you shared about naples and port of the islands- extremely professional!"
 

    
~ mike murphy



"dwyn did an amazing job narrowing down our requirements and allowing to focus our search on our perfect neighborhood.  she was very patient and nimble as we were new to the area and weren't quite sure what kind of home we wanted. we never felt rushed and she was so helpful throughout the process.  i'd recommended dwyn wholeheartedly! thank you dwyn - we love our new home!"
 

    
~ lely buyer



"dwyn made the process simple, fast, and worry free for our family to sell this home. she handled everything while we were out of the state. thanks dwyn!"
 

    
~ b. ayers



"selling or buying a home is an important and potentially stressful event in anyone's life.it is a journey into the unknown. one asks the questions, "how long will the process take?", "how should i get ready to sell or purchase a home?", "what is a fair price?", and many more questions.
dwyn dion is  a calm, resourceful, courteous person who is physically present at the client's side for every step of the selling-buying process. she patiently explains every page of a contract and makes the client immediately aware of any and all new developments.
trulia needs dwyn dion to make this company an even greater success. and even more, trulia needs agents who will cause clients to return to trulia and recommend trulia to their friends and relatives.
selling my home with the help of dywn was a wonderful process. i wish she would relocate to her native maine in order to help me with the next sell and move."
 

    
~ k. balakier



"we have bought 2 homes and sold one through dwyn. if not for her persistence on our first which was a short sale. it would not have happened. a lot of agents would have walked. she stuck with it and got it done. the second deal was a fannie mae property that was time sensitive. she got it done  quickly. we listed our condo , she had it sold in one week. it was the top priced condo sold in our development at that time. don,t look around for an agent . just get her!"
