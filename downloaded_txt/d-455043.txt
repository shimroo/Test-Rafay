more about us














“our home buying journey was incredibly fast- taking only two months from pre-qualification to closing. we were able to keep track of all the moving parts and make big decisions with confidence thanks to tyler’s industry knowledge and transparent communication style. when you work with him, it will be evident that his goal is not just to get you into a home, but the right home for you.”

“we can’t say enough about tami and the sherwood team. they are absolutely amazing!! within days of signing on with sherwood, tami presented us with our first offer to purchase and within months we closed on two building lots – lots that had been listed for several years prior with little exposure or interest.”
