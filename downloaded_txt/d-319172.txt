“i am so very proud of your csr's because each of them has successfully made me feel that my concerns and problems were given the highest priority and within a very short time period, they were asking if there was something else they could help me with!   all of my needs have been met and it is a great feeling that the person identified with my problem and knew how to solve the problem.  keep up the good work and meeting the customer needs.  you will always have my business."  
mrs. ruth brown, retired teacher 2018
