even since the beginning the collaboration with glas expert was fruitful because it was based on a very good communication with all the departments: sales, production ard installing. glas expert supported this project by offering the proper tecbnical solutions, the productive discussions with our architect and by transforming these ideas into reality. glas expert was very helpful for the successful ending ofthe whole project.erwin vondenhofceo - heidi chocolate swiss
a glass provider knows what to ask an architect when he has a project and weighs his answers to be economically efficient. an expert, however, knows how to find, together with the architect, the optimal, technologically reliable solutions and as close as possible to the architect’s vision. for me the expert in glass is glas expert.matius ichimarhitect partner - matius studio - creator de succes
