welcome to the washington province of the immaculate heart of marysecular order of discalced carmelites!

the role of the main office is to be of service to the secular carmelites in the 138 communities throughout the province. we strive to answer questions and provide accurate information to the best of our ability in a congenial atmosphere. while we recognize that the local council holds the authority in each community, we hope to foster unity of vision and practice in the four regions. our primary concern is that our teresian carmelite charism is lived out as authentically as possible throughout the province.
