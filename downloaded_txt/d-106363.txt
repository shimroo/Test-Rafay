personal info

 
    a fall through a glass-top table several years ago put an end to jo's musical direction
    and piano accompaniments. her creative energies are now focused on her writing. ms.
    davidsmeyer's family background: she is the youngest child
    of jean and howard davidsmeyer of sarasota, florida. among her ancestors are an indentured
    servant, a preacher who was one of the original members of the mormon church, benjamin
    rush (a signer of the declaration of independence), and a few scoundrels that no one
    mentions at family reunions. two generations ago, three sisters (including my grandmother)
    married three brothers (including my grandfather) and the family has never been the same.
    dad said that as a child he kept going to family weddings where he didn't gain any new
    relatives! 
jo davidsmeyer  volunteers her
    time to peo (a women's educational organization), to area non-profit theaters, and to her
    church (church of the nativity). she has
    also organized two "combat!" reunions
    as fund raisers for charity.
