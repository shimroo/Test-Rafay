before you donate 



you must be at least 16 years old in most states. donors aged 16-17 may need parental consent depending on the state. you must weigh at least 110 pounds.you must be in good health and feeling well on the day of donation. 










check eligibility























during your donation 



for blood donors, you’ll be comfortably seated or lying down while a healthcare professional cleans the area and inserts a needle to collect blood into a sterile bag. the entire procedure typically takes just a few minutes, and you’ll be encouraged to relax and enjoy a light snack and drink afterwards. 










find a blood organisation























after your donation 



for blood donors, you may experience slight fatigue or a feeling of lightheadedness, but this is usually temporary. rest for a few minutes, drink plenty of fluids, such as water or juice, to help replenish the fluids you’ve lost during the donation. continue drinking extra fluids for the next 24 hours.

every donation has the potential to save up to three lives. here’s why your contribution is so important.
why your blood donation matters: the power of giving
















																	who benefits 
blood donation plays a crucial role in saving lives and supporting vital medical treatments. hospitals and clinics rely on donated blood to treat patients undergoing surgeries, cancer treatments, trauma care, and those with chronic conditions like anemia. every unit of blood you donate can help multiple individuals. 













																	types of blood donations															
there are several types of blood donations, each serving different medical needs: whole blood donation, platelet donation, plasma donation, double red cell donation. each type of donation plays a vital role in helping different groups of patients, ensuring that those in need receive the specific components of blood required for their treatment.













																	blood facts & statistics															
one blood donation can save up to three lives. every two seconds, someone in the u.s. needs blood. o-negative is the universal donor, and ab-positive is the universal plasma donor. red blood cells last only 42 days; platelets just 5 days, making regular donations crucial. less than 10% of eligible donors give blood annually, though 38% of the population is eligible.



















organizing a blood drive is a rewarding way to support your community. we’ll guide you every step of the way.

frequently asked questionsall you need to know about blood donation










												eligibility													






									you must be at least 16 years old in most states. donors aged 16-17 may need parental consent depending on the state. you must weigh at least 110 pounds.you must be in good health and feeling well on the day of donation.								




												the donation process													






the blood donation process is simple and straightforward 
registration: upon arrival, donors complete a registration form that includes personal information and health history.
health screening:  a brief health screening follows, where staff check vital signs, hemoglobin levels, and discuss any potential health concerns to ensure eligibility.
donation: once cleared, donors are seated comfortably, and a sterile needle is inserted into a vein, typically in the arm. 
post-donation care:  after donating, donors are encouraged to rest for a few minutes and enjoy refreshments to help replenish their energy. staff will monitor for any immediate reactions.
recovery:  donors are advised to drink plenty of fluids and avoid strenuous activities for the rest of the day.								




												after donation													






									after donating blood, it's important to follow some guidelines to ensure a smooth recovery and maintain your health. here's what you should know and do after your donation:
1. rest and hydrate:
take a few minutes to rest and recover at the donation site. most centers will provide a designated area with snacks and drinks.

 drink plenty of fluids, such as water or juice, to help replenish the fluids you’ve lost during the donation. continue drinking extra fluids for the next 24 hours.
2. eat well:
enjoy the snack provided at the donation center to help stabilize your blood sugar levels. eating something light and healthy will help you regain your strength.

eat regular, balanced meals throughout the day, including foods rich in iron (like red meat, beans, spinach) to help replenish your blood cells.
3. monitor your body:
refrain from heavy lifting, vigorous exercise, or standing for long periods for the rest of the day. this helps prevent dizziness or fainting.

keep the bandage on your arm for a few hours and avoid using that arm for heavy activities. if you notice any bleeding, apply pressure and raise your arm.

it's normal to feel a little tired or lightheaded. if you experience dizziness, lie down with your feet elevated until the feeling passes. if you notice any unusual symptoms, such as prolonged dizziness, shortness of breath, or pain at the needle site, contact the donation center or seek medical advice.
4. plan your next donation:
you can donate whole blood again after 56 days, or more frequently if you're donating other blood components like platelets or plasma.

sign up for reminders or schedule your next donation appointment. regular donations are valuable and can help save lives.

consider becoming a regular donor.
