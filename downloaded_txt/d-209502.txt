welcome to the 20th year of first 5 california
							


first 5 california was created by voters under proposition 10 to recognize that
								children's health and education are a top priority, especially in the early years of
								development.
research shows that critical brain growth and other developmental milestones take place
								during the earliest years of a child's life. making those years count is what first 5
								california is all about. our focus is to educate parents and caregivers about the
								important role they play in their children's first years.
our public health campaign, âtalk.read.sing. has educated millions of people on the power
								of words, music, and books on early brain development. the science has confirmed what
								our hearts have always known, interacting with our babies from the day they are born
								sets them on a path for success in the future.
since 1998, we have invested millions of dollars to design comprehensive programs that
								address the needs of children ages 0 to 5 and their families. currently, our programs
								are centered around the child, parent, and teacher to improve early childhood outcomes
								in the areas of health and nutrition, early literacy and language development, quality
								child care, and smoking cessation.
we work with our first 5 counties and other statewide partners to make sure our programs
								are reaching the children and families that need it most to ensure they enter school
								healthy and ready to learn.
our promise is to continue to invest in services and programs that
								directly benefit children and families, and to advocate for a sustainable early
								education system for future generations.
