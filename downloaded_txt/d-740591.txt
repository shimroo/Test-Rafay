            how much does treatment cost?
          










treatment costs depend on the type of treatment and length of stay. the state covers some people, others have private insurance - no matter what your situation, we can help you understand your options for paying for treatment - just get in touch with one of our team members.








            how can i pay for treatment?
          










we accept many different types of insurance (verify your insurance here), you can also get help from the state (get in touch with us to learn how), or pay out of pocket. 








            how can i start treatment?
          










call 1-800-227-4190 to speak with our admission/ business office staff, and they will walk you through the process. the staff will ask questions related to your needs, assist you with contacting your insurance company for benefit coverage and eligibility, and determine if an assessment is needed prior to admission.








            how long are treatment programs?
          










the length of treatment depends on the treatment type. for outpatient services, that could be anywhere from one month to one year. for inpatient, our typical program runs 8 weeks. however, it also depends on the individualâ€™s personalized treatment plan and funding.








            do you offer detox programs?
          










yes, we offer detox. learn more about it and our other programs here.

starting the year off right: forgiving yourself through mindfulness



dec 29, 2022




the new year is a time for taking a step back to ask yourself how things went. what our minds usually like to do is focus on the negative aspects. i didn't do x. i should have done y. it's easy to get caught up in regret. however, it's not healthy. we must be kind and forgive ourselves. and one of the best ways to reflect positively is through the practice of mindfulness.Â but how can you use mindfulness to be more healthy, self-aware, and successful this year.here, we cover these topics and give you tools to tackle the new year head-on.
