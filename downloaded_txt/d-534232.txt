traditional braces we offer traditional fixed metal and clear braces to straighten teeth and correct bite problems in even the most complex orthodontic cases.

 
invisalign®
maple orthodontics is an invisalign® diamond provider helping patients straighten their teeth with clear aligners.

  "dr maple's office is the most amazing orthodontic experience i've ever had. i received treatment somewhere else as a child, so i never thought an ortho office could be so much fun!  not only is the staff knowledgeable and extremely capable, but they also go the extra mile to make sure everyone feels welcome."
