patient testimonials



gdatf has changed my life for the better! 











"the graves disease & thyroid foundation zoom forums have been helpful on my journey to educate myself about my graves diagnosis. it is useful to connect with others who are going through similar medical problems as myself. connecting with others has helped bring me out of my isolation & motivated me to seek the medical care i need. this can be a very challenging health issue & finding the proper care & support has not been a straightforward path. connection with other people on this forum has really been a positive experience. staff at the gdatf are wonderful, supportive, & welcoming when you reach out to them.
