women on the net



 welcome back to women's travel!the past two years of travel have been crazy and challenging to say the least! the good news is we resumed domestic travel in 2021 and have successfully rescheduled our 2020 and 2021 international trips to this year!

to kick things off, in october 2021, we safely traveled to our annual trip to women’s week in provincetown! and what a trip it was! a record-breaking 52 fun-loving women from all over the u.s. and canada joined us! because of the number of guests, we took over an additional inn across the street to accommodate everyone! we are returning this year, and once again, taking over both inns! and due to the popularity of this trip, we are already 50% full with returning guests!

at this time, we are also clear to travel this year to the international destinations that were rescheduled from 2020 and 2021!
2022, we’re counting on you! let’s go...
everywhere!
