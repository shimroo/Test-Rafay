our sales specialist is hands down one of the best in the business. his attention to detail and his overall industry knowledge is second to none. i am fortunate to not only call him my anchor rep but also a genuine friend.

david t

























with our hardest summer now over, i wanted to take a moment to thank you for your partnership and friendship. working with you is a pleasure, and the tents you supplied us with are of the best quality. they also kept us safe and healthy this summer!

we know we can depend on anchor to help us resolve matters quickly and fairly. this year has been challenging but it is good to know you have anchor on your side.

lee h.

























without a doubt, this was one of the most challenging years we have faced. from supply chain problems to personnel issues, the number of variables we had to deal with was incredible. but one of the things we could rely on was ryan. when we needed his assistance, he was there. we have had our fair share of anchor field reps, but ryan is proving to be one of the best to work with our account.

history of anchor














anchor industries, founded in 1892, began as a small riverboat supply house located on the ohio river. anchor supply company, as it was known then, furnished oil, groceries, paint, and other supplies to the steamboat trade. due to a growing demand for water-proof covers, anchor’s founder, louis a. daus, added canvas goods to the line of merchandise. today, with 300+ skilled workers and over 362,000 square feet of production capacity in evansville, indiana, anchor is one of the world’s most respected producers of the event, party, and wedding tents, awnings, and outdoor fabric shade solutions, fabric buildings, and structures, safety pool covers, fire shelters, military products, and other custom fabric and frame products.
