what the industry is saying

i am very much enjoying the cma courses!  i wish i knew of your school several months ago, but i am so grateful i came across it because it is exactly what i was looking for.  i will share this course with other loan officers and aspiring to be loan officers, it is so important and gives the education that is needed to do this business.
amy f.
“fairly new, i took the class to gain an overview as a processor. six weeks later, my loan officer was hospitalized and i needed to cover both jobs. i could not have done it without the knowledge gained from this class. eighty-five percent of the questions asked by borrowers i could answer, and if not, i knew where to go for the information. thanks, dave “
