security tags are available in both new and used quantities depending 
              on the style type and manufacturer. retail security hard tags are 
              considered to be more reliable than loss prevention labels or stickers. 
              detection systems for sensormatic tag systems and checkpoint systems 
              are only available in refurbished models. tag removers for ink pins 
              are only available to retailers. security-tags.com is retail security 
              ethics compliant. anti shoplifting deactivator pads are refurbished 
              unless noted in the description. knogo security tags are used, and 
              they are sold with new security pins. call us at 888-909-8247 with questions or orders.
