about other music other music was an independent record shop in new york city, founded by chris vanderloo, josh madell and jeff gibson. launched in 1995, for more than two decades the store was a key part of the global indie music ecosystem, championing a broad selection of essential sounds both new and old, across genres and geography. they also ran one of the first independent digital download sites and had a popular weekly new release newsletter (“the other music update”) and mail-order website, a record label,  and a beloved in-store performance and video series. other music closed in 2016.


























other music documentarywhen other music announced that they would be closing their doors after more than 20 years in nyc, the outpouring of love emotion from customers, industry and artists was truly overwhelming. what could have been just another statistic in a changing retail landscape became a months-long celebration of music, urban culture, and the sort of in-person cultural spaces that are harder and harder to find in our modern digital world. the filmmakers puloma basu and rob hatch-miller showed up with their cameras and stayed through the closing concerts, parades and parties that marked the end of an era, and dug into the other music archives to help tell this story of music and community, including many live performances from iconic indie artists through the years.
