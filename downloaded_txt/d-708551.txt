 st luke and 
        three proto icons

icon tradition comes from the early church,â 
        when the christianity was an undivided unity.â 
        the church tradition st luke was the first icon painter,â 
        who painted three proto images
        of mary and jesus while 
        they were alive. later these three motifs were followed by
        images of saint , when the christianity spread into the wider world. 
        all icons on these pages are based on this tradition, 
        where strict rules apply. these also apply to creating
        icons of new and old saintsâ never pictured in icon style before.
