tpc twin cities

blaine, minnesota

great clubhouse, huge pro shop, nice range, and a heck of a course. they have a lot of very enjoyable holes that are gorgeous to look at, and a real challenge to play.



- ienjoygolfing75, local golf advisor








gold course at golden horseshoe golf club

williamsburg, virginia

be sure and take a moment when you reach the 14th tee and walk all the way to the back of it. from there, take in one of the best view of an inland confluence of holes that i can recall in my travels. you can see the 16th, 12th, 2nd and 7th greens. it is fantastic.



- brandonwebb, local golf advisor








ravisloe country club

homewood, illinois

enjoyed the layout & design of each hole. well maintained course made for a fun afternoon. we are looking forward to going back to play again soon!



susanviti








the fort golf resort

indianapolis, indiana

one of the best courses in the indianapolis area. a very hard course that has a lot of risk reward situations.



logdog317








caledonia golf & fish club

pawleys island, south carolina

 throughout the course, you will see colorful trees and landscaping, especially on holes 1,9, 10 & 18. some of the best ambiance i've ever experienced on a course.

the ocean south at pelican hill golf club

newport coast, california

this course never ceases to amaze me. from the time you walk onto the property till the time you leave you feel like a king! everything is in perfect condition and the course is extremely fun especially in playing on the south side. 



- mikehoskins1








wolfdancer golf club

lost pines, texas

just a beautiful course and always a pleasure to play. was in the best shape i have seen it and incredibly lush and pure fairways. not overly crowded and just a beauty set in the hills.



- gespos01








the links/quarry at bay harbor golf club

bay harbor, michigan

it doesn't get much better. this is a gorgeous course with an impressive layout. it was in superb condition, and only arcadia bluffs can compete with the views.
