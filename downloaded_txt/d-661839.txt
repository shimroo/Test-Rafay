communities we serve
on july 30, 2023 transcore employees joined approximately 100 volunteers from across the tolling industry to participate in a day of service at the community farm at mill ridge. the group completed numerous projects aimed at benefiting people of need in the nashville area by increasing urban farm production for the nashville food project. the group built water catchment stations, painted new water storage tanks, built a machine shed, added to an existing apiary, and expanded the garden.
for over a decade, transcore has participated in ibttas annual service project, which is aimed at giving back to the host city of its annual maintenance, engineering, and roadway operations workshop. while transcore always values opportunities to contribute to the communities where we live and work, we were grateful for this day of service that allowed us to partner with tolling industry leaders to give back to our local community.
