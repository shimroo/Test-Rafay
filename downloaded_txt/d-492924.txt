 faqs








            what services are included in washroom hygiene management?
          









washroom hygiene services typically include the supply and servicing of sanitary bins, toilet roll dispensers, hand washing solutions, air care, washroom vending machines and baby care facilities. we also offer entrance and logo matting plus clinical waste disposal.








            how often can i expect my facilities to be serviced?
          









the frequency of visits is dependent on your needs, the amount of foot traffic, and specific business requirements. options could range from weekly to monthly services, ensuring facilities are always up to standard. we will discuss your needs to work out what is the best option for you. customers with multiple locations can select difference frequencies for each location and frequencies can be changed as needed.








            i'm a new business and don't know how often my washrooms need servicing, how do you quote for that?
          









every business has unique demands, so we recommend starting with a minimum service level. we can then review and adapt the service frequency as your business grows and your needs change. our team will work with you to ensure your washrooms are maintained to the highest standards, providing a tailored solution that fits your specific requirements.








            what happens if there is a missed service or emergency?
          









in the unlikely event of a missed service, we will contact you to rearrange a new appointment. in the event of an urgent requirement, please contact us and we can address your urgent maintenance or replenishment needs as a priority.








            are there flexible contract terms available?
          









unlike many of the larger suppliers, we offer flexible contracts that do not require long-term commitments, allowing you the flexibility to adjust your services as your business needs change.








            how do you ensure compliance with health and safety regulations?
          









we are licenced by the environment agency and all our operatives undertake a rigorous initial training programme along with continuous ongoing training to ensure compliance with health and safety regulations. we also use strict and stringent waste disposal methods with our partners stericycle, ensuring safe and compliant handling of all waste, keeping the customer fully compliant with all waste disposal regulations.
