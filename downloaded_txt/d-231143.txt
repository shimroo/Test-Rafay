if you're seeing this page via a web browser, it means you've setup tomcat successfully. congratulations!
as you may have guessed by now, this is the default tomcat home page. it can be found on the local filesystem at:
$catalina_home/webapps/root/index.html
where "$catalina_home" is the root of the tomcat installation directory. if you're seeing this page, and you don't think you should be, then you're either a user who has arrived at new installation of tomcat, or you're an administrator who hasn't got his/her setup quite right. providing the latter is the case, please refer to the tomcat documentation for more detailed setup and administration information than is found in the install file.
note: for security reasons, using the manager webapp
            is restricted to users with certain roles such as "manager-gui".
            users are defined in $catalina_home/conf/tomcat-users.xml.
included with this release are a host of sample servlets and jsps (with associated source code), extensive documentation, and an introductory guide to developing web applications.
tomcat mailing lists are available at the tomcat project web site:

tomcat-users for general questions related to configuring and using tomcat
tomcat-dev for developers working on tomcat

thanks for using tomcat!
