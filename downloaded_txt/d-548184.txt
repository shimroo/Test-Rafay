mojave ghost
by forrest gander





but here, you said, at the time of our intrusion,
you said this zone here is not one of the earth’s sentences
but an overdub of stutters here where we’re walking
on this slumbering crack, a complex, you said,

of tensions right here, and you bent and touched
your finger to the warm, ant-fenestrated dirt
while i surveyed the hairpin turn in the arroyo beside us
and then you stood and brought it, your finger,
to my lips, you said here, and you watched me
as the taste, part you part earth, brought a change to my face.
