some q&a about the above applications:


q1: why do you
                      suggest multiple spyware scanners? isn't one good
                      scanner enough?
a1: you cannot remove
                    all spyware by using just one scanner. each scanner
                    finds different
                           types of dangerous and
                    not-so-dangerous spyware. more importantly, any one
                    malware
                           scanner can be targeted
                    specifically by malware to make it ineffective.
                    hitting such malware
                           from multiple
                    directions with a variety of tools thus provides
                    better overall protection.

q2: how good is
                      microsoft defender?
a2: microsoft

                    defender was previously called microsoft
                    antispyware, which in turn was based
                           on an very good
                    small-company product called giant antispyware.
                    towards the end of
                           the microsoft antispyware
                    name, the product had fallen noticeably behind all
                    the other
                           detectors listed here. i
                    have heard that defender is an improvement. i only
                    run defender
                           after the other tools
                    listed here, and those provide sufficiently good
                    coverage that so far
                           i have not
                    picked up anything major using defender. also,
                    please be fully aware that like
                           many microsoft
                    downloads these days, you will be asked to let a
                    scanner program look
                           over all of
                    your hardware and software before the microsoft site
                    lets you download the
                           defender
                    product. that usually works fine unless you have
                    done major surgery on your
                           computer, such
                    as replacing the motherboard. if you fall into that
                    category, please be aware
                           if you should
                    fail the prerequisite download scan, your will
                    system will be permanently
                           banned from
                    receiving critically important security patches from
                    microsoft. reinstalling
                           windows from
                    disks can fix this, but unfortunately, most
                    off-the-shelf windows systems
                           no longer
                    include full installation disks. so: some caution,
                    please, if you are one of those
                           who likes to do
                    major hardware upgrades on windows systems.

q3: how important
                      is the firewall?
a3: after a
                    good initial cleaning, your next most important
                    security task is to set up a solid
                           firewall. not putting up
                    a good firewall after a thorough cleaning is like
                    tossing out known
                           criminals from your
                    premises, then not bothering to put up any doors or
                    walls to keep them
                           from returning the
                    first time your turn your back. my favorite firewall
                    was sygate pro. alas,
                           in november 2005
                    symantec bought sygate pro and -- sigh
                    -- immediately discontinued it.
                           (my thanks to s.k. for
                    noticing that event.) what is particularly
                    distressing i am not aware
                           of any
                    comparison that ranks the symantec firewall product
                    as highly as sygate pro. my
                           own experiences
                    back it 2004 tended to confirm that, since at that
                    time the number of
                           successful
                    break-ins i saw dropped dramatically when i switched
                    from symantec's firewall
                           to the sygate
                    pro. the free home version of sygate is
                    still readily available and quite good,
                           but it is not a
                    powerful as the pro version was. i am now testing
                    others such as armor2net.

q4: is running a
                      good software firewall enough?
a4: no.
                    while a software firewall is vital, it is not
                    sufficient by itself to protect your computer.
                           you will also
                    need hardware-level assistance to help isolate your
                    system better from the
                           internet. that
                    it not all that difficult for most users, since if
                    you have computers at home
                           that talk to
                    each other and share a single internet connection,
                    you probably already have
                           the kind of
                    hardware isolation needed. it is called a router -- more
                    specifically, a network
                             address
                      translator, or nat router. a router helps protect
                    your computer by functioning
                           like a one-way
                    mirror, one that keeps unknown internet denizens
                    from seeing your home
                           systems unless
                    you specifically request request information from
                    them first. (obviously,
                           if you fall for
                    a fake-email phishing scam and make just such a
                    request, all bets are off.
                           that is a large
                    part of why phishing is becoming both more common
                    and more tricky.)
                           many of the new
                    generations of cable modems, dsl modems, and
                    wireless access
                           points have
                    routers built in, so it is possible that you already
                    have what you need. if you
                           are absolutely
                    sure you don't already have a router between your
                    computers and the
                           internet, you
                    should consider buying a stand-alone router even if
                    you only have one pc.

q5: i have a router
                      and firewall... and teenage kids. should i be
                      worried?
a5:
                    yes! the average teenager these days attracts
                    malware like a magnet attracts nails.
                            worse,
                    once malware gets into your home network, the
                    hidden-from-the-internet kind
                            of
                    protection that your router hardware was providing
                    simply evaporated. after all, it
                            does not
                    do much good to hid in a bank vault if the robber is
                    already in there with you.
                            one
                    solution for network-savvy users is to add a second
                    "cascaded" router to isolate
                            your
                    computer from the rest of your home network in much
                    the same way that the first
                            router hides you from
                    the internet. setting up cascading routers can
                    tricky, though, so
                            don't try
                    this strategy unless you are already familiar with
                    how to set up such networks.

q6: i have a
                      wireless system that worked right out of the box.
                      should i be worried?
a6: yes! the
                    default settings for the average wireless system are
                    nothing less than appalling
                            from the
                    viewpoint of keeping malware and attackers out of
                    your system. at the very
                            least,
                    shut off the feature that broadcasts your network
                    name. instead, create a network
                            name that
                    is more like a long password -- cryptic and
                    non-intuitive -- and hand-code it
                            into your
                    wireless access point and your computers. enable
                    encryption so that you are
                            not
                    broadcasting everything in the clear, preferably
                    using the highest level available on
                            your
                    systems and access point (aes is good). finally, use
                    mac filters to tell your
                            wireless
                    access point to allow only your computers to use it. you
                    can still be broken
                            into if
                    someone spoofs (fakes) your mac address, but at
                    least you will make it a lot
                            harder
                    for them to get even to that point.

q7: should i run
                      lots of security applications (and other
                      applications) all the time?
a7: no. in
                    fact, in general it's a really good idea to keep
                    your execution "footprint" -- that
                            is, the number of
                    applications in memory and running at the same time
                    -- down to the
                            the smallest size
                    possible. why? because every application that you
                    run continuously
                           
                    represents another set of potential holes by which
                    spyware and other forms of malware
                            can
                    potentially get in. such attacks can be very
                    worrisome, since no amount of updating
                            your
                    windows operating system software can protect you
                    from a really bad whole in a
                            major
                    application. since security applications usually run
                    in a privileged mode, they 
                            can
                    actually become significant security risks in their
                    own right when malware users
                            know how

q8: what are
                      rootkits, and what can i do about them?
                      a8: rootkits -- or, more specifically,
                    malware applications  written using rootkits --
                    are
                            forms of
                    malware that undercut the most basic features of
                    your operating system,
                            such as
                    the ability to see a file or write a certain word to
                    the screen. they can be
                            very
                    nasty, and can
                    irreversibly damage your operating system. a triad (my own
                            term for
                    a type of malware configuration i first encountered
                    back in 2004) is an
                           
                    especially dangerous combination of three forms of
                    malware: a
                    keylogger that
                            records
                    everything you type, a remote terminal application that
                    allows a remote
                            user to
                    access your computer as if your computer were his
                    own, and a rootkit
                             
                      application programmed specifically to hide
                    itself and the other two members of
                            the triad
                    from ordinary forms of inspection, including from
                    spyware checkers. my
                            first
                    name for these hard-to-detect triads was shivas. the
                    methods i describe
                            here are
                    intended to give ordinary users a fighting chance at
                    detecting and
                            removing
                    triads, mostly by attacking them repeatedly from
                    many different angles
                            until
                    something breaks and they become visible to removal
                    tools.

spyware faq
            how bad is spyware? almost certainly worse than you
            imagined. if you are reading this at home or from a small
            business, there is a surprisingly good chance someone is
            tracking everything you are doing, even if you use virus and spyware checkers.
          for windows users with small business accounts,
            delicate negotiations, large financial transfers, trade
            secrets, patent research, or official-use-only government
            documents, the risks of such hidden spyware cannot easily be
            understated. this faq
            explains what spyware is and why it is so easy to
            underestimate the extent of this threat.

how to remove
          spyware from windows systems
a distressingly common strategy i've seen on
          home and small business pcs and laptops is the use of triads
          of hardcore spyware that work together as a team. a keylogger captures
          everything you type, including passwords; a remote access terminal
          gives a remote user the ability to take over your system at
          anytime; and finally, a custom designed rootkit application hides
          both itself and the other two members of the triad from
          ordinary forms of detection. triads, which i also call shivas in earlier
          versions of these pages, also have a nasty habit of taking
          over and using your own virus and spyware checkers to fool
          users with bogus reports on whether any spyware is present.
          the main purpose of this detailed
            spyware removal procedure is to give ordinary home and
          small business users a fighting chance of catching and
          removing triads. it will
          simultaneously do a far more thorough job than any one spyware
          tool of removing the more mundane forms of spyware that
          typically bog down computers. you should be comfortable with
          installing and deinstalling your own software before
          attempting this procedure. additionally, some familiarity with
          how windows works and how to fix problems in it can be very
          helpful. for an earlier, easier-to-read version of this
          procedure, you might want to try
          warren harrison's "from the editor" essay in the nov/dec 2004
          issue of ieee software:
          http://www.computer.org/software/homepage/2004/nov-dec/eic.htm.

ever wonder what folks at
            the u.s. department of defense think about all those wild
            and woolly folks who write open source software? it's
            probably not what you thought. check out the first report below if you would like
            to know more.

            also, have you ever thought it odd that open source
            developers "give away" all that software work for free? take
            a look at the second report to
            understand what's really going on. the economic incentives
            for sharing code are actually surprisingly similar to the
            ones that led to the development of rural electric
            cooperatives back in the early 1900s.
