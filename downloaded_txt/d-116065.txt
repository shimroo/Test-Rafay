what does it cost?



our base rate is $100 for the first two hours (with a two-hour minimum) and $50 for each additional hour. this applies to private or customized training. we recommend at least two hours to cover more material effectively, as one hour is usually not enough. for some specific services, we charge a flat fee of $50. while we may not be the cheapest option, we believe we offer the best value. our goal is to teach you skills, not just sell you sessions. we do not charge for consultations to discuss training options and find the best fit for you.

practical tactical



we're not law enforcement or ex-navy seals; we're law-abiding citizens just like you. while firearms are not a part of all of our courses, they are incorporated into many of them. when it comes to personal protection, you don’t necessarily need a firearm but it certainly helps. a lot. because a portion of the population opposes the second amendment, gun owners face unjust scrutiny daily. to safeguard our freedom and the right to bear arms, it's crucial that we possess the right skills, mindset, and attitude to be responsible gun owners.

















he said to them, “but now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don’t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.”luke 22:36
