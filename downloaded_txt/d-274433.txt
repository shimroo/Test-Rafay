  “i will 
  bring them out from the people, and gather them from countries and will bring 
  them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains… i will feed my 
  flock… i will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven 
  away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which 
  was sick…” ezekiel 
  34: 13-16
