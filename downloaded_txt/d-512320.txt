  the time is finally here! 🎉😁🥳

we've been sitting on this news for what feels like forever. a few months ago, rivr had the opportunity of a lifetime to collaborate with sesame street on three specials for the streaming service, max. yes, you heard that right, sesame street! our collaboration was surreal. we brought our knowledge of unscripted television to their world, and they brought unbridled creativity, kindness and puppetry into ours. we filmed right here in rivr studios with our amazing community by our side....and now, everyone can witness the "pinch me" moments all our cast & crew had while filming.

"cookie monster's bake sale" is the first to launch next week on august 10th. in october, you'll get to see "oscar's handmade halloween" and in december, "elmo's holiday helpers." here is a sneak peek of our first in line, the bake sale episode....and an enormous thank you to all our amazing cast and crew.

this is the first of many posts to commemorate this amazing collaboration!

  rivr is taking italy by storm! 🇮🇹🍝🧀 incredible new spin-off series in the works with the amazing marrs!
repost from @jennymarrs
•
last summer, we sat around a table at our friend’s newly purchased home and dreamt together about how dave and i could help them restore their historic farmhouse. 

in my opinion, the best ideas always happen around a table. 🤍

fast forward to today: for the past six months, we have been traveling back and forth to tuscany to work on our friend’s home. the challenges and cultural differences and language barrier and stressful permitting processes are real. 

yes, this is an absolute dream job in an absolute dream place but there’s a lot of pressure too. we are working with our dear friends who have put every bit of their savings into this project because this is not only a home for their family to enjoy but also an extension of their business and livelihood.

when we first met rebecca seventeen years ago, we never in a million years would have imagined we would be renovating a home for her family in her beloved chianti classico region with cameras following us around. life is absolutely wild sometimes 🤍🙌😭. 

i am so excited to finally share that our four-episode new show, fixer to fabulous: italiano, will air next year on @hgtv!! 🇮🇹 

(you guys! i cannot wait for you to see this one!!! and we still have a lot of work to do. our family will be back over the sea this summer and this fall!)

we have a new episode of #fixertofabulous airing tonight at 9|8c on @hgtv !

as always, this is a special one with a renovation that i absolutely loved (loved!!), incredible homeowners we adore, and funny moments along the way. 🤍

this is also the last episode we filmed with our favorite sound operator, grant. he left us to return to his homeland of new zealand and it was a bittersweet goodbye. we were happy for him but sad for us. our little team behind the camera is like family to us - we spend hours and hours and hourrrssss together and we are all so invested in these renovations and telling these family stories. it won’t be the same without grant - who keeps us laughing every day (at him or with him 😆). i’ve said it before and i’ll say it again: we have the very best team behind us and we are so grateful for each and every one of these amazing people!!

mr. yolo is always encouraging me to stop and celebrate accomplishments. the last episode of season 1 of “makeover by monday” aired on the @magnolianetwork, and i want to stop and celebrate what we did in these nine 3-day makeovers! being able to design a space and thrift the decor, then see that design come to fruition over a few days was so rewarding. i am beyond grateful for my husband, father-in-law, my sister and friends @mjphandyman @damatorenovation for putting their everything into making these makeovers happen! and thank you to our amazing film crew and production company @rivrmedia for making the show so beautiful 🤍

to our clients, the city of milwaukee, and all the small businesses that welcomed us, thank you!! you all made the show such a joy for us to create!

  this week’s “makeover by monday” is worth catching up on! look at this transformation that took place in 3 days!! repost from @ispydiy
•
the before & afters from this weekend’s episode of makeover by monday!!! this kitchen is so dreamy 😍 i was nervous to tackle a 3-day kitchen makeover, but when i saw this space, i could not wait to design it. i knew we could keep so much of the original goodness and just give it a more cohesive look. the owners, annette and ruth are the best, and gave me complete creative freedom (they just requested gnomes 😆). 
the ceiling! i am so happy with how that turned out! the “wood grain” on the doors and built-in was actually painted on decades ago and in bad shape. we covered it with rich paint colors, then brought more warmth in with this wood ceiling (and covered up some plumbing pipes!) swoon. 

thank you @lollylollyceramics for letting us stop by your studio, and @thelmacarolwine for welcoming the crew in the shop! #milwaukee #smallbusinesssupport 

this episode has so many simple diy tips and projects! you can stream #makeoverbymonday on @discoveryplus! and we will be back in the new year with a couple more episodes! @magnolianetwork

  shout out to one of the best crews in the biz. repost from @jennymarrs

luke loves “our filmers” (as he calls our crew). our crew has been a part of our lives for five years now - by our sides day in and day out. they work harder than anyone carrying heavy cameras, climbing onto roofs and into bathtubs to get the shot and sweating in the arkansas heat alongside us. we couldn’t do any of this work without our amazing team and, thankfully, ours is the very best of the best. (not just at what they do but also just amazing humans). they truly are our extended family. 🤍

thanks for this sweet photo of lukey and his pal, “mr. jason”, @mike_davello !! 👏

big, big news! 🎉

for the past couple of years, dave and i have been hard at work designing a line of furniture and accessories in collaboration with @betterhomesandgardens only at @walmart. and, today, (finally!!) we get to share the news that the products are now available in store and online! 

we believe a home should be filled with the things and people you love. the things that surround you should be beautiful and we believe beautiful, well-made items should be available to everyone. we are so humbled and grateful to have a chance to share these products with you all. 

our hope for this collection is that you can bring these items into your home and create memories around the table or sit on the porch swing for a pause and exhale at the end of a long day. 🤍

you can start shopping now at the link in my profile or in a store near you!! 🙌

@noelgatts and @joemazzahomeinspections overcame a waterbed of a roofing system, a tricky floor plan, and a bonus room w/out a foundation to give the owners of the property on tonight's #homeinspectorjoe a house that's distinctly their own 😊 #beforeandafter
