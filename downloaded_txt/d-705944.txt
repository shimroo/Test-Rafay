about usthe mission of cream city swing dance is to cultivate an inclusive and supportive community through the education and promotion of lindy hop and social swing era dances.   we seek to honor and respect the black american history of jazz music and dance and to allow our practice of the dance to become more recognizably like the way that these moves developed: among diverse peoples banded together in networks of mutual support and care, using movement together to express a range of human feelings, and to build on what came before.we were founded in 1998 by lars and patty russell, who started dancing for fun and were hooked within two weeks of their first outing.ccswing grew over the years as dances were organized at locations around the city.  the first milwaukee lindy exchange was held in 2000.  from 2009-2014, we found a weekly dance home in bayview, and organized two more lindy exchanges (2010 & 2011).fall of 2014 brought a venue relocation to blue ribbon hall at best place at the historic pabst brewery and second set of lessons added to the evening, putting lindy hop back in the forefront.   in 2016, we introduced a second night of dancing on mondays dedicated to dance education with leveled classes.in december of 2016, ccswing began operating as a non-profit 501(c)3. the covid-19 pandemic shut our doors in march 2020, and we began reopening programming in summer/fall of 2022.   we're now back to weekly dancing in a new format, combining our pre-pandemic programming into one night with our popular series lessons and a open social hour at the historic falcon bowl in riverwest.current officers:shannon brennan, board membermitch keim, tax directorlyndsey kuhlmann, director of operationsbj szyjakowski, board member  cover photos by ccswing, marv kellerman, darin dubinsky, and maria petrella
