 2015 



no new bills submitted.



  12 may: 3 culture clubs filed a lawsuit in knoxville's us district court against the former state attorney general, claiming their civil rights were violated in 2010 by the then attorney general. the state ag denied the legality of the groups' 'state recognition' by the state commission of indian affairs that non-indians had taken over, and asked for $66.5 million in damages. 
	the lawsuit was voluntarily terminated by the 3 culture clubs on 23 july 2015.
 
 
the suing 3 fake tribes are:	
• lee vest's "remnant yuchi nation" of kingsport, 	
• alice gwin henry's "tanasi tribe" (related to "tanasi council of far-away cherokee") of memphis & 	
• herstle cross's "united eastern lenape tribe" (formerly "united eastern lenape nation of winfield") of knoxville, 
none of which have anything even vaguely resembling a public history prior to 1980.

2012 tennessee legislators' lies 

hb 2284 by rep. shipley  & 
sb 2177 by sen. campfield 


 "two tribes have previously been recognized by the 
state of tennessee as native american organizations ..."  

false.
fact & proof: 
one defunct culture club, the "etowah cherokee nation" was recognized by governor ray blanton in 1978, but this recognition was declared invalid in 1991 by the state (tdec) who said the governor lacked the power and authority to do so, and the group no longer exists. 

there is no record of a second group obtaining state recognition by any means, and no existing historical native american indian tribe has ever been recognized in or by tennessee since the cherokee nation was forcibly removed in 1838. 
six culture clubs, including the three referenced in these bills, temporarily, fraudulently and illegally obtained recognition from the tennessee commission of indian affairs* on 19 june 2010, declared invalid by the tennessee attorney general (27 august 2010) and davidson county chancery court (7 september 2010), and affirmed on appeal by the supreme court of tennessee (16 february 2012).  
    *all members of federally- and state-recognized tribes and descendants had been 
     replaced by persons with no proven native american indian heritage.  

calling a culture club of unrelated people created in the 21st century a "tribe" or "nation" is not only a mistake but identity theft -- it steals the identity of legitimate historical native american indian tribes who were forced out of tennessee, and gives the name to actors who have no actual tribal identity. 

several organizations in tennessee, including the alliance for native american indian rights (nashville) and the chattanooga intertribal association (chattanooga) were recognized by the tennessee commission of indian affairs in 1993 as native american indian organizations. the "united eastern lenape nation of winfield, tennessee" in this bill, calling itself a "nation", was recognized differently as an "indian-related organization in tennessee" -- not as an organization of native american indians, and not as a nation or as a tribe (31 july 1993).  


 "... and one has a master roll, dated march 21, 1857" 

false.
fact & proof:  
this claim "of yuchi gathered in carter county", made by "remnant yuchi nation" "chief" lee vest, was first printed in the bristol herald courier newspaper in june 2011.  
web searches and historians can't find anything about a tennessee 1857 yuchi 'master roll' beyond vest's claim, and there is no known record of yuchi who stayed & survived the american watauga settlement of northeast tennessee in 1772. 
but more importantly -- the 1857 yuchi master roll of kingsport  is referred to in public documents hb 2284 and sb 2177 as proof of the legitimacy of the "remnant yuchi nation", but the public can't access it.  proof denied is not proof at all -- it's fraud. and the public shouldn't accept it from legislators or the constituents whose interests they're presuming to represent. 
 

 "three (3) applicants have met the provisions of this act for state [tribal] recognition".  

false.
fact & proof:  
there is no public documentation that these 3 culture clubs or any existing culture club has "met the provisions of this act for state recognition".
if they had "met the provisions of this act for state recognition", there would be paper documentation filed with some public office. to date there has been no claim of public documentation or reference to where other legislators or the general public could find such.  

"this bill recognizes, for purposes of state native american indian recognition, the following tribes, bands, and groups:

(1) remnant yuchi nation; 
(2) tanasi council; and
(3) united eastern lenape nation of winfield."
 these are culture clubs, not tribes. 
real tribes have hundreds of years of history with the us and state governments. they have their own indigenous language (not english), and have an historical record of living in a place for hundreds years before contact with europeans. 
these tennessee groups have no history beyond getting together recently and wanting to play indian.
all of their members speak english. none speak an indigenous language fluently from birth.  contrary to their claims, none of their members are actually indigenous to their area and are only traced to the areas through their european family lines. 
taking their names, taking their recognition, is identity theft,
and the tennessee general assembly is promoting it.
 the "remnant yuchi nation" was created in 2007 from a group called the "appalachian confederated tribes" created in kingsport in 2006, the brainchild of lee vest. from the actual 2007 meeting's minutes: "at 6:00 p.m. on april 13, lee told the tribe that he as chief had decided for the good of the tribe to change our name from appalachian confederated tribes to remnant yuchi nation. lee discussed the connection of cherokee/yuchi heritage. he said that if you had cherokee ancestors, then you also had yuchi blood. lee then told the history of the yuchi in this region. he also told the benefits for the tribe of becoming state recognized. after he gave his reasons for the change, he asked for discussion. several people spoke in favor of the change. lee then asked for a show of hands for those who favored the change. 100% of the members present agreed with lee for the name change. lee then said that from this forward our tribe would be called the remnant yuchi nation." 

equating 'cherokee' to 'yuchi', then changing the group's name to 'yuchi', has allowed the fraudulent "remnant yuchi nation" to slip under the fraud-hunting radar of the cherokee nation, but not the anti-fraud interests of the muscogee (creek) nation and its member, the real yuchi tribe. 

self-proclaimed "chief" lee vest is not yuchi and not cherokee either:

corky,

  i am not yuchi.  i have never claimed yuchi.  my blood line is 
pamunkey/monacan with provable paper trail.  i only intend to build a 
yuchi village, because i believe the yuchi were in this area.  many of

[fyi, corky allen is yuchi and a member of the muscogee (creek) tribe.
 the "tanasi council" is a new 2010 organization and name for "the faraway cherokees native american intertribal association inc." tennessee corporation 000137791 created by alice henry in 1984 in memphis, said to be "simply a 501(c)3 business entity" in 2008. the name was changed to "faraway cherokee of memphis" and "tanasi council of the far away cherokee" in 2008 by alice henry, founding leader, and reduced further to "tanasi council" in 2010 in an attempt to avoid using the tribal reference to the cherokee after the cherokee nation listed it as a fraudulent group. 
on 8 july 2015 alice gwin henry wrote "the faraway cherokee is a separate entity from the tanasiê"tennessee" council." according to the tennessee secretary of state, "the faraway cherokees/native american intertribal association, inc." was founded in 1984, and its registered agent is alice henry of memphis. 
there is no tennessee secretary of state record for "tanasi council". zoominfo.com has "alice henry, president of the 'faraway cherokee' of memphis tanasi council of the far away cherokee", but the website & domain registration of www.farawaycherokeeofmemphis.com is gone. in 2009: "i am patsy wade, president of the faraway cherokee 501-c3 and vice chief of the tanasi council of the faraway cherokee." so ... am not sure what the distinction is between "the faraway cherokee 501-c3" and "the tanasi council of the faraway cherokee", but will guess that the 501(c)3 non-profit organization is their non-political usa irs-recognized tax-exempt organization, and the other is their unregistered fake tribe - the same people's political wing that engages in promoting legislation to get themselves & fellow fakes recognized as indian tribes in tennessee (2008-2012), and files lawsuits against people who don't agree with them (2015). 

 the "united eastern lenape nation of winfield" was first created as the "ueln, middle division, inc.", incorporated in tennessee in 1983 as a branch of the ohio ueln, considered a fake and fraudulent group of wannabes, and administratively dissolved in 2011. its most recent registered agent was "chief" bonnie 'calm waters' knuckles, a resident of corbin, kentucky, 45 miles north of winfield which is on the kentucky line. in 1993 the tennessee commission of indian affairs recognized it as a "native american indian related organization" because it lacked a majority of native american indian membership. due to lack of investigation and requirements, membership in this fraudulent, tribal-identity-stealing organization has been used to obtain federal minority-owner and sba 8(a) status for at least one person.



without public historical proof for their published claims, 
tennessee representative shipley & senator campfield are 
committing fraud in support of theft of native american indian identity. 

our first recommendation was for you to ask your own state representative and senator to get you the documentation. 
but no legislator to date has been willing to pursue these fantastic claims.  
instead, ask your local newspaper state gov't reporter & tv station's investigative reporters, and especially ask your local college's history professors to write their state representative and senator. ask them, "¿¿¿ where's the proof ???"
"¿¿¿ where's the history ???"

office of the attorney general
robert e. cooper, jr.
attorney general and reporter
nashville, tn 37202

august 27, 2010
statement on mark greene v. tennessee commission of indian affairs

after reviewing material submitted by its former members and other information, the attorney general has concluded that the notice of the june 19, 2010, meeting of the now-defunct tennessee commission of indian affairs did not disclose the commission's intent to deliberate about and approve the applications of the six indian tribes seeking state recognition. the attorney general has further concluded that members of the commission discussed these matters prior to the june meeting. these actions could be found by a court to constitute violations of tennessee's open meetings act. a copy of the answer filed today by the attorney general reflects these conclusions and is available at www.tn.gov/attorneygeneral/cases/tcia/tcia.htm

 one misstatement: they were not "six indian tribes seeking state recognition".
they are: six culture clubs seeking state recognition as native american indian tribes.
 1 july 2009: state commission of indian affairs went into "sunset"  (year-long wind-down period prior to termination).

 10 june 2010: attempts to extend the commission of indian affairs opposed by native americans; bill proposals failed; the state general assembly adjourned. 
 19 june 2010: the tncia held its last legal meeting in memphis, and violated state laws regarding open meetings, advance notice and fraud.
 21 june 2010: mark greene, nashville lobbyist for the cherokee nation of oklahoma (two legislative sessions, 2009 and 2010), filed a complaint in nashville's davidson county court against the tncia for failing to comply with state regulations governing open meetings of public agencies.
 the tennessee commission of indian affairs was terminated on 30 june 2010.

 27 august 2010: tennessee attorney general admitted that the state commission of indian affairs violated the state's open meeting law.

 7 september 2010: davidson county chancery court final agreed order found that the tncia violated the state open meetings act and declared the tncia's action of 19 june 2010 "void and of no effect".  
 as of 11 october 2010, leaders of four of the six groups - lee vest, james meeks, bonnie knuckles & alice henry, including two who were commissioners (jm, ah), had filed five separate  motions in davidson county chancery court to set aside or amend judgment, to intervene, and to dismiss the agreement reached by greene and the attorney general who represented the state and the commission as a state agency. a hearing on the motions was postponed indefinitely and the matter dropped.




the actions taken by the tcia at its 19 june 2010 meeting in adopting standing rule 14 and in awarding state recognition as an indian tribe to the recently created six culture clubs that call themselves: 
 "remnant yuchi nation" aka "appalachian confederated tribes" of kingsport tn; 
 "united eastern lenape nation" aka "upper cumberland cherokee" of winfield tn; 
 "chikamaka band" aka "chikamaka-cherokee band of the south cumberland plateau" of tracy city tn; 
 "central band of cherokee" aka " cherokee of lawrence county" of lawrenceburg tn; 
 "cherokee wolf clan" of yuma tn; and 
 "tanasi council" aka "tanasi council of the far away cherokee" of memphis tn, 
formerly known collectively as  
"confederation of tennessee native tribes", 
are declared void and of no effect by the tennessee attorney general in davidson county (nashville) chancery court on 7 september 2010, pursuant to the state open meetings act, tca 8-44-105. other violations of state law committed by the tcia, including conspiracy, fraud, and violations of the state open meeting, open records, and uniform administrative procedures acts, have not been prosecuted at this time.

be advised that these groups are similar in legitimacy to the "tribes" of the mardi gras indian nation. 





the six pro-bogus-recognition 2010 tncia commissioners (hicks, henry, meeks, goddard, lawson, thigpen) tried to convince the state legislature during its january to june 2010 term to extend the commission of indian affairs for another couple of years and support several bogus recognition criteria bills. the tncia failed to get their bills through a single committee, but succeeded in scaring legislators such that the legislators added a 60-day stay onto the tncia's rule 0785-1 recognition criteria for native american indian tribes which would go into effect 17 may july 2010, 17 days after the commission's expiration date of 30 june 2010. this put the recognition criteria beyond the six commissioners' ability to legally implement the rule and review the applications of the six culture clubs that wanted to be state-defined as tribes. so at their last official meeting on 19 june 2010 in memphis, the tncia created, approved and adopted a new "standing rule 14" of recognition criteria specifically designed to bypass the state's statutory rulemaking process, followed immediately by a private review of their own 6 culture clubs' applications in 30 minutes, returned the applications to the applicant culture clubs in order to avoid any state "open records" paper trail, then approved their culture clubs as the state of tennessee's new tribes, and received a standing ovation from their 50+ supporters in attendance. (the link to the state web site that temporarily contained the announcement of the illegal action, www.state.tn.us/environment/boards/tcia/pdf/tcia_recognized_tribes_i.pdf, is now dead.)

new in-state code word: "tennessee indigenous indians" 
= white republicans who claim to be 5th-generation descendants of indians 
who were too afraid to claim their heritage, who "hid out" for the past 172 years, who have no more connection to the original tribe than they do to their european heritage.
a racial prejudice used to distinguish whites born in tennessee from indians born elsewhere.
