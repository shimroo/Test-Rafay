about steve




“there is a unique quality to steve’s music that i truly enjoy.”

— george benson



with a career spanning over 30 years in music, multi-instrumentalist, singer, songwriter and producer steve oliver is still being heard each day on contemporary and smooth jazz radio around the world.his career has produced multiple #1 hits on the billboard charts and countless radio staples over nearly two decades - including with his latest album “unified” (2020) - a collaboration with keyboardist brian simpson that has reached the #1 spot on the billboard and amazon jazz sales charts.steve’s been a touring member of acoustic alchemy, has played countless club dates and headlined festivals worldwide. he’s also co-written and produced tracks with grammy award winning pianist omar akram and many smooth jazz notables including vincent ingala, brian simpson and paul taylor. 




“this is bobby mcferrin with a guitar strapped to him!”

— art good, catalina island jazztrax festival



having released eleven studio albums, a live cd / dvd package and a “best of”, for oliver, music is therapy and a welcomed diversion from the current world climate. with a plethora of solo radio hits to his credit including “high noon”, “fun in the sun”, and “global kiss”, today oliver is just as comfortable being an in-demand producer, composer, adviser, and mentor to others.with his 2019 full-length album “illuminate”. a follow up to 2016’s acclaimed all vocal project “pictures & frames” (recorded with the legendary vinnie colaiuta on drums and leland sklar on bass at the famed capitol studios in hollywood), illuminate is record deeply rooted in contemporary jazz guitar melodies and steve's trademark wordless vocalese. with steve's instantly recognizable guitar lines and a list of guest artists that includes bass virtuoso jimmy haslip, the incredible joel taylor on drums, and sax luminary nelson rangell, illuminate puts the spotlight back on one of the genre's most engaging performers and songwriters.
