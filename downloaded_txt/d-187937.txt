attention members,
recently we’ve been made aware of suspicious phone calls targeting residents of the rgv. we want to take this opportunity to use caution when receiving unexpected calls. 

what to look for

1. caller id spoofing: fraudsters can manipulate caller id to make a call look like it is coming from ljfcu or another institution.
2. urgent language: be cautious if you are told immediate action is necessary to avoid negative consequences 
3. requests for personal information ljfcu will never ask you to provide sensitive information such as your debit card , password, social security number or pin. if you receive a suspicious call, hang up and do not give any personal information. report the incident to us by contacting our phone or email. 

your security is always our priority. we will continue to monitor and investigate any reports of fraudulent activity to ensure the safety of our members. thank you for your cooperation in helping us maintain a secure financial environment.
