what parents are saying









dfoy is a place where my child can do what she loves doing. dfoy gives my child excitement.




dfoy helps children with their self esteem and boost self confidence.




staff are very welcoming and very concerned about not only academic but social and individual needs of children. they are part of the team that helps children succeed and achieve their goals.




all of the staff are very kind and care about my child and how they feel. they listen to his requests and allow him to have a voice.




the programming is varied and engaging and staff are definitely supportive. i also like the activities that help to build self esteem and sense of community.




dfoy is special because they make children feel safe and secure, so that they are able to develop more academic strengths as well  as developing their social skills. having my child enrolled in dfoy has helped her progress at a faster pace and allowed her to learn new things that can help her now and in the future.




all the staff and program leaders care so much for the children and are so involved in making fun, active, educational, and inspirational activities. i could not be more grateful for their dedication!




students are invited to trips that enhance their understanding of the world. students also have voice and can demonstrate their skills and talents in various ways (performances, projects, competitions) both in and out of the building.




dfoy is community based! they really care about the children! they have been there for my family during a difficult time! i’ll always be grateful for them! thank you.
