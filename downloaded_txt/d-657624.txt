sunday worship celebrationfebruary 16 | in-person or virtual | 10–11:30amjoin us this sunday, february 16, at 10am, for our in-person or virtual, sunday worship celebration where pastor sharon ortiz shares a message titled. "the one jesus loved," based on john 21:15–25.













remembering alcf bay area founding pastor paul e. sheppardpastor paul sheppard became the founding pastor of alcf bay area (formerly known as abundant life christian fellowship) in 1989 to a congregation of 34 members. his visionary leadership forever changed the dna of our congregation by removing religious obstacles that created an atmosphere where people of all ethnicities, socio-economic backgrounds, and ages, felt welcomed.one of the hallmarks of pastor paul’s ministry included being a gifted, nationally recognized and sought after minister of the gospel who rightly divided the word of god in a uniquely relatable way with clarity and humor. our tagline—“an exciting fellowship of growing believers”—put discipleship front and center. there was a sense that we were a part of something bigger than ourselves. that excitement spilled over into five services per weekend at the o’brien facility, and upwards of 7,000 regular attendees and nearly 100 employees at leghorn, as well a national audience through the syndicated “enduring truth” radio broadcast.pastor paul had a love for people of all ages and walks of life. in the early days, his “hands on” approach led him to serving at the local jail and leading prayer for a local university’s sports team. pastor paul also believed in empowering members to serve where their passions led them and, at one point, we had 66 ministries.during pastor paul’s 20 years of ministry at alcf bay area, he modeled humility, courage, patience, joy, and sacrifice. his memory will always live in the hearts and minds of all who knew him!alcf bay areafor information about pastor paul’s wake and service, and how you can donate toward the “destined for victory” broadcast, go to: https://www.destinybayarea.org
