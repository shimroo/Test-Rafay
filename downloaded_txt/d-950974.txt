update to our water meter replacement project
we are about 80% complete on our water meter replacement project. so far around two thousand meters have been replaced. as previously stated in the december water bill insert, the changeout process will affect the usage dates on your water bills, some water bills will be over 30 days in usage and some under 30 days in usage depending on when your meter was installed. this process will continue until the project is complete. if your water bill seems high, please look at the usage dates and check for any leaks before calling our office for a leak check.
reminders:
if you have not paid your water bill or brought your water account to a current status, please do so as soon as possible. we will start water  shutoffs in the very near future.
meters are the property of the town of dublin, only town of dublin employees are allowed to open the meters and to shut off and turn on meters. if you need to check a meter for a leak or for a leak repaired, please call our office and we will send an employee out to open the meter during normal business hours. if you have a water leak emergency after hours, please call the pulaski county sheriff's office at 540-980-7800 and they will contact the employee on call.
