 gw custom basses and lutherie - for bassists by a bassist - grandon westlund, the bass kahuna 



































update: august 2024

after 16 years of working for others, including a 5 year stint as the full time in-house luthier at sam ash music here in indianapolis, i 
have now returned to being an independent luthier and hand building custom instruments. during my recent time at sam ash i did earn 
my factory authorized provider certifications for martin guitars, taylor guitars, fender (and all brands owned by fender: gretsch, 
jackson charvel, etc.). i am currently working on getting this site updated including my pricing and other information in between
the repairs, setups, and warranty work i am doing. i will also be offering guitars this time around as well, and have a few music 
stores in the surrounding area including nashville (more on that later) that will be carrying my instruments.

i made most of the "first time business owner mistakes" my first time around as a full time builder. i really learned a ton
working for others, running 1500-1600 instruments a year through the sam ash shop, including greek bouzoukis, dulcimers, violins,
cellos, upright basses, banjos, autoharps, and yes even electric and acoustic guitars and basses. i had been thinking about going
 back to being an independent luthier and builder for about 2 years now, and with sam ash going out of business nationwide, it
was the shove i needed.

i am also working through reno's music here is fishers, in, so any local
players who need any kind of work you can contact me directly to discuss the work needed, and then drop off with mark at reno's during
their normal business hours.

in the meantime you can reach me through my contact information on my about page.
