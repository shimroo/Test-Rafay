our steel and macro synthetic fibres for concrete reinforcement help simplify the construction process and result in high value outcomes. 
benefits of fibre reinforced concrete – fibre reinforced concrete increases the tensile strength of concrete floors. it reduces cracking and is an excellent alternate for projects where conventional steel mesh reinforcement cannot be used. it improves the impact strength of concrete, reduces permeability which controls crack growth and makes the structure more durable.
