top solutions & tips for your home projects
for homeowners looking for a fast and easy alternative to brushes and rollers, learn how graco paint sprayers can help you tackle your painting projects in half the time.

see all












home furniture
whether it’s a garage sale find or a chair or dresser you already own, a fresh coat of paint can give new life to outdated or tired-looking furniture in your home.









garage doors
even with all the angled panels of modern garage doors, a graco sprayer is quicker and easier than brushing or rolling and makes painting a garage door an easy one-day project.









fences
staining or painting your fence will help preserve and protect it from the sun and weather while improving your home’s overall curb appeal.









railings
railings take a lot of abuse. keep them looking their best with a fresh coat of paint or stain to preserve and protect them from the sun and weather.









shutters
with a fresh coat of stain or paint, decorative shutters greatly improve your home's curb appeal while preserving and protecting them from sun and weather damage.









outdoor furniture
whether it’s a flea market find or an adirondack chair you already own, a fresh coat of paint can give new life to outdated or tired-looking furniture.









sheds
sheds are great for storage. just like your house, your shed can fade over time. graco sprayers make it easy to freshen its appearance with a new coat of paint or stain.









ceilings
painting textured ceilings with paint rollers takes time and can cause the texture to flake off from the surface. using an airless sprayer to paint your ceilings is easier and saves you time.









interior rooms
with a graco sprayer, you can change the look of any room in the house in a fraction of the time it would take you to paint it by hand with a roller or brush.









exterior walls
add value and curb appeal to the exterior of your home with a fresh coat of paint. learn how to save time while still achieving proper paint coverage.









decks
applying a new coat of finish to your deck will protect the wood from the sun and harsh weather and make all the difference in the appearance of your entire home.









doors & trim
painting trim and doors in a room can often be overlooked. a new or updated color like white or stain can put the finishing touch on a professional-looking interior painting project.
