update: cleaning up and updating the entire site for the first time in a long while. dvd info updated, faq updated, heck, every page updated! yes, i realize that the website looks like it was designed in the 90's, which it was! however, my career path has taken me away from web design so what you see is what you get, there will be no major format updates or updating for mobile. sorry about that!
visitors: over 20 million visitors since debuting in 1995
