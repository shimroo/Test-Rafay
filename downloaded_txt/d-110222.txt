hometown: arlington mn. (i know, i know. you've never heard of it. it's an hour sw of the twin cities)

favorite music/artist: obviously the sweet, deep jams we play on z. grew up on a mix of pop, rock, country. a good tune is a good tune. from avicii to zeppelin, i dig music.

favorite movie: it's a toss up between the big lebowski and pulp fiction.

what i'm watching: sons of anarchy! arrested development, the wire, the sopranos, justified. the normal good stuff.

when i'm not on z, i'm: usually hanging out at the station, scheduling the music we play on z. clearly, i know how to party. but when we're not doing that, i'm constantly on the hunt for the best burger in town.

hang with me every weekday 2-7p! i usually have something sarcastic to say about things happening in this crazy world of ours. your mom digs it.
