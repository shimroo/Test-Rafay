we always like to start with a discussion of your goals for your event to determine the best program to recommend. group size, time constraints, budget and the group’s agenda for the entire day factor into making the best choice for the cooking activity. your event can have an instructional focus, an upbeat, party-like feel, or a challenging competitive theme.call (773) 517-3806 to get the conversation started.

we are inspired by cuisines from around the world, with their rustic style and bold flavors created with fresh, healthy ingredients. our focus on international cuisine pairs well with the diversity of our global corporate clients.we don’t think cooking has to be elaborate to be good, in fact, we feel the opposite. cooking is a daily activity and keeping it less complicated allows us to include it into our busy lives. we like to keep a simple kitchen, with basic tools, fewer gadgets and a focus on crafting dishes by taste and intuition instead of just following recipes. we love the science behind cooking, because it helps us understand why things happen the way they do.as chefs, we support recent trends in eating. we are always experimenting with new vegetarian, vegan and gluten free recipes. it keeps us thinking and provides fresh and exciting options for our clients.
