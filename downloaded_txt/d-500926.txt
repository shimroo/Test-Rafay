helpful information


transportation

bus service is available at select sites: college at old westbury, suny purchase and southampton. at each site we have carefully selected and partnered with leading and respected transportation providers who are amongst the most trusted in the tri-state area. all of the vehicles are air-conditioned with qualified and experienced professional drivers.
contact your preferred camp site for more detail. 
  


lunch

nutritious well balanced lunch options are offered at all locations. children will have a variey of hot and cold options available each day. special dietary needs, food allergies, kosher options, gluten free options, vegetarian options, menu questions, ingredients information, and more can be accommodated. for children who choose to bring their own lunch, we will refrigerate and have ready for them at lunch time.
  


swimming

we offer daily swimming periods for all programs at most locations. these periods may be recreational or instructional depending on specific program and site. all swimming pools utilized are highly supervised and exceed all safety regulations. all pools are supervised by an aquatics director who employs a lifeguarding staff. additional future stars summer camps staff and coaches also help with supervision in locker rooms, on the pool deck, and in the pool. swim periods are optional for campers and offer an opportunity for campers to cool off and refresh during the camp day.
 
note – campers at our farmingdale location have daily access to “the water-park” featuring inflatable waterslides, slip-n-slides, sprinklers and more for campers to cool off each day. other sites also have “water-park” features in addition to the on-site swimming pools.
  


staff

we take great pride in our staff -- the catalysts behind all the growth & development, fun & games, and teaching & learning that our programs encompass. from beginners to advanced players, or novice to experienced campers, our staff is able to make sure all campers are given a camp experience that is both challenging and exciting. each site director brings years of experience and expertise, providing  guidance and help to all programs before, during, and after the summer. all programs are overseen by a director who is a qualified and experienced adult professional in their field and has a passion for working with children. additional team members are experienced and gifted individuals who bring an array of special talents and energy to our programs and campers each summer. approximately 65% of future stars summer camps staff are certified teachers and coaches with the remainder typically being collegiate aged student-athletes who are education majors or looking to work with children in their careers.
camp medical staff are fully certified and on-site during camp hours.
