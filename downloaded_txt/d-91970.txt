about us


masterbatch & plastic compound custom manufacturing solutions
we have the power to transform the way your products look, feel, are processed and interact with external elements. from yoga mats and medical tubing to roofing materials, americhem's thermoplastic elastomers are the material of choice for all your custom manufacturing needs.
our products
americhem manufactures masterbatches and plastic compounds. we address common production challenges while enhancing your process control, quality and profitability — and providing greater efficiency, comfort and safety.
what is the difference between a masterbatch and a plastic compound?
our masterbatch comes in pellet or granule form and can be mixed at low levels with customers' resins during the manufacturing processes. our plastic compound is a pre-colored or natural resin mixed with additives and reinforcement filler that is ready to be used by our customers at 100%. we leverage decades of color masterbatch, additive masterbatch and plastic compound expertise to develop custom manufacturing solutions that drive innovation.
