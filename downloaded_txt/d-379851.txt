pinned: the invisible hand
this is pretty close to what i'm going to submit to universities. it's an introduction and 3 chapters. download in pdf here. oh yeah, and thanks for the unmitigated deluge of volunteers the last time, i really *felt* the love.
edit: theres a newer, nicer formatted and spell-check version you can get here. i can't remember, but i don't think there are any huge substantive changes, it just looks nicer.
edit: by the way, this is *really* old draft - the latest one is here.
