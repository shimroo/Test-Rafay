explore all vermont has to offer this summer.


vermont is fortunate to have a wide variety of campgrounds that offer something for everyone, from the most rustic experience to the resort feel with all the bells and whistles, including many campgrounds with rental rvs, cottages or cabins. our member campgrounds are throughout the state – you’ll find one that’s close to scenic hiking, challenging biking or a quiet pond for a relaxing kayak excursion. take a drive on vermont’s byways to visit our covered bridges, waterfalls and quintessential new england towns. the small state of vermont boasts a rich and rewarding historical heritage. today, that history is well preserved in an exceptional collection of state historic sites spanning the length of the state. ranging from prehistoric encampments, to pivotal revolutionary war sites, to the homesteads of u.s. presidents, vermont’s historic sites chronicle the development of a state, its people, and the nation around it. join us for a weekend, a week or the whole summer.
