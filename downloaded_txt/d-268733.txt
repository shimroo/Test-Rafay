ron swift is a remarkable resource. i do not make a significant it move without talking to ron. he helped my various businesses make the switch to open source server software, and we have been running it without a hitch for more than 8 years. ron helps business leaders do this because he loves to. 
                  he is not a paid consultant; he is a man with a mission to save people like me money and time.

i recently purchased an accounting practice which included a very outdated phone system.  
                   one of my first projects was to hire swift staffing to replace the old system with a new voip system.  
                   this was one of the best decisions i made to get ready for a busy tax season.  
                   the phone system provides great features, flexibility, and reliability.  
                   what sets swift staffing apart from the other vendors in this market, though, is their tremendous client service and responsiveness.  i could not ask for a better partner to handle this critical function.
