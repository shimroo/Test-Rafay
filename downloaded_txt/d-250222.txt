yom kippur

posted on 2024-10-09 by timothy 

“the messiah our righteousness has turned from us. we are alarmed, we have no one to justify us. our sins and the yoke of our transgressions he bore. he was bruised for our iniquities. he carried on his shoulders our sins. with his stripes we are healed. almighty god, hasten the day that he might come to us anew; that we may hear from mt. lebanon* a second time through the messiah. (“oz m’lifnai b’reshit”). **
* a figurative reference to the temple.
** from services for the day of atonement, hebrew publishing co., 1928.

where’s the blood?

posted on 2024-09-20 by timothy 


some time ago i was holding gospel meetings in san francisco and several times addressed the jews attending a mission to israel. on one occasion, having concluded my discourse, the meeting was thrown open for discussion with any hebrew who desired to
 

ask questions or state difficulties and also for any who had been brought to yeshua to relate their coming to faith in him.
the experience of one old jew interested me greatly and as nearly as i can give his remarks in his own words were:
“this is passover week among you, my jewish brethern, ans as i sat here i was thinking how you will be observing it. you will have put away all leaven from your houses; you will eat the matzoth and the roasted lamb. you will attend the synagogue services and carry out the ritual and directions of the talmud; but you forget, my brethren, that you have everything but that which adonai required first of all. he did not say, ‘when i see the leaven put away, or when i see you eat the matzoth, or the lamb, or go to the synagogue’; but his word was, ‘when i see the blood, i will pass over you.’ ah, my brethren, you can substitute nothing for this. you must have blood, blood, blood!”
“blood!” that is an awful word for one who reveres that ancient oracle, and yet has no sacrifice. turn where he will in the book, the blood meets him, but let him seek as he may, he cannot find it in the judaism of the present.
after a moment’s pause, the patriarchal man went on somewhat as follows:
“i was born in palestine, nearly seventy years ago. as a child i was taught to read the law, the psalms, and the prophets. i early attended the synagogue and learned hebrew from the rabbis. at first i believed what i was told, that ours was the true and only religion, but as i grew older and studied the law more intently, i was struck by the place the blood had in all the ceremonies outlined there, and equally struck by its utter absence in the ritual to which i was brought up.”
again and again i read exodus 12, and leviticus 16 and 17, and the latter chapters especially made me tremble, as i thought of the great day of atonement and the place the blood had there. day and night one verse would ring in my ears. ‘it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul!’ i knew i confessed my need of it; but it was to be made by blood and there was no blood!”
“in my distress, at last, i opened my heart to a learned and venerable rabbi. he told me that god was angry with his people. jerusalem was in the hands of gentiles, the temple was destroyed, and a mohammedan mosgue was reared up in its place. the only spot on earth where we dare shed the blood of sacrifice in accordance with deuteronomy 12 and leviticus 17, was descecrated, and our nation was scattered. that was why there was no blood. god had himself closed the way to carry out the solemn service of the great day of atonement. he said that now we must turn to the talmud and rest on its instruction, and trust in the mercy of god and the merits of the fathers.”
” i tried to be satisfied, but could not. something seemed to say that the law was unaltered, even though our temple was destroyed. nothing else but blood could atone for the soul. we dared not shed blood for the atonement elsewhere than in the place the lord had chosen. then we were left without an atonement at all!”
“this thought filled me with horror. in my distress i consulted many rabbis. i had but one great question, where can i find the blood of atonement?”
“i was over thirty years of age when i left palestine and came to constantinople, with my still unanswered question ever before my mind, and my soul was exceedingly troubled about my sins.”
“one night i was walking down one of the narrow streets of that city, when i saw a sign telling of a meeting for jews. curiosity led me to open the door and go in. just as i took a seat i heard a man say, ‘the blood of yeshua his son cleanseth us from all sin.’ it was my first introduction to christianity, but i listened breathlessly as the speaker told how god had declared that ‘without shedding of blood is no remission,’ but that he had given his only begotten son, the lamb of god, to die, and all who trusted in his blood were forgiven all their iniquities. this was the messiah of isaiah 53; this was the sufferer of psalms. ah, my brethren, i had found the blood of atonement at last. i trusted it, and now i love to read the new testament and see how all the shadows of the law are fulfilled in yeshua. his blood has been shed for sinners. it has satisfied god, and it is the only means of salvation for either jew or gentile.”
have you found the blood of atonement?
“behold the lamb of god, which taketh away the sin of the world’ (john 1:29). are you trusting in god’s smitten lamb-the sacrifice of god?

in the beginning was the word

posted on 2024-09-09 by timothy 

1 in the beginning was the word, and the word was with god, and the word was god.
2 he was with god in the beginning.
3 all things came to be through him, and without him nothing made had being.
4 in him was life, and the life was the light of mankind.
5 ¶ the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not suppressed it.
14 the word became a human being and lived with us, and we saw his sh’khinah, the sh’khinah of the father’s only son, full of grace and truth.
john 1:1-5, 14

mashiach
he was,
he is,
and
he is to come
the time is very close to the end of the age.
be careful and watch the events happening on this earth.
the signs are there.
i pray for you my brothers, that your eyes and ears would be opened
opened to g-d’s truth, seek and you will find,
ask and he will reveal his truth to you.
o israel hear this
one sin is all it takes to create an infinite distance between you and g-d.
without g-d’s salvation there is no way for any person to bridge that infinite distance.
because of our guilt we cannot save ourselves.
you have everything that g-d has provided, except one thing and that one thing is not possible to have under judaism since there is no temple, there is no altar, therefore there is no blood to cover sin. god said “when i see the blood, i will pass over you”.
leviticus 17:11 says “for the soul of the flesh is in the blood; and i have assigned it for you upon the altar to provide atonement for your souls; for it is the blood that atones for the soul”. tanach – stone edition
without the blood the wages of sin is death for the law was given to show what sin is. with the written word comes death for it is impossible for sinful men to keep every law. but, the spirit gives life.
god has provided that blood, the blood of mashiach yeshua whose blood was shed on the cross to atone for sin once and for all for those who confess they are sinners,  who ask for forgiveness and accept mashiach yeshua as their messiah. for it is his blood that was shed for atonement.
for it is said in the brit chadasha: 
6 ¶ he has even made us competent to be workers serving a new covenant, the essence of which is not a written text but the spirit. for the written text brings death, but the spirit gives life.
7 now if that which worked death, by means of a written text engraved on stone tablets, came with glory – such glory that the people of isra’el could not stand to look at moshe’s face because of its brightness, even though that brightness was already fading away — 
8 won’t the working of the spirit be accompanied by even greater glory?
9 for if there was glory in what worked to declare people guilty, how much more must the glory abound in what works to declare people innocent!
10 in fact, by comparison with this greater glory, what was made glorious before has no glory now.
11 for if there was glory in what faded away, how much more glory must there be in what lasts.
12 ¶ therefore, with a hope like this, we are very open –
13 unlike moshe, who put a veil over his face, so that the people of isra’el would not see the fading brightness come to an end.
14 what is more, their minds were made stonelike; for to this day the same veil remains over them when they read the old covenant; it has not been unveiled, because only by the messiah is the veil taken away.
15 yes, till today, whenever moshe is read, a veil lies over their heart.
16 “but,” says the torah, “whenever someone turns to adonai, the veil is taken away.”
17 now, “adonai”in this text means the spirit. and where the spirit of adonai is, there is freedom. complete jewish bible (cjb)

did you know hashem will seal a new covenant?

posted on 2024-09-09 by timothy 


in the tanakh
in jeremiah
chapter 31
verse 30
hashem
says
he will seal a new covenant with israel

(30) behold, days are coming – the word of hashem – when i will seal a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah:
(31) not like the covenant that i sealed with their forefathers on the day that i took hold of their hand to take them out of the land of egypt, for they abrogated my covenant, although i became their master – the word of hashem.
(32) for this is the covenant that i shall seal with the house of israel after those days – the word of hashem – i will place my torah within them and i will write it onto their heart; i will be a god for them and they will be a people for me.
(33) they will no longer teach – each man his fellow, each man his brother – saying, ‘know hashem!’ for all of them will know me, from their smallest to their greatest – the word of hashem – when i will forgive their iniquity and will no longer recall their sin.

yom kippur

posted on 2024-09-09 by timothy 


this yom kippur will you find peace in your soul?
rabbi jochanan ben zaccai’s dying words:

“when rabban jochanan ben zaccai now lay languishing, his scholars came to visit him: whom he seeing  began to weep. to whom they said, ‘o thou light of israel, thou right-hand pillar, thou strong hammer, whence are those tears?’ to whom he replied, ‘if men were about to carry me before a king of flesh and  blood, who to-day is here, and tomorrow is in his grave, — if he were angry with me, his anger is not  everlasting; if he should  cast be into bonds, his bond are not eternal; if he should kill me,  his killing would not be eternal: and i might perhaps pacify him with words, or soften him with a gift. but they are ready to lead  me before the king of kings, the lord, holy and blessed, who lives and lasts for ever, and for ever and ever; who if he be angry  with me, his anger is eternal; if he bind me, his bond is eternal; if he kill me, his killing is eternal; and whom i cannot either appease with words, or soften with a gift. and moreover, there are two ways before me, one to paradise, another to hell; and i know which way not they will lead me. should i  not  weep? (berakhot, fol. 28b)
if this great man of judiasm did not know where he was to be lead at his death, what are we to do?
if you think there’s two covenants, one for jews one for gentiles think again. there is only one covenant. it’s the same for jews and gentiles alike. you sin once and that’s it. no hope but separation from god. there is no atonement except by the blood on the altar and the altar does not exist since there is no temple. because of the sin in everyone’s life there is an infinite separation between you and god. only the mashiach (yeshua) can bridge that separation since he shed his blood for the atonement of sin. your part is to confess you are a sinner before god, ask for forgiveness, recognize that yeshua paid for your sins by his blood. this is the only point when god will cast your sins into the sea of forgetfulness and remember them no more. where will you spend eternity? your choice, good works can never erase our sins. only mashiach yeshua paid for sin by his blood. salvation is by faith alone lest any man should boast.
in jeremiah 31:30 god says he will seal a new covenant with the house of israel
where will you spend eternity? 
your choice, good works can never erase our sins. 
only mashiach yeshua paid for sin by his blood. 
salvation is by faith alone lest any man should boast.
the faith in mashiach yeshua who alone atoned for sin.
