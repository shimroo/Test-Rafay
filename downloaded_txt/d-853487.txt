    public participation plan update


 april 19, 2021

one of the requirements of an mpo is to maintain a public participation plan that is updated every 3 years.  we have recently updated this document and a draft will be available for public comment.                                                        the public comment period will begin monday, april 19, 2021 and ends on wednesday, june 2, 2021 at 4:00 pm. the public hearing will be held on wednesday, june 2nd from 4:00 pm to 4:30 pm via www.gotomeeting.com. the meeting access code is 369-736-973. attendees may also access the meeting via phone at (312) 757-3121.                                                              questions and public input regarding these documents will be duly noted and included in the appendix of the final documents. the hearing will be held by electronic means only and no persons will be physically present. if any member of the public wishes to attend the meeting electronically, the meeting will be available using the information above.                                                              the public participation plan is available for public review online at                       www.heartlandmpo.org                      from a link on the home page. hard copies of this document may also be requested formally in writing to david benefiel, 739 main street, anderson, indiana 46016 prior to may 3, 2021. oral or written comments and suggestions regarding this document may be submitted to the anderson mpo through wednesday, june 2nd until 4:00 pm.  submissions may also be sent to david benefiel, principal transportation planner at dave@heartlandmpo.org or by phone at (765) 640-4201.                                                                persons with disabilities or non-english speaking persons who wish to attend the public hearing and need assistance should contact david benefiel at least 48 hours prior to the hearing at (765) 640-4201 between 8:00 am and 4:00 pm, monday through friday.  every effort will be made to make reasonable accommodations for these persons.                                                              it is the intent of the anderson mpo to formally approve the public participation plan at its regular policy board meeting on june 3, 2021 with the caveat that no additional public comment is received by the june 2, 2021 deadline that would require significant changes or amendments to the document.
