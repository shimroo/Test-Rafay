this is where the leary firefighters foundation steps in.
we help these heroes by building state-of-the-art training facilities, buying cutting-edge vehicles and supplying modern technology and tools to firehouses and departments across the country.
such equipment not only saves the lives  of these brave men and women but increases the odds that they can save ours.
