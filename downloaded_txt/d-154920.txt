produce wash guide
organic farmers are required to grow their crops without the use of synthetic agrochemicals, protecting you from the health risks associated with chemical pesticide residues found on conventional fruits and vegetables. however, when organic options are unavailable, you can still reduce pesticide exposure by using household remedies to wash your fruits and vegetables.
check our guide for the most effective treatments in removing pesticides from various fruits and vegetables. all the information is derived from peer-reviewed research, with links provided for further reference.
