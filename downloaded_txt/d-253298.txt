annunciation
                      - 
                    march 25
a tradition, which has come down from the apostolic ages, tells us that the great mystery of the incarnation was achieved on the twenty-fifth day of march. it was at the hour of midnight, when the most holy virgin was alone and absorbed in prayer, that the archangel gabriel appeared before her, and asked her, in the name of the blessed trinity, to consent to become the mother of god. let us assist, in spirit, at this wonderful interview between the angel and the virgin: and, at the same time, let us think of that other interview which took place between eve and the serpent. a holy bishop and martyr of the second century, saint irenaeus, who had received the tradition from the very disciples of the apostles, shows us that nazareth is the counterpart of eden. . . . . . more
 
st. anselm
                      - 
                    april 21
st. anselm (1033-1109) was born in aosta, italy, and died in canterbuy, england. st. anselm's services to the church are principally the following: first, as archbishop of canterbury he defended the rights and liberties of the church against the encroachments of the english kings, who plundered the church's lands, impeded the archbishop's communications with the holy see, and claimed the right to invest prelates with ring and crosier, symbols of the church's spiritual jurisdiction. second, as a philosopher and theologian he developed a method of reasoning which prepared the way for the great thinkers of the middle ages. . . . . . more
