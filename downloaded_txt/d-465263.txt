introducing isp management
endless journey is pleased to announce that we have reached a tentative agreement with isp management of alma, michigan - to reintroduce services to the existing coverage area. isp management is moving at a very rapid pace to ensure that our customers will soon have an internet connection restored.
isp managment has been in business for nearly 25 years and is currently servicing over 25 communities - including gladwin since 2003. we are pleased to have isp management stepping in to take care of our customers, employees, and the community.  while this transition will have its bumps - we are confident that isp management has the best interest of all, at heart.  while endless journey continues to close its own doors, we are doing everything possible to assist in this being a smooth transition for all.
our combined goal is to have network services restored in the next 24-48 hours for all current customers, that have accounts in good standing.  this service will be available free of charge for a period of (7) days. during that time customers will be able to contact isp management, discuss pricing and package options, and decide whether or not they wish to sign on as a paying customer for future service(s).
email accounts are still active, and full intentions are had to keep this service available for the foreseeable future. further information regarding email services will be made available, as it is available to us.
billing and service credits matters are being addressed. we here at endless journey would like to reassure all of our prepaid customers that we have not forgotten you. once more information is in place - you will be notified.
again, we are excited to see isp management come into our community, and we trust that all will be in the best of hands!
questions can be directed to the current endless journey phone number regarding the potential transition with isp management at (989) 426-3610, phones will be manned during normal business hours. we will do our best to answer your questions as they come, as information is available to us.
by combining the efforts isp management and endless journey, isp management¿s goal is to provide services to this community that previously and separately could not have been possible.
