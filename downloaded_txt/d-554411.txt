weft history and info


you can read a short version of  weft's history here
interestingly back in 1937 the upstairs of weft's building 113 1/2 and dave monk's building 115 1/2 were a gambling establishment, the turf club aka klemick's. thanks to the urbana free library archives, here's a story about champaign's gambling hotspots, the turf club was part of north market street's gamblers row
joe lex, was one of weft's founders (and partly repsonsible for some of those vinyl records we have stored up in our attic). he recently dug up this little bit of weft history. here's an early vision of what our programming would be, joe lex - weft's 1981 programming vision
