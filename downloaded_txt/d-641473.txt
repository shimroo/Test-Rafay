ok, 
        next, it's time for some refreshments. the pretzels are the greatest at 
        jojo's and 
        you might as well sit down and have a coke. 
        we want you shopping, shopping, but certainly not dropping!
before

        cupboard. the flavorful spreads, coffees, jams, well, 
        everything is mouthwatering. take something different home with you.
you 
        are staying overnight aren't you? of course, so get in touch with the
