pinoy migrant's news





polluted bulacan river needs p1.9b for rehaba total of p1.9 billion will be needed for a major rehabilitation project of the bulacan river, according to the department of public works and highways (dpwh) in central luzon.the project will include dredging the river and the marilao-meycauayan-obanso river system (mmors) that spans at least 43 kilometers.it will also help improve a 30-kilometer dike to help relocate informal settlers along the river.the dpwh made the proposal amid calls by bulacan governor wilhelmino alvarado seeking assistance in rehabilitating the bulacan river.the heavily silted river is among the 30 most polluted rivers in the world listed by new-york based environmental watchdog blacksmith institute.alvarado stressed the urgency to rehabilitate the heavily-polluted and silted bulacan river as it flows directly to manila bay. a sanitary landfill would be needed to properly handle the dredged materials.heavy metals such as mercury, lead, and arsenic, are being dumped into the river by numerous industrial plants along its banks.“this project needs a strong political will to succeed. we also need to put everything in due process, make public consultation and proper information dissemination particularly in the matter of relocating the settlers within the riverbanks,” alvarado said.

filipinos rock the house in nicosia





valentines day is a very special day to all the men, women and lovers all over the world and filipinos in cyprus are no different.a group of very talented filipinos, the "filipino hatid saya" (kapisanan ng mga mang-aawit na filipino in cyprus) as they are affectionately called, presented a very special show to celebrate valentines day for fellow filipinos and their friends and families. the show took place on sunday the 18th of february 2007 at the magic palace in nicosia, cyprus. the theme of the show was appropriately named "give love on valentines day with ricky & friends".doors were open from one o’clock in the afternoon, and by two o’clock the room was nearly full. as in every show, we can not avoid those small mishaps that always happened no matter how good the preparation is! some technical problems with the sound system were encountered just before the show started. you could feel the anxiety and tension building up from the entertainers and the audience was eagerly awaiting the opening of the show. it eventually started at two thirty, only half an hour late and that’s not bad at all for filipino time!the show was highlighted with the opening prayer of fr. zacheus dulniok, ofm, of the holy cross catholic church in nicosia, who especially prayed for all filipinos to unite and to always give love to each other.a very lively duet performed by wilma dayrit and stella toreon with the hit "flashdance", followed by a rendition of "living la vida loca" by ricky berbenzana with all the dancers accompanying the songs opened the show. each singer performed a solo and a duet of popular songs, and the audience showed lots of gratitude towards the choices of songs.the filipino hatid saya group made everyone want to dance and join in with the performers whilst they sang their songs. it was a lot of fun and made the mood very jovial, as they proved their ability to sing with their powerful and angelic voices that made everyone in the audience admire them affectionately as they shouted out loud with appreciation.the event organizer, the cypro–philippine association, led by mrs. ester beatty, enthusiastically acknowledged all those who attended the show, most especially those familiar faces that had not been seen during recent filipino community events.with her message, she hopes that the event will be the beginning of a continuous unity among filipinos, and that it will encourage them to support each other. she said, "walang ibang magtutulungan kung ‘di tayo rin kapwa pilipino". she encourages everyone to show their support to the newly formed entertainer’s group "filipino hatid saya" for their binding artistic talents and skills in acting, dancing and singing. she also appreciated the help of the parents of those children who had participated in the show by helping cultivate their children’s talents. in particular, she asked all parents to continue helping their children develop their talents because one day they might become the next regine velasquez! the association is more than willing to help the new group develop and to show their talents to the public. "let’s bring unity among others, get united and be of great help to each other", she ended. the show was widely supported and attended by filipinos and foreign friends from nicosia and limassol.the organisers would like to thank western union and g.a.p. vassilopoulos worldwide removals (cargo) for their generosity as the main sponsors of the event. we would also like to thank mr. torossian hampig of elita boutique, peacock department store, mrs. luzviminda socratous, maya of carla’s karaoke, wilma of philcy, sylvia of linda’s salon, mr. kypros charalambous and mr. stuart beatty for their technical assistance during the show. big thank you also to the support staff: emily (dj), bhaby avancena (dvd operator), scarlet tugbo, airish maalindog and nora dante. a warm and heartfelt appreciation to the committee members of the association for always ready to help and without them it would have been difficult to organise such events: ester beatty, venny mccullie, cora hammoud, linda kourtollous, joan anotniou, lina dapat & helen patsalides.the show was headed by mr. ricky berbenzana and was supported by the following singers: ms. stella toreo, mrs. wilma dayrit, ms. jenny antolin, miss crisanta endozo, mr. henny orong, miss marie sumlay, miss thea manalang and miss katerina socratous. the dancers were: the limassol dollies (dolly repuno, jenalyn serrona, mailyn bano, nhorie joy elio & arlyn pontilla); the x-10 of nicosia (mel roa, grace roa, kim avancena, analiza avancena & dina ison) and vincent "tets" georgiou from limassol. also performing especially for the shows were remy glorioso and arnel & co. annabel kalatha, a member of the group was not able to perform in the show due to some personal reasons.when the last song "pinoy ako" had been sung, the audience joined ricky and stella on stage to celebrate the success of the show. for at least an hour after the show had finished the stage was crammed with people dancing to the music, whilst several people belted out the songs on karaoke. due to the success of the show, plans have been made to try and host a similar event in limassol next month. mabuhay ang filipino!carmen dolores b. brazan-llauderes & cathrine beatty
