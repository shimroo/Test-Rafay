today i had the day off and i'm trying to save some dough for my mexico trip coming up in a couple weeks, so i made some lunch at my apartment.  it was a big lunch consisting of farfalle pasta with newman's own tomato and basil bombolina, garlic toast, and a spinach salad with avo and cherry tomatoes.  i make my own dressing these days which is far superior to anything else on the market, and i say that with the utmost humility.  perhaps someday i can reveal the recipe, but that will have to wait until i patent it.

i just went to rue cler and the the woman in the bakery convinced me to buy a cookie.  the dim lighting in there didn't allow me to see how burnt the cookie was.  all i can taste is the burnt cookie.  i can't even taste the chocolate chips.but the diet coke taste great!burp!!!!!!

post 666!i took the staff out for a holiday lunch, and i had an open faced portabella/blue cheese sandwich (sans the bread) with a side salad.  a sign i felt like it was a special occasion: i ordered coffee after the meal.

in highschool my friend scott and i used to go to this fancy-ish (fake fancy really)restaurant very much favoured by old people.  i still think this restaurant is terrific.scott is in town so we went there for lunch.   they changed the format of their rolls, and now they're cheddar herb biscuits.  we both had the cobb salad.   i always get the cobb salad.  i intended to branch out but i just love that damn thing.

today was two satisfying trips to the buffet at baba gannouj.  love me some gyro kebob floating on a sea of hummus. yesterday i tried to order only two tacos because i had a pork chop and sausage gravy buscuit for breakfast.  sadly they brought out the wrong type of taco initially so i ended up with four.  i was able to give one away.

today i went with my friend mary allison to this new mexican place.  it's really filling the gap that don pablo's left.  meaning it's gross in an appealing way.  i had the taco salad and ordered queso.  which was akin to a pile of cream of chicken soup sort of.  it was quite sick.  in a good way.

today is the same leftovers of rice/stir fry, but there aren't that many veggies left.  today's cantaloupe has cayenne pepper and lime juice on it, which is kind of fake-y locopops flavoring.  and salt and malt vinegar potato chips.  i'm pre-eating before i have to go to a lunch meeting where i can't eat anything.
