composite decking fitters 















 







composite decking has become a popular choice in scotland due to its durability, sustainability, and low maintenance, making it ideal for the country’s challenging weather conditions. unlike traditional wood decking, composite boards are made from a blend of recycled wood fibers and plastics, offering superior resistance to moisture, rot, and insects. this is particularly beneficial in scotland, where heavy rainfall and damp climates can quickly degrade natural wood.one of the main advantages of composite decking is its long-lasting appeal. it does not warp, crack, or splinter, ensuring a safe and visually appealing surface for years. additionally, it requires minimal upkeep. a simple clean with soap and water is enough to maintain its appearance, eliminating the need for regular staining or sealing, which can be time-consuming and costly. 















timber decking fitters 















timber decking remains a popular choice in scotland, offering a natural, rustic charm that complements outdoor spaces. made from various wood types like softwood or hardwood, it provides versatility in design and is widely accessible. however, scotland’s wet and humid climate requires proper care, as untreated timber is prone to rot, warping, and insect damage. regular maintenance, including sealing and staining, ensures durability and preserves its appearance. when sustainably sourced, timber decking is an eco-friendly option, blending seamlessly into gardens and landscapes. with proper care, it creates a warm, inviting area for outdoor activities, enhancing the beauty of any property.
