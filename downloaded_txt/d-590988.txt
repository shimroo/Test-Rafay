this great-looking boy is jiggs from our 2021 
								dagmar-journey "roadtrip" litter (he was trip)! 
								a beloved family member, jiggs shares his life 
								with autaum & ryan, and their three adorable 
								young daughters, in nova scotia!



 











								beware!
beware of backyard breeders selling unregistered shiloh shepherds, from 
								parents who have not been health tested and who 
								are not registered as breedable, 
								"just for pets." there are many unscrupulous people out there who 
								care nothing about improving this breed, or 
								maintaining health and temperament, and only 
								want to make money. when considering a puppy, don't hesitate to ask the breeder for 
								copies of health clearances, dna, and 
								registration paperwork for the sire and dam. it is your right to be provided with this 
								information!


we are the only shiloh shepherd breeders on prince edward island!
