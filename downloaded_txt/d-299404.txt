welcome








who we arewe are childbirth educators, doulas, midwives, health providers, body workers, therapists, lactation consultants, mothers and fathers.what we do hudson valley birth network, a nonprofit membership organization, believes that birth is a normal, natural event for most people. we provide the public and professionals with evidence-based information about pregnancy, birth, and parenthood. we help families make the decisions that are best for them in order to give birth safely and joyously, and we ensure they have access to support as new parents. we offer comprehensive seminars, workshops and referral services in addition to our regular membership meetings. hvbn is a membership network only and not responsible for the opinions, practice, or health care services provided by individuals listed on this site. we suggest that clients do their own research to confirm that a provider’s beliefs and practices are consistent with their own.
