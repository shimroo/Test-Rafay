why choose bk barrit? 



















elegant style at fair pricesyou work so hard creating stunning spaces for your clients, with painstaking attention to every single detail.

as you design your hotel or restaurant, or hunt down the perfect chair for your client’s needs, you pride yourself on always finding the right fit for your design intent.

but what about your bottom line? why can’t you apply the same kind of creativity and flexibility to your furniture costs so that your design intent also saves you or your client every dollar possible?

that’s where we come in. at, we bring your design intent to life with massive flexibility for your budget, your timelines, and your design.

 



our process 










 
we capture all the details of your seating project, including your quantity, style, specifications, design intent, budget, and timeline, to ensure that we fully capture your exact vision.



 
we pull 5 to 50 options (or more) from our curated collection of custom projects that match your design intent and budget, and together we create your final bespoke seating solution.



 
we send you a comprehensive quote – including both budget and timeline – along with a sample if needed.



 
we custom-build and deliver your seating – on time, on-budget, and customized to your design!
