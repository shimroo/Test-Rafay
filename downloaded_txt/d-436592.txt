priority waters are rivers and streams across america where trout unlimited is focusing our energies to care for and recover wild and native trout and salmon watersheds.
rooted in science and developed in collaboration with tu volunteers and trusted partners, our shared tu priority waters are the foundation of a strategic roadmap to protect, restore and reconnect waters, so future generations can experience the joy of wild and native trout and salmon.
together, we can rise to the moment.
