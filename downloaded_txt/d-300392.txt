who is celebraterecovery for? 



 



celebrate recovery is for everyone!no one should have to face their pain alone.we are a grace-filled community of strugglers who courageously enter this safe and beautiful space to get honest about our pain, and the negative ways we may see ourselves, god, and others. in this process, we come to accept that some of the habits we have developed to escape our pain may have hurt us and those close to us. it is a biblically based approach to help us achieve long lasting recovery by healing our hurts, guiding us toward new healthy truths, and developing life-giving habits.
