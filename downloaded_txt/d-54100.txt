 parent alert:
school fails to defend use of 
    prentice hall textbook indoctrinating your children to islam. 
    different textbook, same attempts. houghton mifflin began with clinton, 
    notice while president bush was in office and with god's blessing, it was 
    effectively put down. now with obama and holder, what will happen? is our 
    government going to continue pushing islam on our children again?

president obama, governor jerry brown, 
    please do something about the lies and bias in our public school textbooks:


video: high school textbooks biased against 
    israel
    "across the centuries" 
    7th grade textbook

"a message of ancient days"
    6th grade textbook
     
 
 
gun 
    rights: when do we pick up arms and fight?
 
 
tell us 
    your story
    if you feel that your child is being indoctrinated in public school, contact 
    us. we will contact your school to confirm details without you or your 
    child's name disclosed. if need be, we will draw attention on a national 
    level to what is happening at your school. if that doesn't help, we can 
    assist in finding legal counsel. there are organizations that will help free 
    of charge depending on the facts, but at the legal level you will have to 
    decide if you are willing to go public. 

    blessedcause is here to help. no one should feel like their child is held 
    hostage to suffer retribution if they complain about the curriculum or 
    activities in their school. no one wants your child to shoulder the cause. 
    our children need protection from indoctrination and from retribution. call 
    us. we can help, keep you anonymous and we won't ask or accept a donation. 
    this is not about money for us, it's about protecting our kids and our 
    religious freedom.  
 
 
the sign of jonah, a sign that you would know god's message is today



how clinton sold our children to islam
    expanded with footnotes
 
 

islam forced on our kids in public school:  

little samantha, a 7th grader  in byron county didn't 
    want to "become muslim," fast for ramadan or memorize by heart the following 
    prayer to allah:
 
 
 "in the name of allah, the compassionate, the merciful. 
    praise be to allah, lord of creation, the compassionate, the merciful, king 
    of judgment day! you alone we worship, and to you alone we pray for help, 
    guide us to the straight path."
 
 
 samantha's  mom wrote her a note to "opt out" of the 7th 
    grade islam course. when samantha handed her teacher the note, the teacher 
    became angry, held up the note and shouted at the class, "is there anyone 
    else!?"
