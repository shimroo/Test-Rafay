the dotcom crash of 2000



upon observing multiple clients crash during the dotcom crash of 2000, the company sagely decided to shift marketing focus away from the high tech market and focus solely on our plastics industry niche in both publishing and agency services.

overview - concept - philosophy



the state of ‘plastics industry’ marketing



let’s face it. in general, the plastics industry lags behind other industries in marketing sophistication. slow to embrace the internet, mainly due to print media bias, we will probably be the last industry to sell obsolete ad banners.















our philosophy was derived... elsewhere



we studied the best marketing philosophies of other industries and were inspired to derive our unique variation of what we learned elsewhere.















the length of the campaign



studies show that the most effective marketing campaigns were the longest ones. hence we only offer annual programs. no monthly or quarterly programs.















a successful campaign must be multichannel



what this means is that the program must be in adequate placements to be seen, to be remembered. so in our plasticsedge™ web component, as an example,placement includes white papers, forums, events, blogs, press releases, etc.















a successful campaign must be cross-media



overlapping, to us, means that the campaign is not just an ad banner, or an email. it’s a year long campaign incorporating concurrent overlapping and comprehensive campaigns of web, email and social media.















hence, the plasticsedge™ was created



no one in the plastics industry sells anything like the plasticsedge™ and never will be able to because our programs utilize the unique and extreme seo (search engine optimization) ability of the one and only gtld, (generic top level domain) to the vast plastics industry; plastics.com


























lead generation by plastics.com



the plastics edge

plasticsedge™ white paper faq







            min and max sizes?
          









2000 words is the minimum optimum for seo but we’ve had great success with 500 word papers.2000 words is approximately a five page word document. 500 words would typically be a one page word doc.








            can we write the white papers?
          









of course, we have several expert technical writers, but there is a fee for that. ask us!








            can we tweak a draft white paper?
          









yes, we can help ‘neutralize’ a sales style paper and we can help tweak a draft, no charge.








            can we help with the keywords?
          









yes, we have strong expertise in doing so and are happy to assist you in keyword research.































seo’d web content marketing - 1st of 3 yearlong campaigns



based on multiple neutral white papers



you provide neutrally written white papers for us to publish on plastics.com. multiple papers over time from ‘one per quarter’ to ‘one per month’. these papers are about your key technologies, case studies, market info, etc. the plasticsedge™ does not charge ‘per white paper’. add as many as allowed. and best, each white paper provides roughly the same amount of leads, so 2 white papers produces twice as much as one, four; four times as much!















seo’d to your keywords, key phrases



our seo team works with you to develop and assign primary and secondary keywords to each paper. as the paper is published we will then seo the paper to your approved keywords to attract quality leads















branding



most of the header and all of the right side column are branding for your firm. we’ll design it for you, work with your marketing staff or simply take what you provide. it’s up to you. the branding column can include anything that a website can; html, video, forms, animated ‘calls to action’, contact info, product info, and so on.















content marketing on steroids - your branded plastics.com white paper begins to rank on google



next, the page will begin to rank for keywords. your white paper will be seen on google by people searching for your exact keywords. usually about two thirds of the leads come directly via google seaches for your keyword















double filteration for quality



many lead gen programs end up using traffic manipulations to send you traffic, but it’s mostly garbage traffic! the plasticsedge™ program performs filtration on your traffic... twice! first, people find you predominantly through google searches for your exact terms. hence they are interested in what you do. secondly, as they arrive at your white paper, they see in the branding an obvious supplier of that product or service. so if they ‘click through’ knowing they are going to a supplier, they have become even more so ‘qualified’.















more plastics.com placements



in addition to the white paper placements, you receive a premium position on plastics.com’s google leading plastic directory. additionally, you can receive sponsorship placement in our industry discussion forums, the industry’s most heavily trafficed plastics forums.


























plasticsedge™ email faq







            do you segment your list?
          









no! segmentation is essentially an invention of marketeers to charge you more for sending less. our members can opt-out any time they’d like, and our perspective to you is that you are getting your entire segment and you are branding to everyone else!








            do we then end up paying more?
          









no! based on typical industry rates for email list rentals from media firms, most charge roughly $100 - $200 per thousand emails to send one email! at our current list size that would be $3,000 to $7,000 to send an email once! based on that, the plasticsedge™ email campaign alone can justify the cost of the program.































mass email component - 2nd of 3 yearlong campaigns



your rich media email is sent to over 33,000 plastics professionals



our plastics.com members agree to receive partner emails in return for free membership.members can opt-out of any email subscriptions















your design, our server



the email is not combined with other partner’s info. each contains only your message. you may provide the email to us, or we will help you craft it. the email will contain a small message to our members alerting them that this is a plastics.com partner email and we provide the required un-subscribe links.















we suggest crafting a series of messages



since the plasticsedge™ runs for a year, we suggest crafting an annual campaign with a series of messages. we cannot give you our email list but we do encourage you to have your emails to contain a ‘call to action’ to solicit our members to join ‘your’ email list, thereby growing your email list















we provide industry standard metrics reports to you



metrics include all of the expected statistics including; emails sent, opens, unique opens,open rate, link clicks, and the click-through-rate (ctr)















what will your ctr be?



we don’t have much of an idea because actual plastics.com ctrs vary quite a bit from partner to partner. and that makes sense, as our partners produce a range of goods and services that range from mainstream to quite specific and narrow niches. just try to produce quality content that will be of interest.















measurable metrics & roi



typical example stats #1) 3.7% open rate and 0.4% click-through-rate (ctr)typical example stats #2) 8.3% open rate and 0.6% click-through-rate (ctr)typical example stats #3) 4.0% open rate and 0.4% click-through-rate (ctr)plastics.com's traffic sent to client websites is much higher than the reported average rates. each campaign's results vary. campaigns typically have lower results than your in-house list, as the plastics.com members did not individually signup for your particular emails, just in a general way

social media component - 3rd of 3 yearlong campaignsthe social media rantfor most companies the amount of leads that can be collected is minimal and the value of the effort to do so is often questioned. usually, they’re right! leads from these channels is likely to be minimal.the social media secretthe value is not in the direct leads you’ll receive. the value is in the fact that social activity is a google algorithm ranking factor! period!google’s ‘socials’ factorbecause google attempts to obfuscate their algorithm ranking factors, half of the seo/social media industry isn’t even aware of the effect of social media activity on a website’s search engine rankings. virtually no marketing execs in the plastics industry are aware of this!all things being equal...if there are two competitors who are essentially equal in google’s eyes, except that one has active social channels and one does not, google will give a clear preference in rankings to the socially active website.the plastics edge™ social media campaignfirst we audit your social media strategy and help fill in the blanks, if needed. we will help ensure you are maximizing your social strategy with the minimum amount of work. we then provide you with our proprietary social broadcasting techniques, designed for maximum effectiveness with a minimal effort.the plastics edge™ likes, shares, favorites, subscribes, connects and endorses every social broadcast you makegoogle monitors what sites (like ours) are reacting to your social activity and then provides domain authority strength back to your website. and the stronger the reacting site (in age, size, gtld status, traffic, etc) like plastics.com, the stronger the effect on your website’s search ranks across the board!our training, your broadcasting and our reacting cause your websites rankings & traffic to rise!

conclusion - let’s wrap it up!



plastics.com – the domain name itself provides unique benefits



the following factors, especially by combining synergistically, provides multiple unique benefits to you:• plastics.com is the oldest plastics website, large, heavily trafficked and updated constantly• plastics.com is the industry’s only gtld (generic top level domain)• plastics.com has earned tremendous google trust by decades of clean interactionthese factors allow plastics.com to dominate google more than any plastics site in the world















the plasticsedge™ – unique upon unique upon unique upon unique...



• the most experienced web team in the world producing your web content & branding on plastics.com• the most experienced seo team in the world attracting direct google searchers of your keywords• the highest google ranking plastics site in the world (over 100 № 1 google ranks) put to work for you















leads come from plastics.com and direct google searches



• unlike any other lead program, our seo’ing of your keywords to your branding on plastics.com will result in your getting more leads from us via google than from our own impressive membership!• plastics.com typically becomes the #1 or #2 top referrer of traffic to your website















the highest value lead generation program in the industry



due to our double filtration of traffic, based on your keywords, visitors sent to your website have first chosen to search for exactly what you do (via your keywords). and then, a second filtration occurs as those viewers consciously choose to click-through to a website (yours) of a vendor providing that service.















measurable roi and we’re easy to work with



we present you with scheduled reports including all standard marketing metrics, allowing an easy calculation of roi. we provide leads to many of the industry’s leading and largest companies, but we have a strong affinity for our smaller partners and believe our program acts as an equalizer for them versus the larger corporations.
