                your web server is working. now make it work for you. 💪
            

                caddy is ready to serve your site over https:
            

point your domain's a/aaaa dns records at this machine.
upload your site's files to /var/www/html.
                
                    edit your caddyfile at /etc/caddy/caddyfile:
                    
replace :80 with your domain name
change the site root to /var/www/html


reload the configuration: systemctl reload caddy
visit your site!

if that worked 🥳

                awesome! you won't have to look at this slanted page anymore.
            

                remember, caddy can do a lot more than serve static files. it's also a powerful reverse proxy and
                application platform. you can use the caddyfile to enable any other features you need. or you could use
                caddy's api to configure it programmatically.
            

                everything you need to know is either in the 📖 caddy
                    documentation or the manual for your os/platform. have fun!
            
if that didn't work 😶

                it's okay, you can fix it! first check the following things:
            

service status: systemctl status caddy
logs: journalctl --no-pager -u caddy
are your site's files readable by the caddy user and group? ls -la /var/www/html
is the caddy home directory writeable? ls -la /var/lib/caddy
ensure your domain's a and/or aaaa records point to your machine's public ip address: dig
                        example.com
are your ports 80 and 443 externally reachable, and is caddy able to bind to them? check your
                    firewalls, port forwarding, and other network configuration.


wait! before trying again, switch to let's encrypt's staging environment to
                avoid being accidentally rate limited. once you
                get everything else working, it's safe to switch back.
            

                depending on your dns provider, it may take a while for the dns records to propagate. even when
                everything is configured properly, automated challenges to obtain tls certificates usually take several
                seconds, but may take up to several minutes or hours.

                and ask it! remember to pay it forward and help others too. 😁
