death by curry














relatively most people have some idea how they would like to end their mortal existence on this planet. some would like
to go quietly in their sleep while others would prefer to 'kick the bucket' while making love. my own
personal preference though would have to be 'death by curry'. to find a curry so hot and so mean that it would
render me lifeless on the spot.

in becoming a well rounded curry eater practice is essential if you
want to eat the hotter curries like the madras, vindaloo or phall. that's why i have felt compelled to share my recipe database with you!
so someday you too will be able to experience 'death by curry'.
