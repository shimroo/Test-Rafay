amazing camera phone pixs





these are two pictures tim jackson took with his camera phone!  as we wrote about in parting shots this issue, camera phones are really taking over and becoming more and more popular.  go tim for taking amazing shots with just a phone!in an e-mail to pbase magazine he told us that the pictures are: "post-capture processing, including conversion to b&w, was done with photoshop cs2.  the camera is handy, as it's always in my pocket, but it would be more useful if it had full manual control (focus, aperture, shutter speed, iso).  but i'm not complaining!"to see all of his images click here: http://www.pbase.com/timjackson/image/73677215http://www.pbase.com/timjackson/image/71475017http://www.pbase.com/timjackson/image/71374248http://www.pbase.com/timjackson/image/71374241http://www.pbase.com/timjackson/image/68884338http://www.pbase.com/timjackson/image/68532120http://www.pbase.com/timjackson/image/68492804http://www.pbase.com/timjackson/image/68492794http://www.pbase.com/timjackson/image/70205530if you have images taken by a camera phone, send them our way (magazine@pbase.com) and we will put them on the blog.
