colorization is 
                  the art of adding color to monochromatic photos such as black 
                  and white, sepia tone, infra red [ ir ], etc. coloring of 
                  black & white photographs has been in practice for quite some 
                  time. originally, it used to be done straight on to the 
                  picture negative. with the advent of computers and graphics 
                  programs it became possible to add hues to a scanned version 
                  of a print. neuraltek pioneered a new system in 1999 called 
                  "real-life-colour", which for the first time made it possible 
                  to obtain colorized results to rival even the original color 
                  photographs. with reallifecolor technology, coloring of 
                  pictures has also become quite simple and time efficient, 
                  making the process fun to use and enjoyable.blackmagic
                  is a shareware graphics software utility based on the 
                  reallifecolor palettes. blackmagic allows one to easily 
                  convert black & white photos to real life-like color.  blackmagic is a great tool for photography 
                  hobbyists & professionals, or anyone who wishes to colorize 
                  monochromatic images...itmakes a great gift for anyone, on 
                  any occasion.

product description


blackmagic
                  is a photo coloring software for pc windows, released as shareware; it is used to 
                  colorize black & white,
                   sepia, or ir (infrared)
                  photos, or to color-correct ones with faded or inappropriate
                  colors. being extremely simple to use, its a software that
                  transcends age and professional  boundaries, providing an
                  immense sense of achievement, pride and satisfaction for kids
                  and adults alike. the resulting colorized photos have
                  optimally saturated and consistent, correct hues - giving the
                  appearance as if the photo had originally been 'shot' in
                  color! blackmagic delivers such professional grade results
                  with the minimum of fuss, and just a few minutes worth of
                  effort. blackmagic
                  incorporates "timebrush rlc [reallifecolour]"
                  standard. the timebrush rlc technology was specifically
                  created for colorizing black & white motion pictures of
                  the hollywood fame. this feature provides blackmagic the
                  ability to render superb, rich, vibrant looking colors, that
                  are not under/ over saturated, yet look completely natural.

colorizing
                  photos - the issues
colorizing
                  black & white photos can get quite involving, depending
                  upon the quality and sophistication of the results desired.
                  the process involved can be very tedious and challenging,
                  taking a day [often several] to completely colorize a single
                  black & white photograph to professional grade quality.
                  the typical 'paint' computer programs usually require the
                  operator to select individual hue [color], opacity
                  [transparency], etc., for coloring a specific portion of the
                  photo. this is further compounded by the need to 'guess' the
                  right hue/ saturation values to color a certain object, which
                  can take several hit-and-trial iterations, with no guarantee
                  of a 'best' match.
the
                  whole process may need to be repeated hundreds of times over
                  to finish a single photograph...even then, the results often
                  leave much to be desired, and rarely resemble the 'real life
                  colors' that we are used to seeing in color photographs even
                  with all the professional care and sophistication, it is
                  common to get results depicting improper color matches, over
                  saturated colors, dull/ faded colors, or over-emphasized/
                  blurred edges.

the
                  blackmagic difference
blackmagic
                  resolves all of the above problems associated with colorizing
                  black & white photos, and more. the system uses
                  state-of-the-art neural net algorithms to provide dynamic parameterisation.
                  this means that the user is not required to pick specific
                  color hues or the associated values/ parameters - she/ he
                  works by simply identifying the 'type of object' to be colored. blackmagic then automatically performs the needed
                  calculations to continuously vary all required parameters,
                  based on the content of the photograph/ region being
                  colorized - all done in the background transparent to the
                  user. this process ensures consistent as well as optimal
                  selection of hue, brightness, saturation, opacity, etc. for
                  colorizing any object/ region of the image, without the guess
                  work that would otherwise have been required.
blackmagic
                  provides several tools, to most expeditiously apply
                  reallifecolor palettes to a monochromatic image. it is
                  available in several versions, to suit every budget and need.

basically, 
                      any average home pc or laptop computer should be 
                      sufficient to run blackmagic.

                  * though blackmagic is technically supported on pc windows, 
                  some users have reported using it on mac os using a bridging 
                  software to emulate windows. if you wish to use blackmagic on 
                  a mac, the prudent thing to do is to try the free shareware 
                  version and see if it works under your emulation environment; 
                  if it does, then you can purchase a license.

blackmagic
                  faq 

general
why
                  is there only one trial version, while blackmagic is available
                  in three flavors? which program edition does the
                  trial download relate to?
the
                  blackmagic free trial download is common to all the blackmagic
                  editions. the trial lets a user test most of the professional
                  edition functionality - which automatically includes all
                  features and functions of the business and home editions of
                  the program. to compare features available in each of the
                  program editions, please consult the feature
                  comparison table.
do
                  i have to download something again after buying blackmagic?
the same program archive you downloaded (trial shareware
                  version) will be enabled (un-locked) after you enter a valid
                  license key. the license key is sent to you via e-mail once
                  your payment has been authorized. this license key
                  "knows" which program edition you purchased, and
                  will 'un-lock' the corresponding functionality. you should
                  however check the blackmagic web site for new versions/
                  updates, and if a version later than the one you downloaded
                  before is available, you could download the newer version and
                  install over your existing installation - effectively updating
                  your blackmagic license.
if
                  i previously trial'ed blackmagic and ran out the entire trial
                  period, can i re-trial a newer program version?
most
                  newer program versions (updates) re-set the trial; so the
                  answer is yes - we would definitely like you to try any new
                  features/ improvements. the only exception is if an update
                  release does not introduce much over and above the previous
                  release.
how
                  do i un-install blackmagic
unlike
                  some other programs, blackmagic does not install files all
                  over your computer, or in your system folders. hence there is
                  no need for special un-installer. to un-install, simply delete
                  the folder where you installed blackmagic (first making sure
                  to backup any personal files/ data you may have in there),
                  then delete the corresponding program group. future releases
                  may include an un-install program that does this
                  automatically.
^^top
                  of faq^^
what
                  is your policy on free updates?
effective
                  1 dec 2003: irrespective
                  of the date of your purchase, or the release/ version you buy,
                  you are entitled to free updates for a whole year from the
                  date of your purchase.
can
                  i upgrade to a higher program edition, or a higher program
                  (major) version?
absolutely.
                  for example, if you purchase the home edition, then later
                  realize that you require the functionality of the business edition, you can upgrade to the higher edition by paying the
                  price difference plus a small administration fee. similarly,
                  if you purchased version 2.5 home edition, and wish to upgrade
                  to version 3.1 home edition or business edition, you can do
                  this by paying a reasonable 'cross-upgrade' license fee. for the
                  latest upgrade/ cross-grade options, please visit the buy-now
                  section.

                  in blackmagic?

                  palettes, and operations in blackmagic.

                  is blackmagic compatible with windows vista?
