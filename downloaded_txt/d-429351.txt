about us
it's all here
since 2003, the georgetown basketball history project has brought together the names, the stories, and the memories
			  of georgetown basketball to an online audience.
in 2010, the site helped support research for "the georgetown basketball vault", which chronicled a century of basketball on the hilltop combined with numerous photos and souvenir items in each book.

the arrival

				  "thirty years ago, an 18 year old walked up to the front door of mcdonough gymnasium and went inside prior to the onset of the playoff round of the kenner summer league. in an era before the internet, before cell phones, and certainly before social media, he arrived virtually unknown."











the house that abe built
"this fall, the building now known as capital one arena celebrates its 25th anniversary ... that is exists at all is a monument to a man who would not take no for an answer, and in so doing, changed the course of the city itself."












crossing the line
"the largest catholic university south of the mason-dixon line, it consciously avoided the issue of integration while the issue was growing externally in importance and resolve across the country. athletics, a visible face of the university, reflected this approach. at one time, it was deemed acceptable. soon, it became indefensible."
