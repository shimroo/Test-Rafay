it breaks my heart to write this announcement but unfortunately due to being shut down since march 2020 with covid restrictions and having exhausted all avenues to retain our location, like many other small businesses, we have had to close our doors.

	 

i want to thank each and everyone of you that have supported us over the last nine years that i have owned this wonderful business. this business was a huge part of my life and i am forever grateful for you letting us be apart of your family celebrations, for trusting us with your children for summer camps and for you attending our events.

	 

i’m not sure what the future holds for us as we live in such a crazy world right now but you never know we may be able to celebrate with you again in a new way. maybe in your home or at an event once things settle down.  or maybe our whimsical space will be available again so you can join us in our home.

	 

if you have any comments, suggestions or questions please feel free to email us!

	 

we will miss you tons.
