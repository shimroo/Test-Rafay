why buy real? 










real wheels are "just a better wheel"
we use only 6061-t6 true aircraft structural grade aluminum in our aluminum wheels. 6061 aluminum must be two-stage heat-treated and therefore is more expensive to use and much stronger than cheaper non-heat-treatable stamping type aluminum or plastic.
we use only premium us steel in all of our steel wheels. while not always the cheapest, it has been proven stronger than the cheaper import steel.
real racing wheels are 100% made in america.














product availability 










wheels listed as in stock may not necessarily mean that we have them on hand as most wheels are custom built to order. wheels that are shown in stock show that we are able to build these wheels for you.
the typical build time for our aluminum wheels is 6-8 weeks depending on parts availability.
for a more accurate timeframe for a set of wheels that you are looking to purchase please call/email our office at 1-800-722-3847 or order@boubin.com.
