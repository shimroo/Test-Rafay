  unveiling the core principles of eviama life

explore our frequently asked questions to understand the values that guide us at eviama life. we're more than just a spa - we're an urban sanctuary committed to green wellness, holistic healing, sustainability, and fostering a diverse and inclusive space for everyone who walks through our doors.
 
     how does eviama life promote sustainability?

  




  sustainability is at the heart of our operations. we use only organic products, our electricity is locally sourced and sustainable, and our spa's construction is eco-friendly. we firmly believe in minimizing our environmental impact while offering high-quality wellness services. 



   how does eviama life ensure diversity and inclusion within its premises?

  




  at eviama life, we value diversity and inclusion. we proudly have a diverse staff and uphold a zero-tolerance policy towards any form of discrimination or disrespect. we strive to create a welcoming environment for everyone.



   what is the unique aroma that greets visitors at eviama life?

  




  the distinct aroma at eviama life comes from the organic essential oils we use, which are also embedded in our preferred dr. hauschka product line. this signature scent has evolved naturally over time, offering a welcoming olfactory experience to all our guests.



   how does eviama life contribute to the local community?

  




  we contribute to the local community by creating jobs through our reliance on local, sustainable electricity. we also host wellness, beauty, and community events to foster a sense of connection and well-being.



   how does eviama life prioritize the use of organic products?

  




  organic is the most effective. organic supports nature and our natural ability to heal. organic, pesticide-free growing practices make for healthier farmers, factory workers, and ultimately, the earth and us. whatever products we choose, whatever we come in contact with, and whatever washes off of us, impacts our health and all beings on our planet, from the most remote atoll to the bottom of the mariana trench. this is significant to us at eviama, so we eschew chemically grown and processed material.our allies in this mission include dr. hauschka skincare, oshadhi professional aromatherapy, the jojoba company, and more.
