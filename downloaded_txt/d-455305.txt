 impeach bush coalition 
 a united coalition of bloggers for the impeachment of george w. bush 







 “they have got us in a vise.”  
saturday, august 04, 2007
i am giving serious consideration to turning off the clock. up until now i have held out hope that the congress of the united states of america would finally come to its senses and impeach george w. bush for his admitted criminal violation of the foreign intelligence surveillance act (fisa). today, that hope is just about gone.i just read this, democrats feel pressure on spy program, in the new york times. the fact that the bush administration is trying to get fisa re-written to cover its prior illegal acts should be the final piece of evidence needed to indict (impeach) him. bush has been arguing since he admited violating fisa that he always had the authority to do so. if he is asking for the authority now, he didn't have it then. slam dunk, folks.instead, the house of representatives appears ready to change the law to accommodate the criminal. the unkindest cut of all is that my former representative and good friend, louise slaughter, is quoted as follows:“they have got us in a vise,” representative louise m. slaughter, democrat of new york and chairwoman of the rules committee, said as she left a saturday afternoon meeting where senior democrats were debating how to handle the issue in the final hours before recess.i don't know nancy pelosi and i had just about given up on john conyers, but louise was always someone i could count on.say it ain't so, louise!

 the emperor's new whitewash  
sunday, march 11, 2007
surprise, surprise, the administration is misusing its intelligence gathering powers.it's all over the news that the  fbi abused its authority under the patriot act. lost in all these revelations about our top law enforcers breaking the law was this item of criminal cover-up: privacy board clears u.s. spy programsremember when the president of the united states started illegally spying on americans in violation of the foreign intelligence surveillance act way back in 2001? well, this same criminal administration decided it needed to police itself, so it set up  a five-member privacy and civil liberties board in 2005. last week, the board issued its report. surprise, surprise, the illegal spying program got a clean bill of health.how does the emperor continue to get away with whitewashing his impeachable crimes? he appoints his good buddies to investigate him ... bush appointed [carol] dinkins, a republican, to chair the board. a longtime friend of the bush family, she was treasurer of bush's first campaign for governor of texas, and she is a longtime partner in the law firm of vinson & elkins, where gonzales was once a partner.  ... and, hey presto, no criminal activity here!

 from daily kos:  mcgovern says bush worse than nixon, calls for impeachment  
thursday, march 08, 2007
by quaoar if anyone should know an impeachable offense when he sees one, it should be george mcgovern, the victim of richard nixon's no-holds-barred 1972 scorched-earth campaign.thirty-five years later, an 84-year-old mcgovern sees an even bigger threat to the united states that he fought for as a decorated wwii bomber pilot -- the bush administration. cheney -- he told an interviewer for the madison, wisc., capital times -- should resign.more herelabels: george mcgovern, impeach bush, impeachment

 the clock is still running  
wednesday, february 07, 2007
the impeachable offense that george w bush admitted to 416 days ago is still on the table.james banford recently brought us up to date on the case for impeachment in bush is not above the law. he reminded us of the grounds: violation of the foreign intelligence surveillance act. then he pointed out that:the issue is not original. among the charges approved by the house judiciary committee when it recommended its articles of impeachment against president nixon was "illegal wiretaps." president nixon, the bill charged, "caused wiretaps to be placed on the telephones of 17 persons without having obtained a court order authorizing the tap, as required by federal law; in violation of sections 241, 371 and 2510-11 of the criminal code."under his program, president bush could probably be charged with wiretapping not 17 but thousands of people without having obtained a court order authorizing the taps as required by federal law, in violation of fisa.how many more days before the 110th congress puts impeachment back on the table?
