dtes local area plan – transit needs
posted in environment, transportation on march 9th, 2014

for the record, my letter to mayor and council regarding the dtes local area plan draft report.
mayor and council,
while overall the dtes local area plan looks good, the area i believe needs more attention is that of transportation – specifically transit.  there are 16 routes* spread across the three main east-west thoroughfares in the dtes, this corridor is as busy as the granville mall for transit service.

hst, good idea, bad implementation
posted in environment, politics on august 12th, 2010

the idea of a harmonized sales tax in itself is a good one.  one set of rules, one set of paperwork for business, an easier understanding for the public of what is and is not taxed.  at face value it sounds like a good thing.  however like so many things the devil is in the details.

newspapers in the digital age
posted in environment, my life, technology on february 5th, 2010

iâve canceled my vancouver province subscription; itâs something iâve wanted to do for a while as that i knew i was most certainly not getting hard hitting news by subscribing to that paper.  in addition i knew i was being somewhat of a hypocrite, subscribing to a daily newspaper that was delivered to my door every morning by car, which iâd read once then recycle, certainly not a sustainable model for those trying to green their lives.

the civic centre, is it really coming?
posted in new westminster, politics on october 23rd, 2009

where oh where shall the civic centre go?
it’s unfortunate this saga of lost opportunities, the best of course being a combination of the burr and the prior city owned cibc building next door.  these two beautiful, historic buildings side by side, what better opportunity for historic columbia street? sadly the cibc building was sold off to a new owner who understood its value, walking past this building and looking in the window you see an amazing example of architecture.

ahh yes, north america, where the only options presented to solve a program are “deregulate it” or “give a private company a subsidy.”
