we sat on a crate of 
  oranges and thought what good men most biologists are, the tenors of the 
  scientific worldtemperamental, moody, lecherous, loud-laughing, and healthy. 
  once in a while one comes on the other kindwhat used in the university to be 
  called a dry-ballbut such men are not really biologists. they are the 
  embalmers of the field, the picklers who see only the preserved form of life 
  without any of its principle. out of their own crusted minds they create a world 
  wrinkled with formaldehyde. the true biologist deals with life, with teeming 
  boisterous life, and learns something from it, learns that the first rule of 
  life is living. the dry-balls cannot possibly learn a thing every starfish knows 
  in the core of his soul and in the vesicles between his rays. he must, so know 
  the starfish and the student biologist who sits at the feet of living things, 
  proliferate in all directions. having certain tendencies, he must move along 
  their lines to the limit of their potentialities. and we have known biologists 
  who did proliferate in all directions: one or two have had a little trouble 
  about it. your true biologist will sing you a song as loud and off-key as will a 
  blacksmith, for he knows that morals are too often diagnostic of prostatitis and 
  stomach ulcers. sometimes he may proliferate a little too much in all 
  directions, but he is as easy to kill as any other organism, and meanwhile he is 
  very good company, and at least he does not confuse a low hormone productivity 
  with moral ethics. john steinbeck, the log from the sea of 
    cortez
