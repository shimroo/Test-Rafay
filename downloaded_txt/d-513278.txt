about us

the akta lakota museum, a non-profit, educational outreach program opened in may of 1991 on the campus of st. joseph's indian school.
the words akta lakota, meaning "to honor the people," were chosen because the museum is truly intended to honor and preserve the rich culture of the lakota people, the students at st. joseph's indian school and for the thousands who visit the museum each year.
