						“we considered other gateway providers, but they didn’t have this flexibility. our lora and dash7 sensors needed a gateway that could support both of these protocols. we found it with the conduit and look forward to working with the multitech team in the future.”					


glenn ergeertschief technical officer, aloxy 






						"we decided to look for rf modules already proven and generally available to help us develop a reliable sensor system and speed our time to market for the placepod. we considered in-house designs, but instead opted to leverage multitech’s lora expertise and focus our engineering resources on the sensor technology."					


robin stoeckerdirector of marketing, pni 






						"there is no doubt multitech is the smart choice for our business"					


david walkerpresident, rtc
