what's 
                  a honky tonk anyway?
the origin of "honky-tonk" 
                  is unknown, according to merriam-webster. but the new york 
 times'                  ed boland reports "... many musicians say the term, 
 which                  can mean a type of ragtime music or a tawdry nightclub, 
 stems                  from tin pan alley.
in the early 1900's, every music production company had a piano
                 in the office, and from the street you could hear people
banging                  away. many of these pianos were made by william tonk
& brothers                  at 10th avenue and 35th street. the pianos
and the sounds they                  made soon became known as honky tonk."

          honky tonk women: the changing role of women in country music

 honky 
          tonks sprang up around east texas oil fields in the 1930s as places 
          for hard-drinking, tough-talking men to get loose after a long day’s 
          work. hank williams’ country hit “honky tonkin” could 
          have been their theme song. but, in 1952 country singer kitty wells 
          looked like somebody’s aunt when she debuted, "it wasn't god who 
          made honky tonk angels". wearing a lady-like gingham dress, but daring 
          to sing about adultery and divorce from a woman’s point of view, 
          she captured the nation's attention and started a revolution in country 
          music. interviews include performers pam tillis and jean shepard and 
          the music of kitty wells, hank thompson and pam tillis. production by 
          david c. barnett.

 country guitar: 
          the music meets technology and changing times
cowboy hats and 
 guitars symbolize ‘country music’ today,  but a hundred years ago you wouldn’t 
 have heard much guitar picking on the porches of rural america.  the banjo 
 and fiddle were the primary  voices of early american roots music; the guitar 
 was a plaything of the rich and elite.  it wasn’t until the late 1880s that 
 guitars gained popularity, as a  parlor instrument played by women.  fueled 
 by mass-production and mail-order catalogs, guitars became a staple that 
slowly moved into the mainstream.   but, the parlor roots ran deep: all the 
early country guitarists said they learned guitar style from a mother.  so 
it’s no surprise that “mother” maybelle carter  would be one of the first 
innovators of the ‘country’ guitar.  the segment features the archive interviews 
and music of maybelle carter and etta baker.   production by tom cole and 
jesse boggs.

a pure sound: country 
          music and the moral message

 there may be far fewer sunday churchgoers 
          than a generation ago, but millions of americans have been drawn to 
          rural southern gospel music through the popular soundtrack of the film, 
          o brother where art thou. concert tours and ‘follow-up’ 
          albums have found audiences eager to buy traditional songs about “old-time 
          religion”. is this just musical fashion or does their moral message 
          resonate with today’s audiences? interviews include charlie louvin 
          and grammy ® winner ricky skaggs and music by the louvin brothers, 
          alison krauss and gillian welch. production by david c. barnett.

thomas a. dorsey: 
 from            "georgia tom" to the father of gospel music  

‘barrelhouse
            tommy’ was famous for raunchy records he made in the 1920s. thomas
            a. dorsey wrote “precious lord”, one of the most popular    
       and powerful hymns of all time. both styles came from the same man
at            opposite poles of his life. dorsey combined sacred lyrics and
secular            style in a new kind of church music. his american black
gospel was a            musical revolution. we hear from gospel artist walter
hawkins, and the            music of thomas dorsey as sung by kansas city
kitty, mahalia jackson,            and elvis presley. production by jacquie
gales webb.

the rise of the
country            blues
 
 in 
           the first third of the 20th century, these itinerant singers played 
            in delta juke joints, on street corners in texas’ big cities, 
           and on railroad platforms in dusty alabama towns. they had colorful 
            names like “blind lemon” jefferson, “mississippi john”       
    hurt and “leadbelly” --or simple ones like robert johnson           
and charley patton. the lines of their guitars etched the foundation    
       of rock and roll. they wrote songs about the devil, women and jail, 
and            harnessed them to earthy music that could lift the spirit. 
just what            makes a song a blues? is it a feeling, a musical form, 
or a way of looking            at life? interviews with honeyboy edwards, 
son house and taj mahal;            music by charley patton, son house and 
bukka white. production by tom cole, barrett            golding, and larry 
massett.

jimmie rodgers: birth
           of the country superstar 

              what we call country songs today, three minute tales of faithless 
 love,            restless traveling or sentimental ballads about “momma,” 
            owe a part of their heritage to the old mountain ballads and one
 part            to the phonograph records that made an icon of jimmie rodgers.
 in a            life as colorful as the songs he sang, the "father of country
 music,"            rose from obscurity to create a new level of international
 stardom for            american music. interviews with merle haggard and
the only living person to have played with jimmie rodgers,  hoyt 'slim' bryant;
 music of gene austin and jimmie rodgers. production            by jesse
boggs  and david c. barnett.

 when            german immigrants of the 19th century, 
 settled in the rio grande valley            they found ground that was fertile 
 for both crops and culture. their            beautiful button accordions

 country 
 fiddling: from back porch to big city 

 like 
 a butterfly, the small and light violin came to america            with early
 colonists. it went from musical culture to culture, and it            carried
 their elements like pollen. circuit-riding preachers, peddlers         
  and schoolteachers all spread their tunes and styles to the most isolated
            areas. even in the deepest rural hamlet, a fiddler was never
alone.             then these sounds were amplified by talking machines and
radio  to become            powerful agents of change in disparate musical 
styles.  lately they have            reappeared as popular music with the 
success of the film o brother            were art thou and its traditional 
music soundtrack. modern fiddlers            mark o’connor and alison krauss 
help tell the story with music            by them eck robertson, and others.

  lone star swing: bob 
          wills and the texas tradition 

fas  
         sharecroppers working in texas cotton camps, bob wills’ family 
          supplemented their meager income by playing for dances. their music 
            reflected the diverse population of the southwest -- with german 
 polkas,            and waltzes, spanish guitar and violins, and bits of blues
 and jazz            from the black sharecroppers that they had worked beside
 in the fields.            as young workers left the farms and ranches for
 the more lucrative oilfields            a new music was heard from the raucous
 roadhouses where they spent their            pay. combining old-time dance
 music with jazz, bob wills created western            swing. this segment
 includes wills own recollections, “asleep            at the wheel’s” ray
benson and music by wills and martie            seidel and more. production

  black and white: 
            crossing the border, closing the gap
 

for         
  more than half of the 20th century, segregation was the law in parts  
         of america. but musicians rarely let race get in the way of making
 good            music. the evidence in commercial recordings and in the
stories  of musicians            is undeniable. black and white players inspired 
and  influenced each            other, creating a common, musical culture 
though  sometimes underground            musical culture. this final segment 
of honky  tonks hymns and the blues            explores the crossovers of 
style and  content, the “race records”            that brought black music 
to all of  america, and the racial divisions            that remain in the 
music industry  today. interviews with doug wamble, clarence "gatemouth" brown,
and stax records’ memphis studio musicians; and the music            of lesley
riddle and the carter family. production by leda hartmann.

the carter family
on the air: border radio and country music

the carter family has 
        a legendary place in country music. their songs, and the image of a family 
        band playing wholesome music, have influenced countless of younger musicians 
        who still play their repertoire. this story will explain how the powerful 
        border radio stations of the 1930s and ‘40s, located in mexico, 
        first helped spread the family’s parlor-style country music to a 
        mass audience. we’ll also hear from janette carter, who runs the 
        carter fold in southwestern virginia. production by heath curdts.
