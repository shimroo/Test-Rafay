day 3..........i realize what happened, i think.





so hello there friends. i have made a stop for the time being which i think is pretty safe. i'm sorry for being so mysterious about this on-the-run stuff.  i'll make it clear to you.so where i left of last time was when i was in the hospital after my accident when i saw the machine i knew what it was for when i saw it.  i think the doctor thought so to because he looked at me and asked me, "what do you think this machine is for?"  the doctor just assumed that i could talk when i hadn't even been murmuring.he was right.i said in a clear voice which even surprised me,"i think that it is something to do with your.......mind."i don't know what made me say mind.  i was going to say brain but i don't know.he looked at me real funny like when my mom looks at me when trying to see if i'm lying. (she's pretty good at it too) then i saw a light and before i knew it had been 2 days and i had woken up in the hospital staring at the ceiling. the same doctor was there looking at my face and he said the words which i wish i had followed immediately he said them."run away to the mind games"i'm really tired right now and i will right asap. you have to know this guys and gals. it may sound boring at first but try and post your comments here.  i'm taking a risk telling you guys anyway.gotta go.  peace.

day 2...........i'm taken to the hospital





i would say that it is a miracle that i actually managed to stay alive and find the time to write this.to tell you my location would be foolish. to say its been a long time would be an understatement. but more on that later.on my last post i told you how i survived and i would like to elaborate on that.  yes what i said in my last post is true.  i have learned to control a different part of my brain and my adrenaline. it's kinda like having superpowers only not really.   i know what your thinking that i have read to many comic books but i haven't.i am gonna tell you what happened right after my accident and believe me, i remember every single stinkin detail.  i'm not really proud of it.as soon as i fell more than terror i felt surprise.  it was like my body had gone numb and i felt no pain.  all i could think of was that i was still alive.  thats when it got kinda fuzzy.  i remember all my friends screaming and calling for my mom. i heard ambulance vehicles and i was rushed to the hospital.  i was taken to the emergency room and the doctor like me had shock on his face.  i couldn't tell why at the moment but i found out soon enough.  suddenly the word gamer flashed in my head. at the time i thought it was extremely random.the doctor said something to my mom and quickly rushed me to the er.  i would probably expect this but at that moment it was almost as if i could read his mind. he was rushing me almost as if he wanted to hide me. when i got inside the room he took me to a panel in the wall and pushed through. there i saw a machine i had never seen before. i knew instantly that it was for my brain whatever it was.  it was going to examine what "power" i had gotten.that is where i have to leave of. i think i can hear voices i think they have found me. i have to keep on  the move because they somehow seem to track me down .i'll try to right as soon as i cankeep reading.

day 1........where it all started.





there i am sweating my heart out playing basketball. i loved the game. it had the physical challenge, the teamwork and the fun of the game. as i was done with the game i started to cross the road to get to my house.did you know the tiniest things can change your life drastically? a rock at the edge of the curb changed my life forever.as i was crossing the road i tripped over the rock. (you are probably thinking clumsy but i was so tired i was sweating like a pig in the middle of june. you can't really blame me.) i dropped 6feet down (which is my height; pretty tall i think for a 15 year old) and hit solid asphalt. as if that wasn't bad enough of course i had to be hit by a 100 ton truck.after that you are probably thinking that my memory was fuzzy. you are also probably thinking how i managed to stay alive. that is still one mystery i am trying to solve. i have come to one conclusion. the human body. we all know its an amazing thing. we all probably read about it in a book. but you have no idea how incredible our body is. i am sure you all have heard of adrenaline. again we all know that it is a chemical that for a moment gives us superhuman powers.in my case, it was more than a moment.i guess you could say that the adreneline kind of froze after it shot out. and some complicated process took place and now i can controll the adrenaline that would explain why i am still alive.thats all i can say for now. i will post as soon as i can.
