hidden gaming gems of 2024

december 30, 2024













it’s been four years since i’ve done an end of year gaming round-up, and the itch to write has returned, since 2024 was a pretty solid year for games.
that said: i’d rather focus this year on the titles closer to the margins and the tiny releases that are easy to miss if someone isn’t directly telling you about them. i don’t need to be the one to tell you balatro is good, or that the like a dragon series is the best it’s ever been, or that the new indiana jones game is pretty neat. (and i refuse to admit how much time i continue to sink into fortnite.)
games are in purchase order. all links are to steam although many of these are available on other platforms.


twenty small mazes – i can’t say it better than the actual game description: “this is a puzzle game with twenty small mazes. they’re good mazes, though.” free to boot.

the brew barons – an arcade-style flight sim in the name of building your business homebrewing beer. no, that doesn’t make a lot of sense writing it out either, but trust me.

minishoot’ adventures – 2d zelda-style exploration + twinstick bullet hell work shockingly well together.

lorelei and the laser eyes – somewhere between resident evil 2 and the rusty lake series lies this wonderful puzzle hunt. of the video game spaces i spent time in this year, hotel letztes jahr will be the most memorable. bonus points for the phenomenal soundtrack by daniel olsén, linnea olsson & jonathan eng.

[echostasis] – the conclusion to the [enigma] trilogy (and practically three games in one itself), [echostasis] is a sobering and unnerving first person existential crisis.

new star gp – driving games are always a struggle; the balance between “arcade driftfest” and “simulation hell” is not one many devs can hit. but new star games holds the racing line perfectly in this f1-style joy.

thank goodness you’re here! – the funniest game of the year, by a country mile.

the devcats “full of cats” series – i stumbled onto devcats last year, and my rule of thumb has quickly become “i see a new devcats release, i buy it and play nothing else for a few hours”. this happened three times this year: stray cats in cozy town; a park full of cats; and a shelter full of cats. finding little kittens hidden in a giant environment is tremendous stress relief, and the proceeds go to cat charities.

i am your beast – i remain in awe of xalavier nelson jr.’s range. this is my hotline miami 3.

ufo 50 – not the lowest of profile releases, but having been stuck in development for years, flew under the radar more than i thought. a collective of the best indie devs make a fake console and knock out 50 unique games. i played nothing else for the two days that we lived at the airport trying to get home in october.

nodebuster – i pretty much always have an incremental or idle game in progress to fall back on. nodebuster was the one of those i enjoyed the most this year.

up to par – i am a sucker for rogulikes and a big fan of mini-golf, so roguelike mini-golf was always going to speak to me. still being refined (the progression can be a little rough), but does what it says on the tin.

the rise of the golden idol – a great sequel to 2022’s the case of the golden idol, and quite a bit more accessible and enjoyable all around. really looking forward to the dlc.

“even though i did get his permission at the time, many people don’t understand the full implications of their actions and decisions and permission they give at 3 am.”
xalavier nelson jr., “a chaotic history of clickolding, the year’s most disturbing game“
(clickolding is extremely good and extremely weird and everyone should play it.)
