meditation

in keeping with the ethos of st james schools, the children practise regular pauses or times of quiet throughout the day to promote their appreciation and understanding of mindfulness.




philosophy

st james cares for a child’s spirit, mind and body. all children study philosophy to explore and challenge ideas in a respectful and inclusive way.




vegetarianism

creating a vegetarian school in 1975 was a reflection of the belief that humans should be kind to themselves, others, and the environment to grow holistically.

pause

at st james, we feel it is important to introduce our pupils to stillness and allow them to discover how to be inwardly free and deeply at ease within themselves. a short period of 5-10 minutes at the beginning and middle of every day is allocated to quietude in which pupils may meditate, contemplate or simply be still – according to their own spiritual inclinations.
