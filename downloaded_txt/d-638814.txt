to all who find
themselves here at o’reilly-fire.com, welcome. whether
you arrived here intentionally or by accident, i invite you to look
around and hope you will find something that interests you. these pages
are my attempt of saying thank you to the men and women who serve their
local communities and this great nation quietly, everyday. our nation’s
fire service, law enforcement, and military personnel often go through
their days without ever hearing a kind word of thanks, nor do they
expect it. their valuable and valiant service is deserving of our
appreciation. i can only offer these pages as a token of my gratitude
to those who have served, those who are serving, and those who will
serve in these most honorable capacities. to the vietnam veteran who
may read this, thank you for your part in keeping my family and i free
and safe, 

welcome
home!
