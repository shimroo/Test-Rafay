welcome



the clark county soil and water conservation district (swcd) is a legal subdivision of state government; the only local unit of government responsible for coordinating the conservation of our soil, water, and related natural resources.
the clark county district was organized in 1944 in accordance with the indiana soil conservation act, now amended (ic 14-32-5).




district supervisors coordinate technical and financial assistance for conservation programs on the 245,000 acres — cities, towns, and agricultural lands — in clark county. the district does not have power of eminent domain nor power to tax or bond.
