the shipwrecks of thunder bay constitute a microcosm of the great lakes commercial shipping industry
            spanning the last two hundred years. the collection reflects transitions in ship architecture and
            construction, from wooden schooners to early steel-hulled steamers, as well as several unusual vessel types.
