our specialized interest rate survey system monitors the gic market throughout the day, providing access to the very best rates available. our professional advisors encompass a full range of financial management disciplines and can help you construct a customized portfolio drawing from a full range of gics, estate and retirement planning products. from all across the market – not just one bank.
we focus on building security and income predictability through a forward thinking conservative investment approach. to that end we’ve placed over $2 billion in guaranteed (gic) accounts and continue with our philosophy “earn and save more ©”, while combining “enterprise, prudence and integrity ©”.
our cornerstone® retirement plan philosophy is dedicated to creating a balanced portfolio, offering predictability with guaranteed savings.
