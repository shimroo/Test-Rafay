product delays and how they impact your order
turnaround times on your order may continue to be affected by the ongoing global supply chain delays we are all experiencing due to the covid-19 pandemic. while we have seen improved delivery from our suppliers with some items, a good deal of the products we rely on to fill your order are manufactured overseas and those delays are expected to continue well into 2023. this, combined with workplace shortages attributed to the most recent variant of the virus, keeps it a challenge to ensure the most timely turnaround of your order.
we are committed to delivering the best possible service we can and want to provide as much transparency as possible as we navigate the ongoing reality of our world and marketplace. thank you in advance for your patience and willingness to allow us to do the best job we can to keep you on the field, geared up and playing the sport we all love.
