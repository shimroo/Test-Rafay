frequently asked questions (faq)we’re asked all kinds of things about our products, so to save time, we’ve written answers to some of the most common questions here. we hope you find this useful, but if there’s anything you’re not sure about, please get in touch and we’ll be happy to help!product faq


what are the tiles made from?
all of our eva foam play mats are made from a high-quality, high-density, closed-cell eva (ethylene-vinyl acetate) foam with added pe (polyethylene) for flexibility and longevity. our pvc floor tiles are made from a high-quality, high-density, virgin pvc, with an added colourant.


are the tiles safe?
in terms of materials, all of our eva foam products are non-toxic, odourless, and free of ammonia, latex, phthalates, and other chemicals of concern. in particular, the chemicals dmf (dimethyl fumerate) and formamide are not present in our products. our products are tested at source by sgs to reach eu guidelines and in the uk by satra, the materials testing agency.all eva foam tiles meet the reaction to fire classification bfl-s1.all eva foam tiles meet the slip resistance classification bs en 7188.


how do i clean the tiles?
plain colour and printed (wood etc.) eva foam tiles can be cleaned using a regular dish cloth and warm soapy water (and/or a mild detergent). we do not recommend using a vacuum cleaner on plain colour and printed eva foam tiles as this can damage the surface. carpet tiles can be cleaned with a vacuum, preferably on hard floor mode to avoid brush marks. rubber and pvc tiles should be first swept with a soft pile brush, then can be cleaned using a mop and bucket or power washer.


can i combine different tiles?
in some cases, yes. for example, all of our 50cm 'classic' range interlocking mats use the same cut-out mould, meaning they are completely compatible, so you can combine mats to make your own unique layout!


are the tiles in stock?
we keep high stock levels of our most popular mats and although demand is often high, all mats are available and in-stock unless marked otherwise. for more information, including large orders, custom colours and logos please enquire.


do you provide samples?
yes! all samples are free (plus delivery) and can be ordered online here.


do you give trade rates?
no, we manufacture direct to retail so our lowest price is always our best price.delivery faq


how long does delivery take?
orders are usually processed within 48 hours but could take longer during busy periods. we provide a standard 5 to 10 day courier delivery service for regular orders and a pallet service for large/heavy orders.


do you offer expedited delivery?
online orders are limited to our standard delivery service (3 to 7 days). however, we can provide an expedited delivery service on telephone orders in some cases. please call us on the number above.


do deliveries need to be signed for?
yes, all deliveries must be signed for, so please arrange accordingly.


do you deliver to po box addresses?
unfortunately we cannot deliver to po box addresses as a signature is required for all deliveries.


do you deliver to bfpo addresses?
unfortunately we do not deliver to bfpo addresses at this time.fitting faq


are the tiles easy to assemble?
yes, all of our mats feature an interlocking edge design so tiles fit together easily to create a strong bond.


do i need to prepare my surface?
whilst a flat, smooth, clean surface is ideal, we understand it might not always be possible. our eva tiles are able to cope with small amounts of dust and dirt and even small variations in floor level. please note however that too much variation can create pressure under the tiles and may cause them to bow upwards in some environments.


are the tiles easy to cut?
both eva foam mats and solid rubber gym mats can be cut to size using a standard utility knife with a good straight edge and of course, gloves.

i didn't like the idea of my little one (5 months old) licking and crawling around on soft tiles made of plastic and chemicals so i bought the natural cork 30cm eva foam floor tiles (16 pack) and i'm really glad i did. they're good quality and provide peace of mind that he's up close to a natural and safe product. i noticed before purchasing that the tiles have been safety tested for children which is obviously very important. once he gets older and needs more space i plan on buying more.

i judge a good company on how they react when they make a mistake. i orders grey matts but unfortunately they sent white. i called them on friday afternoon as i need the matts for monday evening. a new lot of grey matts where delivered this morning. excellent service. this is a great example of a company who are concerned about their customers and reputation. great work guys and will always deal with you in the future.

great flooring. easy to lay. really tough product. has the right amount of firmness and comfort underfoot.
i expect it will last me for 20years +. highly recommend spending the extra to get such a quality product.

delivery was somewhat of an issue because although i specified a safe place through a lockable gate (on my order), i had no proper warning of the delivery time and date and then the the delivery company said the pallet could not be put in the safe place because they could not fit it though the gate!!! why ask for a safe place, not trackable or pre delivery phone call and not reviewing the instructions and advising me pre- delivery. fortunately i have good neighbours who phoned me to say they had arrived. i suggest soft floor change the delivery contractor or get up to date with modern technology (like checking instructions and phoning and using real time tracking).....

as a dance teacher and examiner i was amazed at the performance of sound this product offered .

at the time of enquiry i was a little disbelieving re the clarity of beating shown on the utube clip .

wishing to obtain a product suitable for my granddaughter to practice time steps, cramp rolls and elevated pick ups i felt the price and weight of this product was extremely attractive .

the product arrived within 2 days and i have to say the quality of the mat and the tone of beating is quite extraordinary !
i had chosen the black finish , but had been assured by the very helpful advisory team, that all finishes would produce the same
clarity of sound . i only ordered a 1 metre x1 metre square , so it can slide under a bed when not being used for practice .

teachers and students …… this is a ‘ must have ‘ product !

our conservatory had tired old tiles, so  we overlaid with floor  insulation, flooring chipboard and topped it off with soft floor black ash classic foam tiles.  they are pleasant to walk on, provide good insulation and make our conservatory look like new!

ordered the pink & blue standard 50cm mats for my baby classes (small business owner) and they are perfect! very durable, lovely colours and easy to clean, although time consuming when you have as many as i do!
they are also a decent thickness to provide padding for young children but not so thick they become bulky and difficult to transport. these are highly recommended and will be purchasing again. thank you!

looking for flooring for in our utility room, and loo. problem we had was some unevenness in the concrete floor. found this company very helpful and easy to communicate with. after getting a couple of different samples, decided to go for the soft floor with a wood grain type top finish. really easy to lay, and the finish is great. cost about £300 which is very reasonable compared to floor tiles etc. had carpet tiles before, which just got so dirty and smelly!!
very pleased with company and the finished product.
