a tool for
the everyday
business of life

 a unique ` daytimer
notebook
environment where any line may be
a command to the computer executed by tapping a
function key .



re: chat gpt : "help me understand what this business does or what the website is about: www.cosy.com"
what chat gpt says about your website | via terry mcdonald |

cosy combines elements of forthâa minimalist, extensible 
programming languageâwith array programming concepts inspired by apl and
 k. this fusion provides users with a powerful tool for data 
manipulation, mathematical computations, and general-purpose 
programming. the environment supports an extensive vocabulary for tasks 
such as sorting, searching, slicing, and applying functions to list 
items, making it versatile for various applications.
the platform emphasizes simplicity and user empowerment, allowing
 users to define new commands and customize their workflow. cosy's open 
architecture encourages exploration and adaptation to individual needs, 
making it a valuable tool for those seeking an integrated approach to 
managing daily business and personal activities.
for more detailed information and to explore cosy's features, you can visit their website at cosy.com.

bob armstrong's #lambdaconf2024 talk, 
cosy:
apl evolved as an open vocabulary in forth, 
is now available on youtube, offering a glimpse into a groundbreaking
fusion of programming paradigms.

bob introduces #cosy, a remarkable environment
where apl's expressive array algebra notation converges with forth's
minimalist, extensible essence. prepare to explore an innovative realm
where note-taking, timestamping, and code execution seamlessly
intertwine.


witness the power of cosy's list-based objects, with a
three-cell header (type count refcount) elegantly handling memory
management. experience the refreshing twist of modulo indexing on
general lists (type 0), opening up new possibilities for data
manipulation.


but cosy is more than just a language; it's a comprehensive environment
with a vast apl-level vocabulary, empowering you to tackle common tasks
like sorting, finding, slicing, and selecting with unparalleled ease. 


gary hoover in american business history :
 the  simple key to breakthrough innovation : 

            " yet history
indicates
that the vast majority of breakthroughs
 come from one very simple
idea: 
combining two things
that no one has previously connected. " cosy
uniquely openly bridges from the language of the chip via forth to
mathematically rooted array language evolved and greatly simplified
from apl via k .






extreme simplicity :2.5 min silent ` helloworlda ` word is any non blank string of
characters .


space is the prime delimiter .the syntax is noun
noun verb aka: rpntap f6 instead of enter
on any line & your computer will try to execute it .
all nouns are lists . at the forth level they have a
3 cell header 


`( type count refcount )`indexing is modulo -- like counting on your
thumb & fingers : 0 1 2 3 4 0 
: name . . .  ; adds a word to the
dictionary .
an extensive vocabulary evolved from apl
mainly slicing and dicing , searching & replacing , and applying
verbs to each item in lists ,the cosy


notebook environment itself is written in cosy
. 
for example :

r ` text v@  "lf
vm   ` cash con 

split your note text on linefeeds and return the lines containing the
word cash . 
and to make it a word 
: log r ` text
v@  "lf vm ;



so can write 
log ` cash con

re : planetary temperature

co2
and o2
are the anabolic and catabolic halves
of 
the respiratory cycle of life

 computational
earth physics   the ritchie prize
seeking an executable understanding of the differential in a voxel
because mapping it over a sphere is rather trivial in an apl like cosy

 
any honest rational person seeing these 3 graphs should immediately
understand the 
global statist demonization of the building block of life is a leninist
useful idiocy










  particles moving "up" in a
gravitational field slow down , ie: cool ;
  those moving down speed up
, ie: heat .

newton's law of gravity which explains
how much faster satellites go in lower orbit also explains how much
faster molecules go at the bottoms of atmospheres and thus
quantitatively explains the temperature profiles of all planets
whatever their atmosphere including the ~ 33c warmer the bottom of our
atmosphere is than our radiative balance with the sun .

the ghg paradigm , excluding the law of gravity in violation even of
conservation of energy , being false , has thus never presented
a testable equation quantifying their asserted spectral "trapping" nor
an experimental demonstration of it .  


roderic
graeff's experiment , https://tallbloke.files.wor...
, detects the gravitational temperature gradient . while admittedly
modest it appears well thought out and executed . and , of course , it
makes sense . if there ever was a frin ( further research is needed )
question it's this -- to do it on a taller column . | leif

all you need to
explain our mean temperature is the equations for the 2 macroscopic
forces and their associated energies :


electromagnetic : which includes
kinetic and is symmetrical 
gravitational : which is asymmetric and
explains the gradient w height

gravity 
not "green house gas" spectrum  is why & how much the bottoms
of atmospheres
are hotter than their tops . 

 but it
is not in the energy balance equations



as a
mathematically testable statement :

<=> 

adiabatic gravitational >< kinetic equilibrium 
 matching 
radiative equilibrium at the effective radiative surface

more destructive than stalin's lysenkoism

 
we are lucky to be living in one of the thin peaks between ice ages .
it used to be grade school science that green life is built on co2 and
h2o married by solar energy thru photosynthesis releasing o2 . and we
animals consume those plants and reverse the reaction for the energy
which animates us .  details 














 
for those who
truly grok
classical physics , it should
become clear upon reflection that of the 2 macroscopic forces only
asymmetric centripetal gravity
can "trap" heat , ie : energy , and in fact must
do so to make the equations balance . photons
themselves heat ( blue shift ) in a
gravitational well . in fact simple computations
match atmospheric temperature profiles with undeniable accuracy for all
measured planets .  see recently my comments on , eg : watts

divergence theorem , cannot

#gorehansen
al gore & james hansen
"green house gas" demonization of co2
, the source of carbon to carbon
based life
, gets an f in physics at a very fundamental level
. the non-quantitative  "bait and switch"  in  hansen
et al's 1981 paper
astounded me when i  read it after  a tip from  ralph
keeling .  the hypothesis is that more co2 will raise effective
altitude at which co2 finally has an open path to radiate to space ;
it's colder higher , therefore co2 will radiate less -- thus ( denying
the gravity is why its colder up there , and without equation ) it will trap and
be responsible for the entire
temperature profile below . the paper is an embarrassment to nasa .

it's clear i did not understand at the time that it is gravity which balances the greater
