											what are a few ideas for a pea in the pod themed baby shower?
									 	

pea in the pod baby shower theme
a pea in the pod themed baby shower is a great unisex baby shower idea, especially for moms expecting multiples! pea pod themed decorations and readily available at most party stores or in printable packs off the internet.  for food, consider pea salad, green grapes, and any other type of green food. cupcakes with frosting pea pods are also acceptable and completely adorable! for games, find out who can "stuff" as many peas (bean bags) into a pod (foam tube or pool tube).  if the mom-to-be knows the sex of the baby or babies, feel free to add pink and blue accents scattered throughout the pea-themed decorations and food.

											what are some baby shower wrapping paper ideas?
									 	

creative baby shower gift wrap ideas
when you are giving a gift at a baby shower, you could spend $5.00 for a roll of wrapping paper with ducks or baby blocks on it. however, an idea that is more fun is to get creative on your gift wrapping.  one idea that is especially appreciated by new moms is to wrap the baby gift in a small receiving blanket or burp cloth. these are two items that are used all the time, so you are in essence giving a bonus gift that costs no more than the wrapping paper would have.  if you are trying to save money, consider using blank newsprint or butcher paper that you decorate yourself using paint, marker or other materials. children will love to help you create special wrapping paper in this manner.  no matter how you do it, getting creative with your baby shower gift wrap is a lot of fun!

											how do i throw a cowboy or cowgirl themed baby shower?
									 	

cowboy/cowgirl themed baby shower
ready to give your little buckaroo a great welcome to the world? consider a cowboy/cowgirl themed baby shower!  for food, consider serving cowboy boot, horse, or horseshoe shaped cookies with pink or blue frosting.  for decoration, use lots of bandana prints (tablecloths, garland, ribbon on a diaper cake, etc.) wrangler brand diaper covers also make a charming decoration addition (and gift for the mom to be) to any cowboy/cowgirl themed baby shower. if the sex of the child is not known ahead of time, stick to greens and browns for a great gender-neutral western style.  next, choose games that fit the western theme. traditional baby shower games can easily be turned into a cowboy/cowgirl theme with a little bit of creative thinking.

											what is a simple and fun game for a baby shower?
									 	

scattergories-inspired baby shower game
the board game scattergories can easily be altered to create a fun and energetic game for a baby shower. all you need are enough copies of the alphabet sheet and a writing instrument for every guest. the sheet should list every letter of the alphabet, each followed by a line on which to write the answers. in actual scattergories, the sheets contain categories and a die is rolled to select a letter that each category’s answer must begin with. in the baby shower version, the only category is "baby" and each guest should try to come up with an appropriate word that begins with each letter of the alphabet. the host and mom-to-be should keep the time and be the judges. in addition to the obvious answers, like "bottle" and "diapers," you can accept answers that relate specifically to the guest of honor and her baby. for instance, if her nursery theme is dinosaurs, "tyrannosaurus" could be an acceptable answer. when the designated time is up, start with one guest and have them read her answers. if any other guest has that same word, everyone who wrote that answer must cross it out. this should continue until every guest has read her list. each participant should total up the number of words she didn't cross out. the person with the most unique words wins the game and a prize.
