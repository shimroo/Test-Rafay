your trusted ford dealer in clinton township, michigan
shopping for a new ford should be an exciting and rewarding experience which dorian ford manages to provide. with our dedication to customer service, expansive inventory, and selection of automotive services, you won't find an award-winning dealership experience like this anywhere else in the detroit metro area.


why shop here
ever since we opened our doors in 1964, we've been family-owned and operated with a mission to serve our community. customer service has been a major focus of ours since the beginning, and that hasn't changed. our founder, mike dorian, championed customer satisfaction and personal service, making both of them top priorities for every team member at our dealership.
providing incredible service comes easy when you offer top-quality ford vehicles. we stock in bulk to keep costs down for everyone, which has allowed us to make upgrades elsewhere. when you walk through our doors, you'll feel like you're in a luxury dealership, as the sleek design and attentive staff are there to greet you. even after you've made a purchase, our services can keep you coming back for all your automotive needs.


top-quality vehicles
no dealership would mean much without a premium inventory, and you'll have plenty to choose from when you visit our dealership. we offer all the latest and greatest offerings from the ford lineup, such as the powerful ford f-150. if you're looking for a sedan, the ford fusion might be more to your liking, while the ford edge, ford explorer, and ford escape are shining examples of everything a crossover suv can be.
we have over 1,200 vehicles on our lot, encompassing both our standard and commercial vehicle inventory. additionally, you can find a pre-owned selection of various makes and models with over 250 vehicles to choose from. we strive to provide as much diversity as possible in our selection to ensure that everyone who walks through our doors can find something they'll be happy driving off our lot with.


unending service
at our dealership, our goal is to provide the best service for our community. if you're looking for a ford, one of our team members will listen to your requirements and find the vehicle that best fits your standards. when your vehicle needs service, our ford factory-certified technicians can have it back on the road in top condition in no time. we even have an elite team of financiers who can help you stay on budget.
our dedication to service goes beyond our own dealership, however, as we're also happy to help several local institutions and charities such as mclaren macomb hospital and the karmanos cancer institute. we're also fortunate enough to have the opportunity to help our furry friends and heroes from the clinton township k-9 unit.
when you're looking for the ultimate dealership experience, look no further than dorian ford. with our unrelenting commitment to customer service and massive selection of vehicles, our team is happy to help you find your dream car.
