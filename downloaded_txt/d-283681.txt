port scanning resources
    learn cyber security   blog   pc flank was an online service that provided various penetration testing and security testing tools aimed at helping users assess the vulnerability of their internet-connected systems. launched in the early 2000s, it gained popularity among everyday users and security enthusiasts for its straightforward, user-friendly interface, allowing them to perform basic security checks without needing extensive technical knowledge. if you landed on this page looking for a modern alternative to pc flank, then we recommend you check out shodan.io as a modern web based port scanning alternative.  key features of pc flank:  port scanning: pc flank offered a port scanning tool that enabled users to check for open ports on their systems. this feature helped identify potentially vulnerable services that could be exploited by attackers. firewall testing: the service included tests to evaluate how effectively a userâs firewall was configured. this allowed users to see whether their firewall was properly blocking unwanted incoming connections. stealth testing: pc flank provided stealth tests to determine whether a userâs system could remain undetected by external scans, helping to assess the effectiveness of their network security. trojan detection: the site also offered tests to check for vulnerabilities that could allow trojan horses and other malware to infect the userâs system. browser privacy tests: it included features that evaluated how much information a user's browser was leaking to websites, helping users understand potential privacy risks.  sadly, pcflank.com was no longer maintained, which we felt was a great loss to it's legacy and the awareness that it brought to the industry back in the day. however due to the synergies between pc flank and the articles we cover on our blog, which include our resource explaining what is port scanning, pcflank.com will be merged with aptive.co.uk from this point forward. if you require an external port scan of your organisation see our web app security testing and penetration testing services.
