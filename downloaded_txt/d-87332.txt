sr-71 online - an online aircraft museum
















unofficially nicknamed the "blackbird," the sr-71 was developed as a long-range strategic reconnaissance aircraft capable
of flying at speeds over mach 3.2 and at 85,000 feet. the first sr-71 to enter service was delivered in 1966 and due to politics, it was
retired in 1990. however, the usaf still kept a few sr-71s in operation up until 1998, after a few were brought back to service in 1995.
nasa's dfrc at edwards afb, ca flew the sr-71 from 1991 until the program was cancelled in late 2001. visit the
blackbird archive to learn more.
