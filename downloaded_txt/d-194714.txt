vision and mission
our vision is to improve and sustain food production while conserving natural resources and promoting healthy and active lives by creating and disseminating knowledge in the plant sciences. our mission is to achieve excellence in the science of using plants for food, feed, fuel, fiber and turf, as well as in the management of weed species, through research, teaching, and outreach programs that serve the people of florida, our nation and the world.












academics
