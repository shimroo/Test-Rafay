in may of 2024, the merck family fund (mff) approved a ten year strategic plan.




as mff enters its 8th decade, with the 4th generation of family at the helm, we have updated our vision, mission, programs, and operations to reflect best practices in philanthropy while continuing to center people and place and the urgent crises of racial inequities, climate and democracy. 




















































































prioritizing communities




mff’s new strategy prioritizes communities most affected  by racism, climate change and underrepresentation in the democratic process.  we adopt a systems-based approach that emphasizes power-building and deeper collaboration with partners and colleagues.  the programs will continue to evolve through 2025. 





























mff will support:















place based, multi-issue, power building to achieve system change.
