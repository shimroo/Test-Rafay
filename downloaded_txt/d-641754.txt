racial disparities in our region
racial disparity in the land of sky region report 2023
the killing of george floyd on may 25, 2020 by law enforcement officers in minneapolis, minnesota was inexcusable and offensive to the fundamental promise of america that all people are created equal and endowed by our creator of certain inalienable rights.â  while this heinous murder was far away from our home, we acknowledge that our region has significant racial disparities in most every aspect of our society.â  on average, african american individuals in our region earn lower wages, have less educational attainment, and suffer significant health and criminal justice disparities compared to white individuals.â  these disparities are unacceptable and are the result of many complex factors including, but not limited to, a history of enslavement and segregation of african americans in our region.
