																	great food and a great central location																

																	as always a great experience at the whitehorse inn.
have stayed 3 nights and due to the restaurant being quiet chose to eat in the bar.

																	nice old hotel, good location																

																	we recently stayed at the white horse inn, exmoor for two nights and what a lovely hotel it is.  although the building is old, the rooms have been tastefully furnished with everything you need.   breakfast each day was delicious with plenty of choice.  the staff were superb.  all of them, so friendly and welcoming and always had time for a chat.  would stay again if ever in this area.

																	a real gem																

																	can't recommend highly enough. peter and linda were the most welcoming hosts and went so far as to gave my husband a birthday present! room large and comfortable, food very good. there was much attention to detail and really useful information about the local area. the hotel itself is charming and ideally located for exploring this beautiful part of the country. will be returning.
