the nccb has always been open to any adult with musical training (this does not mean you must have a music degree) who wants to play. many have taken their instruments out of a closet or attic after years of gathering dust. most have been members of high school and college bands while some have been members of military and other professional and high quality amateur groups. no one is required to have received professional (ex. music degree) training, just a general music competency and joy for making music. this band has a stable core of about 50 members.
the nccb is currently rehearsing most monday evenings from 7pm to 9pm at donelson heights umc. for most current information, please check our calendar. the band rehearses nearly year round with brief hiatuses in december/january and july/august.

the present members range in age from their 20's to their mid 80's. to date, people become a member by showing up and cease to be a member when they do not attend. this usually results from job changes, completion of a graduate degree or program, moving away, having children, illness, and death.
the band members represent many professionals - lawyers, physicians, teachers, programmers, engineers, retirees, band directors, bankers, air traffic controllers, social workers, housewives, and others. the nccb has not seen a return from the thousands of high school and college graduates with instrumental training until their careers and family situations have become stable enough to allow a rehearsal night. the band also believes that in this busy world, performance can be a great "stress" reliever.
the nccb was associated with the metro schools' adult education program from 1973 until august 2010. no one involved with the nccb is paid for their services.
our current regular rehearsal space is at donelson heights umc.
this web site is a great asset to the band, but the webmistress can only do so much. we encourage you to submit write-ups, stories, amusing anecdotes of your fellow musicians, or whatever would be of interest to the band members and/or the general public. photos are definitely welcome. whether they are raw, jpeg or png, if they need to be scanned, if they are digital, we can handle most of them.
if someone out there wants to submit a column of interest on a regular basis, we can certainly facilitate that. since the site is loaded into a content management system, we can create a contributor profile and permit direct submission.
anyone who can read music is welcome to join. for more details about joining the band, visit this page. if you want more information, send a message to band@nashccband.org or you can call dan shilstat (615-352-7713).
if you would like to be added to the band mailing list, please see any band officer and they will see that you are added. generally, we will only add someone after they have attended a few rehearsals. any emails sent to the list will be added as a post, so if you think you have missed one (check your spam folder), please view the news archives.
if you have been subscribed to the band list and wish to unsubscribe, each message has an unsubscribe link, if this link has not worked for you or your mail software is hiding the footer of the email, you can send an email to the band@nashccband.org mailbox and provide the address you are attempting to remove.
