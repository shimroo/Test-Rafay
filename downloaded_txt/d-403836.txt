                      temari  (in japanese
                writing,ã¦ã¾ã) - "te"
                means hand, and "mari"
                means ball -  is an ancient folk art form. the japan temari
                association provides the history of temari as originating from
                kemari (a football/kickball type game), originally coming from
                china during the asuka period (538 to 710). the balls were
                originally made from deer hide. during the edo period (1603 to
                1867), women in the royal court evolved kemari to onna mari
                (which then became temari), and would make brightly colored
                balls for the little girls. more gentle games of rolling and
                tossing temari emerged. the ladies also used temari making as an
                opportunity to perfect and show off (even competing) their kagari (kagari means
                "stitch", noun and verb),  to gain the attention and favor
                of their favorite princes. temari
                were at first made with kakagari
                (stitch with silk threads), and limited to the upper classes.
                however, when cotton threads became more easily available common
                people began making them using cotton (and others such as linen,
                wool, etc.) thread. this allowed temari to be made by many women
                in all areas of japan (and for them to become favored toys for
                children), and each prefecture or area established its own
                recognizable and known style, based on local culture and
                materials. temari is a traditional, highly artistic culture and
                skill in that each design shows the unique characteristics of
                the maker's free ideas and creativity. (with
                  thanks to the japan temari association)
  
        temari were/are made from
                previously used materials: discarded clothing and household
                items were taken apart, and as much as possible the fabric
                pieces and threads would be saved and reused (for many
                purposes). materials from nature were also used. the earliest
                known was most likely deer hide, stuffed with pine needles and
                then sewn together. later on pieces of fabric would be used.
                regardless of material, the process is the same: a core filling
                is wadded into the shape of a ball, then wrapped with strips of
                fabric and then thread. the ball would then be firmly stitched
                together (it is said that the balls were wrapped and stitched so
                tightly that they actually did bounce). it became traditional
                for temari made as toys to have some rice, pebbles, etc. in
                their center to make them rattle; modern ones may have a bell or
                similar rattle in their centers for good luck. japanese
                aesthetic requires beauty in all things, so it was natural that
                creation of temari became an art, with the functional stitching
                more and more decorative and detailed, until the balls displayed
                very intricate embroidery. temari wholly transcended from play
                toys into art objects (although loving moms will still make them
                for their children) with the introduction of rubber to japan
                (rubber balls to tend to bounce so much better, regardless of
                how tightly the temari would be packed). 
        temari now represent a
                highly valued and cherished gift, symbolizing deep friendship
                and loyalty, and wishing good luck. it is traditional for a
                mother to make a ball for her daughter as a new year's gift.
                they are also often given as gifts on auspicious occasions.
                filled with both the craftsman's gentle spirit and skill, temari
                are believed to bestow happiness. the brilliant color and
                threads used also are symbolic of wishing the recipient a
                brilliant (happy) life. traditionally, becoming a craftsman in
                japan was a long
                and tedious process, beginning very early in life. you would be
                handed off to a master, and do nothing but watch your master
                while performing servant duties in the workshop for the first
                forty years, learning everything you can by observing - but
                being taught nothing. if the master feels you are sincere after
                forty years of humbling effort, you will be accepted to
                apprentice for the next thirty years, repeating over and over
                the patterns and designs the master has made - but never being
                allowed to create your own designs. it will only be after the
                master dies that you can then be acknowledged as a master, if
                you have proved yourself. to become a temari artist in japan
                today requires specific training and examination, spanning
                upwards of ten years to complete all certification levels (and
                yet also patterning, relatively speaking, after the apprentice
                time frame). certification is administrated and managed by the
                japan temari association in tokyo, japan.

                        patterns seen in
                temari are often geometric and usually symmetrical, with many of
                the design elements being based upon nature. in appearance, most
                are very reminiscent of a kaleidoscope's patterns. designs are
                formed either by their own patterns, or by the "negative (or
                white)" space image that is left once the pattern is stitched.
                westerners will often look at a temari from the side and see a
                lovely upper and lower design with a wide band through the
                middle.  those of the east will look directly at the top or
                bottom and see the image of petals created by the space where
                the thread does not cover. some of the most beautiful designs in
                temari use very few threads.
                      modern day temari are
              created by first making the core base (the mari), usually of rice
              hulls, old fabric, etc., which is then wrapped with  layers
              of yarn and then a layer of regular weight sewing thread (usually
              about three hundred yards for a hand-sized ball) - all of which
              must be placed smoothly and consistently to insure roundness of
              the ball. the ball is then divided with relational geometry using
              a thin paper strip - no defined or absolute measuring being used -
              into one of three standard divisions, using pins and marking
              threads (jiwari). jiwari
              most often become integral parts of the design; other designs may
              require the marking threads to be the same color as the base
              thread wrap so as to blend into the background. after the mari is
              prepared, designs are embroidered with a variety of threads. the
              most common type used today is perle cotton (in both japan and the
              west), although silk, metallic and rayon embroidery threads or
              embroidery ribbons are also used in modern day.  some balls,
              after they had been taken in as art, were further decorated with
              elaborate tassels made by intricate methods of braiding and
              knotting. each temari is different - designs are limited only by
              the imagination of the crafter. 

                      sizing of  temari
              is as varied as the crafter. any size is possible and larger ones
              are popular in japan, where collections of all sizes and styles
              are treasured. smaller ones may be made for personal accessories
              including jewelry. they may be displayed singly or collected and
              arranged in groups. display styles may include hanging
              arrangements or multi-tiered tabletop displays. they make
              wonderful, unique gifts, treasured as wedding and anniversary
              gifts, and as mementos of friendship and special occasions.
