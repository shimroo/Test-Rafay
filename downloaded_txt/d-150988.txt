as the voice of the concrete contractor, ascc will issue bulletins called alert!  these alert bulletins spotlight current issues and developments in concrete construction that concern our members and the concrete industry. there will be no frequency for these bulletins as they will be published as needed to provide quick notice of any unusual or difficult circumstances affecting the concrete contractor.
alert!: portland-limestone cement
alert!: bid qualification - ready mix purchase order
