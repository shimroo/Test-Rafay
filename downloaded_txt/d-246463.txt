what is the digital object identifier (doi)?
a doi name is a digital identifier of an object, any object â physical, digital, or abstract. dois solve a common problem: keeping track of things. things can be matter, material, content, or activities.
designed to be used by humans as well as machines, dois identify objects persistently. they allow things to be uniquely identified and accessed reliably. you know what you have, where it is, and others can track it too.

how many are being resolved?




total doi resolutions to date (all time)
the total doi resolutions to date is calculated using actual number of doi resolutions recorded up until yesterday and the average resolution rate recorded over the past 24 hours (currently this is )





uptime over the last 90 days








try resolving a doi name
type or paste a known doi name exactlyâincluding its prefix and suffixâinto the text box below and then ‘submit’ to resolve it.






dois include a prefix (prefixes always start with 10.) and a suffix, separated by a forward slash (/). prefacing the doi with doi.org/ will turn it into an actionable link, for example, https://doi.org/10.47366/sabia.v5n1a3. clicking that link will ‘resolve’ it, i.e. redirect to the latest information about the object it identifies, even if the object changes or moves.
