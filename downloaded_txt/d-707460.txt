authentic bar-b-q is a labor of love involving hours
						of preparation. we use only the finest lean meats and trim them twice - before and after the
						seasoning and cooking process. the technique of closed pit cooking imparts flavors that cannot
						be matched by other methods. this process gives our beef, pork, ribs and chicken a reddish or
						pink color, even though it is thoroughly done.
a distinguishing feature of brian's bar-b-q is its dual
						cooking method. with closed smokers and chargrills, we can offer both slow-cooked bar-b-q and
						flame grilled specialties. oak logs provide the smoldering embers for smoking meats and open
						fire for the grilling. ask for one of our homemade sauces: regular bar-b-q, hot bar-b-q or sweet
						baby back grilling sauce.
