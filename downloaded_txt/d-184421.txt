new world â new opportunities 
the world has changed â and the world of yoga is changing with it. many of the challenges and obstacles to learning and practice  we faced in the past are falling away. 
i'll be offering expanded opportunities for learning and practice both in-person and online in 2024 that are  accessible,   affordable, inspiring, and effective.

new: 2024 schedule for live workshops, trainings, and webinars
 2024 will hold opportunities for live, online, and hybrid trainings and workshops!  online offerings have the virtue of affordability and opportunities to revisit, review, and really imbibe the content of the trainings, making them a valuable resource. live is of course always best, and there will be a good number of live events too!
 the 2024  schedule is here! 












                  
                special courses 

                                i have been doing regular offerings with  yogau online  on therapeutic topics, and will continue to do so through the year. there's an extensive catalogue of courses to check out!
i've also done two special courses with yoga international. the newest is yogic breathing: the history and practice of pranayama.
 the second is an in-depth course on yoga history and philosophy. this course casts light on how yoga philosophy is not static, but has evolved as people evolved through the millenia of the exploration of yoga practice.
