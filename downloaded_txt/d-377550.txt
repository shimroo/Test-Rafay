testimonials











"i love it because its beautiful and completely comprehensive. i've looked at all of the montessori materials and this is the only one with all of the sounds. the kids like it so much – they go right for their red pencil.”
susan grubbins, montessori primary teacher
lagrange, il









“i’ve been using the language works program in my classroom for 17 years. the 3-step method is easy to follow and gives the children a real sense of accomplishment. i see a marked improvement in their daily writing. i require that my children do one phonogram a week, but they enjoy the work so much that they frequently will do several!” 
barbara boyce, montessori elementary teacher
