hello & welcome to pure integrity candles!
scented strong & lasting long ...naturally -  family owned since 2002.  - made in u.s.a!






about us
it started with a passion for all things healthy, a love of candles and authentic fragrance flickering in ambient light! we set out to create something new, something different that didn't exist. we were one of the first soy candles to market and that was over 20 years ago. from our family to yours, enjoy a more fragrant, healthier, even and longer burning soy candle. we have reinvented how fragrance is experienced and how candles perform with your health in mind. 
 
the pi difference
our unique 100% soy wax formulation burns without petro-soot smoke toxins and our soy wax holds more scent than any other candle we know of on the market today. our fragrances are healthier and very authentic and realistic. we test carefully to make sure our candles burn steadily and evenly with a long burn-time and a steady release of scent. our fragrances are 100% phthalate free and biodegradable, reducing synthetic additives which often cause headaches, allergy flare ups and respiratory issues.

i found pure integrity soy candles on amazon & it is the best candle i have ever purchased!
 


i have been purchasing yankee candles and bath and body works candles for years. but i wanted natural alternative that would not spread toxins into my home. i found pure integrity candles on amazon and it is the best candle i have ever purchased. i now order directly from pure integrity. i burn the mid sized candle in my kitchen/family room that is very large, where i have 12 foot ceilings and the smell is amazing. it even travels upstairs in to my kids rooms. i burn the smaller one in bathrooms and our master bedroom. i have given these candles as gifts and purchased many for myself. i highly recommend these candles and will not purchase any other brand!!!!!
