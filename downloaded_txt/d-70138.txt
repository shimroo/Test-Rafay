china’s dangerous play in peru – part ii



the year 2024 marked a turning point in the relations between the people’s republic of china (prc) and peru. while at the global level countries such as those of the european union, canada, and the united states have been implementing measures to curb china’s advance, the prc consolidated its control over strategic sectors in the andean country.
in february, peru approved the purchase by state-owned china southern power grid international (hk) of enel distribución perú and enel x perú, thus ceding total control of electricity distribution in lima, the country’s capital, to the prc. “china wants to be latin america’s switch, and peru has become the paradigm of that effort,” peruvian political analyst and economic journalist paolo benza told diálogo.

beyond the canal: the real risk of china’s engagement in panama



this article was first published on the diplomat on february 4, 2025. recent statements by u.s. president donald trump and special envoy for latin america mauricio claver carone, as well as the trip by secretary of state marco rubio to central america, have focused attention on the risks posed by the activities of china in panama. two points should be made clear at the outset. first, the united states turned the canal over to panama through a properly ratified series of two treaties whose legal validity is generally not in question, however much some may question the wisdom of the u.s. government in agreeing to them. second, since [ … ]








 




corruption may postpone ccp’s military modernization, report says



this article was first published in u.s. indo-pacific command’s magazine forum on january 7, 2025.   chinese communist party (ccp) general secretary xi jinping’s crackdown on military corruption in the past 18 months could hinder his military modernization goals for 2027 and beyond, according to the china military power report released by the united states defense department in december 2024. the annual report provides the u.s. congress an analysis of the people’s republic of china’s (prc) military capabilities, strategies and goals. the 2024 report highlights significant developments and challenges within the ccp’s people’s liberation army (pla), focusing on corruption, modernization, [ … ]








 




the dragon and the bear, the china-russia relationship is more partnership of convenience than alliance



this article was originally published in u.s. indo-pacific command’s magazine indo-pacific defense forum, on august 26, 2024. the china-russia joint statement of february 2022 has widely been interpreted as a signal of deeper cooperation between the countries, which are the major challengers to the world order. some have gone so far as to assess it as a sign of an institutional axis, or even an alliance. however, the lack of official people’s republic of china (prc) support for russia’s illegal attack on ukraine has sown doubts regarding this argument. deeper scrutiny of existing cooperation between russia and the prc, and [ … ]








 




arctic aggression, prc pursues polar pathway as russia focuses on ukraine



this article was originally published in u.s. indo-pacific command’s magazine indo-pacific defense forum, on november 12, 2024. the people’s republic of china (prc) is not an arctic nation. its northern border is nearly 1,500 kilometers from the arctic circle and even farther from the arctic ocean. yet the prc is encroaching upon the frozen region to control its vast resources and exploit the strategic location for economic and potentially military purposes. the prc arbitrarily declared itself a “near-arctic” state in 2018. the label immediately drew widespread criticism. “there are only arctic states and non-arctic states,” then-united states secretary of state [ … ]

general javier eduardo iturriaga del campo, commander of the chilean army



							“one of our mission areas is to contribute to international cooperation and our country’s foreign policy, and within that framework the army maintains a broad agenda of knowledge and cooperation at the regional and international level with partner nations. the chilean armed forces are currently participating in several peacekeeping missions, specifically in bosnia and herzegovina, cyprus, colombia, and the middle east, and in this area, they also participate in exercises such as u.s. southern command’s southern vanguard.”

colonel (ret.) gladys pecci, paraguayan vice minister of national defense



							“only 5.6 percent of the total [paraguayan] armed forces’ personnel are women, and we want to increase this number. the ministry of defense and the armed forces are being very receptive to breaking established structural paradigms, which allow women to fill certain roles, because we believe that democracy is enhanced when there is inclusion of women in the defense field.”

major general william l. thigpen, u.s. army south commanding general



“the collaboration and partnership that comes with an exercise like this [southern vanguard 22] is extremely important to us. it builds interoperability. it also allows us to understand each other’s capabilities. but most importantly, it builds camaraderie down to the tactical level, as well as readiness for both countries, and partnership.”
