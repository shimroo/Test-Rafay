westfield's twelve soldiers
by maureen b. o'connor (westfield resident)

westfield's twelve pillars dedicated to the 9/11 men:
	alameno, campbell, davidson, eberling, fogel, 
	glasser, keene, madden, salerno, shum, starita, and walsh. 
	remind me of soldiers all lined up in a row. 
	little did they know 
	such a tragedy would come their way 
	on that september day.
	
	all lined up for all to see, 
	reminding us how evil some men can be.
	i watch as people walk by,
	some break down and cry,
	others ponder, why they had to die. 
	i've heard some sigh, 
	remembering how he was a great guy. 
	commuters rushing to work slow down to stop to say hi. 
	our brave soldiers had a lot to bear 
	even though these were soldiers without a uniform to wear. 
	our 12 brave men will always be a part of our town 
	you will always be remembered, 
	we will never let you down.
