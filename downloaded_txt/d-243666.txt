the opportunity to hang out with a bunch of riders around the campfire in the evening, discussing the ride experience from the day, is a great ending before heading to bed.          scott wachs i just wanted to take a minute to let you know last weeks base camp alpha experience was just incredible. first of all the modification due to weather was brilliant, the ground we covered was beautiful and challenging but not overly intimidating. read more.    scott wachs coulterville, ca.. i just wanted to take a minute to let you know last weeks base camp alpha experience was just incredible. first of all the modification due to weather was brilliant, the ground we covered was beautiful and challenging but not overly intimidating. arrival sunday night i felt like i was being greeted by old friends or like i was coming home. thats the overview, totally satisfied.  now a couple details, your staff, all of them so far are nothing short of amazing, they really don’t make me feel like some client with a bunch of money there to pay to have a good time. your staff makes me feel like i’m part of something bigger and i really enjoy the whole experience. i have now had the opportunity to work with six of your coaches, they are all a little different as they are all individuals but they are also 100% first class highly capable instructors, being a good rider is difficult but teaching it is a whole other level of difficulty. i’m very impressed. i had the the opportunity to ride tuesday with jeff and barty, it had to be one of the greatest rides of my life. i felt really challenged but i never felt intimidated or in any serious danger, just right at my limit but not to the point i felt i was going to get in trouble. i really like those guys and we became friends which is special to me because i’m sort of a lone wolf and making friends doesn’t come easily to me. i also made a couple new friends with other clients and i am probably going to ride to the grand canyon in september with one of them who will be picking up a bike from you, (rob). thanks for all you do !!
