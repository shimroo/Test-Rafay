history of the china cabinet






porcelain is a type of ceramic that is delicate and beautiful. originally, these fine pieces came from the east and thus europeans dubbed them as “china.”




these became all the rage for the rich ladies and lords of europe, especially in england and everyone had to have one. these delicate pieces were richly designed and beautiful and thus people used them for display, as well as for special occasion dining.




 in the late 17th century, the first china cabinet was built for queen mary, who loved collecting these ceramics. she had an extensive collection of blue and white china patterns and she had craftsmen from her native netherlands build her special cabinets to display this collection.




of course once the queen had one, everyone had to have one and soon cabinet makers were making their own type of china cabinets.



perhaps one of the most popular cabinetmaker was thomas chippendale. in the 1700s, chippendale created a vast array or furniture, including china cabinets. today, these are some of the more sought-after today and a chippendale china cabinet can fetch good prices at auctions and antique shops. other popular styles are french country (shabby chic), mission style and victorian gothic style.

place your antiques in an oak china cabinet






are your small antique items scattered all over the house instead of inside an oak corner china cabinets? perhaps some are displayed on top of the fireplace mantel while others are on the shelves. maybe some are even on top of the piano! yes, visitors can easily notice and admire your antiques when you place them on such prominent places as these.





however, you should also remember you are leaving your precious items vulnerable to accidental breakages if they are out in the open. that's why you should place them instead in a sturdy china cabinet oak with transparent glass windows.
