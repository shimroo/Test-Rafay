aircraft parts and components
with the success of the bell model 204 design a need was identified for a larger and more powerful version of this helicopter. the result was the model 205 with a lengthened fuselage that accommodated 12 to 14 troops and a larger main rotor blade system. the model 205 prototype first flew in 1961 and deliveries as the uh-1d started in august 1963.
an upgraded 1,400 shp (1044 kw) t53-l-13 engine was added to create the uh-1h model, most uh-1d aircraft eventually being converted. the uh-1h is the most common example of the bell model 205 helicopter.

mro, exchange and non-destructive testing services
the lasting success of the uh-1h has led to the design of upgrades to improve the performance and capability of the type. one of the more common upgrades is the bell helicopter uh-1hp huey ii.
introduced in the early 1990’s, the huey ii upgrade adds a 1,800 shp (1344 kw) honeywell t53-l-703 engine. the kit upgrades the drive train with model 212 / uh-1n components including a 1,290 shp (960 kw) transmission. the conversion increases the gross external weight of a uh-1h from 9,500 lbs to 10,500 lbs, about 600 lbs greater capacity than a standard uh-1h helicopter.

sell consign or trade parts & components
the bell model 204 was the leading design for a us army competition in the 1950’s to provide a helicopter capable of medical evacuations as well as instrument flight training. entering into production in the late 1950’s the hu-1a was quickly revised into the hu-1b with larger main rotor blade system and a larger cabin. the powerplant was also upgraded from the t53-l-1 turboshaft engine to a 960 shp (716 kw) t53-l-5 engine and later an 1,100 shp (820 kw) t53-l-11 engine. the helicopter designation hu-1 was revised in 1962 to uh-1.
a number of variants have been created from the model 204, including: uh-1c which superseded the uh-1b design, uh-1e for the usmc, th-1f and uh-1f for the usaf using a general electric t58-ge-3 engine, th-1l and uh-1l for the us navy using the upgraded t53-l-13 engine, and the uh-1m for the us army. agusta and fuji both produced variants under license from bell.
