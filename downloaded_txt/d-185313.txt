marine steam model supplies


fast steam launch âproject xâ



this model is our vision for a 50 foot fast commuter launch and day boat of the early
    1900s for use on inland waters. it is not based on any particular prototype. this
    project started as the 10th kit we have designed and has remained as âproject xâ.


working dinghy âhenryâ


âhenryâ  is a 1/6th scale model of a typical clinker built, steam powered working
    dinghy of 15ft  6 inches length, used for small vessel harbour towage, as a tender
    to larger vessels at anchor, or for pleasure.
