	 approaching one year
	 
    

some of you have been e-mailing me, asking me questions like, "where are you," or "why have you disabled comments on your website?"i have devoted a lot of time to maintaining this website, hoping to do something helpful for our community. i have done so, believing that those who oversee wilkes-barre twp. planned to enforce ordinances that were enacted to protect our community from the harm caused by sexually oriented businesses. it's too late now to save efo, but it's not too late to save the rest of the business community.in april, this website will reach the one year mark. in that time, wilkes-barre twp. has yet to enforce a single ordinance pertaining to sexually oriented businesses. nor have they enforced the community ban on byob establishments.i know that some will be disappointed, but i'm taking a little break from the regular updates. if wilkes-barre twp. actually does something to curtail the spread of sexually oriented businesses in our community, i will be the first to sing their praises. as it stands now, i get the impression that they could care less.maybe i'm wrong, but i can't help feeling that the township has spent nearly a year relying on this website to do what it should have been doing all along.your turn.

remember these headlines?strip club fight strip club raises coach concerns.w-b twp. strip club withdraws suit over ordinances: club 10 plus said recently passed restrictions on all-nude dancing should not apply there.club owner finds no lack of interest in stripping jobsclub patrons targeted by anonymous web siteweb site posts license plates of alleged strip-club visitorswilkes-barre township determined to halt alcohol use at strip clubclub owner defies wilkes-barre township to enforce ordinancestrip club sues over w-b twp. regulationswilkes-barre township: ballot question could dry up strip clubthis website began because of my frustration with wilkes-barre twp. over their inability to prevent an all-nude strip club from opening near our mall and arena. there are always going to be people who try to bring businesses that sell sex to our communities. the job of local officials is to look out for our best interests, stay on the ball, and prevent things like this from happening.when i was first interviewed by sue henry on wilk, i mentioned a few things that were brushed off by some callers. i stated that strip clubs have a negative effect on businesses that are located near them. the closest business to gentlemen's club 10 was efo furniture and i stated that the club would hurt their business. less than a year later, efo has been forced to re-locate because people don't want to shop at a store that shares a parking lot with a strip club. i wish efo the best and i hope that they are able to successfully re-establish their business in short order.i also stated that strip clubs encourage/promote prostitution. guess who gentlemen's club 10 hired this past spring to come as a "featured dancer"...... a woman who is one of the most widely known prostitutes in america. a woman who bragged about her acts of prostitution while on fox news channel's o'reilly factor.i stated that strip clubs influence children in negative ways. teenagers are glued to the internet and use it almost constantly. gentlemen's club 10 took the time to advertise a pornographic website on their building and on interstate 81. how many young people do you suppose took the time to visit that website? from there, gentlemen's club 10 started a myspace page. myspace is used by tens of millions of teens throughout this country. thankfully, myspace removed their original page because of inappropriate sexual content. now the club has a new web presence.all this to say, that the problems associated with strip clubs don't go away without the involvement of our local elected officials and law enforcement. i recognize that gentlemen's club 10 has threatened repeated lawsuits against wilkes-barre twp. and township officials are probably not crazy about the thought of spending a lot of time and effort fighting them in court. still, it would be nice to see them doing something to stop the negative effects that always accompany sexually-oriented businesses.it would also be nice to see the township enforcing their ordinances pertaining to sexually oriented businesses. the club's argument that they are "grandfathered in" is a very weak argument. townships have the right to enact new ordinances when they are necessary to protect the public interest. townships also have the right to enforce byob bans when local residents vote them into law.i will never understand why wilkes-barre twp. lets a strip club get away with thumbing their nose at an entire community.

	 sexual addictions
	 
    

i hold the men and women who serve in our military in very high regard.  i don't know if gentlemen's club 10 is still doing so, but i was told that for a time, they were encouraging our servicemen to visit the club by offering admission discounts (much like their student discounts....by the way, i have noticed that the club is now specifying in their ads that they require a "college id" not just a "student id."  i can't help but wonder if we encouraged that clarification.)it is being reported that sexual addictions, including pornography addictions, are growing among some members of our military.  you can read more about that by clicking here.  many of these individuals are struggling daily to break the bonds of sexual addiction.the men and women who serve in our military deserve our respect.  i think it would be wonderful if people didn't encourage them to spend their time and money at strip clubs.

	 entertained by bondage?
	 
    

is "bondage" something that should be de-stigmatized? gentlemen's club 10 has advertized several "bondage nights" at their club. i would contend that bondage is a very harmful thing and should not be encouraged. people really need to ask themselves if "sexual bondage" is the kind of behavior we want to encourage nepa residents to engage in.this evening, wbre-28 covered a breaking news story out of central florida. according to the story, "investigators said christopher wood took a woman against her will and raped her to make a sexually explicit bondage video, wesh 2 news reported."you can read the entire story and view the video of wesh's news report by clicking here.further developments as of 1/16/07 can be read by clicking here.

	 efo furniture galleries moving
	 
    

when it was announced that a strip club would be opening on mundy street and sharing its parking lot with efo furniture (i'm sure to efo's great dismay), many of us wondered what kind of effect this would have on efo's business.efo has now announced that they are re-locating to a new site.one can only wonder how long the building efo is moving out of will remain vacant. my guess is that it will remain vacant for as long as it shares a parking lot with a strip club.and now the blight begins.

	 someone who knows
	 
    

since last april when this website began, i have encouraged people of faith to be in prayer for the women who have become caught up in stripping and other forms of sexual entertainment.  many of you have been faithful to do so and i truly appreciate it.from time to time, i have received e-mails from women who work at area strip clubs.  they often express feelings of disgrace and despair.  many of them do not have strong families to lean on for support when they need it.  many of them feel stuck and are looking for a way out.the other day, i received an e-mail from a woman who dances in a topless club in southeast pa.  i appreciated her insight and asked her permission to post the text of her e-mail, with the assurance that i would not reveal her name or location.the full text of her e-mail is included below.  please be in prayer for her that things begin to turn around and she finds a job she can be proud of.  i believe she would appreciate that.i know there are other women who read this blog who can identify with her struggle.  please know that we are in prayer for you as well.mr family---mr. family,i have never been to any of the clubs in wilkes barre, but i am a stripper in a topless club in ______.  i started earlier this year at 30 years old.  i have a bs in business management and was an internal auditor for several years.  i worked very hard for my education, working the night shift at the front desk at a local resort full time and going to college during the day.  for a while i was doing ok.  last year at this time i was doing very well in my professional career.  then due to market and other conditions, i was laid off in april.  in the last couple years because of sarbanes-oxley legislation internal auditors were in high demand, so i wasn't too worried, and i did get a severance package when i was laid off so i thought everything would be fine.of course, by then the spike in demand for auditors was dropping.  by now pretty much everyone has the hang of the sarbanes reequirements and the bulk of the work is done.  the doucmentation has to be updated every year, but it is no where near as much work as it was doing it for the first time.  it is now january and i still don't have a job.  i am starting to get some interest in my resume so i can hope for things to get better, but i am afraid to get my hopes up too, and i no longer have the confidence i used to have so i am afraid maybe i won't interview as well as i did before.either way, i live alone, have never been married and there is no safety net for me, and no other source of income to rely on.  i have to survive one way or another.  i feel as though my identity as a person is falling apart.  i have become little more than a sex object and although most of the customers are polite and i am lucky enough to work for a club that does not promote "turning tricks" and is very strict about the rule i still am in the business of selling sex even though i worked hard to have a "real" career that i could be proud of. i am depressed and cry a lot, i am much older than most of the other girls i work with and unfortunately much smarter.  i am not taken in by the excuses they make and know full well how degrading it is to me and women in general to take my top off for money.  i would love to stop, but i know of no other way to make enough money to cover my bills and living expenses.  minimum wage at walmart simply would not cut it for me.  before i was laid off i was making 45k a year and i even have savings, which have long since disappered.lately, theree ar more girls than ever dancing and often there are more girls than customers so it is even more difficult to make money, forcing me to work more hours doing something i detest. i don't think clubs are to blame though.  i think society is to blame.  if there were no demand, there would not be any clubs.  the patrons are the ones that make clubs profitable and it is pathetic that a woman's sexual assets are more valuble than her brains, education, or work ethic.  it is a male dominated society that causes these problems, not just club owners. the whole thing makes me sick and i am tired of it.  none of my male colleages have had the trouble getting a new job that i have.  i always dressed very conservatively at the office, didn't wear much makeup and always wore my hair up.  i was never looked at a sex object, however the women who showed a lot of cleavage and tight pants seemed to be treated better even in a professional setting.  it just seems that whether the compensation is monetary or not women that flaunt themselves are compensated better. anyway, thanks for reading this rant even though there is nothing anyone can do to make it better.  i hope you guys are able to make a difference for someone somehow because as long as women are treated this way and it is accepted in our society things will not get better. frustrated and hopeless,_______

	 violence against women
	 
    

i recently read a study that was compiled by kelly holsopple, a former stripper and the co-founder of the metropolitan coalition against prostitution in minneapolis, minnesota.you can read the entire study by clicking here. my hope is that local women who have been considering stripping as a viable financial option will read every last detail about what they are choosing to embark on. i would also hope that women who are already involved in stripping will learn more about the cycle of destruction that these businesses create and promote.the study is three pages long and includes great insight into the many ways strip clubs bring serious harm to both women and men. if you do not have the time or patience to read the entire report, i have included several quotes below.please be advised that the study includes a great deal of information that may shock and offend you. because of its graphic detail, i debated whether or not to link to it. please use discretion if you choose to read it. in the end, i believe it serves to give us all a valuable glimpse of the ways women are being degraded, right under our noses.the organization and conditions of stripclubs not only produce and reproduce gender inequality, but facilitate and normalize men’s violence against women. sexual violence has been normalized, institutionalized, and legalized in the stripclub industry as socially sanctioned male behavior. stripclubs and the men associated with stripclubs have turned acts of violence into entertainment and tied male sexual pleasure to victimizing and exploiting. stripclubs are structured according to male domination and control, and are inherently violent. it is impossible to set up stripclubs without sexual violence and that is reason to challenge the legitimacy of stripclubs. one hundred percent of the eighteen women in the survey report being physically abused in the stripclub. women find out about stripping from a variety of sources. upscale stripclub franchises recruit in new cities by having managers and imported dancers scout in nightclubs. most women find out about stripping from girlfriends already in stripping, male associates, the media, and some from prior involvement in prostitution. one woman told how she loitered in and around urban stripclubs to pick up customers when she was fifteen and how her pimp eventually drove her to small town strip bars because those bars admitted her and hired her. someone else got involved in stripping through an escort service for bachelor parties. another young woman who went to a gentlemen’s club to pick up her friend recounted her recruitment as an eighteen-year-old. she waited at the bar, was served alcohol, and the owner asked to check her i.d. instead of censuring her for drinking, he told her she would make $1000 per week and pressured her to enter the amateur contest that night. she won the contest, $300, and worked there three weeks before being recruited into an escort service by a patron pimp. forty four percent of the women report that men associated with the stripclub have threatened to hurt them physically.one woman new to stripping was dumbfounded at how little money she was making taking her clothes off, so she asked the manager for his advice on increasing tips. he suggested turning tricks and said he could help her set up dates. management sets up tricks, says it is good for business, and obligates women to turn over money from prostitution to the club. women say prostitution is promoted even though owners tell women they would be punished if they turn tricks. some stripclubs are notorious for promoting prostitution. women characterize customers as scum, psycho mama’s boys, rapists and child molesters, old perverted men, idiots, *******, and pigs. strippers are largely disgusted by customers and describe them as pitiful and pathetic, stupid and ignorant, sick, controlling and abusive.women in this study undoubtedly denounce stripclub owners as pimps and "glorified pimps" and maintain that owners misuse power and are sick. the women also label managers as pimps citing that they mistreat women, that they make every attempt to take money from the women, and that they are sick because they are affiliated with the industry and know the harm they do.

	 students targeted
	 
    

seeking to cash in on the sexual curiosity of young people, gentlemen's club 10 is offering deep discounts off their normal admission if you present a student id at the door. apparently, quite a few of our local high-school students have taken them up on this offer.  where did i first learn this? this came from a high-school senior at one of our local high schools.i can't think of anything the club has done at this point that has better illustrated their deep-seated desire to turn our children into paying customers at their sex club.is it possible that this student discount has been timed to coincide with the christmas season when many young people will have some extra cash on hand?

	 bondage at club 10
	 
    

gentlemen's club 10's latest attempt to draw people in involves some very strange sexual practices. most specifically, i'm referring to what is called "bondage." in several recent advertisements, gentlemen's club 10 has advertised specific evenings where "bondage shows" are available in their "private rooms."i bring this up because in the uk, they are currently searching for some nutcase who apparently has a "bondage fetish" and he's going around hurting and killing women to satisfy this appetite. you can read all about it right here. this is a major story in the uk right now. it is also being covered by all the major american news networks.this is the kind of deviant sexual behavior that a business like gentlemen's club 10 blatantly encourages. women should not be treated this way or portrayed in such a fashion. it is dangerous.i would hope that if local law enforcement is reading this blog they will look into this. preventing this kind of behavior is much better than trying to cure the problems it creates.

	 the new culture of northeast pa
	 
    

i am saddened to see the cultural decline that is occurring here in northeast pa. it's so unfortunate to watch this decline accelerate as the years progress.1. strip clubs are popping up all over.2. gambling has been legalized and will feed another unhealthy addiction.3. local radio stations are filled with inappropriate commentary.4. 97.9 has a billboard on 81 south near dickson city that portrays a nude woman covering her breasts.the only way this trend will be stopped is if our hearts are changed. we can take pictures of cars. we can formalize our complaints to local media and elected officials. but if we want to see lasting change, people need to recognize their need for christ. without the change of heart that he produces, we'll spend our days simply putting out fires.i have hope.  i am becoming more and more convinced that we will begin to see this change occur.  call me crazy (because i am), but i'm praying to that end.  please join me in that prayer.

	 like vegas?
	 
    

i remember when gentlemen's club 10 was preparing to open. they claimed that they wanted to be a "classy" strip joint like they have in vegas. can there be such a thing as a "classy strip joint?"at gentlemen's club 10, you can pay nude women to simulate sex on your body. club 10 brags about the fact that you can pay for a "lap dance" inside their establishment. i won't go into great detail, but let's just say this has nothing to do with "dancing" or "artistic expression."i have to thank a reader of this site for sending me a link to an article posted on netscape today. this article points out a few reasons why state supreme courts and federal courts (especially those with juristriction over las vegas) are prohibiting what is commonly referred to as a "lap dance."lap dancing promotes prostitutionlap dancing promotes the spread of sexually transmitted diseaseslap dancing is often tied to other vices, such as drug offenses and other criminal activitygentlemen's club 10 is promoting or creating a culture of depravity in wilkes-barre twp. but i guess we're left to assume that as long as they're making money, nothing else really matters.in sin city vegas, erotic dancers must keep distance

whether sexual addiction takes the form of extramarital affairs, frequenting strip clubs, compulsive masturbation, exhibitionism or surfing the internet for porn, it's as destructive as any other dependency. the dismissive attitude that exercising self-control is all it takes to end inappropriate behavior absolves the accuser from considering the deeper truth.while i don't agree with every last point made in this article, i am pleased that it brings to light the true problem of sexual addiction. read on if you're looking for help to overcome such an addiction.when lust takes oversexual addiction is way more than a bad habit

after attending a concert at the arena last night (friday), we drove by adolescent's club 10.  the time was about 11:00pm which, according to club supporters, is a pretty busy time for the club.  the lot was mostly empty (with the exception of a tractor trailer that was illegally parked).for a club that boasts a capacity of 1300, it looked like they might have had about 30.this begs the question... how is the club still open?  readers of this blog have stated that the club is not paying its bills.  are the owners of the building forgiving their rent payments?  are the not-so-public investors delaying re-payment?a business that isn't profitable can only stay open for so long.

	 exploited women
	 
    

using a strong female voice and beat-driven music, a local radio ad informs mothers of a way out of poverty--by working in gentlemen's clubs."you don't have to be poor anymore," the ad says. "call us and change your life today. ... it's a once in a lifetime opportunity to be financially independent."this is an excerpt from a radio ad that was run for a while by a strip club that was looking for some "new talent." how are many women ending up in this kind of lifestyle? what are the main forces that are influencing them to pursue this kind of life?difficult family backgrounddependence on illegal drugsabsence of a loving fatherunwed pregnanciesthe promise of easy money (without an explanation of the true consequences)the more i have learned about the problems strip clubs create, the more compassion i have felt for the women who get lured into that lifestyle. a huge percentage of them have never experienced or accepted the kind of unconditional love that we have been created by god to receive (from both him and our families). they spend their lives trying to ultimately find acceptance and love, but all they find is lust, infatuation, greed and abuse.for those of you who pray regularly, please take a moment today to pray for these women. if the lord doesn't change a person's heart, lasting change will never take effect. please pray that even though they may come from backgrounds where unconditional love was absent, they will come to experience and accept the forgiving, unconditional love of god.

"your myspace.com profile may not include the following items: telephone numbers, street addresses, last names, and any photographs containing nudity, or obscene, lewd, excessively violent, harassing, sexually explicit or otherwise objectionable subject matter."a big thank you to myspace for addressing our concern that our children not be constantly bombarded with such inappropriate content.other info:gentlemen's club 10 is currently revamping their original website.  because their site is advertised on 81 south and on the exterior of their building (in full view of children), it is a violation of community sign standards for them to post nude, pornographic, lewd or sexually explicit material or links to such material.  this is what they did when they first established their website.  if their site does post this kind of information, please let us know so we can begin contacting the proper authorities.

	 corruption of minors?  you decide.
	 
    

in recent weeks, gentlemen's club 10 has set up a myspace page. for those who are unaware, myspace is a networking / friends website that is used primarily by teenagers. i believe the club resorted to setting up this page because they were forced to remove their pornographic content from their main website (in order to continue advertising their web address on their signs and billboards).in the six months that gentlemen's club 10 has been open, they have worked hard to attract teenagers to their strip club. they have lowered the entrance age to 18. they are establishing a web presence on myspace. they are doing everything they can to lure the young people of our area into their club, including hiring at least one teenager to strip at the club.for this reason, i complained to myspace about what the club is doing. they reviewed the club's myspace website and several days ago, they removed it because it violated the myspace terms of use.  in addition to posting address and phone info. (a big myspace no-no), they also posted partially nude / suggestive / sexually explicit pictures of women stripping. they have also posted a link to a porn website through one of their "slide shows."unfortunately, gentlemen's club 10 is back to their old tricks. once they were taken off the web by myspace, they reposted all of their lewd content. i have submitted an additional complaint to myspace about this activity. if you are a myspace user, please voice your displeasure to their complaint department. we must do everything in our power to prevent gentlemen's club 10 from drawing our children into their debased manner of living.one more thing.... unfortunately, several dj's from 98.5 krz are also supporting gentlemen's club 10's myspace presence by linking to their page and encouraging people to go there. years ago, i used to listen to krz, but they are becoming too hypersexualized for my taste and i'm ashamed of them for not giving much thought to the influence they have on the youth of our community.

	 ordinances
	 
    

supporters of "dirty old men's club 10" seem to be under the impression that wilkes-barre township cannot enact new ordinaces that apply to them. not true. a township has the ability to enact and enforce ordinances that are in the public's best interest at any point.case in point: strip club closed after new ordinance takes effect

	 news update
	 
    

it's always good to know what other areas around the country are doing to prevent their communities from being over-run by sexually oriented businesses.just as our local officials have chosen not to enforce ordinances that were in place before gentlemen's club 10 opened its doors, so too are officials in other areas of the country failing to take a stand for the people.much of this comes down to the fact that inevitably, this conflict always results in lawsuits. gentlemen's club 10 has already flexed their litigious muscles and little has been done to defend the people in the wake of their lawsuits. i guess i can't blame the leadership of wilkes-barre twp. for being hesitant to foot the bill to battle yet another lawsuit from the club..... but there is help available.the city council that is mentioned in this news update has sought the help of the alliance defense fund in their battle to keep their community safe, clean and moral for all residents. i believe that if our local officials sought their help, we might find ourselves making better progress in this effort.city council accepts aid to block sex shops.

	 bait on a fishing rod
	 
    

to the men who patronize gentlemen's & adolescent's club 10....would you like to know what the dancers think of you? would you like to know how silly you look in their eyes? would you like to know that your fantasy is just a scam?here's one more line from the stripper at gentlemen's club 10 who wrote the comments in the previous post."the guys in the club are like bait on a fishing rod, only were fishing for money, not the guys."gentlemen's club 10 fosters a pathetic circle of people using each other. in the end, everyone is degraded.

	 a stripper's view
	 
    

i have stated from the beginning that the women who strip at clubs like gentlemen's club 10 find themselves in a cycle of depression and despair....and often they feel quite powerless to do anything about it.many strippers are prostitutes and drug users who use sex as their tool to obtain drug money. some strippers are young girls without a strong family structure to support them. for many of them, stripping seems like a quick way to get ahead, yet what they end up finding is that it ruins their lives. it destroys their self-confidence. it damages their relationships. it prevents them from dating or marrying.their lives are exploited and ruined in order to line the pockets of greedy club owners.take a look at the thoughts of a woman who strips at gentlemen's club 10. please tell me what she thinks about her quality of life. (please excuse the spelling errors. this is cut and pasted just as she typed it).fisrt of all, its hard being 19 years old and being the only single one out of all of your friends. i seem to have a hard time trying to date someone. some how it always comes in the way of the relationnship. which in my eyes i dont belive it should. if there is trust in the relationship there should be no problems as loing as im going home to the guy im with...does anyone agree or disagree ? latley i cant even see or dat a guy for more than 3 weeks because the cant deal with the dancing thing. i hate to be judged by people, i am not your typical dancer. im not the drug user or prostitute as alot of dancers are. i am a 19 year old who lives on my own and has wlel over a few grand a month in bills and who has to pay her way through school, i am there for money and only money, not drugs or sexual favors.it would relaly be nice for me to be able to lvie a regular life...... and not the stipper life..... do you think i like being told im not good enough to be on stage or that im ugly? most of the time at work im getting pout down, and i tihnk that any girl who can deal with dancing is a good person, and no i dont mean the druggies or prostitutes i mean the single mothers and the college students..... we make our money a little bit diff then most people, but were sitll owrking jsut like you are.thank you gentlemen's club 10 for ruining her life. i hope you're happy with yourselves.

	 inside scoop
	 
    

"gentlemen's club 10 is covering up full-fledged sexual activity at their club (but they won't be able to cover it up for long)." a.r.how much are their dancers doing when a customer pays for a "vip"? what forms of sexual activity do you consider legal and lawful in the strip club context?the comment board is open to those who have been e-mailing me with information. i don't get the impression that these people necessarily share my passion to rid our area of sexually oriented businesses, but they do have some very interesting claims to make about the club.the comment board is open to these e-mailers or to those who would dispute their claims.
