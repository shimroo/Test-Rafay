exclusive designs
located in the heart of southeast asia is a small island called bali. bali, indonesia has been known for its wholesale silver jewelry and other fine arts and crafts for over half a century. for decades bali has been a major source of sterling silver jewelry for smaller jewelry wholesale and retail outlets. in the last few years many technical advancements have taken place in bali altering the style of the balinese silver jewelry produced here. although we produce our silver jewelry in bali, we have our own exclusive style of designing which is quite different from the normal balinese ethnic sterling silver jewelry found in the jewelry market today.
casting silver jewelry provides consistent quality
we utilize top of the line casting equipment to produce our wholesale sterling silver jewelry. the two most common problems in both cast and handmade sterling silver jewelry are fire scale and porosity. our silver jewelry is vacuum cast in a neutral gas environment which helps eliminate both of these problems. using hi-tech casting equipment gives us the quality and consistency to provide our customers with a clean sterling silver jewelry product that keeps their customers satisfied. not to mention the quick production times! even if we are out of stock on an item we can produce it in a matter of just a few days eliminating back orders.
