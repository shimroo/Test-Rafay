discover 

a moroccan desert hideaway 

korakia pensione began hosting visiting artists and musicians in the 1920s, when painter gordon coutts built a moroccan hideaway to recreate his life in tangier. the mediterranean villa next door was owned by silent screen star j. carrol naish. today, the two historic properties are a 1.5-acre petite resort known as one of the premiere palm springs hotels—a hidden oasis of secret gardens, pools, lounges, and fountains among 28 villas and homes.   



our story
















relax 

stay and renew your soul 

renew your soul in our individually designed rooms that, like you, have a name—not a number. one-of-a-kind vintage pieces, custom furniture and thoughtful touches let you know we care about your stay in palm springs. our historic villas feel like a place from another time (we keep technology out of sight to honor our setting), but we haven’t held back on great wi-fi. you can also select albums from our library of vintage vinyl to play on the turntable in your room. choose from 16 mediterranean and 12 moroccan villas and homes, each distinctive in character, with features like high wood beam ceilings, private patios with striking views of the san jacinto mountains, or even a suite with a full kitchen, stone bathtub, and wood-burning fireplace at the center of j. carol naish’s own 1930s villa.
