uk indymedia : 1999 - 2016
28-04-2017 20:19






open publishing was disabled on this site in mid-july 2016 as there was a very low volume of original grass roots news reports from activists being posted and the collective running the site was dwindling as people were working on other things. from 1st may 2017 this site is a static archive and will no longer be updated.the history of uk indymedia is somewhat documented under the indymedia topic but the full history is yet to be written and perhaps never will be... but this archive will remain available.see you in the streets!

build gardens not prisons
08-09-2015 18:53






the campaign against a new mega-prison being built near wrexham got a boost recently when the reclaim the fields network held an action camp nearby.the reclaim the fields international action camp, attended by 100-150 people, ran from 28th august to the 2nd september 2015 and was hosted by a local anti-fracking site. workshops explored the links between land struggles, prison abolition and other issues including gender, animal liberation and freedom of movement.people held evening noise demos at three prisons in the region in solidarity with those inside, leafletted the local town, and picketed several companies involved in the mega-prison. finally a blockade of the construction site held up lorries for over 4 hours without any arrests.as anyone with experience of them knows, prisons are abusive places used to control and threaten people, particularly those of us who are working class, people of colour, or disobedient. we need justice processes based on strong, vibrant communities, not more prisons and cops harming our communities.the new prison would be the biggest in the uk, and the second biggest in europe. it aims to open in 2017 and would give the state enough cages to lock up an extra 2100 people.meanwhile, robert king of the angola 3 will give a talk on struggle and revolution in the us prison system, on wed 16 sep in dundee.community action on prison expansion | reclaim the fields uk | gardens not cages | frack free wrexham | borras community protection camp

maximus: same circus, different clowns
05-03-2015 23:42






on monday 2nd of march 2015, there were demonstrations in over 30 towns and cities around the uk (plus toronto) against maximus, the us based health insurance corporation that has taken over the contract from the french it company atos to administer the work capability assessment on behalf of the department of work and pensions. atos announced its exit from the contract in early 2014 following an intense period of direct action against the company by groups such as disabled people against the cuts.the day of action was timed to coincide with the first working day of the new contract, with the spotlight turned on maximus as well as the continued use of work capability assessments and the life-threatening consequences of the ongoing government attacks on the sick and disabled.in central london, to the chorus of "david cameron is a w*****" (youtube) activists from dpac hit the streets, taking direct action to block traffic and at one stage bringing traffic to a standstill on victoria street in the shadow of big ben.the demonstrations across the uk on the streets were complemented with an online twitter campaign using the hashtags #maximarse and #scrapwca, the latter trending for a number of hours. this gave the opportunity for those unable (including through sickness and disability) to make it to demonstrations to vent their anger and frustation around the work capability assessment and at a government hell-bent on targeting the sick and disabled.on the newswire: maximarse is more than a farce | mental health resistance network statement | wrexham joins national day of protest against wca & maximusother links: johnny void | video: maximarse the movie (youtube)

police serve bytemark with production order for bristol indymedia information
01-09-2014 20:58






bristol indymedia has been hosted on a bytemark debian virtual server since the last server seizure in 2005 [ 1 | 2 ], during the run up to the g8. from then up until november 2013 the site was running oscailt, in march 2014 it was re-launched as a wordpress site "using the software modremoveip". on 14th august 2014 bristol indymedia switched off open publishing on the site for a summer break with the intention in september to "review whether we have the time and inclination to turn publishing back on".on 27th august 2014 bristol indymedia reported that, "the police had a court order to access the bristol indymedia server. we don’t know for sure, but assume that our web hosts have complied with the order and given the police this access". bristol indymedia disabled open publishing on the server and said "it is unlikely that open publishing of news items will ever be re-enabled as it would require complete re-installation of the server".since then the only source of further information has been from an article in the times which reported that the pace special procedure production order obtained by avon and somerset police and served on bytemark on 15th august 2014 "demands access to the details of administrators and bill-payers, login credentials, information on those who posted articles and the ip addresses of everyone who visited the site over an unspecified period". the court order served on bytemark hasn't been published. the times has reported that the police have said that, "no arrests have been made in connection with this incident".corporate coverage: [ the times: activist website indymedia shuts down after police raid (repost) | the bristol post: anarchist website bristol indymedia to close following police raid (repost) | bristol24-7: bristol indymedia offline for good after police raid ]activist coverage: [ urban75: indymedia bristol raided by plod, servers accessed! | libcom: sources and the police raid on bristol indymedia ]

police action against bristol indymedia
28-08-2014 18:27

bristol indymedia reported on 27th august 2014 that:the police have physically accessed the bristol indymedia server.last week we heard from our web hosts that the police had a court order to access the bristol indymedia server. we don’t know for sure, but assume that our web hosts have complied with the order and given the police this access.we consider this server to be compromised, users should assume that from this point on the police have access to the ip address of anyone accessing this site.in light of this it is unlikely that open publishing of news items will ever be re-enabled as it would require complete re-installation of the server.we are going to leave the calendar on for now, but note that it is likely that ip addresses are now being recorded and accessed by the police.

updates to the indymedia newswire
16-02-2014 22:44






the uk indymedia collective met this weekend in wales. amongst other things, we have agreed some changes to the newswire. the default view will now be the promoted newswire — articles that have been read and promoted by a member of the collective. this will mean that newly published articles won't immediately appear on the front page of the site but can be viewed by clicking through to the open newswire. we hope these changes will encourage people to post content that meets the editorial guidelines.

new squatting law starts to crumble - keep squatting!
11-11-2013 22:31






section 144 of laspo may prove unenforceable in practiceresistance to s.144 of the legal aid, sentencing and punishment of offenders act (laspo) 2012 that outlaws squatting in residential buildings is growing. ultimately, the law may prove unworkable and unenforceable. there have been a number of successful prosecutions under the new law, including the widely publicised conviction and imprisonment of 21 year old alex haigh who came to london looking for work and stayed in an unoccupied housing association flat. he pleaded guilty, but it has since become clear that where a not guilty plea is entered by defendant, it may be difficult if not impossible for the prosecution to prove the charge. after some notable acquittals, we have a better idea about the obstacles facing hapless prosecutors and some of the ways in which well-informed residential squatters might go about successfully defending themselves in court. read on.on the newswire: brighton acquittals 1 | brighton acquittals 2 | moelfre acquittal | squatting as protest in southwark | mike weatherley is a coward case | alex haigh conviction | henry: bristol's first victim of squatting criminalisationother links: squatters legal network | advisory service for squatters | rooftop resistance | squash
