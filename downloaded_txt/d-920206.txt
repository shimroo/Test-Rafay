our impact



each year, over 500 animals that would have been euthanized in overcrowded shelters are given a second chance by the animal alliance of new jersey.  these abused, injured, ill and infirm animals are alone and without a voice. animal alliance helps those who have no time left -- where every animal rescued in a life saved. animal alliance has impacted the lives of thousands of pets and people -- through adoption and low-cost spay/neuter.
