testimonials 


















what our clients say 



















as a commercial trucking litigation supervisor, i have found hightower, stratton, novigrod & kantor to be not only extremely knowledgeable but personable and readily available. it is difficult in today’s commercial claims arena to find a defense firm who is willing to accept the challenge of mitigating the existing exposures by building a solid yet economically feasible defense. my comfort level in combatting the litigious mentality of some is by far exceeded with hightower, stratton, novigrod & kantor.terri




dale, i just wanted to let you know in all my past experience as a florida adjuster how impressive i think herb is. he does an amazing job not only with the critical incidents but in every aspect of the claim from medical specials to property damage issues. he is an incredible asset to us and our client with his consistency, reliability, responsiveness and knowledge. in our line of work folks are very quick to complain (present company included of course) and rarely take the time to call someone our when they do an amazing job. i am taking a minute to let you know but i am sure you already know that about him!

 

thank you and your team for all you do!xenia




lee and his team at hightower do a fantastic job with our construction cases. they are zealous in their defense of clients, practical in their assessments and tremendous communicators about the ins and outs of cases.  i continue to be thankful for their representation of our insureds and for their professionalism and friendship.cody




michael and his team at hightower, stratton, novigrod & kantor are incredibly knowledgeable about premises liability law and are exactly the kind of trusted partners our company values. they instill a sense of confidence by laying out the facts, case law, and risk assessment to help make well-informed decisions. they are not afraid to defend vigorously, while maintaining professionalism and civility.  if i need to engage outside counsel, i would turn to hightower, stratton, novigrod & kantor without hesitation.lauren




dan novigrod and his team are very professional, thorough, proficient, and knowledgeable.  they take time to explain matters that may be unclear and they were very flexible in scheduling. dan’s team demonstrated an ability to grasp our unique qualities and tailor their approach to the case accordingly. i absolutely would recommend them and definitely intend to continue using them for the foreseeable future!ralph




 

































diversity & inclusion 


















our many faces 



many of the firm’s fortune 500 clients have inquired about our hiring and retention practices. diversity and inclusion are the firm’s foundation and strength. we share our story with you.when a lawsuit came across our desk about a muslim patron seeking damages after a client’s restaurant unknowingly served her prohibited food, did we google to determine her complaints? no. we simply asked one of our attorneys of a similar faith and found out everything we needed to know. the resource we had in-house, was enough to discover the plaintiff’s claim was a fraud.florida is full of people who have moved here from across america and around the world. your defense firm should reflect this melting pot and include people from diverse backgrounds, nationalities, beliefs, cultures and orientation. since 1992, hightower, stratton, novigrod & kantor has cultivated a work environment for growth and acceptance as well as empower team members to bring unique ideas and perspectives to claims management. together, we have successfully protected florida businesses for nearly three decades.we continue to evolve with the changing dynamics of the us population. roughly ⅓ of the firm’s partners are hispanic or african american. firmwide, almost ½ of employees identify as racial or ethnic minorities and ⅓ are women attorneys.our firm will continue to hire and retain talented individuals of all backgrounds as we have since inception. we are proud to offer you the best legal services available from a true world view. please contact us for additional details, or if we may assist with your florida legal needs.
