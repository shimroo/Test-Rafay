linking research and outreach in support of rural vitality







established by the rural development act of 1972, the nation’s four regional rural development centers work in partnership with the land-grant university system to address crucial needs in our nation’s rural communities. the northeast regional center for rural development (nercrd) at penn state serves the 12-state region from maine to west virginia and the district of columbia.




our work



  
            economic development, resilience, and innovation          
nercrd is pursuing several lines of inquiry related to economic resilience and innovation, with a current emphasis on identifying pathways for rural recovery from the effects of the covid-19 pandemic.



  
            tourism and outdoor recreation          
recognizing that tourism, including agritourism, is an important economic development strategy for rural communities, nercrd’s research and outreach in this area are aimed at helping communities identify and leverage their tourism and outdoor recreation assets. 



  
            food systems, nutrition security, and agriculture          
nercrd’s work in this area helps communities understand the impacts of local and regional food systems and how to best capitalize on their potential benefits.



  
            capacity building and facilitation          
nercrd serves as a regional hub for our land-grant university (lgu) partners, linking research and extension faculty across state lines. by facilitating collaborative networks and partnerships, we enhance the capacity of the lgu system, so that its people can work more effectively to foster regional prosperity and rural development.
