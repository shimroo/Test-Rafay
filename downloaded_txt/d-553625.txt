what's this "middle spunk" all about, anyway?okay,
    our first banjo player ron colby lived in alexandria, and passed the "middle spunk
    creek" highway sign on i-94 quite a bit. (he later played with our friends the platte
    valley boys.)
when the band was formed in 1968, ron thought "the middle spunk creek boys"
    would make a pretty good band name. at least it's been a pretty long-lived band
    name!
