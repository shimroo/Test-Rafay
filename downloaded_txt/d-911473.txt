our program








find her voice
she’ll have academic space to discover who she is as a person. she’ll learn to express ideas convincingly (and maybe even challenge the status quo) in person and in writing.





ignite the spark of learning
we encourage your daughter to follow wherever her curiosity leads.





encourage educational continuity
national research shows girls often stall academically in middle school, but ellis students buck this trend.





think big
ellis girls are known for an intellectual sparkle that stems from knowing many different things. it’s cool here to think about big ideas.





discover what she's passionate about
that begins at ellis—and lasts for life. along the way, she’ll try many new things to uncover where her true talents and personal interests lie.





envision her future
ellis is about the journey of learning, not worrying about report cards and grades. performance isn't graded until fifth grade so that girls keep taking risks.





embrace her identity
ellis students can be more than one thing: childlike and adult, playful and competitive. it’s all part of discovering who they are.





grow independent scholars
ellis’ demanding writing program is central to every student finding her voice. instead of focusing on grammar and mechanics, ellis concentrates on organizing thoughts into coherent and persuasive arguments. our high school papers incorporate college-level thinking.





graduate ready to shake the world
our grads leave their mark at yale, penn state, mt. holyoke, purdue, and other top colleges. but who they become next is more notable: epidemiologists, book editors, engineers, county supervisors, corporate attorneys, artists, and more.





pave her own way
she'll begin finding her voice by working in teams and introducing herself to the whole school. at the end of her time in the lower school, she will be on the path to discovering the girl she is meant to be.





prepare for success
ellis starts middle school early— in fifth grade—so girls can hit the ground running in the traditional middle school years. students develop organizational skills—time management, goal setting, note-taking, prioritization, and more—that prepare them for success.





develop well-rounded learners
integrated studies builds with a new focus each year (self, community, outside world, capstone) and culminates in a “passion project” that combines all her interests. seniors create their own projects outside the school—settling refugees through nonprofits, painting educational murals in hospitals, and more.
