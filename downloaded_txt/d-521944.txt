chicago's garden center







at fmgc, our goal is to provide everything you need to celebrate the beauty of nature in an urban environment. whether you are looking for native plants, eye-catching container creations, or extraordinary wedding florals, you will discover a superior selection at fmgc. our ever-changing inventory and customized design options provide unique and beautiful solutions for each of our valued clients.

living in a large city has untold advantages; however, a significant trade-off for urban dwellers is the lack of exposure to nature and green spaces. weekend excursions and an occasional walk in the park are wonderful, but there is just no substitute for colorful blooms and lush greenery in your own backyard (or on your balcony). that is why we specialize in original container gardens, rooftop installations, interior floral design, and seasonal décor.


if you are lucky enough to have adequate outdoor space for gardening, you are sure to find everything you need at fmgc. we have an extensive selection of annuals, perennials, native plants, groundcover, trees, shrubs, and bulbs. perhaps you enjoy home-grown tomatoes, potatoes, and herbs. we have a wonderful selection, including organic seeds and plants. additionally, you will find the finest products to weed, feed, and de-bug your yard, as well as whimsical accents, accessories, and unique garden furniture.

we have a wonderful selection, including organic seeds and plants. additionally, you will find the finest products to weed, feed, and de-bug your yard, as well as whimsical accents, accessories, and unique garden furniture. chicago is a great place to live, but freezing temperatures can arrive with little warning, and winter seems to drag on



into spring more often than not. that is why we offer lots of ways to bring nature home during the cold winter months. our design team can create seasonal decor for every occasion, unique wedding florals, and we also offer contract florals for both residential and commercial clients.
