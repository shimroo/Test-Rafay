black in hampden: voices, stories and perspectives



jan 31, 2025




my project is a podcast episode called ‘black in hampden’ about being a person of color living in the hampden area, a historically predominantly white, working-class neighborhood in baltimore, known for its past reputation of racism. as a black teen in hampden, when i tell others the area i live in, i am bombarded with questions about how i navigate this area with the history it has. my project serves as a new testament to combat the stereotype the neighborhood faces for its terrible past. i want to break the sad narratives and share my perspective as someone young and new to the area.

what we heard at the youth town hall will move you 



nov 20, 2024




voices of the future: a youth town hall was an event organized by keniera wagstaff and truth avenue at morgan state university school of global journalism & communications. it allowed young people, ages 14 to 24, to engage directly with local politicians and community leaders, asking critical questions about issues impacting their communities. topics included school safety, support for underserved communities, justice, and more. recognizing baltimore city's pressing challenges, the youth town hall sought to address these issues and explore ways for the community to create tangible change. during the event, our team interviewed five participants about their views on community involvement: tael’a hughes and mehkiah sabedra, both morgan students and event panelists; andrea daniels, managing editor at the baltimore banner; malachi harrison, a high school student; and ellis lewis, a middle school student.

courage, creativity, and connection



oct 24, 2024




as a second-generation nigerian american, i have always loved everything involving art, film, media, writing, and languages. my journey has not always been easy, but through creativity, i have found the courage to connect with others and grow my self-confidence.i consider myself to be extroverted, but it was a challenging journey overcoming insecurities that developed at a young age. i used to make it a point to stick to what’s comfortable and stay to myself. when i began using my yellow polaroid and my camcorder (both gifted to me by relatives) to take pictures of the people around me, it allowed me to come out of my shell and form deeper connections with others.

redesigning the waym logo



sep 24, 2024




i’ve been a part of wide angle for some of the most formative years of my life. during the vast majority of high school, i was a part of their after school program, and in my early 20s, i worked as a graphic design intern. throughout that entire time, a giant wooden relief of the wide angle logo has hung on the office wall. if you’ve never seen it, the wide angle logo features the silhouetted figures of four youth: three holding up film equipment,–cameras and a boom mic–and one holding a pencil and paper. this logo has represented wide angle’s commitment to amplifying youth voices and providing them with media and arts education for as long as i’ve been here. the emphasis was on teaching video production, with a little hint at more, like drawing, represented by the youth holding the pencil and paper.

it's all about showing up



aug 22, 2024




when it comes to getting ahead, we’ve all heard the phrase it’s not about what you know, it’s about who you know. you’d be surprised by how many people at major companies are hired not for their intensive portfolio or impressive resume, but simply because they were recommended by a friend. success is found through building a supportive network. hard work will only get you so far. how does one find this hypothetical network of people to pull them to the top? some would say by getting thousands of connections on linkedin. others may advise you to send cold emails to every billionaire whose name you happen to know. while there may be some value in those methods, one simple, yet powerful lesson i learned from a successful ceo, is that the secret to networking is all about showing up for other people.

josh's digital media journey in comcast's olympic spotlight 



jul 17, 2024




i am a former amateur boxing national champion for the usa boxing association who found a deeper passion for combat sports through digital photography and short filmmaking. my story has come full circle in many ways. i found boxing around the same time as digital media. since my high school (baltimore school for the arts) didn’t give me an athletic outlet, i spent my after-school time on youtube, watching training videos of the uber-talented kids my age at upton boxing centre in baltimore. this content inspired me to become a boxer myself, and eventually, i deemed myself high-level enough to switch gyms and train at upton boxing under coach calvin ford, the trainer of gervonta davis.
