	 the pacific
	 
    


i just got done watching "the pacific." and it didn't take long for the anti-americanism to start. not long into the first episode a bunch of soldiers on their way to guadalcanal ask "what are we doing here?" "why are we here?" look, i know that it only took liberals 6 months to forget about 9-11 but i'm pretty sure that on august 7th 1942, 8 months after pearl harbor that every single soldier, and civilian remembered that event. then after the first nights fighting one of our soldiers and a central figure for the show began feeling sorry for the japanese. taking out a family picture from an enemy soldier and thinking to himself, they're just like us. i wanted to yell at the tv, except for pearl harbor, that imperialism thing, that vicious racism against anyone not japanese. but then again that's how liberals see things. it's all about moral relativism. they aren't any worse or better than we are. this sure isn't anything close to band of brothers. i suppose hanks didn't like the nazi's, oh yeah, hitler fought against his precious russia and stalin. i guess that makes sense.

	 something obama can't take away
	 
    


no matter how anti-american, anti-freedom, and anti-liberty obama is he'll never be able to stop the american spirit of our fighting men and women. you can tell a lot about people by their actions, some(terrorists) use civilians as human shields while others use themselves for that very same purpose.

	 obama to trample civil rights
	 
    


as anyone can tell i'm no fan of the aclu and i'm not even sure they will do anything since this abomination is coming from obama. but can you imagine a law that will take anyone's dna from just an arrest? i agree with the thought of getting the dna from convicted felons but just an arrest? just to give you an example, i was arrested once a long long time ago because the person who was driving and myself "matched the description" of two people who robbed a nearby house. how the police officer knew this at 11:00 pm in the pitch dark is unknown. after we spent about 15 minutes at the local police station the 2 real burglars were caught and walked right by us. one was a black man and the other hispanic. i'm white and so was the other person. they would have taken my dna under obama's new law.josh gerstein over at politico sent threat level his piece underscoring once again president barack obama is not the civil-liberties knight in shining armor many were expecting.gerstein posts a televised interview of obama and john walsh of america’s most wanted. the nation’s chief executive extols the virtues of mandatory dna testing of americans upon arrest, even absent charges or a conviction. obama said, “it’s the right thing to do” to “tighten the grip around folks” who commit crime.

	 what we have to look forward to
	 
    


if socialized medicine passes this is what obamacare will bring to the united states:a hospital patient told yesterday of her “eight hours of horror” after the bodies of three dead people were left in their beds – with one not taken out until the ward was full of visitors.sarah stevenson was undergoing treatment at heartlands hospital in birmingham when three patients on her ward died in the same afternoon.the grandmother was appalled when the body of the first patient, who died around 1pm, was left in bed for more than four hours, allowing a stench to spread through the ward.

	 obama to outlaw fishing?
	 
    


looks like it could happen:the obama administration has ended public input for a federal strategy that could prohibit u.s. citizens from fishing some of the nation's oceans, coastal areas, great lakes, and even inland waters.this announcement comes at the time when the situation supposedly still is "fluid" and the interagency ocean policy task force still hasn't issued its final report on zoning uses of these waters.fishing industry insiders, who have negotiated for months with officials at the council on environmental quality and bureaucrats on the task force, had grown concerned that the public input would not be taken into account."in spite of what we hear daily in the press about the president's concern for jobs and the economy and contrary to what he stated in the june order creating this process, we have seen no evidence from noaa or the task force that recreational fishing and related jobs are receiving any priority."unless more anglers speak up to their congressional representatives so their input will be considered, it appears the task force will issue a final report for "marine spatial planning" by late march. president barack obama then could possibly issue an executive order to implement its recommendations.even i don't think obama could be that stupid but we all know he's a far left wing fanatic and if he believes fish are hurt then he may just outlaw fishing altogether.

	 the personal tragedy in believing in global warming
	 
    


it's hard to believe anyone would take global warming this seriously but the ignorant and less educated are the ones targeted by the alarmists. great job al gore, now you're responsible for the deaths of an entire family.a seven-month-old baby girl survived three days alone with a bullet in her chest beside the bodies of her parents and toddler brother.argentines francisco lotero, 56, and miriam coletti, 23, shot their children before killing themselves after making an apparent suicide pact over fears about global warming.at least the baby survived. maybe she'll grow up and help spread the truth about the global warming hoax.

	 remember van jones?
	 
    


he was the environmentalist czar for obama who was eventually thrown under the bus when it was proved he was an admitted communist and believed george bush brought down the twin towers on 9-11. well, princeton has hired him as a professor.

	 it's about time!
	 
    


seems the voters are finally figuring out what kind of president obama is.overall, 43% of voters say they at least somewhat approve of the president's performance. that is the lowest level of total approval yet measured for this president. fifty-five percent (55%) disapprove. the president earns approval from 76% of democrats while 86% of republicans disapprove. among those not affiliated with either major party, 38% approve and 61% disapprove. the president earns approval from 37% of men and 49% of women.not that obama cares for the american people but lets hope he gets the hint and tries to pare back his socialist/communist agenda. he can start by taking the health care bill off the table. it's obvious the people don't want the government taking over one sixth of the economy. with medicare and social security broke we sure can't afford the 1.4 trillion dollar price tag for obamacare.

	 do you believe in miracles? part 2
	 
    


now, don't get me wrong, nothing, and i mean nothing will ever beat the miracle on ice of 1980 when a bunch of 19 year old kids beat the russian pros. let's also remember where we were in this country back then. a deep recession, the iranian hostage crisis. a general feeling of gloom and one game brought back our national pride. so, i'll start with a reminder of that day 30 years ago.tonight the usa beat canada 5-3 which was also a big favorite. without the empty net goal the score would have also been the same. another similarity was the shots on goal. in 1980 russia had 39 shots to usa 16. tonight we were out shot 45-23.to give you an idea the chicago blackhawks have 3 american born players on their roster compared to 14 canadian born players. unfortunately this was just a round robin game so it means little. gives us an extra day off and we'll face a less talented team in the next round but a great win and upset nonetheless.

	 9 obama justice appointees previously worked for terrorists
	 
    


the only thing that surprises me is that they admit it.attorney general eric holder says nine obama appointees in the justice department have represented or advocated for terrorist detainees before joining the justice department. but he does not reveal any names beyond the two officials whose work has already been publicly reported. and all the lawyers, according to holder, are eligible to work on general detainee matters, even if there are specific parts of some cases they cannot be involved in.holder's admission comes in the form of an answer to a question posed last november by republican sen. charles grassley. noting that one obama appointee, principal deputy solicitor general neal katyal, formerly represented osama bin laden's driveri guess bin laden and mullah omar weren't available for obama to hire.

	 more violence and murder by left wing democrats
	 
    


seems the narrative from the media and other left wing sources is that this guy was some kind of right wing nut but as i will prove later he's nothing more than another far left wing fanatical nut job who had nothing but murder on his mind. the remains of two people have been found in an austin, texas, building where a man crashed a small plane, authorities said. the identities of the two dead people have not been confirmed, the austin fire department said in a statement. two other people who were injured in the incident were taken to a hospital, and 11 others were treated for minor injuries, austin police chief art acevedo said. authorities said andrew joseph stack iii, 53, an austin resident with an apparent grudge against the internal revenue service, set his house on fire thursday and then crashed a piper cherokee pa-28 into the building, which houses an irs office with nearly 200 employees, federal officials said.  all around the internet leftists are jumping all over this mans hatred for the irs. for some reason the lunatic left thinks only "right wingers" think we're taxed too much. andrew stack left a suicide note, more like a manifesto. here is part of this lunatics manifesto that the media will never repeat, after reading it tell me if this guy is a right winger or left winger: as government agencies go, the faa is often justifiably referred to as a tombstone agency, though they are hardly alone. the recent presidential puppet gw bush and his cronies in their eight years certainly reinforced for all of us that this criticism rings equally true for all of the government. nothing changes unless there is a body count (unless it is in the interest of the wealthy sows at the government trough). in a government full of hypocrites from top to bottom, life is as cheap as their lies and their self-serving laws.  i saw it written once that the definition of insanity is repeating the same process over and over and expecting the outcome to suddenly be different. i am finally ready to stop this insanity. well, mr. big brother irs man, let’s try something different; take my pound of flesh and sleep well. the communist creed: from each according to his ability, to each according to his need. the capitalist creed: from each according to his gullibility, to each according to his greed.  joe stack (1956-2010) you can't get anymore left wing than quoting the communist manifesto and then the very next sentence ripping on the freedom and liberty that capitalism provides. as this story unfolds lets see if the media will tell the truth about this far left wing fanatic or if they will continue to lie to the people and refer to him as a right winger.
