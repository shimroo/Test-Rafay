productsonline storethe brands we carry at super jock ‘n jill change constantly as we are always searching for the best products for our consumer. our buyers do a great job of picking what they think are the best products to serve the different needs of our customers.   we hope we can do a lot of the homework for our customers in helping find great products at a great value.

taking care of our customersto this day, we still don’t have measuring tapes, we custom fit each customer to make sure you leave with the perfect fit. our community of runners, walkers and athletes are responsible for the success of super jock ‘n jill. when we opened our first store, we knew that the way we treated people was the most important aspect of the business.

communitycommunity is a big part of what motivates us. as a small, local company we feel an obligation to be more than just a retail store. we provide support for events, local track and cross country teams and donate hundreds of shoes to different organizations throughout the greater seattle area each year. we want to help as many people stay active and healthy as we can. we are a great resource if you need info on local events, new running or walking courses, are in need of a personal trainer or physical therapist or just need a good place to eat in the area.  we want super jock ‘n jill to be a place where people can start their run or walk or just come in and talk about local running events or how they did at their most recent marathon.
