welcome to astro*carto*graphy!
astrocartography is your celestial roadmap to meaningful, powerful  even life-changing destinations across the globe. imagine it as a visual guide  a world map with distinct lines drawn for each planet, revealing the places where their influence is most pronounced. these lines and their intersections pinpoint your special places, each holding unique potential and significance in your life's journey. 

astrocartography, often abbreviated as acg, empowers you to make conscious choices about relocation, career opportunities and personal development. not only can it help you understand the forces impacting your present location, acg reveals the optimum places on earth to seek love, prosperity and wellbeing. 

the founder of astro*carto*graphy®, jim lewis (1941-1995) developed the groundbreaking discovery that different locations stimulated different parts of his astrological birth chart.  jim was not just a pioneer, but also a personal friend and mentor. i am a qualified astro*carto*graphy interpreter and my company, equinox holds the privilege of being licensed by jim to produce maps to his specific design with his unique interpretation handbook.

more about our analyses




 

astrocartography map kit: - a projection of your birth chart onto a world map. this kit includes a 48-page interpretative handbook by a*c*g founder, jim lewis. the booklet has been updated to include an interpretation of chiron and the moon's node lines by locational astrologer, robert currey.

3 city report: for a more detailed study of particular locations, your individual report (approximately 10,000 words) describes the astrological influences on you in any three locations around the world. 	drawing on jim lewis's insights based on his research, your  3 city analysis explores the psychological and practical conditions you're likely to encounter in different locations. 

astrologer selection and commentary: for an even more personal analysis (that combines with the report), astro*carto*graphy trained astrologer, robert currey is here to provide his individual analyses of each location for you. whether you have specific places in mind or seek roberts expertise in selecting the best places based on your criteria. this unique process combines research into your a*c*g map with your natal chart. remember, a*c*g planetary lines impact individuals uniquely  there are no inherently 'good' or 'bad' lines based on planets alone. it depends how they interact within your birth chart.  roberts insightful comments will vary according to the influences in each location but average about a page in length per location.
