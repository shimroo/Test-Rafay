astrophotography 
i'm very active in the astronomy community, and i am a contributing editor with     sky & telescope magazine. check out my astrophotography blog, books, etc. at www.eveningshow.com. i also still  do technical consulting for vendors in that community, and spent over 20 years working for companies like starry night. and       software bisque. watch for new open source and commercial projects along these lines from time to time now from starstone!


opengl & vulkan consulting
if you need 3d graphics help with opengl or vulkan projects on any platform, i've thrown my hat in with the fine folks over at lunarg, inc. and no longer do independent contract development here. lunarg however (and me) will be happy to discuss your project needs in detail there.
