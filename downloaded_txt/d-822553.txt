testimonials



we love fdw! my daughter started dancing here at 3 years old and is growing into such a beautiful young lady not only in dance, but in life thanks in part to the amazing teachers at this studio. they are truly kind, caring and the kids absolutely love them all! i love the many unique styles of dance they offer and the professionalism every teacher has always shown. they have been in this community for over 30 years and the experience they have gained over the years shines through in every performance. we are so proud to be part of the fdw family and can't wait watch both my girls grow up here.

my daughter has participated with this studio for the past two years and has grown so much as a dancer and as a person. she looks forward to dance practice and doesn’t want to leave when it’s over. her teammates and instructors have become family to her. she loves it so much that after her first year, she joined the competition team. i would highly recommend this dance company to anyone looking to join dance at any age. thank you for being an inspiration to my daughter and setting the standard for her as well as raising the bar for her goals.

april of 2013, my 3 daughters and i made the switch to fdw. we were so happy we found not only a studio that teaches quality dance curriculum, but also cares about their students, teaches them life lessons, treats them like family and believes in and encourages them!michelle and the other teachers welcomed my family with open arms and went out of their way to get them ready for the upcoming showtime production. my heart was so full as i watched the balloons fall on my girls in the finale, my girls were so happy! i knew this was the kind of environment i wanted my children to be a part of.i am so thankful to michelle and all the teachers for giving my girls this opportunity to make great memories, learn life lessons and be able to take their dance experience and apply it to all walks of life as happy, focused and determined girls ready to pursue their goals!

i was a member of fdw from 2nd grade in 1993 to high school graduation in 2004. i remember how much i looked forward to going to dance after school. i took classes in ballet, tap, jazz, lyrical, and pointe.i was the most excited to have the opportunity to dance with the company and eventually the ovations competition team. looking back at my time in the studio, i built everlasting friendships, leaned discipline and grace from an amazing teacher, and competed across the state. to this day, i wish i was still taking dance a couple nights a week to stretch. i also miss things like the rudolph game, the big reveal of costumes for the year, and of course, showtime!all my love to fdw!

i danced at fdw from age 3 to age 18. dance has always been a major part of my life and a day rarely goes by that i’m not reminded of my days with fdw.now i am working as a resident doctor at usf. although my day to day life has nothing to do with dance, i strongly believe that the skills i gained at fdw made me the person i am. dancing taught me discipline, dedication, team work, attention to detail, creativity, patience, confidence, and compassion. during my interviews for medical school and residency dance was something my interviewers always asked me about because it set me apart and made me well rounded.i wouldn’t trade my time at fdw for anything and consider michelle, susan and everyone at fdw my second family.

florida dance workshop taught me teamwork, self-confidence, resilience, and diligence. thank you, michelle and susan, for fostering not only the technical skills that create excellent dancers, but also the strength of character that creates great leaders.

florida dance workshop was my second home growing up, and still to this day, i always feel a sense of family walking through the doors. without michelle, susan and all of the wonderful training i received i would not be where i am today. i made lifelong friendships and connections throughout my years at fdw and will always cherish those memories and my years spent in the dance studio.

i am so very happy i found florida dance workshop. my daughter started at just 3 years of age and has learned so much in just 2 seasons. the teachers are very patient and encouraging with the little ones; keeping them interested and giving them confidence. as long as she is dancing, it will be at fdw!

absolutely wonderful experience at florida dance workshop. my nine year old had taken dance for a year when she was 5, but took a few years off to try soccer and softball. she realized she really missed dance and it was her true passion, but was a little nervous to go back after missing so many years. we started with one class and loved it. the teachers, staff, and students were all amazing and supportive. i can not begin to express how grateful i am for the positive environment they have created for dancers of all skill levels. simply the best. and mrs. deb at the front desk is nothing short of amazing! we are now on our second year at fdw and are enrolled in 4 classes. excited about our dance future and thankful for this amazing studio and the staff that make it what it is ❤️

absolutely phenomenal. my daughter started dancing for two other studios since she was five and well it didn’t sit well for many reasons. she loved to dance so much i had to keep on the hunt. i was amazed when we found fdw. at first i was a bit nervous because well in the world we live in unfortunately we face some challenges with how we look. i have never felt this here all the teachers the students all are just utterly wonderful and kind. they make my daughter feel like family and keep me informed about everything they are so well organized and are just truly a wonderful team. even the owner is so involved they take pride in their dancers. i wish i could turn back time and have found them when my baby girl was five however she has excelled and is doing spectacular things with this studio. so grateful highly recommend… can’t wait to see her transform in the next few years. yes we are stayingggggg permanently
