wilmington garden day returns in 2022!
we consider it a privilege to serve an organization that turns strangers into friends through a mutual love of nature and gardening, while at the same time supporting long-established beneficiaries who help children and families in our community overcome life's challenges and thrive.  

get ready to wind your way through a majestic bamboo forest, linger in a formal english garden, marvel at over 10,000 hosta species and be inspired by unique patio container plantings.  these and much more can be found on the 2022 wilmington garden day tour, a beloved tradition and one of our region's first celebrations of spring. 
   your innovative ideas. your volunteer time. your generosity.  your support and participation.  these gifts make each year a success.  
    mark your calendars for thursday, may 5th for evening in the garden and saturday, may 7th for the garden day tour.
    after a long pause, we look forward to enjoying next spring with you!
