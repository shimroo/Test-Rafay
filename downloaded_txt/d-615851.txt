after the game, here's brandon wood, a former arizona high school star (and top draft pick of the angels) who broke the single season afl home run record with 14.

	 afl championship game
	 
    


on a sunny saturday, we made it to the arizona fall league championship for the second consecutive year. oddly, it was the same two teams as last year—scorpions and desert dogs, although the players and mlb teams who made up the squads, were different. the results were the same as the desert dogs were the winners, this time 9-3.matt kemp of the dodgers was the star of the game with two home runs and jamie shields of the d-rays pitched seven strong innings for the win. casey daigle—with celeb wife jenny finch cheering him on—came on to pitch the ninth inning. it was a sloppy game with five errors between the two teams, a few of the errors leading to big rallies for the dogs.the game was as much about who was there as who played. in this clip, you will find davey johnson, former mets manager, braves second baseman as well as manager of team usa baseball, the olympic team; the big bopper, bob watson, (former astros star now mlb and team usa exec) and angels owner arte moreno. we saw but did not capture on video former cardinals/a’s/cleveland outfielder georeg henrdick, former white sox exec rollie hemond and the father & son garagiolas, joe and joe jr.here is the video!

	 arizona fall league game: solar sox at scorpions
	 
    


the final game in our three day stretch took us to surprise stadium in..well…surpirse (az). surprise is a haul not because of the distance but because it requires driving through a series of surface streets with bad traffic. no comments necessary about the driving of those who live in sun city and sun city west (major retirement communities).surprise stadium is a tough place to shoot video; the contrast between light and dark is not well defined and it’s difficult to shoot from light into dark and visa-versa. nonetheless, the stands are close to the field, so close-up shots are easy to come by. however, it’s also not nearly as fan-friendly as peoria, meaning you can’t get physically close to the dugouts and practice areas for autographs.because there were no game day notes for the fans, i had to take a stab in the dark at some of the players’ names (mostly first names that is). i corrected the mistakes in the subtitles in some parts of the clip. for example, i called eric patterson (younger brother of corey) “mike.” well, three games in three days, and your brain begins to fry.player of the day: angel guzman of the cubs—five no hit innings. others featured include billy butler (royals), brian sanches (phillies) and taylor buchholz (astros).next game for us will be the championship game, 11/12

	 afl game: javelinas at saguaros
	 
    


our first night game in our many years of going to fall league. a somewhat larger crowd than normal and there are no issues about sitting in the sun. our last trip of the fall league season to peoria; today, we're off to phoenix muni where the crowds have been somewhat more robust.featured in this clip are brad eldred (pirates), chris young (chicago white sox), ryan zimmerman (nationals) and eddie rodriguez (coach, nationals).

	 mariners adam jones selects a bat
	 
    


it’s not all fun at arizona fall league. in this clip, the owners of zinger bats, a utah-based baseball bat company, are showing young seattle mariners outfielder, adam jones, a few of their more choice models. apparently, among the major leaguers who use the zinger bats are miguel cabrera and pudge rodriguez. which one would i use if (in my dreams) i swung for the fences? the x73 model of course—it’s called the barry bonds model.

	 desert dogs at saguaros
	 
    


yes, another trip to peoria. no, i am not running for mayor of the city. today, ts and i (and about 100 other folks) saw the desert dogs get whalloped by the home standing saguaros. lots of miscues, not the least of which was from future d-back shortstop stephen drew. brad eldred, a first baseman who played much of the season for the bucs in pittsburgh, hit two home runs. three more games in the next two days. stay tuned

	 phillies prospect scott mathieson
	 
    


one of the highlights of the game between the peoria saguaros and surprise scorpions was getting to see phillies prospect scott mathieson. i had the good fortune to meet scott’s father doug, who was in town coaching team bc (players from british columbia, canada) as it competed in the arizona fall classic, a baseball tournament held at the peoria complex (where the mariners and padres train). the tournament is for top high school players from throughout north america.doug mathieson is also the coach responsible for adam loewen (also in fall league), jeff francis, larry walker and young giants pitcher morgan brinson. brinson was featured in a video clip from arizona rookie league.scott is a budding prospect in the phillies organization, playing this season in a ball at clearwater. with 114 k's in 111 innings this past season, i'd say he's the classic power pitcher destined for citizens bank park. he’s invited to big league training camp for '06, but the smart money says he starts the season in reading. hey, it could be worse; reading is the granddaddy of all shopping outlet cities and has the best (i mean best) pretzels in the u.s. oh, by the way, mathieson did not have one of his better outings today; he gave up a handful of runs and the score was 10-10 when we left in the 7th.

	 fall league game: scorpions at saguaros
	 
    


my annual fall league birthday baseball game was a day late, but full of excitement nonetheless. it was the surprise (nee scottsdale) scorpions at the peoria saguaros. first viewing of the scorpions this year, and it’s a team filled with talent: brandon wood, kendry morales, michael bourn, jared weaver, etc.. this clip provides an overview of the game and then some up-close shots of a few players, most notable alex gordon (no. 2 pick in the most recent draft) and brandon wood (he of 43 minor league homers this past season), a graduate of horizon high school in phoenix (and former top draft pick of the angels). by the way, if you want to get a glimpse at a future cy young candidate, look at jared weaver (also of the angels). he was a no. 1 pick who held out an entire season before signing. he is the real deal with major heat plus a wicked, major league curve

	 at the fall league game: mitchell paige
	 
    


mitchell paige, a former member of the oakland a's, now a hitting instructor for the washington nationals, was in the stands at today's desert dogs-saguaros game. paige shot video of each nationals player at-bat. a few folks recognized him and asked for autographs.

	 arizona fall league--phoenix desert dogs at peoria saguaros
	 
    


what better way to spend columbus day than watching an arizona fall league game. today, the peoria saguaros hosted the powerful phoenix desert dogs.  we came to see the dogs, last year’s afl champion. that team features a host of future stars including stephen drew (diamondbacks), greg miller and andy laroche (dodgers), andre ethier and daric barton (athletics) and jarrod saltalmacchia (braves).i avoided the long in-game shots which i need to hold off on until i get a camera with a more powerful zoom. instead, i focused on the players before the game. saltalmacchia (whose name i butchered in the clip) is going to be a favorite. he has a big smile and was quite warm to the young fans. he even spoke to me.as you might imagine, much of my focus was on stephen drew of the diamondbacks. drew did not disappoint; he hit a monster three-run homer onto the lawn in right field. in baseball terms, he was worth all $4 million-plus the d-backs spent.one final note: leaving the park, we spotted jenny finch, softball superstar, sitting in the stands. she is married to casey daigle, a minor league pitcher with the diamondbacks. (btw, he was a very friendly guy with the the fans before the game).i am on fall league hiatus until oct. 21st, my birthday. i have been to an az fall league game on my birthday each of the past four years.

	 fall league games on mlb radio
	 
    


for those of you who can't make it to arizona for fall league, mlb radio is airing some of the games online. check the site to get the schedule.at yesterday's game, my wife noticed that they hung a microphone outisde the "broadcast booth" to cacth ambient noise. given the size of the crowd, they might have caught me sneezing 30 or 40 yards away.

featured is ian stewart, one of baseball america's top 50 prospects. he hit a homer is yesterday's game against the saguaros that was big league all the way. look for him at 3rd base in coors field in 2007 if not 2006.

	 boys of fall league
	 
    


before the start of each arizona fall league game, the young players sign autographs and pose for pictures. the handful of fans get into this up-close-and-personal scene, almost always treating the players with respect.this clip features jeff clement, seattle mariners; dan uggla, arizona diamondbacks; val majewski, baltimore orioles; gary harris, seattle mariners and jim miller, colorado rockies.editor's note: excuse the typo in the titles. val majewski's last name is spelled incorrectly. i will try and fix.
