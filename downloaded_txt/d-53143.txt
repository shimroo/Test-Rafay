our new racial justice framework

 

we are excited to announce a significant milestone in the scherman foundation's journey. as we celebrated the foundation’s 80th anniversary in 2021, we embarked on a transformative process to deepen our commitment to racial justice and equity. we proudly present the results of this three-year reimagining of our framework.our new direction is reflected in updated mission, vision, and transformation statements, along with revised program guidelines. these changes reflect our strengthened dedication to anti-racism and racial justice, emphasizing the importance of organizing, power shifting, and movement building in bipoc communities.
