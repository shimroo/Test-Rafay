peace church bible study home page


welcome!
this web site is for anyone with an interest in the bible and the "historic 
        peace churches" (brethren, mennonites, quakers).
 i hope this site will:

help bridge the gap between academic/scholarly readers of the bible and non-academics, and between "believers" and those who feel no religious affinity for the biblical text.
help people who want to learn the languages in which the earliest manuscripts of the bible are written:  hebrew, aramaic, and greek.  i'm particularly interested in those who are studying these languages outside a formal classroom setting for whatever reason.
help brethren, mennonites, quakers (and anyone who feels an affinity for any of these groups) to engage scripture more deeply.
offer ideas for working with scripture ecumenically and in interfaith settings.
give me some practice learning html and web page design.

please let me know what you think about how i'm doing with any of this.  i'm especially interested in communicating and synergizing with folks who share any of these goals and interests.

thanks!  grace and peace of the lord to you!
-- susan jeffers

lots of other christian groups have peace 
  testimonies as well. but how about: every 
  church a peace church?

  theology papers 
  papers from "theology and culture: peacemaking in a globalized world," a consultation 
  of "historic peace church" theologians held in switzerland june 2001 as a response 
  to the world council of churches' "decade to overcome violence."

  are representative of the biblical bases for historic peace church understandings 
  of peace.

biblical studies

bible study tools  comprehensive site, including online study bible, hebrew and greek interlinear bible, concordances, commentaries, devotional materials, dictionaries, and many other helps. includes special fonts you can download and view the actual greek and hebrew characters, for example in the theological dictionary and lexicon sections.
bible gateway  lots of bible versions in lots of different languages; you can look up passages by chapter and verse or search for particular words or phrases.
blue letter bible  translations, commentaries, devotionals, dictionaries. easy to use, but doesn't include nrsv, niv, or recent reference works.
biblical studies glossary  intended to be a comprehensive list of the terms one comes across when moving from devotional bible study to academic, scholarly biblical studies. some of the words are peculiar to the various disciplines of "the guild," others are more general terms that non-academic readers like myself sometimes experience as stumbling blocks. a work in progress, like the rest of this web site.
biblical scholars  brief biographical information on some important present and past biblical scholars.
learning biblical languages  resources for learning biblical hebrew, aramaic, and greek.
online articles and journals in the academic discipline 
  of biblical studies 
  annotated bibliography with links organized by discipline and biblical subject.
the development of the canon of the new testament "this survey covers a small part of the huge body of new testament studies --- how the church selected certain writings as authoritative and separated them from a larger body of early christian literature. in view of the central importance that the new testament has within christianity, it is amazing that there is an absence of detailed accounts of such a significant process. my goal is to collect and organize the information that is available, and make it easily accessible in the form of hypertext.... i especially hope this site will be useful to persons who cherish the new testament, but are unfamiliar with the history of its development...."
bookshelf some of my favorite and most-used reference books.  annotated list with links to reviews and author information.
biblical-studies email list.  "the purpose of this list is to allow the interested person to post questions regarding the whole gamut of biblical studies.   archaeology, linguistics, exegesis, history, textual issues, all are legitimate areas of inquiry for this list.   academic or simple questions are allowed.   all are welcome to participate; veteran scholar or interested layperson; cleric or lay; protestant, catholic, or jew."
society of biblical literature
  "founded in 1880 to advance the public understanding of the bible and biblical 
  scholarship." the major north american professional organization of biblical 
  scholars. i'm a member (you don't need a phd or a full-time academic appointment 
  to join!) and have attended the annual meetings the last several years. sbl 
  meets each november in cities around north america. 

specifically quaker biblical studies:

methodology and philosophy: what i (used to) think i'm doing here
illness and lots of inward changes has left me trying to regroup, rethink, realign myself with whatever the lord has in store for me, now. 

http://jeffers.bethanyseminary.edu
http://individual.utoronto.ca/nt_greek_online/
friends 
  theological college
  kaimosi kenya. i visited kaimosi back in the 1990s, still think of and pray for these friends often.
spiritual disciplines
a brief list of disciplines you can use to get closer to god through scripture.
quaker bible index
  a comprehensive scripture index to early quaker writings. a work in progress. 
  i have long admired and used the author's work in making accessibly early quaker 
  uses of the bible. thanks so much to esther murer! online as of this writing: 
  genesis, part of isaiah, matthew, mark, luke, john, romans, 1 corinthians, hebrews, james, 1 & 2 peter, 1, 2 & 3 john, jude, and revelation.
"racing 
  across the lines: changing race relations through friendship"
  this book is great. it describes what i think is a key to rightly lived religious 
  faith today - friendships across racial difference. it invites readers to consider 
  how we form friendships and why interracial friendships are so rare. it provides 
  many anecdotes and suggestions for coping with tension and increasing trust. 
  its perspective is spiritual, personal, and interpersonal. it avoids blame and 
  emphasizes personal change: what each person can do. the author is a psychology 
  professor at cleveland state university and president of a diversity management 
  consulting company. she is african-american, from the cleveland area, catholic. 
  i recommend this book to any individual or friends 
"understanding 
  the quaker past"
  by licia kuenning. why and how to read early quaker writings.
"friendly bible study"
  method for quaker bible study groups; by joanne and larry spears.
quartz hill school of theology
  online courses in bible, biblical languages, theology, church history. courses 
  are free to audit, or if you want interaction with the instructor and/or continuing 
  education credit it costs $50/course. heavy emphasis on biblical languages, 
  which is unusual in online bible courses. a wonderful example of the potential 
  of the internet for sharing resources widely and low cost.
"what 
  makes a successful online student?"
  geared toward folks taking college-level courses online, but the principles 
  apply more broadly. 
"the five 
  gospels parallels"
  lets you bring up the canonical gospels, with or without thomas and paul. easy 
  to navigate and check out parallels. i included it here because of the section 
  at the end of the home page, 'help! (formerly "works in progress").' 
"paul and fox on the road to damascus: sent to turn 
  people to the light"
  paul being the author of new testament books like romans, galatians, and thessalonians 
  as well as a main character in the book of acts. fox being george fox, the person 
  usually credited as being the founder of the society of friends (quakers). paul's 
  "damascus road experience," described in acts 9, 22, and 26, is often taken 
  as prototypical of a certain kind of conversion experience. i look at another 
  aspect of it, his sense of mission around going forth to proclaim the gospel 
  and "turn people from darkness to light, and from the power of satan to god 
  (acts 26:18). this is a slightly modified version of the introductory chapter 
  of my ma thesis (earlham school of religion, 1999). i hope to post more later.
open access overview  "how the internet is transforming scholarly research and publication" by earlham college philosophy professor peter suber.
net bible  i'm in the early stages of actually using the free online new english translation; so far i like it very much.  but what's really great is the philosophy behind it -- check out the preface.
postmodern bible: amos  concept and prototype of one man's dream of a hypertext bible commentary.  wow!
theology resources 
  links to resources concerning the academic discipline of christian theology. i hope to update it "'fore too long"!
"how 
  to read the bible"
  a sermon by c. h. spurgeon.
  "as for you, my brothers and sisters, who have not to preach, the best food 
  for you is the word of god itself. sermons and books are well enough, but streams 
  that run for a long distance above ground gradually gather for themselves somewhat 
  of the soil through which they flow, and they lose the cool freshness with which 
  they started from the spring head. truth is sweetest where it breaks from the 
  smitten rock, for at its first gush it has lost none of its heavenliness and 
  vitality. it is always best to drink at the well and not from the tank. you 
  shall find that reading the word of god for yourselves, reading it rather than 
  notes upon it, is the surest way of growing m grace. drink of the unadulterated 
  milk of the word of god, and not of the skim milk, or the milk and water of 
  man's word."
