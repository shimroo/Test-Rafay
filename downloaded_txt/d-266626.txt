“love is the answer, love is the way.”



autumn has cultivated a distinguished career over two decades in film and television, and has become beloved for her heart-centered storytelling on the hallmark channel. she is a mother of two and a living example of resilience, transformation and compassion. autumn serves as a bridge between the worlds of artistic expression and spiritual guidance, in service to the liberation of humanity by walking the way of love.



hi, i’m autumn! while you might know me best from my work as an actress in film and television, the more interesting parts of my life have happened behind-the- scenes.after creating the life of my wildest dreams, i still somehow felt disconnected from my true life and authenticity.then, i turned 33. and everything changed...after an incredible journey, i know that i’ve come to earth with a mission...and i’m only just getting started. i believe that every single soul is essential to the awakening of the collective, and i’m here to help you find your own role in the divine story unfolding all around us.
















    read my story
  














film + tvmy most recent project for the screen was ‘junebug,’ a heartfelt hallmark film about reconnecting with our inner child and our creative path. it took me five years to bring this special project to fruition as an executive producer, and i am so proud to share it with you! alongside this offering, i co-created an inner child workshop for you to embody and explore the themes of creativity and healing from ‘junebug.’  come play!!! 
















i’m also the founder of earth school, a brand-new transformative community designed to guide you on a journey of self-discovery, heart-centered leadership, and authentic living. through monthly themes, teachings, and a supportive community, participants will develop skills to live more fulfilling, liberated lives.

mentorship



“autumn’s story and experience position her as a guide capable of leading others through their spiritual awakening, helping them discover their true essence, and empowering them to live creative lives filled with purpose, joy, and authentic expression.”



mentorship with me might be for you if you feel that you are being called to a new way of being and are searching for a path to arrive back home to your heart. i can walk alongside you and light the way as your path begins to open. together we will find the keys that you have kept carefully hidden inside you... waiting for this exact moment.as my 1:1 spots don’t open very often (this is why i started earth school, to serve as many people as possible!), please apply below if working with me personally is something that calls to you, and i will reach out when spaces are available.
