 winter is off to a start

the day - fallen leaf lake fun

we
went to snowbird. utah mountains are fun.">
































we've
had a decent number of tiny storms roll through already so far and the
temps have been cold enough for everyone to make a lot of snow. the
majority of resorts will open on the 22nd but in what looks like rain
if they can open at all. then we should see some colder storms drop a
ton of snow setting everyone up for the thanksgiving holiday.
check out our lake tahoe ski resorts page for the latest in openings, conditions, and web cams.

as always, lake tahoe is subject to sever winter weather events that
can be at times, paralyzing. always be sure to check weather forecasts
before heading into the mountains.

about lake tahoe
lake tahoe is so many things, but it is never the
same thing twice. the same thundering waterfall in spring can become a
trickle through a golden aspen grove in fall. in the winter it becomes
your favorite double black diamond, aptly named 'waterfall'. it is a
balloon ride not just over the jewel of the sierra, but over dozens of
other majestic alpine lakes. it is a hike to any of these lakes. it is
the lake itself. it is wilderness areas with no motorized access of any
kind. and next to that you'll find some of the best jeep trails
anywhere. it's a region known around the globe for it's world class
skiing. with summer as the busy season.

the sapphire blue waters present opportunities for fun and recreation
wherever you look. summer brings fishing, swimming, boating, jet
skiing, water skiing, parasailing, or just hanging out at some of the
most beautiful beaches the world has to offer. you don't need to be in
a balloon or even on the lake to enjoy it's beauty. the 72 mile drive
around the lake is among the world's most beautiful. and the view from
any of the peaks
surrounding the lake is simply spectacular. for those not
looking for a hike of any difficulty, the gondola at heavenly provides
spectacular views. 

 winter
brings a white coat to the blue world. the attention moves from the
beaches to the mountains, from the lakes to the backcountry. the region
is dotted with first class ski resorts and the backcountry shows up in
more ski and snowboard films than almost any other location.
both the south and north shore have recently added much in the way of slopeside
accommodations,
working hard to attain the elusive ski
village atmosphere. it seems they've both succeeded.
 the fishing in lake tahoe is excellent year round (but only
july
1-september 30 for it's tributaries).  charter a boat and have
everything ready for you or go it on your own with your own gear. you
can pick up your essential fishing rod and reel
supplies
here.
