maximizing independence and providing employment opportunities
lighthouse for the blind & low vision provides on-site comprehensive rehabilitation programs for persons who are blind or visually impaired in two locations in florida. on-site services are provided in tampa and in winter haven for persons residing in hillsborough, polk, and hardee counties.
our training programs are designed to help individuals who have recently lost part or all of their vision to gain the skills needed to perform daily living tasks independently and maintain their employment. rehabilitation engineering services are provided statewide by lighthouse assistive technology specialists to help blind or visually impaired individuals maintain their existing employment through the use of assistive technology and devices.
children who are blind or visually impaired need the proper tools and training to succeed. we help infants and young children develop independence and prepare for school. plus, we help teens prepare for college, the workforce and independent living after graduation.
if you or someone you know has an uncorrectable visual impairment that significantly affects daily activities or interferes with employment and employment-related tasks, please refer to our eligibility guidelines to see if you or they qualify to receive some or all of our services.
