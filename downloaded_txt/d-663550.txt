our vision 



our values 



our history

our visionoacc envisions vibrant, healthy, and just communities where diverse asian and pacific islander identities and heritage are affirmed and celebrated through cross-cultural exchange, intergenerational dialogue, and educational programming 



our valuesoacc believes that the arts and cultural heritage are essential to building and sustaining vibrant, healthy communities.oacc believes that the arts can be a powerful vehicle for positive social impact and change.oacc values authentic cross-cultural interchange among oakland’s apia residents and the need to extend that dialogue among the community-at-large.oacc values the need to empower its immediate community; build bridges between diverse communities, and collaborate with local community organizations.oacc values cultural programs that are high quality, have community relevancy, and affirm diverse apia identities.oacc particularly values local underserved populations and under-represented apia cultural art forms that are left out of mainstream outlets, education, and media.oacc values the need to break down apia stereotypes and more accurately represent apia identities in the community and mainstream outlets. 



our historythe oakland asian cultural center (oacc) was founded in 1984 by a coalition of volunteers who recognized the need for a strong artistic and cultural force in the chinatown area. since opening its own facility in 1996 in the heart of oakland’s chinatown district, the oacc has presented countless high-quality cultural programs including performances, workshops, festivals, school tours, classes, and exhibitions.
