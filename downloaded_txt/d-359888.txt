a kansas city tradition for more than 87 years



velvet creme popcorn was born in 1937, out of depression-era necessity. "pop" and "grammie" white began making popcorn in their home to support their three children while pop was laid off from work. pop would pop the corn and grammie would seal the products in wax bags with a hot iron to keep them fresh for customers. soon their business grew and moved to broadway, and in 1954 they became the first company to offer their product in decorated tin cans, each one hand-painted by family. today, the business resides in westwood, kansas, close to the plaza, and is in the capable hands of third- and fourth-generation family.

our delicious products are available online or in-store and are perfect for any occasion! whether you're planning a family movie night or looking for the perfect corporate gift - we're here for you, and we'll treat you like family!
























i grew up in westwood just two blocks away. you could smell the popcorn being made in the air. they had the best candy selection around and that popcorn is the best.
one of my all-time favorite childhood memories ever. great place!

visited this store for the first time today. what a treat! the gal that helped me was extremely kind and knowledgeable. i walked in with my sister, not intending to buy a thing.
left with a can of delicious popcorn and i will be going back soon! amazing what a difference excellent customer service can make. thank you!

so exciting to have found this amazing family! when looking to purchase popcorn tins for our customers this year a friend mentioned velvet crème.
i did some research and found this crew to be my choice. great reviews, excellent prices and the history of the business sealed the deal.
nance and her daughter have been easy to work with and i can’t wait to hear from our customers once they receive their gifts.
oh… might want to mention all of the flavors are beyond delicious!! stop in the store if you are in the area and sample before you buy!!! thank you!

their popcorn is so good and fresh. lots of ways to buy the popcorn for great gift presentation or just simply packaged for yourself to enjoy.
other delicious choices of candies, nut mixes, pretzels, chocolate, and even more snacks. fun place and friendly service.

this is my first experience with my “other” hometown popcorn company… boy!
i’ve really missed out over the years because velvet crème is absolutely the tastiest product i’ve ever eaten!
i moved to the southeast and now must mail-order delicious kansas city merchandise because there’s nothing in this area to match!
i couldn’t have requested faster delivery… and vc has the most accommodating customer service! now i’ll buy nothing but velvet crème!
