about your music teacher                      

 
my name is joe klein and i've been a music teacher for over 3 decades and a performer for even longer than that. 
i hold a teaching diploma from trinity college london and have taught thousands of clients over the years - face to face, in group sessions and more recently online via zoom, skype and microsoft teams.

                        there's nothing i love more than imparting knowledge to my clients and watch them experience the joy of playing a musical instrument or singing their favourite songs.
you really don't need to have been born with any special musical talents, nor is there any pressure to reach specific "milestones". i find that best progress is made through an easy-going approach to learning (and teaching).
i teach singing and guitar at all levels - from beginners to professionals. please go to the corresponding link for details and drop me an email or give me a call and let's embark on your musical journey.
