testimonials 







“as a first-time conference organizer, i had no idea where to begin. the amazing staff of conference and event services walked me through every step with patience and humor. their organizational skills and dedication to getting things right made my job so much easier. with their help, we created the appalachian mountains writing project summer institute from scratch. they organized housing, meals, and registration, and even delivered snacks for the attendees. that first, scary year we hosted a small group, and by the second year, we tripled our enrollment. we would never have been successful without the guidance and support of conference and event services.”dr. clarice moran associate professor of english education & site director of appalachian mountains writing project  “the conference and event services team is professional and a joy to work with. their extensive experience means you don’t have to worry about details falling through the cracks. from catering to lodging, meeting room reservations to parking, registration to communications, and more–they work their magic behind the scenes so you can enjoy your event along with your participants. we are very thankful for our partnership with the friendly folks at conference and event services!”jennifer maxwell sustainability program director, office of sustainability  “i wholeheartedly recommend appalachian state university and [the conference and event services] team.  the university’s mountain setting is stunning, and the variety of on-campus venues meets a variety of programming needs, from receptions to dining to meetings and presentations. the events team goes above and beyond throughout planning and execution to provide an outstanding experience. they are responsive, detail-oriented, a pleasure to work with, and the food is delicious. leadership north carolina has hosted an annual 2.5-day program at appalachian state university for more than 20 years. the experience just keeps getting better.”kelly turner program director, leadership north carolina  “each year, my program hosts a multi-week summer training for 23 incoming college advisors on app state’s campus. conference and event services helps us coordinate every detail, including lodging, meals, parking, and meeting space reservations. reaching out to all of these campus departments individually to coordinate this event would take tons of time. ces streamlines the process and takes care of the logistics so we can focus on preparing our training content. the ces team uses their expertise to help us map out the flow of our event and make it as smooth as possible. as if this were not enough, the ces team are some of the kindest people you could hope to work with. when planning for this major event each year, i am thankful that i can rely on conference & event services – thank you!”gloria medina program director for appalachian college advising corps  “using conference and event services makes so many aspects of running a residential program easier.  with ces, we can request space reservations, transportation support, and manage field trips, including ticketing and meal planning for our participants.  our staff could spend more time focusing on the content of the program than on the logistics of getting participants from one place to another.  i have been particularly impressed with ces’ ability to problem solve for us in getting transportation needs met for off-campus activities, including finding vehicles for comfortable rides to grandfather mountain and food options for days out and about.”dr. tracie mclemore salinas chair, department of mathematical sciences
