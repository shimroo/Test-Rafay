gps vehicle tracking - sorting the systems







i have been getting several requests for information about automotive gps tracking systems.  while we have an article by steve armstrong that talks about a couple older gps navigation systems, in recent years vehicle gps tracking gadgets have become popular, affordable, and plentiful.  but which ones are not junk and more importantly - what do they do?  they offer not only different features but there are some major differences in deployment and how they are used, ie. how you interact with them.



i'm going to tell you right here that this article is still in the works, i am still doing more research but i wanted to get this started and out for you.  so check back often for updates.  as long as this notice is still here this is a work in progress and changing.



the old classic gps tracker system installs permanently in the vehicle or equipment and is accessed via satellite.  it requires a monthly fee to access the satellite data.  this is what companies will use to track their fleets or off road equipment with the ability to locate them if stolen.



while the prices of the trackers and the access fees have been rapidly dropping, many consumers today are not needing such a tracking system but still want data on vehicle location and speed.



it's now possible to have this without spending thousands of dollars or pounds.  still, it comes at the cost of knowledge because the market has been flooded with these small portable gps tracking devices.



decisions decisions


first, we need to consider how we plan on using a gps tracker.  is it for personal occasional use?  occasional vehicle tracking or permeant?  pets, recreation, hobby, automotive, spying?



pets - with pets you are likely looking for a permeant solution that will have to be water proof and battery powered.  pets would be best with satellite tracking (with a fee) if you will ever need to find them if they run away or are stolen.  this will give you what the vet chip implant will not do - find your pet without someone finding it for you.



other gps tracking uses could be:
    auto, pets, children, camping, luggage, ...

    and the obscure - spying, package tracking, model aircraft, ...


let’s help clear the clutter

once we realize what we want to keep track of we can narrow down what type of gps tracking technology to use.

how to clean your car bodywork, properly






by mark stephens

as well as spoiling the look of your car, dirty bodywork also reduces the value of your car.  chemicals in rain and corrosive winter salt mixed with extremes of temperatures really test the paintwork of your pride and joy.

the grime has to be shifted if you don't want to have problems down the line when you want to sell your car.

it's also good practice to wash your car as it gives you a chance to take a look at the bodywork and see if you have accumulated any chips or dings that need attention.  you can also look at wheels, tyres, etc and make sure that they are in good order as well.  so apart from treating your paint work to the wash that it needs, a bucket and sponge is a great opportunity for a quick check-up.

in order to get off to a good start you need to make sure you have some basic kit.

a hose (providing you aren't breaking any hose-pipe bans in the uk), a good bucket (with no grit inside it; give it a good wash out beforehand), a clean sponge, chamois leather and a squeegee blade (turtle make one that halford’s sell).

when you are buying a chamois leather a good indicator of its quality is a strong smell of fish oil.  don't bother with the synthetic cloths - they just aren't as good - if they were, real chamois wouldn't exist anymore!

the first step is to hose the car and shift the heavy mud or grime - if it's on there badly just let the water soak for 10 mins.  use a good car wash formula (your local halfords will have some good deals - pick a good name like turtle or simoniz).

starts with the suds at the top of the car and work down, doing one side at a time (and rinsing with water in-between) this will prevent streaking and difficult to remove marks.

repeat this for the other side. rinse again and squeegee off the excess water.  finally finish with the leather to get a squeaky clean finish to the body.

don’t crash the car, well even if you do the car will save you







by anil

have you been drinking and driving? or perhaps chatting on your mobile while driving? if you are a little careless while you drive and are prone to having a bump here and there you are better off getting your hands on a new set of wheels with active safety technologies. car manufacturers such as mercedes are incorporating space age technology into their cars to save lives or rather save us from crashing our buggies when we are simply too careless with our own lives.  this might sound science fiction to you but these are some of the technologies mercedes’s latest s class has:

auto cruise control warns you if you are getting too close to the car in front and if you don’t react it applies brakes on its own to maintain a safe driving distance.

traction control sense when you steer too sharply or lose traction in the wet and cuts engine power and limits the power individually to each wheel to bring you back on track.

anti lock braking system, this has been around for quite some time now.  abs helps in achieving best possible braking performance, it prevent jamming of the wheel which results in skids and loss of vehicle control.  the computer senses when the wheels are about to lock and releases the brakes momentarily and then applies them again.

airbags, as many as 8 airbags protect you in the unlikely event of a crash.  airbags exist for all passengers and are inflated in milliseconds when the care ‘senses’ a crash.  airbags can protect the occupant even at 100mph crashes.

space age safety technology
now this is the most impressive of them all, the mercedes s class can sense when the car is going to meet with a crash using its 360 degree radar and braces for impact.  it rolls up windows if they are down, inflates the seat cushions to protect occupants and lowers the steering to save the driver from chest injuries and lowers pedals to prevent foot injuries.

now that’s some technology, all to save our lives when we loose control.  maybe if diana was riding this s class she would have been amongst us.  so lets not crash it, for if you do the car will save you but repairing the high tech car will burn your pockets for technology doesn’t come cheap.  the fully loaded mercedes s500 with all the safety features retails at over $125,000!

how to avoid speeding tickets






by tom bailey

speeding tickets could cost you much money and additional points on your record.  that is why it is encouraged that you do try to keep your speed within the limit.  this not only decreases your chances of getting pulled over by a traffic enforcer.  this also helps you out in decreasing your chances of meeting accidents, crashes, or collisions that could be the result of driving beyond the given speed.  you should first learn the three types of speed limits which are the absolute, the presumed, and the basic.  the absolute speed limit means that if you drive a mile over the posted limit, you are speeding.  if you can legally exceed the posted limit as long as you drive safely pertains to the presumed speed limit law.  as per the basic limit, it actually allows you and other drivers to drive only as fast as conditions allow, no matter what the limit is posted.


you should also be cautious for you should always be on the alert.  you should also be able to note that all states have a basic speed limit.  study your state laws.  you see, in california, arizona, colorado, and connecticut, the speed limits are absolute either on highways and everywhere else.

in general, the most basic thing to keep in mind is that you should always drive at or below the posted limit on interstates and state highways.  this is generally just to be on the safe side.

here are the speed limits in the states in the us as of 2006: 
alabama – 70, alaska – 65, arizona – 75, arkansas – 70, california – 70, colorado – 75, connecticut – 65, delaware – 65, district of columbia – 50, florida – 70, georgia – 70, hawaii – 60, idaho – 75, illinois – 65, indiana – 70, iowa – 70, kansas – 70, kentucky – 65, louisiana – 70, maine – 65, maryland – 65, massachusetts – 65, michigan – 70, minnesota – 70, mississippi – 70, missouri – 70, montana – 75, nebraska – 75, nevada – 75, new hampshire – 65, new jersey – 65, new mexico – 75, new york – 65, north carolina – 70, north dakota – 75, ohio – 65, oklahoma – 75, oregon – 65, pennsylvania – 65, rhode island – 65, south carolina – 70, south dakota – 75, tennessee – 70, texas – 70, utah – 75, vermont – 65, virginia – 65, washington – 70, west virginia – 70, wisconsin – 65, and wyoming – 75.

online auto insurance quotes






author: andrew daigle
are you searching for better auto insurance rates?  are you tired of feeling as though you're overpaying despite your spotless driving record?  if so, it's about time you started shopping around for the best auto insurance rates from a new auto insurance company.  thanks to the web, motorists are no longer limited to dealing exclusively with local agents and hoping for the best deal.  instead, the internet has opened a new door for those who are looking to compare auto insurance rates and get the best value for their money.

when shopping for auto insurance online, the process of choosing a company is a bit more involved than simply asking your neighbor which local agent they work with.  when shopping for auto insurance online, you may be required to do a bit more footwork while researching the auto insurance company, but in the end, it can pay off in a very big way.  the best way to find a respectable auto insurance company is to research their history, learn about their policies and how long they have been in business, check their reputation with the better business bureau and request a free auto insurance quote.

what is the most common way that an auto insurance company could compete for your business?  by offering the lowest auto insurance rates, correct?  if you said yes, then getting auto insurance online may be the way to go.  because there's so much more competition online, companies must work harder to get your business.   in most cases, you can complete a request for a free auto insurance quote online in a matter of minutes.  depending on the specific auto insurance company, the number of requests, the day of the week, and other factors, it may take many hours or even several days to receive a response.  the best part, however, is that you can shop from a nation of auto insurance companies with the click of a button and never even have to step out your front door.

free auto insurance quotes online are very valuable for any number of reasons, including the obvious fact that they cost you absolutely nothing.  not to mention, the option is very convenient for someone who lives in a rural location and perhaps isn't close enough to visit several auto insurance companies or doesn't have the access to a great number of companies because of the fact that they reside in a small town.  where there's less competition, the prices are higher.  but the internet has certainly changed the face of competition by bringing a multitude of options to those who either enjoy the convenience that the internet can offer or those who need the competitive pricing that simply can't be found in their area.  whether you are shopping for pennsylvania auto insurance, new york auto insurance, florida auto insurance, arizona auto insurance, california auto insurance or anywhere in between, you can search for discount auto insurance rates from the comfort of your favorite recliner.

the information in this article is provided for reference purposes only.  it should not be used as, in place of or in conjunction with professional financial or insurance advice relating to auto insurance quotes, discount auto insurance or auto insurance rates.  for additional information or to receive an auto insurance quote, contact a local auto insurance company.
