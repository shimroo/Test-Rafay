                                                green mountain junior baseball is a nonprofit, volunteer-run organization that has been a part of the lakewood/green mountain community for over 25 years. our objective is to create a fun, safe, and competitive baseball-playing environment for the youth of our community. we offer baseball for all age groups through 14 years old. our league supports all levels of play, from tee ball to teams that play in the rocky mountain junior baseball league and tournament-only teams. we do our best to place players on skill level-based teams so that every player has the best experience possible. although the number of teams or players on each team can fluctuate depending on the number of players registered each season, we do not place limits on the number of teams in our league and will do our best to field a team or multiple teams at each age level. all green mountain junior baseball officials, including the board of directors, coaches, and team parents, are responsible for understanding and fulfilling these objectives.
