(teething is pretty much done, so no land sharks! regular vaccinations, deworming, and veterinary check-ups have been done to ensure their well-being. older puppies have had more time to develop and are sturdier and more able to easily make the transition to a new home.older puppies have developed emotional maturity and patience, making it easier for them to establish a bond with their new family members. they are often more attentive, affectionate, and capable of understanding cues and the behaviors you desire. this can lead to a deeper and more immediate connection, allowing you to form a strong bond and create a sense of companionship sooner than you might with a younger puppy.save more - click the button below to see some of our older puppies at discounted prices.older puppiesdon't see what you're looking for? give us a call at 417-588-5626*prices do not reflect shipping fees, or the 3.5% merchant fee when running a credit/debit card or paypalmidnight acres kennel • 25540 rim drive • waynesville, mo 65583 • (417)588-5626*for photo credits (attribution) click herepurebred and designer breed puppies for sale in waynesville, missouriclick to text ushomefaq’stestimonialsguaranteecontact usprivacyattributioncopyright 2025 castlewood inc. - all rights reserved created by castlewood studios
