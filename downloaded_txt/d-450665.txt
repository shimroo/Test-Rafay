pole shift forum







the
pole shift forum's
purpose is to stimulate critical thought about a controversial
subject.
could the poles and the equator
trade places? frozen places on the earth melt? hot places become
freezing? can the earth's crust be shifted--globally--with
cataclysmic suddenness?
some suggest
over-accumulation of ice at the pole as a possible cause. given
current data, is that
possible?
has it happened before? probable? possible? impossible? or does
earth's crust world-wide move only with almost imperceptible
slowness, as most currently
believe.
























we are not
         advocates with an axe to grind. we are not true
         believers--and we are not looking for true believers.
         we want people
         willing to examine assumptions that underlie current
         scientific beliefs about such global mechanisms. sorry.
         we're not interested in those who focus on spiritualistic,
         apocalyptic, caycean, atlantean or millenialist beliefs as a
         way of approaching this subject. plenty of other websites
         exist for that purpose. not us.
we're hosting informed
         debate about scientifically measurable mechanisms that might
         possibly cause events such as shifting or wandering of the
         poles, displacement of the earth's crust. some believe that
         earth's rotational balance can be destabilized, causing the
         earth's outer crust to skid, so that the lands of the north
         and south poles end up in radically different positions on
         the earth. 
we mean the geographic poles,
         not the magnetic poles, which are discussed here:
         http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4520982.stm
to promote rational
         debate, we need knowledgeable and critical contributors. as
         difficult as this has been, we still hope to attract more
         people with specialized scientific training. for example,
         consider those folks at the poleshift data collection
         website. they desire to get volunteers to report gps and
         magnetic compass readings around the globe to detect and
         measure pole shifts, etc.. check what they're up to
         at http://data4science.net/poleshift/

after years out of print,
         you can again buy charles hapgood's book
         the path of the
         poles.
if interested, read what he has to say
         for yourself. for details click on
