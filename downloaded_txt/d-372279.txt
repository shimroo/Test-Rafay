            bonneville t120 ace
a celebration of the
original cafe racers!




            the limited edition bonneville t120 ace is a modern classic that’s moody, mean and full of attitude.  based on the celebrated t120 black, the bonneville t120 ace has real pedigree, performance and presence to go with its purpose.
 
‘head down – hang on’ was the refreshingly defiant attitude of the young urban leather-clad bonneville riders of the 1960s as they rode out onto and beyond london’s north circular then gathered back at the ace cafe, comparing rides and sharing tales to a thrilling soundtrack of rock ‘n’ roll.
 
the spiritual home of british motorcycling and cafe racers, traffic light heroes, and ‘out to the hanger lane roundabout and back before the record finishes’ riders, london’s legendary ace cafe, and the timeless biker attitude to speed that made it famous, are now commemorated with an one-off triumph limited edition motorcycle; the bonneville t120 ace.
 
delivered with a numbered certificate signed by triumph ceo nick bloor and ace cafe managing director mark wilsmore, the bonneville t120 ace is a real collectors’ item.

            the ace story





            since 1938





 

            it was in england. it was in london. it was in 1938. a road side cafe was built to cater for those using the then new arterial carriage way – the north circular road – the a406. it was just before the war. it was a place no one at the time would have thought would go on to become the world´s most famous motor cafe. this building was called the ace cafe. and the story began….
the doors having opened the ace cafe became a meeting point for motorists who not only liked to pull over for a cuppa or a full british breakfast, but also to enjoy the company of like-minded people.


 

            heavily damaged in an air raid by the luftwaffe in 1940, it was subsequently rebuilt in 1948. with the advent of rock ‘n roll, the ace cafe attracted youngsters on their motorcycles. the cafe racer was born, the record races, and with them came the ton up boys and girls, and the rockers.
it´s a story about speed, it´s a story about boy meets girl, it´s a timeless story with worldwide appeal and which to this day continues, carrying the spirit into the future. it´s our story. it´s your story. it´s the ace cafe story. keep revving it up!
