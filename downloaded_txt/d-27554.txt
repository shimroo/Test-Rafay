we keep community at the üß° of everything we do!

























































                                        what is college confidential‚Äôs purpose?
                                    
from its inception in 2001, cc‚Äôs mission has been to help students and families navigate the college admissions process, better understand their options, and make more informed decisions. we want everyone to have access to timely information and tried-and-true advice to choose the right college.













































                                        what is college confidential's vision?
                                    
college confidential's vision is to provide a gateway to real, unfiltered guidance to higher education, through the power of community.  we bravely champion students and those who support them with authentic guidance they can trust when and where they need it most.













































                                        why is there advertising on college confidential?
                                    
while college confidential is always free for everyone, everywhere, it is not free for us to maintain and improve. so just like your favorite podcast, we rely on advertising and sponsorships. our team works to directly engage sponsors that add value to our community and users.
