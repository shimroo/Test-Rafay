“the teaching that ‘you are the creator of your own reality’ is not some naïve, fantastical invitation to ultimate power. it is a confrontational invitation to take responsibility for everything within your experience, regardless of whether you perceive it to be positive or negative.”

— story waters





"rather than being some idealized goal we created for ourselves to achieve, spiritual awakening is better understood as the journey through a back door—as opposed to the birth-death front door—in the illusion that forms the human experience."

— story waters





"the unconsciousness of sleep bookends, & thereby defines, each individuated day of consciousness we live. this is despite our experience of consciousness continuing as we sleep, but in a fashion that is beyond the comprehension of our daily awareness. just as your experience of consciousness does not cease when you sleep, it also continues between lives."

— story waters





“you already contain everything you seek. you are the only person who can ultimately answer your deepest questions. do not let any external moral construct define your boundaries. do not try to be anyone or anything other than yourself. there is nothing to prove, and the approval of no person—except yourself—can free you.”

— story waters





"you cannot remember what the reality of your spirit is like through the accumulation of knowledge. the experience of your spirit cannot be contained in the linearity of language. what you seek through spiritual awakening is far more than mental. you seek the feeling of resonance that connects your human self with the infinite freedom of your spirit."

— story waters





"freedom is not superior to limitation; with this realization, i am able to choose freedom. happiness is not superior to suffering; with this realization, i am able to let go of suffering. abundance is not superior to poverty; with this realization, my abundance flows. nothing is superior to anything; with this knowing, i step out from hierarchy, competition, and struggle."

— story waters





“linear time is a choice to experience the meaning that arises out of a particular sequence of events by tracing a path through them. what we — as individuals within linear time — call past and future exist simultaneously in the present moment; we just perceive them from a perceptual vantage point that gives rise to the quality of feeling separated from them by time.”
