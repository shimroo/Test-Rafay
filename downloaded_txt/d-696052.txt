when it matters

    sensors built to take on your most challenging applications. when it matters, choose microstrain.

  



 
microstrain vibration, temperature, unmanned and autonomous vehicle sensors

microstrain’s inertial and wireless sensors detect and monitor vibration and temperature on a manned, unmanned, and autonomous vehicles. for aerial vehicles, our sensors report position, velocity, and attitude. in ground vehicles, our sensors provide localization and mapping. use sensor cloud to capture and organize data.




 
all-in-one navigation with microstrain 3dmgq7 - gnss/ins

    the 3dmgq7-gnss/ins is an all-in-one navigation solution featuring centimeter-level position accuracy. a dual-antenna rtk-enabled ins delivers outstanding performance, even in unpredictable conditions. the gq7 is the best single-vendor rtk navigation solution available to eliminate programming time and enable manufactures to develop new innovations faster than ever before.  



 
sensors used to gather data on evtol prototype

a prototype evtol created by beta technologies to deliver human organs for critical transplant operations. microstrain sensors were used to accurately capture critical measurements in many environments to ensure successful missions.
