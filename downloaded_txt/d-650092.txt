learn morejuniper and her loyal flying reindeer skära are the first ever guardians of cedar wood. with juniper’s mentor niko back in the north pole, they’re entrusted with protecting the magical forest hidden in the middle of london because there’s a teeny-tiny chance that he left behind a few sparks of magic… but definitely not enough to attract any dangerous magical creatures. probably.it turns out niko actually left behind a lot of magic, transforming the entire forest into a haven for powerful creatures just as he's stranded far from london. a witch wielding a flaming dagger, a cursed queen desperate for a cure, and a pack of wolves out for revenge are all in pursuit of a legendary fox with the power to grant a wish under the midsummer blood moon—and the very fate of the cedar wood, and possibly all of britain, hangs in the balance. protecting the forest from these calamitous newcomers is a lot of work for a thirteen-year-old and her trusty reindeer, but juniper is determined to save the world.and one more thing—this adventure features a giant ground sloth, which is about the size of a toyota prius, but with more claws.imprint publisher: roaring brook pressisbn: 9781250372642
