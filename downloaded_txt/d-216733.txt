harry potter and the deathly hallows fan art challenge
[aug. 12th, 2009|08:58 pm]

reverberating my deviantart journal: i finally, even though i bought the book back in 2007 in english, finished reading hp: the deathly hallows by j.k rowling. i've been putting it on hold far too long but finally decided to start reading it again a few days ago, though having forgotten what had happened up until the chapter i was on, i needed to start from the beginning again. i can't tell you how much i realise now, even with the flaws in the story, that i've always loved the harry potter cast ever since i was a child, so much, that at a few points in the book when i felt for and with them the most i even started crying and it was emotional. they were, and will be part of me forever and it hurts to leave them behind, and i'm just not ready to do that yet. when i read the last line in the book i turned the page so quickly because i didn't realise, didn't want it to be over yet, and it all suddenly felt empty. then, i thought, to have them linger longer in my heart, i would draw fanarts as tribute, but i didn't really know where to begin portraying the characters i loved so much so i came up with the idea. why not draw an individual fan art out of every chapter in the last book to celebrate? and this now, will be my quest. anyone who feels they want to do the same, feel free to take the list of chapters and paste it into your journal!from here on, this is a challenge to myself and i will link every piece of fanart from this list. (of chapters)http://www.hp-lexicon.org/about/books/dh/chapters-dh.html <-- chapter synposises to help the memory.( harry potter and the deathly hallows fan art challengecollapse )edit: my connection at home isn't working and school is closing now so i'm off~ until i get my connection back...

you, and, you.i should have known not to ever trust you again. i don't even know why i let you back into my life after that shit stunt you pulled with me some time back. you know who you are, and i'll never ever forgive you again, no matter how many times i tried being your friend and supportive of you, you've alwyas just been a selfish person with control over your little friend. you two deserve each other and i hope you'll remain as lonely as you are because you brought it to yourself.adding out of frustration: i don't know why i've been so lenient with you, you've done this to me so many times, you've done this to so many people, no wonder why everyone's angry with you. i guess it was out of nostalgia, that i thought you were still my friends.

so yeah, the other day i was paintchatting with my friend celectis (though that session didn't last long, or really get started at all...) and we got all emotional over dmc and dante, i don't know if i want to get into the details because i think you'd be looking at me strangely afterwards but yeah anyway... xd; you could say that our love for dante and the devil may cry characters and games is pretty deep, and well... i dono, it made me think about how i could show my adoration for the series and i was thinking; maybe i'll do a fancomic of sorts? and then my mind travelled and i got unconfident i would be able to make one all on my own... so yeah... does anyone wanna make a devil may cry doujinshi anthology together? ;3;

i've been so out of it lately. what's been going on with everyone? ;_; do you guys want to help out by telling me a little about yourselves, like, what you ate today, what you did or what you read in the newspapers, what your latest obsessions are, what new character you found that you like or what games you're playing or anime you're watching?i feel like i've been neglecting lj and all other community crap for too long (except for facebook and even when i'm on facebok, i'm lazy...)  so i haven't been in touch with what my friends are up to... ;_;
