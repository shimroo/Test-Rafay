about our farmlocated in south royalton, vermont, hitching post farm (hpf) sits on 75 acres in the middle of the lush green mountains. the farm offers boarding, training, lessons and eventing to riders of all levels. hpf is home to various events throughout the year including a usea horse trial, several schooling horse trials as well as numerous event-oriented summer camps. built on a long history of horses and riders, the farm provides an atmosphere that encourages horsemanship, teamwork and success for those at all levels.originally run as a riding camp in the summer and a ski camp in the winter by joe and dot mclaughlin, hpf eventually became a boarding and training stable, along with running one of the early horse trials in the country. joe passed the reins to his daughter rosemary “rozo” mclaughlin who further enhanced hpf through her development of a very busy lesson program eventually beginning the wave of the “adult camp.” laurie hudson, joe’s granddaughter, has been running the farm since 2001 and continues to grow and expand the offerings at the farm while maintaining tradition.how to find ushitching post farm is located at 2096 back river road, so. royalton, vt 05068. from interstate 89, take exits 2 or 3 & follow gps.  or visit our contact page for directions.
