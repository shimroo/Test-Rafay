fall, winter, & spring outdoor education programs
today, over 3,000 students from more than 30 regional public and private schools participate in a lutherhaven outdoor education program each year, joining these early explorers in journeys of wonder, adventure and group-building at one of our two sites: camp lutherhaven on lake coeur d’alene and shoshone mountain retreat up the north fork of the coeur d’alene river.
