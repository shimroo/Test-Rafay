	life is beautiful
	
  
upon the blue skies and white clouds i met you then,
    gazing at the starry skies i fell for you,
    memories in paradise were left in thoughts,
        as time continue and trial sets in, 
         through the trials we stand firm,  
         blessed am i with you by my side,          
       moment that i cherish now and forever...

so many feelings.so many thoughts in her mind.she wish she can speak it all out.but words can't describe what she feel inside.how she feel inside.guess you will never know how she feel.she wanted you to know that, nothing else is important to her but you.what you think,what you do.she wants to be part of your world.she knows sometime she lost it all,but to her all is because you are important.but is all this right?has she been on the wrong side? you never let her know.sometimes she really don't know what to do..you appeared in her life and tell her that there are still people who loves her in this world.life is so much more to celebrate.but life hasn't been always good.what is good will have to come to an end and reality will have to sink in.what is life? if only you are here with me...

120606this is a very first post after a extremely long break.it has been a good few months break.there are ups and downs for her.going overseas for attachment bring new meaning to her life.a bigger picture as who is inportant in her life as well as what are her priorities.there are nights where she constantly cried herself to sleep.coming back home was the sweetest memories and being able to be with her family and loved ones.knowing that the moment she opened her eyes there will be someone to greet her with kisses and hugs.all this warm feeling is just priceless....i miss you

some said time is a healer. how true is this statement? she still comes across it difficult some time. though she try her very best to occupied herself with all sort of activities. but nothing can replace the good and quality time she once had. there are times the small thing behind her head just start ticking and remind her of everything. all she had on her face is just sweet smile. things had changed that is for sure. walking ahead is what now she will be thinking of, though there will be tough time she knew the fruit that she get to harvest in the end is worth all the difficult time she will have to bear. weekend especially will be lonely, but the quality time she get to spend with her family heal the loneliest wound in her heart, though deep inside she wish it will be prefect, able to keep both by her side. but she knew is impossible. yet she is thankful for all the blessing from above. she believe everything happen for a cause, the future is what she is looking forward to..
