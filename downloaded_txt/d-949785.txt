best places to buy or sell boats 



what is best place to sell a new or used boat in the uk?


do some web searches on the make & model, and make a note of the brokers, locations and the price for your boats year of manufacture. it is usually the case that second hand boats sell for most in wealthy locations in their country of manufacture, though there are exceptions.
boats that are good sellers in their country of origin often make low money in other countries. for example there is a hunter yachts brand in both the us and uk, but they are unconnected, and each sells best in their home country.
beneteau, moody, jeanneau and so on sell well around europe. some boats fall in value rapidly, others fall to a bottom price then gradually rise again over the years - westerly sailboats in the uk are like that, as they were very strongly built early on and have at least a 50 year proven life. cheaper-built boats die quicker.
some brands like oyster (big sailboats) and sunseeker (big powerboats and yachts) are global.
prices are low in places like south africa (once you have done the deal) and high in places like the uk central south coast.
phone round the brokers, send them the details, ask them what your boat is likely to make. look on websites like boatsforsale.co.uk, a survey report and professional photos also help.
if you are talking about a small cheap boat worth less than £5,000 then maybe sell it yourself.




what is the best place to buy a boat in the uk?


buying a boat can be a great experience or a nightmare. the closest analogy to buying a boat is buying a home. if you are buying a boat that is permanently in the water then we would strongly recommend you use the services of a boat broker or boattrader. one who is a member of a national association.
use a boat broker who is professionally accredited and is competent. one who has been in the business for a while with a good range of boats. they will have little to gain by selling you a boat which is not suited you or has a false description. most boat brokers sell on commission for owners.
to make the most of the brokers time make an appointment,
make sure your broker provides you with a checked inventory or stock list and written acceptance of your offer in the form of a contract with the conditions of sale.
make sure you use a qualified independent boat surveyor. you also need to make sure the broker is providing legal title and all loans will be cleared and a check needs to be done to make sure there is no vat left to pay- ask for proof.
make sure the broker has an audited trust or independent account for your money.
buying a boat is a big purchase. take your time and ask questions. the broker or boat trader will go through the boat controls with you. if possible be there on the day of the survey.
if you do not sure of your driving capabilities ask the broker to organise some lessons - it will be money well spent.
finally make sure you can get insurance, and have somewhere to moor or berth your boat once you own it. ask for a signed transfer of title.
now that you’ve decided where to buy your boats here are some more useful tips when choosing one.
firstly you need to decide what sort of boat you want.




what are the most popular types of boat:


there are so many different styles of boats available now that choosing the right new or used boat for you may seem a daunting task.
do your research and explore the different types of boats available in the uk. consider what you want to use your boat for, where you plan to use the boat (on the sea or fresh water), the size of boat you want, how many people you expect to be on board, whether you want a trailerable boat and if you want a new or used boat or just a cheap, small runabout. narrowing down your options and knowing its purpose will assist you in discovering the perfect boat for you.
some of the popular styles of boats are below:




motorboats and motor yachts


a motorboat (or motor yacht, motor cruiser or power boat as they can also be called) are a type of boat that is powered by a petrol or diesel inboard or outboard engine or motor. a motorboat has one or more engines that propel the vessel over the top of the water. some of the different types of motorboats available are:
 
offshore cruiser
an offshore cruiser or blue water cruiser is a boat designed for extended cruising. offshore cruisers travel at moderate speeds with a relatively gentle motion at sea and can carry large antennas that need to be mounted as high above the water as possible to extend effective radio range.
there are many different styles and sizes of offshore cruiser available, but all can travel long distances for long periods of time.
 
inland cruiser
an inland cruiser or river cruiser as they are also known as are boats that are designed for cruising on inland waterways of which there are loads in the uk.
inland cruisers come in a variety of sizes and they have the advantage of being able to navigate most of the uk rivers and canals. they are modern sleek boats that are easy to steer as they have a steering wheel like that in a car.
smaller inland cruisers can be used as day hire boats but have less facilities than the larger inland cruisers used for holidays and longer trips.


sports cruiser
sports cruisers have two basic requirements that make them a sports cruiser. firstly, the boat will need to be a sporting vessel with a sleek design that is designed to cruise. and secondly, it will need to feature a dedicated cabin with decent berthing capable of accommodating at least two people.
there are a wide range of sports cruisers on the market to choose from and they can range from 25-50 feet in length. if you a looking to buy a sports cruiser, you need to decide whether the ‘sports’ bit (its dynamic performance) or the ‘cruiser’ bit (the internal accommodation) is more important to you.
 
cabin cruiser
a cabin cruiser is a type of power boat that can provide accommodation for its passengers inside the structure of the boat. cabin cruisers can handle the water well and give a stable ride because of their size.
they can be described as mini holiday homes that you can use to take the whole family for adventures on the water. even with the smaller style cabin cruisers you can have the flexibility to enjoy a day of swimming and relaxing on the water or spending long weekends enjoying the boating lifestyle.
these boats are generally equipped with a toilet, a galley, and at least one berth. most cabin cruisers have a small dining area, and some have an aft cabin (a cabin to the rear of the cockpit, with a double bed). some cabin cruisers also come equipped with heating, air conditioning, and power generators.
cabin cruisers usually range in size from 7-14 metres in length. many cabin cruisers can be towed with a trailer and are easily stored on land, which reduces maintenance and expense. the cabin cruiser provides many of the amenities of larger yachts, while costing much less and is normally fully operable by the owner, whereas larger yachts often require a professional crew.
 
classic
a classic boat is a boat that has usually been built between 1943 and 1975. there are many different styles of classic boat available, however there is no universally agreed definition of what a classic boat is. the age of the boat, quality of design and the build are all factors in qualifying a boat as a classic. it is also important to consider an individual boat’s history to determine whether it is a classic.
someone who enjoys bringing something back, making it work and enjoying it for what it truly is will take pleasure in restoring a classic boat. 
 
day cruiser
a day cruiser is a powerboat up to 23 feet in length with a small forward cabin. the cabin lacks standing headroom but is long enough for a single or double berth.
day cruisers are the most affordable type of power boats4sale for short day or overnight cruises and come in a wide range of styles from simple, inexpensive runabouts to larger yachts.
a day cruiser is the ideal boat to take the kids cruising on the sea to a beach for swims and picnics, visit a historic town by water, head across a bay for dinner at a waterfront restaurant, or to meander up a river or canal to see the sights.
day cruisers can be towed on a trailer and launched into the water at many stunning locations.
 
cuddy boat
 
a cuddy boat is a boat with a small shelter cabin and usually has a small toilet. it may also have a small berth. the cuddy on a cuddy boat is usually not tall enough to stand in. typical lengths of cuddy boats range from 5.5-8.5 metres.
cuddy boats are very popular as recreational boats for people who require a boat with a little shelter and storage space but do not wish to upgrade to a full cabin boat. this style of boat serves as a great small-family recreation and overnighter. cuddy cabin fishing boats are also used as near-shore fishing boats.




sailing boats and yachts 


a sailing boat (or sailboat, sailing dinghy, sailing yacht or simply, yacht) as they can also be called is a leisure craft propelled partly or entirely by sail using the force of the wind.
there are lots of different types of sailing boats and yachts available and these can range in size from lightweight inflatable dinghies, all the way up to superyachts as large as 90 metres in length which means they may have one, two or even three hulls. some of the different types of sail boats and yachts available are:
 
catamaran
a catamaran is a multi-hulled watercraft featuring two parallel hulls of equal size. it is a geometry-stabilized craft, obtaining its stability from its wide beam, rather than from a ballasted keel as with a boat with only one hull.
catamarans typically have less hull volume, smaller displacement, and shallower draft than monohull boats of comparable length. they range in size from small sailing or rowing vessels to large naval ships and car ferries.
 
cruiser
a cruising sailing boat is a sailing or motor yacht that is suitable for long-distance travel and offers enough amenities to live aboard the boat yet is small enough to not require a professional crew.
generally between 16-50+ feet in length, these boats offer cabins for extended cruising. boats larger than 26 feet usually have standing headroom down below. many of the more popular models have large fleets and are raced or have fleet associations for group cruising
.
classic
a classic boat is a boat that has usually been built between 1943 and 1975. there are many different styles of classic boat available, however there is no universally agreed definition of what a classic
oat is. the age of the boat, quality of design and the build are all factors in qualifying a boat as a classic. it is also important to consider an individual boat’s history to determine whether it is a classic.
someone who enjoys bringing something back, making it work and enjoying it for what it truly is will take pleasure in restoring a classic boat.




fishing boats


a fishing boat is a boat used to catch fish in the sea, or on a lake or river. there are many different styles of fishing boat that can be used in commercial, traditional and recreational fishing. 
fishing boats can range in size from small dinghies to large charter cruisers and are often not dedicated just to fishing. some of the different types of fishing boat available are:
centre consoles
centre consoles are tough boats to beat when it comes to all-round fishability in different environments. this style of boat is the most versatile and user friendly of all fishing boat types.
 
the helm is located on a console in the middle of the boat which makes for great mobility and excellent visibility. many centre consoles include an onboard toilet and cater to your comfort more than other boats of a similar size.
 
cuddy cabin
a cuddy cabin is similar to a centre console but has an enclosed cabin area in the front. they serve as a great fishing boat but can also be used as a small-family recreation and overnighter.
 
the cabin usually comes with some basic living amenities, such as a small kitchen and a sleeping area. if you are interested in doing more than just fishing on your boat, then this could be the right type of boat for you and your family.
 
flybridge sportfishing boat
a sport fishing boat is a type of power boat designed for recreational fishing by anglers using rods and lines. this style of fishing boat is typically designed with a cockpit at the stern, fitted with a chair that is fixed to the deck to which a rod can be secured. fishing rods can also be used by hand or mounted. these boats usually have a long high foredeck leading back to a rear-set cabin, which has a flybridge set above.
 
sportfishing boats are used for angling on open water, often while travelling at speed. when it comes to deep-sea fishing well beyond the sight of land, an offshore flybridge sportfishing boat is the ultimate option. these vessels are perfectly suited for extended fishing trips and boast some of the most powerful engines you can find. they can also offer very comfortable living areas.
 
walkabouts
walkabouts or walkarounds as they are also known, are fishing boats that have a small cabin but can also offer can offer 360-degrees of fishability. the small cabin with a berth and toilet is perfect for over-night stays, escaping the weather or securing equipment. the unobstructed pass way around the boat goes from the stern at the back to the bow at the front and are often the choice for dedicated anglers who want to fight or land a fish.
they are also a top choice for family anglers with small children, who may need a break from the action now and again.
 
pilothouse
a pilothouse is exactly what it sounds like, it has a pilothouse. this means that the helm station on both sides, the front, and the back is completely enclosed and can be completely sealed off from the elements.
the pilothouse is located in the centre of the boat with two side decks for access to the forward cockpit. a pilothouse usually does not have a living area and but can offer a proper toilet and a good amount of storage space.
the biggest advantage of a pilothouse is that they can offer complete protection from the weather. pilothouses are extremely popular in areas where the boating season may extend into the cooler months of the year, and protection from the elements is critical. you can cruise in comfort whether it is raining, sleeting, or snowing outside.
 
aluminum fishing boat
aluminum fishing boats are one of the most popular types on the water, especially for people who are looking for a smaller style boat. adaptable and often surprisingly inexpensive, they are ideal for anglers who want to work the shallows, navigate through rock or launch from a remote landing.




narrowboats


a narrowboat is a particular type of canal boat that is built to fit the narrow lock and waterways in the uk. narrowboats are used for permanent or part-time residences and are very popular for holidays, weekend break and touring.
on almost all narrowboats steering is by tiller and they usually have steel hulls and a steel superstructure.
narrowboats come in a variety of different stern types. some of the different types of narrow boat available are:
 
traditional stern
a traditional narrowboat is the ideal choice of narrowboat for long cruises and living aboard. they have a classic and attractive design stemming from traditional working boats where space for transporting goods was more important than a communal area to gather. 
this style of narrowboat has the smallest stern area, offering the least external space. there is room for only one person at a time outside, giving more space for inside living. traditional sterns come in a variety of lengths starting from around 40-70 feet. they are the least common style of narrowboat.
 
semi-traditional stern
the semi-traditional narrowboat is an extremely popular choice of narrowboat as it is the modern-day version of the traditional stern narrowboat. they have the looks of a traditional stern with the space of a cruiser.
 
this style of narrowboat benefits from having a slightly larger stern deck, which enables more than one person to be in this area at any one time, making them a more sociable boat for cruising. this style is a popular choice for families and boaters who have dogs as the passengers are in a defined closed in area. due to this additional outdoor seating area, you do however lose some living space within the boat.
 
one big advantage of a semi-traditional design is that the steerer can stand inside the seating area and this will offer some protection from the weather.
 
cruiser stern
a cruiser stern is an ideal holiday boat as it offers a large expanse of external space, ideal for recreational cruising. they have a back deck of between 4-8 foot in length, providing planet of space on the back for several people to stand and socialise.
 
the cruiser stern is the ideal choice for those boaters that want the best cruising experience and are not so worried about the internal space on offer.
 
widebeam
widebeam narrowboats are the ideal choice for those considering living aboard full time and who are not worried about cruising every inch of the canal network.
 
narrowboats are usually 6ft 10” wide but widebeam boats are generally between 10ft to 12ft in width. one of the biggest advantages to them is the additional living and storage space which can often make the inside space of a widebeam look like and have the feel of a small apartment rather than a boat.
widebeams are available in a traditional, semi-traditional or cruiser sterns.




houseboats and liveaboard boats


houseboats and liveaboards in the uk come in a variety of different shapes and sizes and can be either stationary or motor powered. living on a houseboat whether as an alternative home, for vacation, or for permanent residence is becoming more and more popular.
houseboats can by separated into two categories – non-cruising/static houseboats or cruising houseboats.
non-cruising houseboats are the most common type of floating home. they are not designed for travelling out to sea. most of the time, these types of houseboats are moored, anchored, or tied up to a designated spot in a marina or dock etc. these boats are equipped with all the necessary conveniences of a house, and they resemble barges or flatboats. but unlike a typical boat, most static houseboats are unable to operate on water because they lack propelling gadgetries.
if you are looking for a houseboat that can be used for travel on water and for days out or weekends away, a cruising houseboat is a the preferred option. these houseboats come with an engine or sail, so they rely on fuel for mobility and can be operated on minor water bodies but not in high or open oceanic seas. they come equipped with homely furnishings inside, and because they move, they are more of a vacationing vessel.
living on a houseboat whether for vacation, as an alternative home, or for permanent residence is becoming more and more popular. permanent residence of houseboats is often an option for retirement.




speed boats


a speed boat is a boat that is powered by an engine and designed for high speeds. there are two main styles of speed boat – bow riders and cuddy cabins, both of which can be towed on a trailer and launched into the water at many locations. the difference between a bow rider and a cuddy cabin is below:
 
bow rider
a bowrider is a type of speed boat that has a seating area in the bow at the front of the boat. bow riders are a very popular type of boat among all kinds of boaters – from those new to boating, to seasoned veterans who have spent years on the water.
bowriders are generally designed for recreational use such as leisurely day cruising, recreational water sports such as water skiing and swimming. they come in a variety of styles from basic to luxurious so offer something for everyone. bow riders are versatile, which is why nearly every boat manufacturer offers a bow rider line, so there are a lot of choices on the market.
 
cuddy cabin
a cuddy cabin boat combines the agility of a bow rider with the versatility of a cruiser. the term “cuddy” means a small room or cupboard. a cuddy cabin typically does not have enough head room to stand but may include a berth and a toilet. many owners use the cabin as a secure storage space for equipment or as a napping and resting area for the kids.
cuddy cabins range in size from about 20-30 feet in length. they are a great choice of boat for those wishing to enjoy cruising, water sports and even casual fishing. because there is a cabin on board there is also the option to have overnight stays on some of the larger sized cuddy cabins.




inflatable ribs


a rib, rhib or sib as they are also known as are high performance, lightweight powerboats constructed with a solid or inflatable hull and inflatable tubes around the outer edge.
ribs are incredibly versatile boats and their design means they are stable, seaworthy and very durable making them the perfect tool for any commercial work. the added buoyancy from the tubes means that they have an impressive load carrying capability, and if the integrity of the hull is compromised, they will still have adequate flotation to make it back safely to shore.
 
the choice of ribs on the market is now huge. some of the different types of rib’s available are:
 
inflatable keels
these lightweight inflatable keel tenders are the backbone of the inflatable world.  an inflatable keel has an air chamber between a wood insert floor and a fabric bottom which makes it more rigid and gives it a small v shape, so it is not as floppy.
 
rugged enough to be used in any type of water, yet capable of being folded up and stored in a bag, these air decks are perfect when you require a boat that is likely to be assembled and disassembled multiple times a season, and where weight is a critical factor.
 
fibreglass keels
a fiberglass hull tender has a moulded and sleek finish. fiberglass keels are cheaper and easier to repair when minor accidents occur, and it is relatively easy to find fiberglass technicians almost anywhere.
 
fiberglass console ribs have more under deck space on the smaller sizes (up to 15ft).  these can offer a higher under deck fuel tank capacity and/or more space for storage, among other benefits. these boats produce less noise under operation compared with some of the other styles.
 
aluminium
aluminium floor boats provide a more rigid floor and ride slightly better than their air deck alternatives. they are made up from pvc tubes and a floor which is pieced together with lightweight aluminium panels.  
 
these aluminium hulls are much more resistant to impacts in certain conditions i.e., shallow waters and rocky shores.  in case of an impact, the hull might suffer a scratch or bend, but will not fracture. their low weight demands less power, which results in fuel economy and this style of boat is easier to carry and dock.
 
aluminium boats generally require very little maintenance other than keeping the salt off to protect the hull from corrosion.
 
 
hopefully all the above information will help you when looking for your next new or used boats for sale in the uk.
