private client.

experience matters.
for over 50 years, we have been helping clients of all sizes achieve their goals. in 1972 we began advising the world’s largest institutions with our equity research services.  today, we continue to leverage that experience and knowledge to deliver portfolio solutions to our private clients and institutional partners.
we pride ourselves on our depth of experience, proven performance over time, and attention to building long-lasting relationships. 





we know what it takes to build and manage wealth.
and more importantly, we know what it takes to preserve it.  we understand that it took years of hard work to accumulate wealth and it provides a certain lifestyle, freedom to pursue your passions, and a lasting legacy.  we employ our years of experience to formulate a strategy that integrates all of your financial goals, such as retirement, wealth transfer, college savings, corporate and executive services, and more.
contravisory gives you depth and performance with a focus on delivering the highest level of personal service and accessibility. it speaks volumes that our private client business grows almost exclusively by way of referral.







we get to know you personally.our philosophy is built upon the qualities of integrity and trust. we take the time to get to know what’s important to you and your family. a successful wealth management plan starts with a complete understanding of your objectives, values, and passions.


we develop a blueprint and lay the foundation.based on our understanding of your objectives we thoroughly assess your current situation.  we work with you to develop a comprehensive financial plan and investment guidelines based upon your objectives, risk tolerance, and return expectations.  those guidelines will inform all of our decisions as we execute the plan going forward.


let’s grow together.we pride ourselves on delivering a concierge client experience customized to your life.  building on a strong understanding of your situation, you can expect regular updates, educational outreach, and ongoing communication allowing us to monitor your progress and address changes in your life.  steady progress towards your goals is our first priority.
