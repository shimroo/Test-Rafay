"through tennis, lives can be changed and spirits reclaimed." - arthur ashe



why nyjtl?





free programs




cary leeds center





the mission of new york junior tennis & learning is to develop the character of young people through tennis and education for a lifetime of success
on and off the court.
 












you're in good company when you partner with nyjtl. our
partners are an elite group of forward-thinking organizations who
demonstrate their corporate social responsibility by supporting
new york city's kids.






















“our idea is to use tennis as a way to gain and hold the attention of young people in the inner cities and other poor environments so that we can teach them about matters more important than tennis.”

– arthur ashe
