the ear is a musician's foremost tool, and i credit the department of music for honing mine. classes expanded my ear in new directions — first hearing harmonically, then structurally, then texturally, then sociologically. beyond classes, i had opportunities to grow in musicianship such as taking one-on-one lessons with several conducting faculty, conducting the chamber chorale while touring internationally, and interviewing world-renowned conductors for my senior thesis. i am deeply grateful for my music education that intertwined ear and intellect.
