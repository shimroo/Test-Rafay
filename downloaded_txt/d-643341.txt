    one of my favorite things about lakeland is the ccp program, which is a great opportunity to earn college credit so that i'm able to save time and money in the future. it was great that i was able to earn two degrees while still in high school, so i can earn my bachelor's degree in 2 years.

    i loved coming to class to learn about real-life cases that my professors have experienced and the opportunity to go through mock crime scene scenarios. especially with the recent development of the criminal justice program, i enjoyed "investigating" a "residence", simulating a grave excavation, and lifting fingerprints. it is a bittersweet moment that i will be graduating.
