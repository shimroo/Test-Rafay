welcome to dyxum
dyxum.com is a website which provides the opportunity to share still   digital and film images and the experiences of alpha system users.
our most valuable asset is an active forum community where  photographers can learn and share their knowledge, images and experiences.
what makes dyxum unique, is a lens database with information about most lenses ever released for alpha system  film and digital cameras.
if you would like to see a range of the best work our members produce, we would recommend starting with our dyxum photo contest hall of fame.
