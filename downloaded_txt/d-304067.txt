about us
                        
half a century ago, uncle leeâs helped introduce green tea to the north american market. in the process, we carved
                            out a little piece of a rich history. today, our diverse collection of teas continues in that same spirit. it is our mission
                            to share generations of knowledge, craftsmanship, and tradition with tea lovers everywhere. but we arenât here to
                            lecture. try one of our teas. taste the history for yourself.

"this tea is delicious. i would recommend this tea to the universe. it is great with a little honey and lemon."
ogt from amazon




"i am pretty picky about tea, cuz i've always been a coffee person. but i'm trying to make some changes. i find this to be the most balanced green tea i have ever had. doesn't have a harshness to it or something so weak that you don't have the flavor. great purchase i would recommend
