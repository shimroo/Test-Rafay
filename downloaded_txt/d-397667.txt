          the angelfish society was founded in 2000 and became incorporated in march 2003 as 
          a not-for-profit corporation.
          
          we are a collection of angelfish enthusiasts, hobbyists and breeders who are 
            interested in the advancement of our hobby, through improvements in the quality 
            of the fish we keep and breed, by employing the standards which this society has 
            implemented and will continue to develop.
            
            our founding membership came from the angelfish forum where the idea evolved that 
            a set of standards used throughout the hobby would benefit not only the angelfish, 
            but also the professional breeders, hobbyists and enthusiasts who enjoy these 
            wonderful freshwater fish.
            
            the angelfish society is dedicated to the enhancement of the angelfish through 
            high quality breeding programs using standards established by the society.
