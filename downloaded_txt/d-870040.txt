services
for an evaluation of the best technique for reproducing a drawing or a photographic subject in mosaic, the bisazza design studio is available for a free consultation. in addition to the technique that involves the use of whole mosaic tiles, bisazza creates mosaics with hand-cut tiles in smaller sizes and arranged following the pattern of the design, according to an irregular texture.
