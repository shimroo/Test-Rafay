in memoriam: energy 92.7 (oct 2, 2004-sept 10, 2009)





there have been some short stories posted about kngy (energy 92.7) flipping to a chr top 40 format very soon today. according to articles posted at all access, it will become krev-the revolution. the station had been sold a couple months back. 
______

i began this blog in early november in the same way as these guys had for previous dance station kpti which was also on the same frequency of 92.7 from may 2002 to april 2004. energy went on-air on october 2, 2002. the station managed to surpass previous dance station kpti by having a number of on-air djs, several mixshows, a successful morning show, a great selection of music, and of course the crystal clear internet stream. the station will be sorely missed.

i would like to thank everyone who helped with making this blog the best it could be by providing me with updates and other info i might have missed out on. i couldn't have done it without you. this blog will remain online to serve as a resource. i will continue to answer emails sent to the address posted.
