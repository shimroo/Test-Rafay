frequently asked questions









i’m new to aveva, but i am familiar with wonderware, what do i need to know?





in 2014, schneider electric acquired invensys plc, the owner of the wonderware software brand and many others, to form a new software business unit.  aveva and schneider electric’s software business merged in 2018 under the aveva name, with a combined set of software solutions.  in 2021, aveva acquired osisoft combining world-class data management together with aveva’s leading industrial software.









how does this affect existing wonderware users?





it shouldn’t affect users much at all.  the same great software merely changed names from wonderware to aveva.  all of the people, teams and programs remain in effect. users will continue to work with and through the same sales and support personnel.  wonderware software will continue to function and evolve into the future, just under aveva.









are there any benefits to wonderware customers?





yes!  aveva continues the legacy of wonderware by delivering amazing vendor-agnostic software solutions that spark ingenuity, now with an expanded portfolio of software to help you achieve more than ever before.  this includes integrations in new areas such as asset performance, data management, and engineering software technologies.









who should i contact if i have specific questions about my formerly wonderware software?





you may always contact aveva with any questions about our software solutions.  our support teams are standing by to assist with any technical inquiries.  in addition, our partner network, which includes the former wonderware distributors, is also available to assist you with any local sales, support and training.
