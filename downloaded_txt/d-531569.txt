 "i started taylor manse, and it's a tremendous read. your style is first rate, your dialog feels real, and genuinely rendered. i was engaged immediately by the plot, and characters. your works should be getting much more play. they certainly deserve it, in my humble opinion. your canon is a binge-read waiting to happen for lucky discerning readers."  robert blake whitehill

the wager







the native american depicted at the right was painted by the famous western artist, mr. chuck dehann. thank you mr. dehaan for allowing me to use your painting as the focal point of the cover of moon cave.
