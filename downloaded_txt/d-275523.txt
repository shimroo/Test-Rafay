pre-season: two jeremys, a devon, and another rome?
survivor 48 pre-season cast analysis
by damnbueno | published: february 15, 2025
as the new season approaches, damnbueno evaluates the new survivor 48 contestants based on their pre-game interviews, and projects how they'll fare in their tribes and in the game as a whole.



 


pre-season: the best survivor winner's moves ever
survivor multi-season analysis
by damnbueno |
                  published: january 27, 2025
with survivor 48 still a month away, damnbueno has combed through all the winning games and compiled a list of the top 20 moves made by survivor winners in their victorious seasons (plus a few from the not-so-great list). whose move(s) will reign supreme?



 


episode 14: closing out survivor 47

                    episode 14 recap/ analysis
by jeff pitman |
                  published: december 23, 2024
survivor 47 ended well, even if the final result seemed obvious going in, because the contestants made it a real battle, although the non-rachel ones were unable to forestall the inevitable. a solid ending to one of the better new-era seasons. even so, a few things could still be improved in the format. let's discuss.



 


episode 14: a fitting ending for a fitting winner
survivor 47 
                    episode 14 recap/ analysis
by damnbueno |
                  published: december 19, 2024
damnbueno gives his reactions to what really was the second half of the survivor 47 finale: a single, albeit historic, immunity challenge win, the most unsatisfying fire-making challenge yet, and a seemingly tightly fought final tribal that delivered a (correctly) lopsided jury vote. he then asks: who will be back for 50?



 


episode 13: it's semifinale week on survivor 47!

                    episode 13 recap/ analysis
by jeff pitman |
                  published: december 15, 2024
with all the voting out complete on survivor 47, it feels a bit weird that there's still one elimination left, plus the jury vote. why was the season split this way? an answer that attempts to complete the season's edit puzzle.



 


episode 13: an early log-on for rachel?
survivor 47 
                    episode 13 recap/ analysis
by damnbueno |
                  published: december 12, 2024
after an in memoriam for wardog's log, damnbueno gets into the survivor 47 semi-finale two-hour extravaganza, with a whole lot of both big and delicately balanced gameplay from rachel: immunity wins, idol and advantage plays, surprise blindside and somewhat muted f5 exit. who is now poised to take the million?



 


episode 12: could andy actually win now?
survivor 47 
                    episode 12 recap/ analysis
by jeff pitman |
                  published: december 8, 2024
sometimes a survivor episode is so well put together, a seamless synthesis of strategy and storytelling, that everyone loves it. "operation: italy," episode 12 of survivor 47, is exactly that. a taut, perilous heist film that actually pans out, despite ridiculous odds of somebody catching on and everything falling apart.



 


episode 12: they bought it!
survivor 47 
                    episode 12 recap/ analysis
by damnbueno |
                  published: december 5, 2024
damnbueno gives his real-time reactions to the implausibly well-executed "operation: italy" scheme in survivor 47, episode 12, as andy finally pulls off a big move and shatters both the (one episode old) underdogs alliance and the last remaining strong pair. how did it all go so right?



 


episode 11: rachel's big episode
survivor 47 
                    episode 11 recap/ analysis
by jeff pitman |
                  published: december 1, 2024
as survivor 47 episodes go, episode 11 didn't have a ton of mystery - once rachel won the ic, it was pretty clear kyle was headed to the jury. despite that, there was still fun to be had, particularly from of all the places the journey. it was also an episode that dramatically raised rachel's profile as a player.



 


episode 11: perception vs. andy's reality
survivor 47 
                    episode 11 recap/ analysis
by damnbueno |
                  published: november 28, 2024
damnbueno pushes back on andy's edit in survivor 47, with a deep dive on the disparity between andy's view of his own game vs. how his tribemates describe his game. then damnbueno runs through the extremely rachel-centric events of episode 11, from a fast-moving journey task to slow and patient immunity win.



 


episode 10: live by the edit, die by the edit
survivor 47 
                    episode 10 recap/ analysis
by jeff pitman |
                  published: november 23, 2024
it took five post-merge episodes to get there, but episode 10 of survivor 47 finally had everyone cast votes, and the biggest alliance was fractured, and the contestants also managed to dismantle an unwelcome new era twist by collectively abandoning a nearly useless new era trinket. power shifting all around! (plus how the editing shapes our view of contestants.)



 


episode 10: mid-season report card
survivor 47 
                    episode 10 recap/ analysis
by damnbueno |
                  published: november 21, 2024
before getting into the events of episode 10, damnbueno assesses the chances of winning of the final nine. then it's off to the rice-fueled slithering races, and seeing how the numbers realign themselves as tuku tumbles.



 


episode 9: think big, survivor
survivor 47 
                    episode 9 recap/ analysis
by jeff pitman |
                  published: november 18, 2024
in episode 9 of survivor 47, a fan favorite character joined the jury after a chaotic strategic scramble. while the ending was exciting, getting there through all the production-laid hurdles was tiring, if pretty to look at. how to fix that? read on.



 


episode 9: politely, wtf?
survivor 47 
                    episode 9 recap/ analysis
by damnbueno |
                  published: november 14, 2024
damnbueno tries to assign credit for the last episode's boot, then dives into the chaos of survivor 47, episode 9's messy tribal. (it was genevieve.) but was it a good move, long-term?



 


episode 8: get ready to get happy
survivor 47 
                    episode 8 recap/ analysis
by jeff pitman |
                  published: november 11, 2024
episode 8 of survivor 47 brought back the fan-favorite auction (in new era shackles), and featured some brilliant emergent gameplay, with rachel making use of her shot in the dark to assess whether she needed to play her idol. it was a struggle between tribes for dominance, and a struggle for the show to shave off some of its new era excesses.



 


episode 8: when is unpredictable too predictable?
survivor 47 
                    episode 8 recap/ analysis
by damnbueno |
                  published: november 7, 2024
damnbueno wades through episode 8's auction, and finds the survivor 47 version was very long and stubbornly retained all the same flaws found in 45's. but the post-ic maneuvering and a clever shot in the dark play elevated the rest of the episode.



 


episode 7: turning back time
survivor 47 
                    episode 7 recap/ analysis
by jeff pitman |
                  published: november 2, 2024
it's the merge! everyone has purple buffs! but despite all that, episode 7 of survivor 47 sent the tuku tribe back to tribal council, where their pre-merge power dynamics returned to control the vote. all because of a dumb twist, designed to impede the players from actually playing.



 


episode 7: an unwelcome return with a championship twist
survivor 47 
                    episode 7 recap/ analysis
by damnbueno |
                  published: october 31, 2024
amid minor distractions from the world series, damnbueno rounds the bases of episode 7 of survivor 47, an episode that returned the bag of rocks, random-drawn teams, and only six, er, five people voting (ugh), but at least gave sol something fun to do, briefly.
