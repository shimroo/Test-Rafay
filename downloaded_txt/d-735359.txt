innovative, effectiveconservation

the south china tiger is the ancestral root of all tigers, a national, cultural icon of china, and yet it is the most critically endangered of tigers with about 100 left in captivity. 

our mission is to restore, reintroduce and protect a genetically viable population of south china tigers and its biodiverse ecosystem.

the south china tiger, also known as the âchineseâ, or âamoyâ tiger is considered critically endangered by the iucn. there are few, if any in the wild, with the last confirmed sighting over two decades ago. there are currently about 100 in captivity in chinese zoos, reserves and in the care of save chinaâs tigers.

rewilding research paper published






breeding


an ambitious and successful breeding program has increased the population base and gives the subspecies a chance to recover from the genetic bottleneck and the brink of extinction. 



the south china tiger project has supported researchers and scientific studies across many disciplines such as cheetah reintroduction monitoring, camera-tracking photogrammetry and prey consumption rate assessment.  


research





sct continues to work with our partner, the state forestry administration, wildlife division in infrastucture planning and survey of candidate sites in china for future reintroduction of rewilded tigers. 


reintroduction



rewilding


sct has innovated a conservation model that sees zoo-bred tigers made wild again. ârewildingâ allows tigers to rediscover lost hunting skills such as camouflage, stalking, and ambush of wild prey such as boar and ungulates.

by protecting an apex predator carnivore, we are protecting its prey and the entire food chain - the complete biodiversity of its ecosystem. restoring the tiger means restoring its habitat. 


biodiversity




south africa was chosen for its relatively cheaper land, abundant prey, conservation expertise and wildlife management skills. laohu valley reserve encompasses over 300 sq. km bordering the orange river.

the global pandemic has taken a disproportionate toll on wildlife and those who care for them. save china's tigers has also seen a steady decline in donations and has launched a funding appeal to support efforts to confront the challenges of the pandemic and the ongoing maintenance of the 300 sq. km laohu valley reserve. 
brad nilson, managing director said: "as a small charity with a big challenge, we rely on any and all donations. we have launched our appeal to help reduce our shortfall in funding.  we continue to provide a proper reserve facility, professional staffing, prey, habitat and medical care to the world's most endangered tigers and remain steadfast in our efforts to eventually find suitable protected reserves in china. for twenty years, we are the only charity focussed on saving the world's most endangered tiger.  we are in it for the long haul. we currently have 19 hungry mouths to feed, with more to come, and we, and the tigers, would greatly appreciate your kind support."

petri later died in a plane crash while doing an aerial game count in zimbabwe. he was a dedicated and highly respected conservationist and from the beginning, a tireless advisor and supporter of our tiger project. he spent much time trekking our reserve and the distant mountains of china searching for a suitable reserve. we are so thankful for his enthusiastic spirit, creativity, and curiosity about the world that he so willing shared with us. he helped keep the world ordered, yet unexplored and magical. he is greatly missed.  

petri captured the video with a gopro camera mounted on a dji-platform drone hovering about 15 feet off the ground. the tiger slowly stalked the drone and then jumped repeatedly about 4 feet off the ground in an effort to capture it, narrowly missing it. on seeing the video, one scientist commented: "itâs good that the tiger nearly caught the drone, after all, you are teaching them to hunt!"

this airborne tiger is not a trained tiger doing a stunt, but a rare south china tiger attempting to capture and kill a drone flown by the reserveâs conservationist, petri viljoen on save chinaâs tigersâ laohu valley reserve in south africa.
