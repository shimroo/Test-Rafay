getting my master's was a big goal of mine. it was something i always wanted to do, but i was nervous to begin. 

alejandra garcia was recently named the new principal of ector middle school for the 2024-2025 school year.

i love being one of the first people others talk to before arriving on campus! 

alexandria is walking the stage debt free thanks to several scholarships and our falcon free program which allows students whose families make 100k or less a year to have their tuition and mandatory fees covered.
