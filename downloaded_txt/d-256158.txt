amygdala: lying
                      deep in the center of the limbic emotional brain, this
                      powerful structure, the size and shape of an almond, is
                      constantly alert to the needs of basic survival including
                      sex, emotional reactions such as anger and fear. consequently
                      it inspires aversive cues, such as sweaty palms, and has
                      recently been associated with a range of mental conditions
                      including depression to even autism. it is larger in male
                      brains, often enlarged in the brains of sociopaths and
                      it shrinks in the elderly.


brain
                        stem: the part of the brain
                        that connects to the spinal cord. the brain stem controls
                        functions basic to the survival of all animals, such
                        as heart rate, breathing, digesting foods, and sleeping.
                        it is the lowest, most primitive area of the human brain.


cerebellum: two
                      peach-size mounds of folded tissue located at the top of
                      the brain stem, the cerebellum is the guru of skilled,
                      coordinated movement (e.g., returning a tennis serve or
                      throwing a slider down and in) and is involved in some
                      learning pathways. 


cerebrum: this
                      is the largest brain structure in humans and accounts for
                      about two-thirds of the brain’s mass. it is divided
                      into two sides — the left and right hemispheres—that
                      are separated by a deep groove down the center from the
                      back of the brain to the forehead. these two halves are
                      connected by long neuron branches called the corpus callosum which
                      is relatively larger in women’s brains than in men’s.
                      the cerebrum is positioned over and around most other brain
                      structures, and its four lobes are specialized by function
                      but are richly connected. the outer 3 millimeters of “gray
                      matter” is the cerebral
                      cortex which consists of closely packed
                      neurons that control most of our body functions, including
                      the mysterious state of consciousness, the senses, the
                      body’s motor skills, reasoning and language. 

 

the
                          frontal lobe is the most recently-evolved
                          part of the brain and the last to develop in young
                          adulthood. it’s dorso-lateral prefrontal circuit
                          is the brain’s top executive. it organizes responses
                          to complex problems, plans steps to an objective, searches
                          memory for relevant experience, adapts strategies to
                          accommodate new data, guides behavior with verbal skills
                          and houses working memory. its orbitofrontal circuit
                          manages emotional impulses in socially appropriate
                          ways for productive behaviors including empathy, altruism,
                          interpretation of facial expressions. stroke in this
                          area typically releases foul language and fatuous behavior
                          patterns. 


the
                          temporal lobe controls
                          memory storage area, emotion, hearing, and, on the
                          left side, language.


the
                          parietal lobe receives and processes sensory
                          information from the body including calculating location
                          and speed of objects.


the
                        occipital lobe processes
                        visual data and routes it to other parts of the brain
                        for identification and storage.


hippocampus: located
                        deep within the brain, it processes new memories for
                        long-term storage. if you didn't have it, you couldn't
                        live in the present, you'd be stuck in the past of old
                        memories. it is among the first functions to falter in
                        alzheimer's. 


hypothalamus: located
                        at the base of the brain where signals from the brain
                        and the body’s hormonal system interact, the hypothalamus
                        maintains the body’s status quo. it monitors numerous
                        bodily functions such as blood pressure and body temperature,
                        as well as controlling body weight and appetite.


thalamus: located
                        at the top of the brain stem, the thalamus acts as a
                        two-way relay station, sorting, processing, and directing
                        signals from the spinal cord and mid-brain structures
                        up to the cerebrum, and, conversely, from the cerebrum
                        down the spinal cord to the nervous system.
