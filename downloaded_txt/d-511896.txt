who we are


 











quality has been our driving force since 1932. my grandfather, lines r. taylor, had that vision of quality. joined by my father, robert w. summers, after world war ii, these two men grew the company based on a mission of providing quality workmanship at a reasonable price.
with this heritage comes responsibility. we believe quality is about smart budgeting, being sensitive to the environment, and caring for the communities and residents where we work. 
let my company show you what a difference a dedicated group of professionals can make on your project. we pledge to do everything possible to bring the summers-taylor quality to you.

r.t. (rab) summers
chairman of the board
