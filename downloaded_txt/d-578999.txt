february 2 : 
			new found  bruce kulick / michael bolton demo track

/ bruce kulick
			last week, julian gill of kissfaq messaged me about a newly 
			discovered demo song from 1986/1987 called 'chains of love' by bruce 
			kulick and michael bolton, which neither of us had heard of before. 
			
			to verify that this aor-style demo was legitimate, we both reached 
			out to bruce kulick.


written by bruce kulick, michael bolotin, and desmond child 
			"chains of love" started off with a musical track demoed by bruce on his 
				home recording equipment with a drum machine track, likely in 
				late-1986/early-1987. bruce performed the guitars, including a 
				gorgeous era-appropriate solo, bass, and keyboards, and then 
				provided the instrumental track to michael bolton. michael 
				completed the melody and lyrics with songsmith desmond child, 
				and then recorded a vocal track for the demo. the song wouldn't 
				be used on michael's 1987 "the 
				hunger" 
				album or "soul provider" in 1989, which did include a 
				collaboration with desmond child (and diane warren). 
			a 3:35 
				version of the completed demo - engineered by ira david hoch - 
				surfaced in 2022.







february 2 : 
			
			frehley's comet live +1 - the expanded edition - vinyl re-release 
			2025
from 
			:

fridaymusic.com
"live+1" 
			was originally a 1988 ep by the hard rock band 
frehley's comet
			

			led by former kiss co-founder ace frehley. the super rare extended 
			play recording was meant to keep the radio programmers and fans 
			happy until the release of the band's second studio album, "second 
			sighting."

			the first four songs were recorded live at the aragon ballroom in 
			chicago, illinois, on september 4, 1987. the last song, "words are 
			not enough," is a rare version of a demo recording the group made in 
			1985.

			this hard rockin' live masterwork has been out of print for decades, 
			that is until now.....

			friday music is very pleased to announce for the first time ever 
			"live + 1 - the expanded edition" by ace frehley and frehley's 
			comet.

			mastered impeccably by joe reagoso (ace frehley/alice cooper/david 
			bowie) from the atlantic records tapes. "live +1" is now enhanced 
			with two more bonus tracks making this a highly collectable lp for 
			all ace frehley and kiss fans.

january 22 : 
			new found vinnie vincent 1982 funky-disco recording
from 
			: 

kiss related recordings 
			recently, someone emailed me about a rare vinnie vincent recording i 
			wasn't aware of. to verify that it's not fake, i did some research 
			and reached out to richard friedman, who co-wrote and recorded the 
			funky disco track "keep on dancin'" with donald pantoliano under the 
			name
			
			third rail band.
			so here's a little surprise for you to check out and listen to: 
			vinnie vincent played an amazing lead guitar solo at the end of the 
			song, starting at the 5:04 mark.

			between 1980 and early 1982, vinnie cusano (a.k.a. vinnie vincent) 
			worked for richard friedman at we buy guitars in nyc. during that 
			time, they wrote and recorded the demo 

			"back 
			on the streets" 
			and a few other songs.

			since the mid-1980s, richard friedman's name has often been 
			misspelled as "richard freeman" in the credits for "back on the 
			streets," such as on
				
				vinnie vincent invasion (1986) and
				
				john norum "total control" (1987).
