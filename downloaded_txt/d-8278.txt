the canine good citizen program

				
				by launching the canine good citizen program in 1989, the american kennel club established a training benchmark, for both pet dogs and their owners, that represents a solid, basic foundation for the well-adjusted dog.  the tests involved in the canine good citizen certification represent the facets of dog behavior that are important in the home environment, social situations, and even veterinary visits.although the program establishes training goals and works with other organizations and local governments  to encourage the adoption of their standard, it is the certification exam that they are most known for.  in fact, obtaining the canine good citizen certification is a prerequisite for some assistance and therapy dog organizations, and it is considered the starting point for other obedience and performance events.who can take the certification tests?any dog, whether purebred or mixed breed, can take the tests and obtain canine good citizen certification.  the only requirement is that the have all necessary vaccinations and boosters, including rabies, so there is an implicit minimum age for participation.  additionally, the program encourages owners who obtain certification with a puppy to re-test when the dog reaches adulthood, to make sure the training and behavior is maintained through the normal behavioral changes that occur as a dog matures.

irish terrier
					to train or not to train.
for an irish terrier puppy, it 
will be well advised to find an 
experienced terrier trainer.
balance with proper socialization 
early on in your puppy's life.  
get your puppy accustomed to nail 
trimming and grooming now.  you 
don't necessarily need to groom 
an i.t. puppy, but get them used 
to the feel of a smooth soft 
bristle baby brush (for example).  
if you wait until later, it will 
not go as smoothly.
					
irish terrier
					choosing an irish terrier puppy 
with a sweet temperament is 
important, but no guarantee 
forever.  be very wise when 
introducing to other dogs, make 
sure they are also very nice 
dogs.  if exposed to aggressive 
behavior, an irish terrier will 
of course defend itself, and 
there will be no turning back.  
avoid situations where your pup 
is forced to defend itself.  that 
is your job, to keep your puppy 
safe at all times and in every 
situation.
					
glen of imaal terrier
					recently we rescued of glen of imaal from our local spca. she is 4 yrs old and is a very focused little girl. a mind of her own, not real affectionate, but very loyal at the same time. she has trained me well.

brussels griffon information

					the brussels griffon is a breed of toy dog named for the griffin, a mythological animal, which it is said to resemble.  the brussels griffon seems to have descended from a dog used by 17th-century belgian peasants to rid their stables of rats.  the ancestry of the modern breed includes the affenpinscher, the smooth-coated pug, and the ruby spaniel. conformationbrussels griffons have distinctive short, upturned faces, large, round heads, short noses, and unusually large and prominent black eyes.  the male griffon from 7 to 12 pounds.  the female is slightly larger. disposition the brussels griffon is intelligent, alert, sensitive, and full of self-importance with an almost human expression. they are inside pets, good with other pets and children of all ages.  there are two types of coats, rough and smooth. they come in colors of beige, black, black and beige and red.  courtesy of kelly crawford, kmc-kennels.

dog question of the week
some answers to last week's question:
what is the best trick you have ever taught your dog?

this week's question:

						what is the best trick your dog has taught you?

read previous dog questions


					although we have taught many tricks over the years, the greatest trick (at least for others) is the dogs that show the children at the schools to ""stop, drop and roll"".  however my personal favorite is the flying dog - a male of ours that leaps to 6 1/2 feet from a sit to retrieve what ever it is
