inside|the|x: the x-files transcripts archive
















hey! does this thing go to 11? how are you all doing!

2018-01-03 added: transcript for babylon



welcome to insidethex, a complete collection of transcripts for every episode of
"the x-files" and
"the lone gunmen" to have been screened on tv.
also included are transcripts of "the x-files: fight the
future (1998)", "the x-files: i want to believe
(2008)" and a transcript of "the simpsons
- the springfield files", an episode featuring the fbi's finest. each transcript contains the full dialogue,
locations, scenery and background information where appropriate.

these transcripts are the very hard work of some very important people who took the time and effort
to tirelessly produce them after each episode. this project started 20 years ago (i know, i know...)
and since then every episode has gradually been accounted for by dedicated fans.
the truly magnificent carrik in particular helped to make this possible, contributing more than 50 transcripts,
including most of series 5 and all of series 6, 7 and nearly all of 8. vic vega also deserves a mention for
contributing over 35 transcripts particularly series 1 and 2. season 9 was transcribed by x_follower,
intrepidly, alexandre doctor-x, and myself. i've been working on seasons 10+ myself. transcripts for the lone gunmen were transcribed by libby and
myself.


dvd commentaries/notes/articles/interviews: if you want to read transcripts of the dvd episode
commentaries and assorted notes and script snippets, libby has painstakingly typed them up and they are available from 
the unofficial website for mitch pileggi and the x-files.
a large collection of interviews and articles can be found at eatthecorn.



lastly, i really enjoy feedback on the site and the transcripts, so click here
to let me know where you are visiting from. so far we have had visits from over 140 countries!



enjoy seasons 10 and 11 and happy reading guys!
