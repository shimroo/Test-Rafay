a-k.com - now for sale or lease for a limited time - $190k 


thanks for your interest in a-k.com - if you are interested in purchasing this domain, please click the button below to get in contact. some value points for the domain: 1. highly aged (seo benefits)(a-k.com has been active since 1996)  2. highly sought after (value appreciation)(139,100+ other websites use the term “a-k” in their domain)  3. highly competitive (#1 brand of its keyword) (“a-k” is taken in 78+ other extensions besides .com) 4. high comparable sales (best value indicator) (one of 676 l-l.com domains - this is priced at 1/5 of the price of the non-hyphened .com domain and it’s treated the same in seo/branding!)



use the button below to go to our contact page where you fill out a form to express your interest in this domain. note: we do not respond to inquiries that we deem to be unserious - unserious inquiries include those with too small of offers, ones without traceable contact/company names, & anyone potentially using shady tactics.

we believe it’s imperative to operate with the upmost transparency and goodwill as it relates to helping companies find the right brand - we will only do business with people  who respect our values.we understand that domain value is something not taught in business school but we ask that you do some research on it before attempting to make contact or putting together an offer. the domains we sell vary from $10k-$10m usd+ (and the prices we have are backed by market data) - chances are that if the domain in question is a high use generic domain (or is in a very rare category like 3 letter .com), it will be priced between at least 250k-1m. if you don’t have this kind of capital laying around, we are open to talking financing (but only to accredited individuals). thank you for taking the time to read this.
