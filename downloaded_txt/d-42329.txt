            a strain of bird flu has been detected in a nevada dairy worker that could make it pass more easily among people, alarming some officials. how concerned are you about the potential for an h5n1 pandemic?





you voted: 






 i’m very concerned. i’m cooking meat and eggs thoroughly, avoiding raw dairy, vaccinating my pets against the flu, washing my hands regularly, and considering masking in high-traffic public spaces.
                                



 i'm worried about the devastation to wild and domesticated birds, but not as concerned about damage to humans at this point. i am closely monitoring the situation, however.
                                



 i’m more concerned about the possibility of increased cost and decreased availability of meat and eggs than i am about h5n1 triggering another pandemic.
                                



 i wasn’t aware there was a bird flu outbreak going on.
