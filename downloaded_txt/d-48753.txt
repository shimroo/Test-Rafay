   jubilee resourcesvisit the official website for the jubilee year here.tradition dictates that each jubilee is proclaimed through the publication of a papal (or pontifical) ‘bull of indiction’.  you can read more (here) about this important document on the vatican's website for the jubilee year.  the title for the bull of indiction is taken from the first words of the document, in this case, "“hope does not disappoint." visit the jubilee website from the united states conference of catholic bishops here.we have also created a page of resources for individuals and parishes for the jubilee year of hope (available here).
