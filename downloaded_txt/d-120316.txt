when the wife complains just say.........
the character of a football helmet 
    captures the essence of a sport better than any other piece of equipment. 
    helmet shape and composition determine the specific era in which it was 
    used. helmet battle scars can reflect a specific player position or style of 
    play.  changes to helmet logos and color schemes usually symbolize a failing 
    team's effort to rebuild itself. customized padding may indicate a player's 
    specific sensitivity to injury. the angle slant of a receiver's one bar 
    facemask reveals how much he was willing to sacrifice protection for 
    additional visibility and performance. red or blue paint over spray on the 
    inside edges of the helmet suggest that the player may have been 
    exceptionally talented and a member of an all-star or pro bowl squad. 
    conversely, excessive facemask attachment holes drilled in the shell 
    probably indicate that the helmet is a "hand me down" and was last worn by a 
    reserve type player. these are just a few of the endless examples that show 
    how the flavor of the sport can be savored through the nuances of a football 
    helmet. helmet hut is an electronic helmet museum that provides historical 
    information and pictures related to professional and college football 
    helmets that were worn from the 1950s through the 1970s. actual game worn 
    helmets are featured along with "authentic helmet hut reproductions"  
    that proudly display the "helmet hut" trademark inside each shell.
