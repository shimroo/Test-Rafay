(secret swim holes)




the typical day
    - 




the cabins form a small village with a  central kitchen and patio, an outdoor bar and campfire.
 children constantly move from cabin to cabin, to the  spring
          house, 
          pond, woods or to somewhere "new". 




        children have outdoor games,  a small pond, acres for playing and local swimming holes.
  

secluded swimming holes attract kids and adults.


teenagers and the more adventurous explore
unspoiled
            local vistas, trails and lakes, and generally enjoy 
the surrounding spectacular wilderness.

adult family reunion members often sit around the outdoor bar and campfire
with food and beverage, exchanging 
          family information, telling new versions of old stories 
          
and enjoying each other while the kids kids play nearby.


weather is typically 
            perfect; 65-85 degrees and
            low humidity.
            nights 
        are typically 55-65 degrees with the starry skies centered around the milky 
        way.
