the father's house, northern california

what we found with fcr is they are kingdom minded, they’re church friendly, and they understand ministry and big vision. they understand how churches operate by faith and by growth. working with fcr has been a completely different experience than working with the other lending institutions and banks we have worked with over the years. i think that’s because they understand what pastors and churches are doing in their community and what it’s going to take to get it done. - dave patterson, lead pastor at the father's house
