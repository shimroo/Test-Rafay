            baseball the way it’s meant to be played. 

            manage your team from the clubhouse and from the 
            dugout. from formation draft, to rookies and free agents; trade your 
            way through rebuilding, or find that missing piece to win this 
            year’s championship.  

            winning a purebaseball championship 
            takes more than just a great roster, it means winning baseball 
            games, not categories. each mlb player is rated for a vast array of 
            baseball skills and games are played via our highly realistic game 
            simulator where you call the shots from the dugout. 

            it’s always baseball… purebaseball!
