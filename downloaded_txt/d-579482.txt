had a great experience with this company!

they are professional, knowledgeable, prompt, willing to return for any concerns or problems. the quality of work was very impressive! i highly recommend the crawlspace doctor! they went up and beyond to address all of our water issues and crawl space encapsulation.

i will try and make this as short as possible...

we just moved to tn from co and just bought our house 12 weeks ago. we have had nothing but rain which has equated to 8″ of water constantly being in our crawl space? this just can’t be normal or good! we had 6 companies come out and give us their thoughts and got bids from them. but, what made tom with crawlspace doctor stand out above the rest, was his concern for where the water was coming from and not wanting to put an expensive band-aid on a bigger issue. tom came to our house at least 6 times, coming out in rain and shine, and then more rain before he came up with quite a few options. we signed the bid with tom only after him coming out two more times to our house explaining every little thing in detail to us again. the work was to take 6 days and it took exactly 6 days, now justin which is tom’s son took over and was the main person handling all of our work and his attention to detail and true care for his and his teams workmanship was something you just don’t see anymore! we 100% recommend tom and justin with crawlspace doctor for crawl space encapsulation, because not only were they professional, diligent, and caring but they were fair priced and did an excellent job. and thank you!

we hired the crawlspace doctor...

to do an encapsulation of our crawl space, they offered an alternative to having a dehumidifier installed without any upkeep on a separate unit, they piped in a couple of small ducts into our hvac system. our floors are not as cold as they were without the work of the crawlspace doctor folks. we also hired them to installed some extra support to stiffen our floors, they did a great job, cleaned up afterwards and hauled away all debris when they gave our crawl space a cleaning. the area is now sealed and has a great appearance. we would recommend them!
