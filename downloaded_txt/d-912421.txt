after one 
              year and more than a hundred of mp3s, time is come to stop the site.
 
i don't have enougth 
              time and money to fight against powers and laws.
 



thank you for your visits.





 
my opinion is that 
              the initial philosophy of internet was not to make money with 
              the e-buisness, but to have a technical solution to exchange 
              ideas and cultural things with the whole world. many people 
              in the world are not able just to have food, while big 
              record companies make billions of dollars and treat us as thief 
              just because we put many mp3 on the net. music has no price. 
              them who are not agree with that don't really love music. real musicians 
              don't need big companies to make money. they just do their things, 
              and they become legends. i like to put my favorite musics 
              on the net as i like to talk about my favorite books or to show 
              my favorite paintings to my friends, and that's all. 
please send me your opinion. 
              thanks.
