        about us
      

reid school of music





at the reid school of music, we are committed to thinking differently about music and helping students make a rich contribution to cultural life when they graduate.we do this by examining the social contexts where music thrives, studying how sound and music affect mind and body, learning about musical acoustics and technologies, and creating, performing and sharing music in all of its forms across the capital of scotland.working with you is a dedicated team of staff who lead their fields as performers, composers, sonic artists, historians, community activists and scientists, ready to share their knowledge, experience and enthusiasm directly with you.based in the centre of edinburgh, you’ll have ready access to several concert halls, spaces to rehearse your band, setup your gig or practice in one of our steinway school piano rooms. in addition, the uks top musicians regularly visit to give concerts and masterclasses. your experience is further enriched by our ensemble in residence programme, open mic nights, and busy student-led music societies creating performance opportunities across genres from orchestra to music theatre, experimental, jazz and traditional music.
