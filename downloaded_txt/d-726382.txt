---------
the 2024 annapolis
reunion - is complete




this is a short sample of
photos -  more to come as they come
in.



   
the 2024 reunion in annapolis, md ran from june 10-13, 2024. we do
believe everyone attending had a great time. our stay was at the
doubletree by hilton and was a fine choice. ease of access and nice
facilities. there were multiple highlights, with the main two on wed.
june 12. this included a visit to the naval academy and our memorial
service at the grave site of hugh purvis. both highlights were enhanced
by the attendance of 3 generations of the hugh purvis family. hugh
purvis's great grandson terry and wife beth also attended our annual
dinner on wed. evening. 

    below are some of the photos from the three days.
for more, see the 2024 annapolis gallery link in the left column (under
