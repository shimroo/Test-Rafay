                    as you may have heard, ad service blogads.com is closed for business.
                

                    blogads had a long and exhilarating ride. when our ad service for bloggers launched here in the
                    spring of 2002, mark zuckerberg was a high school senior and barack obama was in the illinois state
                    senate. since then, blogads has seen many peers in the social media advertising ecosystem arrive
                    (facebook, linkedin, twitter, instagram, tiktok et al) and depart (xanga, friendster, adbrite,
                    federated media, gawker, pajamas media, and glam, to name a few.)
                
 
blogads tees were a huge hit, seen everywhere from the taj mahal to
                    yosemite to swanky parties in manhattan.

                    for better or worse, blogads helped fund many of the people whose ideas became the intellectual
                    bedrock of 21st century america. through our ups and downs since 2002, it was a privilege to see
                    sites weâve helped fundâperezhilton, dailykos, feministing, talkingpointsmemo, politicalwire,
                    dlisted, wonkette, instapundit, largeheartedboy, sportsblognation, methodshop, marginalrevolution, obscurestore,
                    galadarling, the millions, metafilter, stereogum, concreteloop, jack & jill politics,
                    electoral-vote, dooce, techcrunch, busblog, comicscurmudgeon, pinkdome, scienceblog, kuro5hin,
                    aquarium drunkard, cuteoverload, virginia postrel, davewiner, litkicks, tomandlorenzo, gothamist,
                    betches, gaypatriot, drudgeretort, americablog, joho, susiebright, regretsy, andrewsullivan, blue
                    virginia, democraticunderground, volokh conspiracy, matt welch to name a fewâshape the content,
                    format and trajectory of ideas (and fun) in the us and around the world.
                

from the spring of 2002, the original spec for blogads, the grandmother of all
                    platforms for self-serve content advertising in social media. (iâd totally forgotten blogads was
                    originally called blogadz, until nick denton counselled me over coffee in nyc that the âzâ felt very
                    1999.)

                    on a personal note, thanks to blogads, i got to know three amazing guys, brian clarke, jake brewer
                    and david carr, who each died in 2015. each guy was wonderful and wonder-filled. in their
                    fieldsârespectively advertising, advocacy, and journalismâeach was a diligent practitioner and a
                    joyful philosopher. most years i got to talk with brian, jake and david just a few times, by phone
                    or in person, but what a difference those talks made for me. every conversation fanned a fire.
                    afterwards, words cut sharper, possibilities glimmered, goals clarified, the world got bigger. i
                    miss their wisdom and grins, particularly in this busted-to-hell 2017.
                




                    done right, a business is a life raft rowing away from lifeâs inexorably sinking ship. a good
                    business always keeps you busy, often keeps you dry and sometimes keeps you sane. by definition,
                    every shuttered business is a failure. but, though blogads.com ultimately lost its own little war,
                    everyone who participated is proud that we helped other causes win their own important battles and
                    wars.
                


                        long before there was a clear ad model for social media, we helped political blogs become
                        viable. weâre particularly proud that blogads underwrote the grassroots political blogs that
                        helped set the stage for barack obamaâs victory in 2004. (more recently, we rue the ads we sold
                        for bloggers who later cheered donald j. trumpâs know-nothing nihilism.)
                    

                        we helped underwrite the seedlings that ultimately grew into publishing empires like vox,
                        techcrunch, blogher and popsugar. (in 2005, 23 of the 30 biggest blogs relied on our service.)
                    

                        after much evolution, the reigning ad format of the twenty-teens (and onward?) is not much
                        different from the original 2002 âblogad,â our eponymous proprietary ad unit that combined an
                        image and link-filled text to deliver readable, site-synchronized information. this ad format
                        has become the standard for successful advertising and is today called ânativeâ advertising.
                        itâs with zero chagrin and some laughs that i recall how intensely annoyed conventional
                        advertisers (including my buddy michael bassik) were when we introduced the blogad. âitâs a lot
                        easier to massproduce a 300ã250 gif that can run anywhere,â the critics said. to which we
                        replied: exactly!
                    

                        self-service advertising, which blogads helped pioneer, is now standard too â with diy ads
                        driving revenues for facebook, twitter, linkedin and google. (hereâs a 2011 video of building a blogad.)
                    

                        my 2002 prediction that social media (then basically the blogosphere)
                        would eventually âpower knowledge-sharing far more profound than anything offered by current
                        mediaâ has been proven true 1000-times over. as has the prediction that "the old economics of media â 
                        he who controls distribution wins the most readers and serves advertisers best â will be plowed under 
                        by a new economics â she who relates best attracts the most valuable audience." driven by darwinian pressures and abetted by
                        zero-cost cmses, self-publishing has morphed and mutated to invade every existing media niche
                        and create many new niches. social media has speciated into hundreds of different forms, forums
                        and idiomsâ¦ snippets of text, photos, wifi-as-community, vanishing photos, audio, videos, animated
                            gifs.
                    

                        traditional news and entertainment businesses have become, as i predicted in 2002, like
                        ârefrigerator salesmen trudging into the next ice age.â the volume and pace of people-created
                        content has diluted many publishersâ mindshare to the point that theyâre irrelevant. the social
                        media sideshow of 2002 has become 2017âs big top, with publishingâs once-mighty elephants now
                        beleaguered and begging for peanuts from the former audience (who are too busy selecting an
                        instagram filter to notice.)
                    


                    sadly, the utopian dream that ad-supported, autonomous, righteous bloggers would flood the world
                    with torrents of cleansing information has proven to be false.
                

                    first, the money isnât there. the supply of what we in the ad industry call âpage impressionsâ
                    (articles, posts, comments, videos, photos, animated gifs, comments on comments, smiley faces on
                    comments on posts about videos about memesâ¦ etc etc etcâ¦ content!) has multiplied, far oustripping
                    advertiserâs demand. compounding the problem, programmatic ads, technology which allows advertisers
                    to bypass name brand publishers to target readers based on demographically specified cookies, has
                    proven immensely cost effective. (for example, cisco doesnât need to pay $50k to reach a few
                    thousand (hundred?) ctos on the new york timesâ site or even techcrunch because, for just a few
                    nickels, it can use cookies to locate and target the same people elsewhere on the web.
                

                    second, transparency. some blogs are selling posts to advertisers without disclosing the impetus for
                    the post. many others are creating information and spin to earn ideological or social brownie
                    points.
                

                    third, noise. many blogs are now irrelevant amid a surplus of cat videos and bogus cancer cures. in
                    politics, a few blogs like politicalwire, dailykos and talkingpointsmemo battle on, often relying on
                    subscriptions. their efforts notwithstanding, facebook, with all its secret nuclear-powered
                    link-algorithms, now propels factoids and opinions far faster and further than human hands could
                    ever manage. as dana boyd notes, social media has proven to be both an r&d lab and icbm of falsehood. even
                    highly evolved state-of-the-art platforms like medium are failing in their mission to power great bloggers.


                    in short, most blogs are bust. sadly, ad-driven fact-focused journalism is begging for bailouts too.
                    maybe weâre all lost.
                



in addition to sitting in the front row as history was made and saving some marriages, we met a lot of great people.
