testimonials















“m&m showjumping is a premier barn for the horse and rider.  the head trainer, monica, is able to attend to both the horse and rider’s individual needs - making them a unified team.  i have been riding here for over six years and have created lifelong friendships and memories that i can carry with me my whole life.” 
maddy b.











“when i came to m&m showjumping, i had just turned eight years old and had never ridden in an english saddle.  one year later, i competed in my first national show, winning two grand champions and a reserve champion.  monica and her staff have not just taught me how to be an excellent equestrian, but more importantly, an excellent horseman.” 
bryn t.
