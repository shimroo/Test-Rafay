vision
the ppa community promotes academic excellence, whole-child education, and fosters innovation in a safe environment.
mission
pinellas preparatory academy (ppa) is more than just a school. our ppa community is made up of students, faculty, staff, families, and other stakeholders. we support and nurture all areas of children’s development and learning with a focus on social emotional, cognitive skills, academic development, global citizenship, physical health, and humanities. we take learning outside of our textbooks. our students connect lessons to the community and contribute to the solution of real-world issues through cross curricular hands-on experiences. we are committed to providing an environment where students are physically and emotionally safe to ensure they reach their highest potential. our rigorous and innovative curriculum provides our students with the tools necessary to succeed outside the walls of ppa.
