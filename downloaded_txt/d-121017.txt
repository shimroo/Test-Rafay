is mother nature humane?when it comes to wildlife, many people feel that if we let nature take its course that all wildlife problems will be solved. this is true to an extent as mother nature will stop overpopulations of any animal from occurring.however, just how is this done if nature takes its course and man does not interfere? any animal, take foxes or raccoons for instance, is able to reproduce at a rate that the population doubles yearly; two, then four, then eight, etc.soon there comes a time that there are so many animals that there is not enough food to go around, or enough area in which to live. some animals must therefore go. the way mother nature limits the number of any species is through disease, internal strife between the animals, or starvation.read more





















   the trapping chronicles came to life after fta contacted chuck sykes of the management advance company to produce the first ever television promotion of trapping.   donations were received from across the country from trappers, associations, fta members and their affiliates which made these broadcasts possible.   the videos explain the use of trapping as a wildlife management tool, and how trapping helps play a large part in wildlife conservation.
