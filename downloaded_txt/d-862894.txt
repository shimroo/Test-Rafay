who is the new jersey real estate referral group?
 


 

the new jersey real estate referral group (njrerg) is a licensed real estate  brokerage firm, serving as principal broker for a vast network of real estate  referral agents in new jersey. unlike conventional real estate brokerage firms,  njrerg’s mission is to refer our buyer and seller leads to full-time sales  associates who handle the transactions and address all of the customer's real  estate-related needs. the associates receiving our agents leads are prepared to  deal in a professional manner with all the time-consuming details and  intricacies of listing, selling, negotiating and finalizing real estate  transactions. 

          the njrerg is a network that consists of active real estate licensees who have  chosen to direct business to full-time real estate professionals. this means  that the members of our network are able to earn commissions and keep their  licenses active without themselves providing representation to buyers and  sellers in real estate transactions.

          our  company's mission is to give associates who choose not to pursue real estate as  a full-time career the ability to earn extra income by placing real estate  leads with the most professional sales agents in new jersey. our company is  well-positioned to provide all the support necessary for the successful  servicing of prospective buyers and sellers on a referral basis.
