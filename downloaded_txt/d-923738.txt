 cgi projects.

scripting projects
my scripts below are self-contained and don't require any particular
 library or framework; plus, they're free to download and use. if you like them,
 consider making a donation to support their development.
 see the menu to the left for more scripts and resources!

freestyle menu v1.0 rc12
a very flexible unlimited-level, drop down javascript menu that uses ul/li list data
    formatted with a css menu layout. it's powerful, lightweight and extremely easy to use!
supernote v1.0beta2
easily turn plain footnotes into dynamic, css-formatted popup tooltips.
dragresize v1.0beta
makes page elements draggable and freely resizeable.
checktree v1.0 rc
displays and manages a multilevel list of checkboxes.
iepngfix v2.0a4
makes png images and backgrounds work in ie 5.5/6.0 without any modifications
    to your document html.
htmlhttprequest v1.0beta3
dynamically request pages from the server and parse/insert them into your document,
    using xmlhttprequest or a hidden iframe transport for best browser compatibility.
    it's great for ajax web apps or as a frameset replacement!
photo morpher v1.0 beta
an image gallery on steroids. blend and morph between images that are defined in a
    standard list in the page for easy modification and good backwards compatibility.
addevent manager
easily add multiple event handlers to an object across all common browsers.

cgi scripts

twinhelix forums v1.0 beta 3
a self-contained perl website forum that doesn't require a database.

v4+ browser compatible scripts

cascading popup menu v5.2 rc4
an extremely customisable hierarchial popup javascript menu: it's more of a pure
   javascript / dhtml menu system, with flashy effects and cross frames support.
dhtml scroller v4.0 rc2
an iframe replacement, can load external files and scroll vertically using divs.
tipster v3.1 rc
adds mouse-tracking and fading popup javascript / html tooltips to your page, or
    forms them into nested popup menu arrangements.
cross-browser dhtml api v1.1 rc
for dhtml coders, to simplify cross-v4-browser coding.
