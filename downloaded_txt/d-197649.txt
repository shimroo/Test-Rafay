welcome to the home office of the connected international meeting professionals association (cimpa). 
cimpa is unlike most meeting planning organizations. our mission is simple: to connect people through meetings and travel. 
in this association, distance is irrelevant and borders are non-existent. our 3436 members are in 124 countries in 5 continents. collectively, the planner members of cimpa plan over 200,000 meetings annually.
