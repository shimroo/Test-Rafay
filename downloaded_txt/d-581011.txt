                                        what a true pleasure to experience perfect customer service that is beyond comparison!

from the young lady who took my order by phone, to the email updates with pictures, plus the expedited delivery date and bill the delivery driver (who went above and beyond to ensure a successful delivery), i cannot praise this business & its employees enough.

living 5 hours away, it's a tremendous relief to know that i can count on the plant shoppe's staff to brighten both of my daughters' days while they're away at college.

thank you all for everything!

                                        she love it! it was very professionally done. i would reorder it again from the same shop for other occasions. remember to order from a local store and not through an online website.

                                        thank you so much for the beautiful arrangement and balloons! my daughter is a student at uf in gainesville and the plant shoppe always makes the most beautiful displays for her when i place orders for special occasions. i truly appreciate the thought and care that go into making them and the pictures of the order that they always send. i can't recommend them enough!

                                        i recently purchased two dozen roses from the plant shoppe florist, and they were absolutely stunning! the roses were humongous, fresh, and vibrant, and the arrangement was beautifully complemented by lush greenery and purple flowers. the attention to detail and quality exceeded my expectations. hands down, the best florist ever! i couldn’t be happier with my purchase and will definitely be returning for future floral needs. highly recommend!
