crux,
the southern cross, is visible from latitudes south of 25 degrees north
and completely invisible in latitudes above 35 degrees north. 


crux
was unknown to the ancient world, ptolemy drew it as part of centaur in
the original 48 constellations, the romans called it thronis caesaris in
honor of emperor augustus, although crux is invisible in italy, it was
visible from alexandaria. 


5
countries; australia , brazil , new zealand, papua new guinea and samoa
feature the southern cross on their flags.


another
interesting sidelight is that the last time crux was seen in jerusalem
(latitude 31 degrees, 46 minutes, and 45 seconds)  was about the time
jesus  was crucified.







when
you see the southern cross for the first time,
you
understand now why you came this way. 
look
for the sign, the time
the
sign of the southern cross, yeah


  
--southern
cross- crosby, stills and nash
 
-- sign of thesouthern cross - black sabbath


...amazed
to stumble where gods get lost
beneath
the southern cross 
follow,
follow the southern cross...
there
ain't no way to get lost 


   
--beneath the southern cross - patti smith
  
-- southern cross  - ozark mountain daredevils


rocking
through the night
all
is silent... southern cross
woke
up... where all the stars seemed out of reach
and
recognized none but the southern cross

the
view from the caribbean.
what
you see pictured is spectacular. in the southern hemisphere you can view
many magnificent gems of the southern milky way, an amazingly clear view
of the southern cross (crux), as shown, and the false cross,  and
much more. other dazzling southern sky treasures you can see are canopus,
the tarantula nebula, the incredible eta carina nebulaand neighboring star
cluster ngc 3532, the jewel box cluster, the southern pleiades along
with many other spectacular open clusters strewn along the milky way, the
huge globular cluster omega centauri, the giant galaxy centaurus a and
apha and beta centauri.
the
caribbean provides an amazing view of crux (the southern cross), plus one
of the best "star gazes" anywhere on the planet.
