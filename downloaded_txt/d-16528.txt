risks in visiting an active volcano
            safety cannot be guaranteed when visiting an active volcano. eruptions can happen at any time without warning. a decision to climb an erupting volcano should be based on a risk-benefit analysis. to see an eruption is one of the greatest sights in nature, but the challenge must be accepted with common sense and knowledge of the risks.  
volcanoes of the world
            there are more than 1500 active volcanoes in the world. these have
            erupted in the last 10,000 years, and have a reasonable chance of
            erupting in the future.
