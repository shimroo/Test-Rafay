mission statementthe prairie museum of art & history/thomas county historical society serves the community of thomas county and the greater nw kansas area as an educational organization, promoting local history, hosting visitors, groups and organizations, while enhancing the quality of life on the high plains of kansas.a unique destinationthe prairie museum of art & history is a unique institution, serving as both a repository for the thomas county historical society and home to international artifacts of the kuska collection. the historical society connection means that part of our mission is to tell the story of this region of the high plains, from prehistoric times to the present. the kuska collection, an extensive and wide-ranging collection of dolls, glass, ceramics, clothing, paintings, and much more assembled by nellie kuska, allows us to tell the story of collecting generally and of the unique aspects of different items in the collection specifically.in addition, visitors are invited to tour the outdoor campus which is home to the cooper barn, the state’s largest barn and 8th wonder of kansas architecture; a sod house; one-room school house; 1930s homestead and barn; and quaint church used by early settlers of northwest kansas.
