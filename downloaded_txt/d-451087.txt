the 2024 towel day ambassador

the annual towel day ambassador contest has ended. ken kopacki has been democratically elected towel day ambassador for 2024.
one thing that made ken an outstanding candidate are his existing efforts to spread copies of the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy. it's no exaggeration to say that he already was a true ambassador!

his main responsibility will be representing earth on may 25th at the intergalactic pandimensional towel day gala. to support the enormous responsibility for the legacy of douglas adams, regional tda assignments are as follows; dan ekberg - north and south america, rio lacour - europe and asia, carol - australia and antartica, ed hunter - the uk and africa. 
our sincere congratulations to the new ambassasor, and thanks to the contest organisers!
