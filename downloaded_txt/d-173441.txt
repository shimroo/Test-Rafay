antisemitism by consensus at the harvard crimson





why its stance on bds is b.s.talk about a hot mess.the editorial board at the harvard crimson is comprised of 86--count 'em--86 people. that's not an editorial board. it's a greek chorus and one that's woefully off-pitch, given its april 29 editorial endorsing the boycott, divest and sanction movement on campus, whose primary goal is the destruction of the state of israel.you'd think that's a pretty serious move at a pretty serious school, right? after all, this is harvard, the school with a 5% acceptance rate for applicants clamoring to be in cambridge. alas, you'd be wrong.let's first circle back to the 86. on its website, the crimson states:three times per week, the board meets to discuss the biggest campus issues of the moment and vote on a shared stance to be published under “the crimson editorial board” byline. while we strive to find a meaningful consensus — that is inclusive of our varied perspectives and concerns — we often disagree. occasionally, when the board is divided about the opinion expressed in a staff editorial, dissenting board members have the opportunity to write a dissent.all righty, then. however, a dissent has yet to appear at the crimson.com four days after the editorial was published and generated a firestorm on jewish media. does that mean all 86 agree with such bilious statements like: "israel’s current policy pushes palestinians towards indefinite statelessness, combining ethnonationalist legislation and a continued assault on the sovereignty of the west bank through illegal settlements that difficults the prospect of a two-state solution; it merits an assertive and unflinching international response."for that alone, the 86 should be 86ed. and, yes, they said "difficults." no, difficult is not a verb, no matter what the wiktionary says. they apparently were too self-satisfied having used "ethnonationalist" in a sentence to notice.look, these mensa wannabes are actually latecomers to embrace bds. it's supplanted hacky sacks as a campus pastime. but because it's hah-vahd and the crimson has a long roster of luminaries who once toiled there, including fdr and jfk, this editorial has received outsized attention.so, no surprise if a few of them are doing revolutions six feet under because of sentences like this: we unambiguously oppose and condemn antisemitism in every and all forms, including those times when it shows up on the fringes of otherwise worthwhile movements. in case you wondered if students who get in to harvard are truly our best and brightest, that line reveals the answer is an unequivocal no.bds is an unapologetically antisemitic movement. it rejects a two-state solution in the middle east. it only wants one state, and it is not a jewish one. it wants full rights for arab citizens--conveniently omitting that israeli arabs, who make up 20% of the population--already have full rights. that emboldens the bdsers to throw around phrases like "apartheid" and "colonialists," without accounting for the fact that jews have lived in the region for over 2,000 years. so, yes, 86, if you oppose antisemitism, you can't be for bds. how do you know it's antisemitic. take this test (i know, 86, not another test), put forth in the forward by former dissident and israeli minister natan sharansky back in 2005, to determine whether something's antisemitic. it's the three d's--demonization, delegitimization and double standards. on that account, bds passes with flying colors. as one example, sharansky writes:it is antisemitic discrimination, for instance, when israel is singled out for condemnation by the united nations for perceived human rights abuses while proven obliterators of human rights on a massive scale — like china, iran, cuba, saudi arabia, sudan and syria, to name just a few — are not even mentioned. likewise, it is antisemitism when israel’s magen david adom, alone among the world’s ambulance services, is denied admission to the international red cross.so, facts. not fancy. you would have thought at least one out of 86 would have realized that.

remember pearl harbor--dan rather looks back





during my time at cbs news radio, i had the privilege to write commentaries for dan rather for his "dan rather reporting" segment on the network. commentary by anchors and pundits used to be a staple on thousands of radio stations that picked up network feeds. they're all but gone now, a casualty of shifting formats, changing demographics and hyper-partisan politics. below is one i wrote for dan that aired december 7, 2001, when the 9/11 attacks were still fresh. i was proud he chose to use it on such a momentous day, and as proud when it won an award from the writers guild of america. that it's been 20 years is proof that the days go by slowly, but the years go by fast.remember pearl harbor.that was the
battle cry a staggered nation rallied to after experiencing its first day of
infamy 60 years ago.images of the
uss arizona collapsing into the water as it was consumed by a torrent of fire
were as prevalent then as photos of the mangled wreckage as the world trade
center are today. it was our original ground zero.remember pearl harborit's left to
the dwindling ranks whose lives were forever altered that sunday to recount and
reinforce the horror of that moment. the notion of the u.s. under attack was in
danger of becoming an historical curiosity in this new millennium. september
11th changed that, of course. but it took such a tragedy to fully allow younger
generations to understand and appreciate such a moment.remember pearl harbor.the japanese
do. tens of thousands visit there every year. what a difference 60 years makes.
they are told how a wave of their country's planes pierced the early-morning
sky over oahu. one of them dropped from on high a 1,760-pound bomb on the arizona.one sailor
recalled the battleship literally jumped out of the water, with its millions of
pounds of gunpowder exploding soon after. it took just nine minutes for its
shattered hulk to succumb to the deep. more than 1,100 crewmen died. some 900 are
entombed in the harbor now and
forever.it is said
that bubbles from the oil that leaks from the arizona to this day are the tears
of dead sailors. many of us who lived through that day will undoubtedly shed a
few of our own.remember pearl harbor.dan rather reporting, cbs news.

ny times takes a long and winding road to set the record straight





 no joke: jackie mason gets an error-filled farewellperusing the new york times print edition this morning (yes, it's still a thing) and was startled to find a sizable chunk of page a-16 was devoted to corrections of stories that appeared in recent days.that's hardly notable, in and of itself. the times routinely owns up to errors, unlike many other papers. but what was striking was how many of them were in this roundup.some are copy editing hiccups--filed under the category of stuff happens, like being off a year on someone's age or a careless misspelling. but several came from one article--the obit of comedian jackie mason, which had some eagle-eyed readers kvetching.an obituary on sunday and in some copies on monday about the comedian jackie mason contained a number of errors. it referred incorrectly to the circumstances in which he was reported to have used a yiddish word, considered to be a racial slur, in talking about david n. dinkins, at the time a black candidate for mayor of new york city. the comment came in 1989 during a luncheon with newsweek reporters, not during a banquet at the plaza hotel in manhattan. the obituary misstated where mr. mason pursued rabbinical studies; he did so at mesivtha tifereth jerusalem of america, a yeshiva in manhattan, not yeshiva university, also in manhattan. it overstated the number of times that mr. mason had appeared on the “the ed sullivan show” before his contract with it was canceled after mr. mason made what mr. sullivan regarded as an obscene gesture onstage; he had appeared on the show about 20 times before then, not “dozens of times.” the obituary omitted two of mr. mason’s survivors: a sister, gail schulman, and a brother, rabbi gabriel maza. and it was not the case that mr. mason’s two younger sisters had married rabbis.oy vez is mir. that's a lot to get wrong. and it's especially surprising, given the heft of the times obit desk and its ample resources to fact check. given the putative author, william grimes, has long been gone from the paper, it's likely this one has been gathering digital moss for a while and the haste to crank it out allowed for these oopsies.at least the times set the record straight, given that mr. mason was unable to do so.

brian schatz's office can't even be bothered to send a real form letter





 the things you find when you clean out your gmail promotions folderpoking around in the recesses of my gmail promotions folder--where would-be spam and solicitations forever rest in digital purgatory--i came across a shortie from the office of sen. brian schatz, d-hawaii. this was no mere happenstance. back in march, i happened to email him (or the intern who monitors the inbox) at the end of march for the start of passover (like me, schatz is an m.o.t.).i didn't pick schatz randomly to make this request. having made numerous visits to the aloha state, i have a strong affinity for the islands and their people. i know that making a go of it is tough when you live there. almost everything's expensive and wages often don't match up. and an article in the star-advertiser brought that home on march 26, reporting that nearly half of all kids in the state are food insecure and that 15 percent simply don't have enough to eat. half!given that one of the traditions of passover is inviting strangers to join in the seder--the holiday meal-i gently suggested to team schatz that, in the spirit of passover, he perhaps could wield the visibility of his formidable social media platforms to highlight the problem of food insecurity and how people could come to the aid of his fellow hawaiians.or not. despite emailing him about a problem specific to his state and wishing him a chag pesach (happy passover), this is all i got back.thank you for contacting me. for more information regarding communicating with a u.s. senator from your state, please visit: http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm.sincerely,brian schatzu.s. senatorhuh? i know how to send emails to chuck schumer and kirsten gillibrand, thank you very much. so, living nearly 5,000 miles from hawaii apparently deems me incapable of making observations about a dire problem in the state or caring about the people schatz represents?look, i get it. senators get jillions of emails, letters and other brickbats thrown at them every day. was i expecting schatz to get anywhere near my email? no, brah. would i have expected someone to have the foresight to forward this to his social media guru. yeah. maybe. would it have been too much to ask for someone to have actually read what i sent? definitely not.and if you agree that hunger in hawaii is a problem that needs to be dealt with--by schatz or anyone--do what i do and give to organizations helping, like the maui food bank and the maui farm. and i'm sure they'd be happy to hear from brian schatz too.

n.y, post reporter falls on her sword; many not impressed





laura italiano wrote fabricated kamala book tale; trolls are out in full force. but are they wrong?here's a story you won't read in the new york post, about how veteran scribe laura italiano was "ordered" to write a whopper of a tall tale about how taxpayers funded gave undocumented children copies of kamala harris's book and that italiano resigned in protest after the fact.the kamala harris story -- an incorrect story i was ordered to write and which i failed to push back hard enough against -- was my breaking point.— laura italiano (@italiano_laura) april 27, 2021actually, you can read about it in the post, though the washington post, where the story by paul farhi was at the top of the charts this morning. unsurprisingly, the twitter trolls had little sympathy for italiano. the few "thank you for your integrity tweets were outflanked by missives like this:you wrote the incorrect story, and then resigned??? that says a lot about your moral character.... or lack there of.— kennygallegos (@slvnative) april 28, 2021 if the story was incorrect and you knowingly went ahead helping create it - and took a paycheck for doing so - the word you’re looking for is “complicit”.— safe spaces | commentary+ (@real_safespaces) april 28, 2021italiano is no journalistic fawn who got caught in a no-win situation. she's been at the post since the 1990s, knew who she was looking for and how it operates. inevitably, no matter how dedicated or skilled a journalist, she knows that the hard-right agenda fomented by rupert and lachlan murdoch inevitably colors the news report a dark red.given that, if quitting was in italiano's mind, the end result, wouldn't it have been better to outright refuse to write the story, take her chances with disciplinary proceedings and possibly benefit from all the publicity? as she tweeted, she failed to "push back hard enough." meaning, if you take that to its literal conclusion, she knew the story she was writing was verifiably false. yet, she wrote it anyway, even though the debunkers came at it fast and furious.the n.y. post belatedly took down the story after sheepishly admitting in an editor's note at the bottom of a story that its report that thousands of kids had been given harris's book was wrong.the original version of this article said migrant kids were getting harris’ book in a welcome kit, but has been updated to note that only one known copy of the book was given to a child.but that mea culpa is at the very bottom of a rewrite of  an april 23 italiano story now re-headlined: kamal isn't at the southern border -- but at least one migrant kid got veep's bookso, sorry, not sorry.and, as farhi points out, it's not even clear any child actually got that copy. it was contained in a toy and clothing drive sponsored by the city of long beach, calif. in the end, i'm sorry italiano was put in this position. but she's had a birds-eye view of the underbelly of new york city politics, courts and cop shops long enough to know when a story stinks to high heaven. she spent her professional life writing nonfiction. that she chose otherwise with the harris book nothingburger and quit in disgust after she had reached a "breaking point," then good for her. but it's not really good enough.meanwhile, the kamala beat marches on at the post. the vice president has been mentioned prominently in articles on nypost.com no less than seven times in the last three days alone. doubtful mike pence ever got that much attention. but when his boss gleefully sucked up all the right-wing media oxygen, it's easy to understand why. and no newspaper made more sure of that than the new york post.

standards and practices at nbc needs some practice





 there goes the myth about all the jewish writersso, michael che is taking his time apologizing--assuming he ever does--for his anti-semitic trope on weekend update on last week's saturday night live. it went something like this:"israel is reporting that they vaccinated half of their population, and i'm going to guess it's the jewish half."now, i don't know if che wrote the joke, although he's one of four putative head writers on the show. weekend update itself actually has a staff of five writers, though it's safe to guess if che didn't like the joke he wouldn't read it. he apparently liked the joke.what's baffling--beyond why he'd find it funny (spoiler alert: it wasn't) --is that scripts are ostensibly still vetted by standards and practices before they hit the air. and they'd have not one, but two opportunities to knock it off, in dress rehearsal and before the live show. but it appears nobody got their girdles in a knot over this crack.which then begs the question of "why not?" and why has nbc and snl gone quiet about this for four days, despite wide condemnation. even the adl hasn't been able to get a response out of lorne michaels. one more time: why not?in other nbc anti-semitic news, the network today did pull the finale from its streaming platforms of "nurses," a series it imported from canada, which stereotyped its way into ignominy. in it, a hasidic man refuses a bone graft because it would come from a "goyim leg."oy vey iz mir.among those who went on the attack was the simon wiesenthal center, which knows a thing or two about anti-semitism. "overreaction? orthodox jews are targeted for violent hate crimes -- in the city of new york, jews are [the] number one target of hate crimes ... this is no slip of the tongue. it was a vile, cheap attack masquerading as tv drama."as deadline reported, an nbc source said the network was contacted by several jewish groups about "nurses" and was "keen to have conversations with them about the topic."that's all well and good, but also disingenuous. nbc doesn't own "nurses." it's a canadian import that was used to plug a hole in its schedule caused by covid. there are no plans to repeat the episode or bring "nurses" back for another season. on the other hand, "snl" is an nbc property. and on che they remain silent.they should know better. in broadcasting, nobody likes dead air.

maria bartiromo debasement roundup





 one-time "money honey" trades credibility for trump fealty; what happens after january 20?it's really sad to see how far maria bartiromo has fallen, at least as a journalist. those, like me, who remember her best as the go-to reporter during the glory days of cnbc in the late 90s and 2000s, when the markets were on a roller coaster.since 2013, she has been on fox business network and sundays on fox news channel for "sunday morning futures." fbn, like its sibling, has been a predictably friendly forum for donald trump. anchors like stuart varney and lou dobbs--like bartiromo, cnn alumni--foment and generally foam at the mouth over anything 45-related. bartiromo may be less venal, but she is something worse--an enabler for trump in exchange for access.that was on exhibit today, when she was on the receiving end of trump's first interview since election day. it's not the first time she's gone one-on-one with trump. and one reason for that is she throws softballs big orange is only too willing to hit out of the park. even worse, she is all too willing to buy into the whack-a-doodle conspiracy theories trump and his diminishing minion of minions are trying to palm off. lies piled on lies, but bartiromo either stayed silent or leveled broadsides like these.“elections are the reason that our young men and women go on battlefields across the world and in some cases lose their lives. because they believe that their vote, my vote, matters just as much as your vote. and if that is not true, this is a very serious turning point for america. so, this is no longer about you, president trump. this is about america.”eeew. really does make your stomach churn. but it might be what she needs to do in order to get fox back in the good graces of trump, who's been excoriating the network for taking a break from butt-kissing and urging far-righties to abandon murdoch world for newsmax and oann.and it may have done the trick. as the washington post reported, trump tweeted four clips today. more critical coverage of bartiromo's "interview" can be found at usa today and cnn ("it was filled with lies"), bartiromo may no longer be the "money honey" (a term she reportedly trademarked), but she's mindful of her own bottom line and where she works. we'll see how much her stock falls once her biggest fan decamps for mar-a-lago on jan. 20.

outrage with your coffee: npr story on filipino "comfort women" during wwii a must-listen





 report by julie mccarthy brings home vitality of npr despite network's pandemic challengesdespite the fact that most of us who listen to "weekend edition" on npr don't need more than the jolt coming from the caffeine in our mug of medium roast, the program doesn't shy away from taking on tough topics. that was in evidence today in a dispatch from manila bureau chief julie mccarthy, left, about the continued fight for justice by filipino women who were sexual slaves to japanese soldiers during world war ii.the report demands your attention, as it weaves a harrowing tale of one woman and how she and her family were terrorized in 1943 by japanese soldiers who stormed their village looking for filipino guerrillas. they lashed her father--the village leader--to a tree and started skinning him alive. two of her siblings who tried to stop the soldiers were bayoneted, while her mother was sexually assaulted and later died. the woman told mccarthy she was removed to a garrison where two of her sisters were also taken, and  repeatedly raped by soldier after soldier. she was 12.there's much more to this gripping story and it's one you should catch up to. it's also remarkable in that it runs for more than 13 minutes, which the weekend format allows for more so than npr's signature weekday news programs, "all things considered" and "morning edition." still, 13 minutes is a relative eternity, even on npr. but mccarthy offers no padding, no unnecessary flourishes. just damn good storytelling.reports like these highlight why npr remains essential, as it has the forum to tell stories like these without fear or favor. that's not to say it's easy to pull off. npr has been clobbered by a drop-off in underwriting revenue and donations because of the pandemic. npr staffers avoided layoffs by agreeing to unpaid furloughs, which are still ongoing this year. cutting overseas bureaus would be an easy way to cut costs, but npr has not succumbed to the beancounters, and has held the line in places like manila. that means we get to hear from award-winning correspondents like mccarthy, who has criss-crossed the globe in service to npr. we are better for it, as this story affirms.p.s. after i tweeted about the story, mccarthy wrote back that more would be posted on the npr goats and soda blog, devoted to global health and development news. the blog is new to me, but with stories like these i'll be happy to get acquainted.

anchorage hath no fury like a news anchor scorned





 mayor resigns after sexting scandal surfaces. his digital paramour has not.so, the fact that anchorage mayor ethan berkowitz resigned yesterday, after admitting to an "inappropriate, consensual messaging relationship" with a local tv anchor is salacious enough and worthy of national attention, including the new york times. but there's a lot more to unpack here, and much of it comes from baggage belonging to the anchor, maria athens (left), who's seen nightly on the abc and fox alaska affiliates, known as your alaska link.here are a few, for lack of a better term,  highlights:--athens told the anchorage daily news the texting from berkowitz, a married father of two, began in 2016. "when he slided into my texts, with his little witty slogans and pictures," she said. --their relationship badly went off the rails. why isn't clear. but athens clearly had a few bones to pick, which she left in a venemous voice mail first obtained by the alaska landmine website and later released by the mayor's office, in which she threatened to kill him and his wife, called him a "jewish piece of living fucking shit" and made unsubstantiated claims he had sent nude photos to an underaged girl's website. that's something the purportedly not-underage girl denied to the anchorage press, by the way.--for extra emphasis, athens added in the voice mail, "i can believe i'm such a fucking good person who thought i loved you." yeah, about that...--athens also went wild on social media, posting nude photos she said were of berkowitz and filming a video inside her tv station, which she posted on her facebook page claiming she'd have a story that would essentially accuse berkowitz of being a pedophile. station management demanded she remove "any mention or affiliation with our stations." but that's as far as they went, incredibly enough and then....--athens was arrested last friday for getting into a fight with station general manager scott centers, who also doubled as a boyfriend, or, as athens claimed in court, her fiance. as the anchorage daily news reported:a charging document in the case says athens and ... centers fought in the car "about work," with athens punching centers and hitting him with her cell phone. athens said she grabbed centers' arm because he was driving erratically during the argument but denies attacking centers.later, athens allegedly hit centers again inside the tv station. when police ... arrested her, she hit a cop on his vest and tried to kick the doors of the police cruiser, causing police to put her in full restraints, the charging document said.athens denied hitting the officer or being in full restraints. because that would change the whole narrative, right?a reasonable assumption would be that athens would have been canned from the station faster than a kodiak bear would have swallowed a salmon for lunch. but the adn reports her status isn't clear and nobody at the station is talking. which is something that is very welcome right about now.

when newspapers read like novellas





 fun with purple prose or how not to catch a traincaught this masterful missive on one of my local facebook groups. it's a 90-year-old dispatch from the mount pleasant courier, a now-defunct title for a northern new york city suburb. the dispatch, about a car that made a wrong turn onto railroad tracks, is a compelling yarn by itself. but what makes it fun is how it's written--breathless, totally unironic but likely in keeping with the norms of small-town newspapering in the 1930s.to wit:"he had proceeded about an eighth of a mile when the dawn came up like thunder behind him and he sailed out of his car and spun like a maple leaf into the bushes many yards away, shocked but otherwise unhurt. as men in railroad overalls gathered about the bushes to determine if he were killed, it dawned on young mr. koerner that had been driving down the right-of-way of the new york central and had been rammed by the morning's first passenger train on the putnam division, bound for new york."love it! of course, try writing like that today and your editor will let out a hearty laugh while ensuring the door hit you on the way out. but different times. and, fortunately, you can't get into the same mess as young mr. koerner anymore. the putnam division went kaput in 1958, and the right-of-way (you can still spot a few remnants of tracks) is now a popular bike trail in westchester county.

when a one-person newsroom goes down to zero





 lee newspapers fires editor for stating the obviouswhen even warren buffett doesn't have the patience to see whether an investment will pan out, you know there's trouble. and trouble is what has predictably emerged since buffett sold his newspaper holdings to lee enterprises in march for $140 million. like every newspaper chain, lee has engaged in an unhealthy amount of layoffs, furloughs and other rapacious cost-cutting. some of that can be attributed to the pandemic, but mostly to blame is the slide in circulation and advertising due to reader attrition, advertisers drifting online and not investing in a digital product worth paying for.this crisis was ably encapsulated by ashley spinks (photo from wtvf), the managing editor of the weekly floyd press in virginia, in an excellent piece from mallory noe-payne at npr affiliate wvtf. the title of managing editor is misleading, given that spinks was the sole editorial employee at the paper. "you don't always have the capacity to do follow-up interviews, to add context and color to stories," spinks told the station. "but even more important than that, what are you not reporting on?"a good question, and one spinks will not have an opportunity to answer, at least as managing editor of the floyd press. after this story aired, she was fired by lee for doing the interview. an update: i got fired today for doing this interview. less than 24 hours before the press goes to print. the paper is not finished, don’t know how it will be. on a personal level: it’s 3 days before my wedding, which my superiors knew. they couldn’t even wait for next week. 1/x https://t.co/cdpedfbkpn— ashley spinks (@ashleyinfloyd) october 13, 2020of course, the thin-skinned suits at lee are cretins for doing this. but the fact that newsrooms have been reduced to almost nothing is, sadly, not news. check out this dispatch from mountain home magazine about jeff murray, the last man sitting in the elmira star-gazette newsroom, and a wondrous story in the new york times about evan brandt, the only reporter covering pottstown, pa, for the once-mighty pottstown mercury.ashley spinks's next chapter is still evolving. but it's already a little greener.hello, everyone! probably my last update for the night. i’m floored and humbled by all the support—for me, but also, i know, for the venture of small town journalism in general. i’ve gained 900 followers and now have more in my venmo than i make in *three months* from lee. 1/x— ashley spinks (@ashleyinfloyd) october 14, 2020you would hope another newspaper in virginia would admire the spunk and tenacity of a journalist like spinks and try to grab her. sadly, though, most other newspapers in the commonwealth are also trying to stay one step ahead of oblivion. it also doesn't help that the largest papers in virginia also happen to be owned by lee enterprises.

 more than a hiatusgot a little behind in putting together the recycling pile, so i've been staring for a while at the last print issue of the jewish week, dated july 31. not the latest. the last.the jewish week had been rattling the tin cup for a while. it's published by a non-profit, which had already solicited contributions from readers, and when the pandemic hit, like all over print media, it was starved for advertising. that's especially troubling when circulation is already down to around 40,000 from 65,000 at its peak, and a lot of  readers got it free with contributions to uja-fed. still, it was the largest jewish newspaper in the u.s. and often punched above its weight with investigative reports on sexual abuse by hasidic rabbis and serial sexual harassment by one of the jewish world's most prominent philanthropists. commentary was often provocative and it provided reliable coverage of israel, especially its sometimes-fraught relationship with the american jewish community.but that wasn't enough to save the print edition. many daily newspapers have cut back on their print frequency because of declining readership and ads. many others--especially weeklies--suspended print editions when covid-19 didn't disappear like a miracle.however, no one should expect to have the jewish week ever show up in their mailbox again. various articles in the last print edition used iterations of "hiatus" or "suspend" to describe what was happening. but it's suspended just like presidential candidates suspend a campaign. it's over, even if the new york times said the jewish week was "pausing." the best evidence of that comes from the paper's own editor-in-chief andrew silow-carroll (who i knew when he was editor of the albany student press and i was a reporter and editor there, and he was just andy carroll). he told the times: “the print model has been broken for a number of years now, compounded, quite honestly, by a lack of jewish engagement. maybe that’s an easy way of saying we have an older readership that isn’t being replaced. and the way to find those readers, i think, is online, which is a reason i thought a move like this was inevitable.”he's right about the broken print model. ditto for the jewish engagement part. and, yes, it's true those still reading print are older (guilty as charged). but to simply assume those under 60 are lying in wait for a digital version to consume simply isn't so, especially when it's a much diminished version of the print offering. about half of an already-slender staff--some of whom had been there for parts of five decades--are gone. and it shows, given the current version of the website, which like other jewish papers, sits on a platform run by times of israel.some more observant--as in religiously observant--readers, said they read the jewish week during the sabbath, when they are forbidden to use electronic media. now, it's out of sight, out of mind. that's a shame. because the jewish community needs more information. more transparency. more accountability. the jewish week provided that for 45 years. how much longer is an open question that may not have a really good answer.

s.v. date, media rock star





 now, even trump knows who he isfor some reason, donald trump keeps coming into the white house press room to do briefings. you could ask "when will he ever learn," but you know the answer to that.still, he must have been having fever dreams about wanting to be turkish strongman recep erdogan or belarus despot alexander lukashenko after huff post white house correspondent s.v. date asked a question many wished they had the cojones to ask and which the twittersphere rightly wondered why it had not been asked sooner. "mr. president, after three-and-a-half years, do you regret at all, all the lying you have done to the american people?" trump pretended to have a hearing problem. "that who has done?" to which date replied, "that you have done."trump apparently heard that and moved on to another questioner. no other reporters decided to follow along date's line of questioning.still, pretty cool, right?heavy.com immediately disgorged five fast facts about the indian-born date, including that the guy is quite the sailor. thinking right about now, trump would like to send date on a one-way trip home, and we don't mean washington.

not cottoning to tom cotton





times staffers in a lather over fascist op-edthe outrage was fast and furious to the new york times  running an op-ed from reliably vile sen. tom cotton of arkansas calling on president trump to invoke the insurrection act and crack down on protesters. this is among the least incendiary passages:"in normal times, local
law enforcement can uphold public order. but in rare moments, like ours today,
more is needed, even if many politicians prefer to wring their hands while the
country burns."
  reaction to the times even considering the op-ed for publication, let alone running it, poured out from all corners of the twittersphere, including black staffers at the times. the language, like in this tweet from editorial board member mara gay, was similar:
running this puts black people in danger. and other americans standing up for our humanity and democracy, too. @nytimes pic.twitter.com/mqaa2wj6yg— mara gay (@maragay) june 4, 2020 
 
  also weighing in was sewell chan, the editorial page editor of the los angeles times and former boy wonder at the nyt, who finished out there as, wait for it, op-ed editor. he wasn't happy with cotton mussing up his once-beloved page.
thread: as a former @nytimes op-ed editor i am reluctant to weigh in on my alma mater. but the decision to publish @sentomcotton calling for troop deployments to quell unrest falls short of sound journalistic practice. pic.twitter.com/sgxsndkq8l— sewell chan (@sewellchan) june 3, 2020no doubt, the pain from george floyd's murder 10 days on has yet to subside. that's both understandable and expected. however, the brouhaha over the op-ed has many shades of the cancel culture that has stained many a college campus--some variation of "not only do i not like what you say or think, i'm not going to let you say it here under any circumstances." that colleges have too often kowtowed to this sickening groupthink has sent higher education to a new low.as marc tracy's article in today's times about the controversy dutifully reminds us, it is
not unusual for right-leaning opinion articles in the times to attract
criticism. this time, the outcry from readers, times staff members and alumni
of the paper was strong enough to draw an online defense of the essay’s
publication from james bennet, the editorial page editor.
“times opinion owes it to
our readers to show them counter-arguments, particularly those made by people
in a position to set policy,” mr. bennet wrote in a thread on twitter. “we
understand that many readers find senator cotton’s argument painful, even
dangerous. we believe that is one reason it requires public scrutiny and
debate.”exactly. while one could reasonably argue that some things are better left unsaid, or unpublished, i would counter that the op-ed is an excellent forum to not only showcase the extremism of cotton and his fellow miscreants, but to also serve as a call to action. in other words, if you didn't think now was a good time to donate to the democratic senatorial campaign committee (cotton is up for reelection, though he probably doesn't have much to worry about), check the calendar. and reread cotton's op-ed.on a side note, this paragraph from tracy's article was both curious and troubling:the opinion section is run separately from the news side. mr.
bennet reports to the publisher, a.g. sulzberger, as does the paper’s executive
editor, dean baquet, who is in charge of news coverage. the distinction between
opinion pieces and news articles is sometimes lost on readers, who may see an
op-ed — promoted on the same home page — as just another times article.that can only happen if you read the times online, as most do. it's easy enough to make the distinction in print, of course. and while i won't proselytize yet again for why you should be holding the physical times in your hand, this should nonetheless highlight the need for the times digital staff to more explicitly distinguish between news and opinion, if this is indeed an issue. if that distinction is lost on readers, it needs to be found pronto.

here's one media layoff story you won't read in the new york post






keith kelly will have to go silent, assuming he still has a job





the daily beast has word of corona virus-related layoffs at the new york post. finally.



finally, in that the murdochs have let the post bleed rivers of red ink for decades, partially because they can and mostly so they can piss off andrew cuomo and bill de blasio.



the newsroom has usually run thin, but the sports section is still laden with top-shelf columnists and beat writers. there's also solid coverage of the media industry, real estate and entertainment. and, of course, page six is well, page six. estimates have put the post's annual losses at as far north of $100 million a year. old man murdoch may have viewed that as a rounding error as the price for influence. but that was apparently then.



covid-19 has laid waste to ad budgets. newspapers here, there and everywhere have gone on a furlough and layoff frenzy. others stopped printing and went online. some have pulled up stakes for good. the post, mostly under the auspices of media columnist/uber maven keith kelly, has been dutifully reporting on the misfortunes of other companies, like gannett and mcclatchy.



and now this. at least a dozen staffers got the axe, while some part-timers are now on a long-time furlough, according to the daily beast. so far, only one reporter has revealed his fate, 16-year veteran rich calder.






i was laid off from @nypost yesterday due to the economic crisis. it was a wild 16-year ride, including the last 5 covering city hall, that i'm glad i took! and i am humbled by the outpouring of support i’ve since received from the room 9 crew, ex-colleagues & so many others! 1/2
— rich calder (@rich_calder) april 30, 2020
 but he has company. and they have names besides misery.

update: 5/1/20 at 11:20 a.m.

longtime sports writer of distinction kevin kernan gave his -30- on twitter.





after 23 years the parting glass was raised to me at nypost. blessed run, 44 years total. from thurman, goose, reggie, lt, bernard, bird, magic, michael, patrick, doc, gwynn, seau, eli, derek, a-rod, piazza, wright, degrom, judge, alonso, ambs delivered. thanks for being there.

articles without the c-word





if you look hard enough, reporters occasionally write about something else



want to read about something else? thought so. here are a few
items worth catching up to.



los
angeles times—let my people go—to the movies. to get you into the proper frame
of mind for passover and easter, a dozen flicks with a connection however
tenuous. can you really watch uncut gems a second time without reaching for
the xanax?



washington
post—tzi ma is changing what it means to be hollywood’s go-to asian dad. you
know the face. now remember the name.



chicago
tribune—how you can be rescued from the parental hell of trying to placate
picky eaters.



philadelphia
inquirer—the city of brotherly love is a union town, even on tinder.



pitchfork—watch
these nature webcams while you listen to this music---when your pot dispensary
won’t deliver.



star-tribune—wcco
film critic dishes on his “modern family” cameo. or what happens when 

you’re
a frat buddy with the executive producer.



san
francisco chronicle—tomorrow’s snl could be best or worst episode ever---not
live from new york, it’s…



atlanta
journal-constitution—iconic apollo 13 ‘successful failure’ marks 50th
anniversary---guess it’s kind of worthy of celebration. beats the alternative.

the new york times doesn't shrink from adversity





despite few ads, today's print edition still pretty hefty



those of us who still crave the print edition of the new york times pay a premium for what is now a privilege. home delivery clocks in for the metropolitan area at a turn-and-cough $72 a month (though, you can get it down if you call customer service and see if they have any specials, as i do periodically).

dean baquet and co. have not let us down. it would be tempting, as many media outlets have, to scale down the news hole as advertisers have fled. but this is the times. and in times like these, we need the times more than ever.

today's 52-page edition has two full-page ads on the backs of sections, a couple of jewelry ads on a3, a half-page real estate ad on a5 from a broker anxious to offload a couple of estates in new jersey, a small movie ad, a few classifieds and that's it. there are a few house ads, as there always are, but otherwise it's all the news that's fit to print and then some.

true, the times has made a few coronavirus concessions. the two weekend arts sections have been consolidated into one for the last month. no loss if there's nothing new opening. and the sports section is now down to a couple of pages. but you'd have expected that. instead, there's more room for obits, covid-19 related or otherwise. unfortunately, there's been quite the parade of farewells, including today mort drucker, the great mad magazine artist and arts patron anne bass, who gets a delightfully detailed writeup by deborah solomon.

granted, it won't take you as long to read the sunday times as it normally would. the travel section is content challenged, as is real estate and arts & leisure. but there's still enough to justify unfurling from your fetal position to read as you take comfort from knowing covid-19 won't endure, but the times will.

we interrupt the coronavirus crisis for this musical interlude





music stars come to us because we can't come to them



i dialed up one of my favorite stations, kexp-fm, out of seattle, to keep me company while cleaning up st. patrick's day dinner yesterday. instead of the usual eclectic fare that makes the station one of our greatest was an extremely stripped-down version of "crooked teeth" by death cab for cutie. turns out, it was the group's lead singer, ben gibbard, singing his forlorn heart out. and he wasn't alone.
turns out gibbard will be doing this every day, at least for the next two weeks, at 4 p.m. pdt. not sure if kexp is committed to that, notwithstanding gibbard is a seattle-area native. fear not, the stream, where he takes requests, is also on youtube and facebook.
gibbard isn't alone in bringing the music home. npr is keeping a running list, which includes everything from rhett miller to the vienna state opera.
other artists, like chris martin, john legend and keith urban, have already popped up on instagram live and other virtual venues to help us and them pass the time.

voting no on peter baker's no-voting stance





being sanctimonious not a job requirement to be white house bureau chief



new york times white house bureau chief peter baker raised his share of hackles recently with his holier-than-thou pronouncement that he can only stay pure to his mission by not voting.


as reporters, our job is to observe, not participate, and so to that end, i don’t belong to any political party, i don’t belong to any non-journalism organization, i don’t support any candidate, i don’t give money to interest groups and i don’t vote.

oy. and, in a lesser-reported passage, baker related how his righteousness tends to suck the life out of a room.

i try hard not to take strong positions on public issues even in private, much to the frustration of friends and family. for me, it’s easier to stay out of the fray if i never make up my mind, even in the privacy of the kitchen or the voting booth, that one candidate is better than another, that one side is right and the other wrong.

in other words, baker is unlike us mere mortals. bully for him? nah. it's just plain bull.
i once toiled for the aclu in its media relations shop. it was there i was constantly reminded how voting is our most fundamental right, the one mentioned most often in the constitution. how baker believes reporters should forfeit that right for the sake of their job strains credulity. given his pedigree, he should know better.

reporters have to put up with a lot nowadays. the money's rarely great--though the bank the peripatetic baker makes at the times and contributing at all hours to msnbc is far from chump change. for most journalists, job security is next to nil. and you have a president who apparently has little else to do than foment hatred for the first amendment. 

at the very least, reporters should be allowed to be human and take ownership of a point of view. however, that's different from expressing that point of view in their work. that's a no-no covered in journalism 101. it's what you signed up for. but that doesn't preclude casting a ballot and risking a tsk-tsk from baker.

baker has been appropriately flayed in some circles for his position, including washington post media scold erik wemple, who noted one drawback is that "non-voting journalists lend credence to the idea ... that merely having political viewpoints is, at some level, a disqualifying or problematic thing. it isn't. what matters is what's in the article (or the segment, or the video, or the podcast)."

after i wrote the above lede, i looked up the definition of hackles to make sure i was on the right track. the first one that came up was "erectile hairs along the back of a dog or other animal that rise when it's angry."

alas, i don't have too much hair left to make erect. but after reading what baker said, i know how the dog feels.

new york times gets cozy with maria sharapova





what happens when ads get too close for comfort

dominating the five-ish pages the new york  times devoted to sports today (notice i didn't say sports section), the first page is dominated by news of maria sharapova calling it quits from tennis at the not-so-ripe age of 32 because injuries and constant pain did her in.

most of the page, as the times is prone to do nowadays to cover up its paucity of sports copy, is a striking photo of sharapova, at once frustrated and content. the next page jumps to a chronology of her remarkable career and the rest of the article by christopher clarey. all well and good.

however, immediately adjacent to the jump page is a nike ad, which, even if you have only a passing knowledge of sharapova, or just read the preceding spread, you know it's her.

the clarey article has an interview with sharapova and the photo was taken by a times freelancer. but the ad right next to the article? while it may not have been the intent, the end result looks like an advertorial for sharapova's swan song, in effect paid for by a five-figure nike ad buy. it would have been much more appropriate--and effective--for the ad to go on the back page of the section, which is mostly taken up by sports news.

the news and business sides of the paper aren't supposed to get involved with each other. but when their worlds collide, somebody has to step in and referee, lest there appears to be some collusion between editorial and advertising.






more curious is that the times ad is markedly different than another version circulating on the web:





certainly looks more deliberate than a printing oopsie. this one was just for the gray lady--very gray, given the resolution.

it should be noted that the times didn't have the exclusive on sharapova. that went to vanity fair and vogue, which had a first-person account from the five-time grand slam winner about why she was hanging it up. still, it doesn't appear she gave an interview to anyone else except the times, which makes no mention of the magazine missive. that's no knock on clarey, who has done a more-than-workmanlike job covering tennis and other sports for the times for decades. it's just a shame that his exclusive is sullied by the impression that nike and the times ad reps got a little too cozy.

and because you don't want to zoom in, here's the ad copy.

they wanted you to smile more.
they wanted you to be more polite.
they wanted you to scream a little softer.
they wanted you to be less aggressive when you won.
they wanted you to walk away when you made mistakes.
but instead of just becoming the player the game wanted?
you became the player it needed.

vintage nike. a good ad, just one that was not in a good place.

the death star of newspapers not so deadly?





alden may finally be realizing when enough is enough
an interesting take by rick edmonds of poynter on how alden global capital, the rapacious venture capitalists who gobble up newspaper assets whole and then spit out their desiccated remains, has essentially hit a pause button on its plundering. at least for now.



the thinking, according to edmonds, is that alden has stripped away the muscle from its properties and is momentarily content to look at the bones.

since the company does not entertain questions, it’s a guess why. more reductions could be on the way later this year. or alden may have calculated that it has reached the minimum number of staffers necessary to put out a news report people will pay for, now that it is revving up a drive for paid digital subscriptions.


if so, there's a dangerous flaw in that model, one others like gannett haven't realized or didn't care too much to rectify. namely, it's hard to convince people to pony up for digital subs when there's nothing worth paying for. if all a paper does is re-purpose what little print content it has for the web without any value add, the ennui readers will have for the print version will infect the digital edition.most papers out of the times-post-journal orbit still pay too little attention to the web product to make it worth paying for, certainly not to the point where it can convince people to shed the more-expensive-to-produced-and-distribute print version. 

there's a reason why print circulation has cratered. there's a reason there hasn't been a corresponding digital migration.so, instead you have a company like gannett slapping a $2.50 price tag on a 16-page edition of the journal news and wondering why its daily circulation is down to 24,000, when it was 160,000 back when i was a reporter there in the late eighties.the end of print, or at least curtailing the number of print days at most publishers, seems a foregone conclusion at this point. it's already happened in pittsburgh, at many advance media titles, like the post-standard in syracuse and soon the saturday editions at mcclatchy titles. monday papers would likely be next to go.

which brings us back to alden. what reason is there to expect it's capable of investing in digital if it can shake the print habit? i don't think the remaining reporters in places like denver, san jose or st. paul have any expectations of that happening. then again....alden is all about extracting value. maybe the best way for that to happen is by actually injecting some cash into their digital side, so the papers become more profitable and, more importantly, valuable. that's valuable, as in attracting a buyer.

could los angeles times owner patrick soon shiong, e.g., find a reinvigorated san jose mercury-news and its beleaguered sister papers in the bay area irresistible? yes, alden appears to bask in its reputation of predatory buyer. but making money is often more about knowing when to get out rather than staying in. you just need to have something worth selling first.

"the affair" cheats on the lirr





don't mess with the train nerds





on last night's episode of "the affair," we see alison (ruth wilson) making her season 3 debut sitting on a train. given that many of her story arcs take place out in montauk, it's easy to assume she's heading there.



but then the episode cuts to a shot of an amtrak train heading through verdant farmland. so, she's headed somewhere up the hudson valley. intriguing. until...you notice the train interior and it's not that of an amtrak train. then you see her getting off. lo and behold, the train not only belongs to the long island railroad, alison is getting off in montauk after all.



yeah, yeah, get a life, train nerd. i hear you. but how hard could it have been to get a shot of an lirr train. maybe it was cheaper to use stock footage of an amtrak consist, but for a show that tries hard at being authentic in both its settings and emotions, it does stand out.



it's like when "law and order" detectives were routinely visiting manhattan apartments that, in the actual street grid, would have been located somewhere in the middle of the hudson river. it wouldn't have been that hard to come up with a fake address that sounded real. "law and order" could have been mildly forgiven that its writer's room was in l.a.



for "the affair," however, what happens is very much about where it's located. and you wouldn't want alison getting off at the wrong stop. she's messed up enough as it is.
