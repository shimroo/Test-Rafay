the goats of terra linda

posted on june 9, 2018  by  todd 

reply 





high above terra linda, in the terra linda/sleepy hollow divide, hundreds of goats are “monching and cronching” on the dry grass as a means of fire prevention. over 400 goats and sheep have spent the last two months grazing in the open space to reduce the fuel available for fires in the coming fire season.

winter camp 2012

posted on may 13, 2013  by  todd 

1 





for the second year in a row we joined our cub scout troop for winter camp at camp marin sierra. 
thankfully the snow wasn’t as late as i am getting these pictures up. we lucked out, again, and got fresh snow just in time for our arrival. the big new activity this year, given how fresh the snow was, was knocking on trees to create a mini-avalanche. our hike took forever since we stopped at every tree. the laughter that followed more than made up for the extra time out in the cold.

chasing rainbows

posted on march 31, 2013  by  todd 

reply 


after a short rain shower late yesterday afternoon a rainbow appears just behind the house. we grabbed the camera and went chasing after it, hoping to find a pot of gold. alas, we were treated only to the sight of the rainbow itself, which couldn’t decide if it was a single or double.

it was a wild week in northcutt land. 
after putting up with sick children and an out of town husband we treated marla to a breakfast at cibo in sausalito. the lattes and donuts flowed freely. cora enjoyed a play date with a friend from school and the girl scouts kept us hydrated and poodled.

this week in northcutt: episode 1

posted on january 8, 2013  by  todd 

reply 





i’m sitting in the oakland airport right now waiting on a flight to ces. (see all of ign’s ces coverage here.) it’s quiet, unstructured moments like this that i really like to poke through the site and look back on fun and family… only for 2012 there’s not much to see. i did a terrible job keeping things up to date and it makes an otherwise exciting and eventful year look dull.
