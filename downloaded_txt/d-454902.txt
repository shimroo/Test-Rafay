last week host excellence "decided" to rebuild a raid that hosted one of my mysql databases without any notice.  of course they botched it up and hundreds of us where without email and access to our mysql databases for more than 40 hours. i lost more than $4,000 in sales and when i asked for more internal memory to host the database on another home server and connect it to my website they hosted they took more than 24 hours to get back to me and just gave me the glib answer that no they wouldn't do it because it violates their tos. well they violated the tos by not notifying me and making my site unusable for more than 40 hours.their customer service has gotten worse and worse and i for one no longer trust them.  i am moving to another host asap.  add to that they lied to me for more than 16 hours when the raid rebuild first started and told me nothing ws wrong with my site based on their testing.👍 84 out of 👉 90 users found this review to be helpful!more reviews📄 editorial review🔃 host excellence is part of newfold digital🔧 services: web hostingdomain registrationwebsite builderssl certificates own datacenterupdate 2018 oct: hostexcellence.com is closed for businessif you used exclusively linux products, please go to site5.comif you used any windows products, please go to verio.comif you used only domain products, please go to dotster.comnote 2018: all customers are migrated to  site5 since the acquisition transition to eig.host excellence (part of ecommerce.com brand which includes ix web hosting) came out to offer the best webhosting services.when started, the focus was mainly on best services and excellent support, not necessary on price. linux and windows platforms were both supported from the beginning, at that time most of other companies was only offering unix based servers.nowadays, this focus has driven an increasing degree of success for hostexcellence, which imply directly to success for their clients. keeping the cost of their services affordable while continuing to improve their track record has been an effort, but not one that has been without reward.why choose host excellence ?they understand their clients need and bring these needs to reality. webhosting is a lot more than domain names and servers. it's about customer service, performance and dependability. it's about every customer.there are a lot of hosting providers to choose from, all promising pretty much the same experience. however, when you're operating fixed budget, but cannot afford the compromises associated with most shared hosting, host excellence is a great choice.locationshost excellence is by now a big company along it's sister, ixwebhosting. they maintain a corporate in 3 continents and 4 countries. their data center and headquarters is located in columbus, oh and along with their support facility in hopkinsville, ky they do their best to provide you great services, directly from the heartland of usa. they also have an office in ukraine and romania (even in india and austria in the past) and have relationships with entities worldwide.guaranteesas a hostexcellence customer, you have the possibility to test their services for 30 days without any risk. such feature is quite rare on webhosting companies and prove their openness on great services.moreover, they offer  100% money-back guarantees, 30-day money back guarantee  and any-time money back guarantee to its subscribers. this guarantee allows clients to purchase hostexcellence services with zero-risk and full confidence.along their packages, they offer few extras which can help you improve your business:ssl certificatesmerchant account (accept credit cards)website moving service (from $49)💰 price & costif you are looking to get the best price on budget webhosting range, ixwebhosting or bluehost may be a better choice. however, if you are looking to great services at affordable prices, hostexcellence will give you what you need.⌛ reliabilityhost excellence guarantees at least 99.9% of the time during any 12-month period update, this means that your website will be up and running all the time. this includes server uptime, network uptime and webserver. it does not cover any areas where host excellence has no direct control, such as fibre-optic main line cuts, backbone provider failures, dns or registrar issues with domain names, routing issues between host excellence data center and subscriber location.🏢 data centera key factor which set them apart of other companies is their own privately owned data center, located in columbus, oh. previous they owned a datacenter in hopkinsville, kentucky. they employ a distributed servers architecture, with services configured very well. a lots of brands will host a variety of webservices on a single machine. in this case the server cannot properly use its own resources on any particular task. instead of wasting servers in this manner to save a few dollars, they give each webserver to a specific task (like special server for databases, for dns..), and optimize the machine for that task.having 24/7 administrative staff, multiple backbone providers, diesel power-backup facilities and redundant cooling systems, hostexcellence has one of the most robust, very well managed data center. they try to continue expanding their capacities, refining their performance and reliability.🔨 control panelsince it's start, hostexcellence provided it's own control panel (ghcp) to manage your account and domains, however, a modified version of h-sphere was integrated for hosting management.today, a complete new version of their own control panel is already in place.for vps they offer you cpanel or plesk on centos or debian.🌏 server locations:   columbus📢 special pagescontact us:

time hosted: 2 to 3 yearsglobal ratingfeatures costcustomer relationcontrol panel😠 i am pissed off because i host several domains on my account & i am told that i cannot provide a separate login to access only one of my sites. ie if i want someone to look after just one of the sites, i have to give that person my username & pw to my entire account.  what a mickey mouse setup.then i am told i can upgrade my control panel to allow what i want, but that this will kill my site which is created in site studio.  by the way i have been chatting to oleg barrannik over this issue & he has been great

we’ve been with host excellence for a couple months now. our sites have been down more than 3 times each. slow most all peak times. extremely slow tech support response -- sometimes 3 days to answer a ticket! we just learned that the server we’re on has over 27,000 websites on it, which is overcrowded and very obvious by the poor performance. we are sorry that we went with them now but are now past the refund period so we have to suffer! you don’t! do yourself a favor, stay away from host excellence, which is run fathi said, which also runs ix web hosting and maybe others.🗨 hi,thank you for your feedback about host excellence, we are continually working to improve our hosting company and its through comments like yours that will take us to the next level in customer care and service.i am

excellence for the past 4 years. i have not had any issues with them. i now have 3 domains hosted by them. i have not seen any down time. the price it a little above average, but what they are offering as far as packages is better then most other hosting companies. i like that i have dedicated ip addresses for my domains and not a shared ip. they have their own data center which they own and operate. this make getting support faster. you don't have to worry about it being managed with another company and just getting 3rd party support. the control panel is great. the only complaint i have is the skins are a limited. this is just a simple cosmetic complaint. when i have had issues or questions, they have responding a timely manner. i would and have recommend host excellence to my coworkers and friends.👍 98 out of 👉 104 users found this review to be helpful!📅 jun  6, 2008carolyn webchick (memorycollections@h...) ⏳ time hosted: 2 to 3 yearsglobal ratingfeatures costcustomer relationcontrol panel😞 i have used host excellence for over 3 years, but have recently started moving my 18 websites to godaddy. two major problems: email sucks!!! the majority of my web clients who utilize host excellence email complain constantly about not getting mail or not being able to send mail. other major problem is that my home pages keep getting hijacked. in the last 9 months, i have had to remove jihad index pages on 5 separate occasions and replace with my valid  index pages. host excellence said this is my problem. regardless, i need a host with better security and secure ftp. this is disappointing as i really like host excellence features and customer server, but maybe this is a case where you get what you pay for. not much for not much.👍 62 out of 👉 72 users found this

some customers that have reviewed this server before. in the short time we've been with them, the server has crashed at least once a week, sometimes for several hours. we constantly have clients flooding our customer service email asking what is wrong. when we call host excellence, they always have an excuse for the server crashing. "somebody is abusing their site", "we're moving our server to ohio", etc, etc. we've lost countless sales due to their unreliability. i don't see how they can claim, legally, that they have 100% customer satisfaction. seems like a load of crap to us. we are looking to switch servers immediately, and to get a refund of the time we've been with them. do not pay to have your site hosted by them, it is not worth the pain.👍 65 out of 👉 70 users found this review to be helpful!📅 mar 12, 2008bob smith (advertisers2000@y...) ⏳ time hosted: over 3 yearsglobal ratingfeatures costcustomer relationcontrol panel😠 i´m writing this review as i wait for my e-commerce site to come back up and for host excellence to give support to the other 33 callers before me on their phone support. live chat is down as well. if you have an e-commerce site and expect at least 99% uptime, do not host with host excellence. we open an average of 3-5 tickets a week. their web and database servers crash constantly, including their own support site. live chat support is often unanswered and waiting times for phone support are often longer than 40 minutes. in january 08, a couple of tables from our database were suspiciously lost. when we asked for a security or login log of some sort, host excellence could not provide any. to this day we don´t know what happened or how those tables got deleted.  even more upsetting is the fact that when you visit their site, right on the home page they state 100% customers satisfied. from my experience and many others, this is just false. we are currently looking to [read more...]👍 98 out of 👉 104 users found this review to be helpful!📅 feb 20, 2008matt (mattfuehrer@m...) ⏳ time hosted: over 3 yearsglobal ratingfeatures costcustomer relationcontrol panel😃 hosting of my business website has been stable and problem free over the past 3+ years.customer service via phone and help desk ticket has been fast and easy- they have always been able to solve any issues right away.email on the other hand is another story.  spam, spam, spam.  they do not use any spam filters at all (because on a shared server if they filter the email then it'll affect other hosted users) so i get all of the spam that comes my way.  also, blacklisting has been a real big problem.  this is not all host excellence's fault, but as a hosting service they do have more power than me to make email a better experience.  also, horde, the web mail client sucks, sucks, sucks- it is there for emergencies only.👍 60 out of 👉 65 users found this review to be helpful!📅 jul  3, 2007jesse (jesse_worley@y...) ⏳ time hosted: 1 to 2 yearsglobal ratingfeatures costcustomer relationcontrol panel😠 if you sign up with hostexcellence you will need a lawyer on retainer. they will lose your data, as they did to so many people in june 2007, and then lie about why it happened, using an excuse that is simply not possible in a data center as well managed as they claim theirs is. how is it that a power surge can even happen in "one of the most robust and well-managed data centers in the world?" it's a literal impossibility unless they aren't employing even the most basic power hardware available. either way, they cannot be trusted. their administrators are largely incompetent and will lose your data, change permissions on your files, or suspend you without investigating your account. use another host, these clowns aren't worth the money they steal.👍 73 out of 👉 83 users found this review to be helpful!📅 jan 27, 2007elvis (qvkrrlyd@t...) ⏳ time hosted: 1 to 2 yearsglobal ratingfeatures costcustomer relationcontrol panel😞 these are the facts:i signed up about a year ago and was on the original "linux basic" plan (or something like that), which  gave me 50mb web space for $2.95/month. then  around december some time i was looking on their home page and saw that that for the same price the new plan now called “linux express.” i contacted the “live chat” and asked them if i can change plans, a seemingly simple request. after a convoluted conversation i finally got a response basically saying it would cost me the equivalent of almost two-years of what it would otherwise cost to sign up for a new plan!
