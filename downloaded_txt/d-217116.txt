americans' tax dollars fund talibaninterdictorjune 22nd, 2010i'm sure this is both necessary and good as part of the larger picture:79-page report, entitled "warlord inc," faults the us military for making trucking companies who deliver goods to us military bases in afghanistan responsible for their own security. it details how eight trucking companies that share a $2.1 billion contract are forced to pay warlords and afghan officials to pass unhindered with their convoys. in some cases, the companies pay as much as $150,000 a month for protection, or as much as $1,500 per truck, according to internal memos and other documents reproduced in the report. the report accuses the military of turning a blind eye to the problem.for the last 25 or so years, the us government has operated like it's part of a peter sellers movie.
