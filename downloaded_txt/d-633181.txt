“this course is a great design and so carefully maintained. they take pride in this place, and it shows  the people there are really nice. it is absolutely one of the top public courses anywhere near pittsburgh, and the price for the experience is a steal.”

“i travel all over the us exploring different golf courses. totteridge is at the top of the list, due to its elevation changes and over all layout. wonderful course, suits all types of players.”
