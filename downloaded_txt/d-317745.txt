funded from june 2000 to july 2007 as a cooperative agreement between the social security administration (ssa) and the university of illinois at urbana-champaign, the disability research institute (dri) developed a national network of partners producing high-impact research in disability. housed within the college of applied health sciences' center on health, aging, and disability, the dri served as a mechanism for partnering rigorous scientific research with the experience and practice expertise of the ssa to frame a focused research agenda designed to meet the informational needs of the agency.  the dri cooperative agreement brought together nationally recognized teams to conduct projects identified as need areas within ssa with minimal time delays between project implementation and applicable information.
this website contains an archive of technical reports produced by the dri.  more information about past dri research projects.
