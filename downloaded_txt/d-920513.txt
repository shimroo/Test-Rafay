which can make you feel better, or feel worse no doubt,

betsy hears a boo
















by sista seuss (who is me and this is rough)





on the tenth day of may, at an hbcu
in the heat of the gowns and the chill of the crowdsbetsy sauntered right in and changed all their moods.they were graduating and had no time for fools, that's whenbetsy heard a noise, a very loud boo!




she looked at omarosa, who she thought had her back.
she didn’t think she’d be hassled if she brought her friend, black.
but the graduates wasn’t having it was their damn day first!
they didn’t earn a degree to have their celebration cursed!
if she could shyt on their day they could shyt on hers too.
they turned their back, and gave another loud round of boo!



so this part’s in my brain, specifically my mind,
and because i'm fresh out of fucks, it may come off unkind.
i imagine the graduates saw their hbcu, not on their side.
i mean have you forgotten the administration where this woman resides?
did you hear all the cuts propose to attack students at risk?
did you forget that all your students/ graduates look just like this?


did you forget how she questioned if funding black was constitutional?
should you have consider a speaker who attended an hbcu, or am i just delusional?
did you consider for a moment that her intention might be fake?
did she offer you incentives? is it money that you’ll make?
i imagine your graduates were fresh out of fucks too,
so, completely out of fucks but filled to the brim with boo.


the threat to mail their diplomas as if they didn’t earn their day?
to forget that this administration on last week threaten to take funding away?
i only hope that one of those graduates gets it in his/her/or they minds,
to take your job, cause it might be about time.
the fact that you as educator would invite a living diss,
all that teaching, but their educators haven't learned shyt.



and if trump and betsy gets the chance to take funding away,
i know she'll remember all the boos her ass received today.
