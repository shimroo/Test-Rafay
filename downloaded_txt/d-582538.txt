hear from our valued clients from states around the country and see why music directors are singing a tune about the musicians abroad experience.
led by accomplished music educators, musicians abroad has become the first choice for international student performance group travel by providing industry-leading, on-line services and customer-based support. focused on creating custom trips that provide relevant, memorable and rewarding student travel experiences, musicians abroad successfully partners with music directors, designing travel to memorable european destinations.






giving young people an opportunity to explore new and exciting places encourages them to become more global thinkers and citizens. in a world that often feels like it is becoming more and more closed off, making our students aware of everything that the world has to offer them is a chance i feel we have to encourage. additionally, the pace and rigor of the musical experience that the students receive only makes them more capable and adept musicians when they return to their schools. it is a transformative opportunity on every level.



josh hamiltondirector of choirs, rowan county senior hs (ky)






switzerland is always a favorite stop on the tour - going up to the top of three famous mountains is three days was delightful. i love going from the business of london and paris to the open splendor and natural rugged beauty of switzerland. i had never been to the netherlands and that was simply lovely. utrecht is a gem of a city that i hope to visit again. we toured the waterways of amsterdam on the last night and that was delightful. 



justin romneychoir director, south oldham hs (ky)








the opportunity to share your music while experiencing so many cultures from major european cities like london and paris, the amazing scenery of switzerland, or the canals and bicycles of the netherlands is truly a life changing experience. 



scott cookseydirector of bands, louisville male hs (ky)






this trip was life changing and i have been viewing life in a different way after the trip. iâm always pushing myself to be my best, which has been a great change.



tristan morrisonstudent performer








my advice would be to take time to let the experience soak in. take pictures for memories but make sure to put your phone down and enjoy the moments. this tour was a great mix of touring and performance. i was able to learn so much about the different places and cultures while also being able to have fun performing music at great concert venues.



brady renselstudent performer






terrific student musicians, a great teaching staff and a committed mtc team. our passion is bringing outstanding musical and intercultural experiences to students in kentucky and southern indiana.



dr. frederick speckcoordinator








the 2023 trip to europe with musicians abroad was a trip of a lifetime! to have well-planned experiences in eight different countries over a period of 16 days was incredible. i came home from this trip a better person than when i left.



caren whitehouseadult traveler






i remember being awestruck by visiting windsor castle and westminster abbey just weeks after i watched the coronation of king charles iii on tv. then, in paris, the choir and the orchestra were fortunate enough to perform in la madeleine church. this became one of my favorite concerts as the acoustics were terrific and i knew that we, as performers, were actually singing in the same sanctuary where chopinâs funeral took place and where both saint saã«ns and faurã© served as church organists.



scott bradfordissma choral education director








i am gratefulâ¦ to have my students engage in such a truly life-changing experience that you simply cannot teach within the walls of a classroom.



katy brielband director, clark pleasant ms (in)






fabulous student musicians, a great group of music advisors and a terrific team of tour leaders and guides! i canât wait for the next opportunity to bring students from kentucky and southern indiana on this amazing musical, cultural and historical adventure.
