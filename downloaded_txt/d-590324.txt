closing time




hi gangsters!

after 8 years, 69 days and 8994 posts i am closing this blog down for further postings.

on the behalf of myself and my beloved friends of the pcl team i now say goodbye. it is time. this blog no longer serves any purpose whatsoever.

our facebook page, however, will remain and hopefully continue to spread that good stuff! 

except for the obvious gratitude towards my companions of the pcl elite (you know who you are!) i would like to especially thank ange who more or less on her own kept this blog alive and kicking for years.

auf wiederschnitzel!



/z aka mr. dante fontana.

update: note that the link to our fb page was wrong when i posted this. now it has been corrected.

strip along with us




never quite got a grip on the popularity of strip records. guess they were a platform for the middle class of the 60's to be a bit risque and participate in the sexual revolution from the comforts of their living rooms in scarsdale. i dunno.....this lp is confounding in that it features the obligatory bar band, sleazy emcee and the sounds of drunken patrons urging the bump and grind of a performer named "doll-ie". standards such as "misty" and "blues in the night" are featured with the typical heavy handed drummer. aural porn for the masses.

strike one




lew burdette, a crafty right hander for the milwaukee braves was the mvp of the '57 world series. known for his outstanding control, the nitro, west virgina native was often accused of throwing the illegal spitball. sportswriter red smith was once quoted as saying, "there should be 3 pitching statistics for burdette: wins, losses, and relative humidity."
burdette was also a bit of a practical joker posing as a lefty in this 1959 topps card. 


lew shows a bit less control in this number recorded in 1959. another in a short list of baseball player recording fails. 
thanks to my facebook buddy, radiolux franky for the goodness.

the big guava 




this week half of the american political circus comes to tampa, florida and there's more to the tampa bay area than joe redner, the shuffleboard hall of fame and rondo hatton's grave — as this 1976 promotional film will show you.in the early '90s i lived in tampa while pursuing studies at the university of sun and fun and tampa's public access cable was a goldmine of visual delights from carol h. sudler iv's (aka harrison) award-winning chatterbox talkshow to gg allin videos shown by suzy morbid (now dj suzy solar) and, of course, the legendary sondra prill.

gag boxes




i've always had a thing for gag boxes. i recall my dad having an enviable collection of adult novelty boxes that he would carefully keep hidden from the yuma youth brigade (we knew exactly where they were hidden and took great care, after ogling, to replace them in the exact same corner of the upper closet shelf.)

collectors weekly interviews mardi & stan timm about their collection of gag box novelties, many produced by the h. fishlove and co. and the brains of the operation - irving fishlove.
here's a few from their collection: 



 
for the novelty connoisseur, the timm's website, timmstuff is worth a peek.
