anyone who knows her wouldnt be surprised to learn that jilly sees the world through a prism of faerie tales. it was years before i came to understand that she wasnt just being whimsical when she talked so easily about hobs and brownies and various kinds of faerie creatures. 
they were real.
faerieland, otherworlds, and all the denizens and creatures you might imagine to live there.
it was all real.
and so were ghosts.
i remember when i first realized this. i felt like my head was going to explode.

falling in love. a finalist for the 1992 world fantasy award, this novella was originally published as

charles de lint's readers have been asking him to put together story collections featuring their favourite newford
characters. the crow girls are among his best-loved characters, so de lint obliged by gathering their stories all
under one roof, so to speak. some other members of the newford repertory company show up here, but at the forefront
of each story are these two little wild girls with their big personalities.

these stories have all been published before. "crow girls" is also available in the very best of charles de lint and
in moonlight and vines; "twa corbies" in moonlight and vines; "the buffalo man" in tapping the dream tree;
and "a crow girls' christmas" in muse and reverie. "make a joyful noise," published in a limited edition by subterranean press,
