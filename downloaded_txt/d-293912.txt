welcome to mr chow
in china, a meal is a social event meant to be experienced with others. food is shared in a communal setting. dishes are served “family style” to ensure all guests get a taste of everything. the principles of chinese cuisine are entrenched in a theory of harmony, dictating that all facets of the senses are stimulated equally. a balance of tastes, textures, fragrances, and colors is presented to enhance and accentuate the other. to ensure the most enjoyable experience, ordering is traditionally done by a single person, typically the host.










world famous dining experience
the first mr chow opened in london on valentine’s day 1968 with top chefs serving authentic beijing cuisine and with creative original recipes such as chicken satay and ma mignon. mr chow has since expanded to the usa opening the beverly hills location in 1974, then new york where the first location opened in 1979 on 57th street, and the second location in new york tribeca in 2006. the fifth location opened in the summer of 2009 at the w hotel in miami beach. the sixth location opened in 2016 at the caesars palace in las vegas.
