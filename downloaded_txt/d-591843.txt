baseball on the gold coast
 



    welcome to the

gold coast baseball association (gcba)



   we love baseball and think it is one of the best team sports to be involved in. we understand that starting a new sport can be daunting and learning new skills can be scary but rest assured baseball offers a fantastic environment to learn the basics and grow new skill sets.baseball is a team sport that engages hand eye coordination, team work and strategic thinking. starting in the under 8’s age group we have new players playing in a t-ball program to initiate hitting, catching, throwing and base running. as players become older they will have opportunities to pitch and hit against pitchers.baseball is one of the usa’s, japan’s and central america’s premier sporting associations; playing baseball provides potential opportunities to overseas education, tours and experiences unlike any other sport in australia.so, feel free to continue to surf our website to find your club and learn more about baseball; how it operates on the gold coast and how you can get involved and get in the game!
