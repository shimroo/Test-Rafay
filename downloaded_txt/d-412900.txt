beware of phishing messages in my name:
i have been informed by students and the vt chief of police (mac babb,
wmb1@vt.edu, 540-231-5123) that there is an active phishing scam
regarding an internship using my name as well as that of other
professors. i have repeatedly reported this. the scam should be
obvious, using a false phone number, and eventually asking for bank
information. please report such to the chief of police.
