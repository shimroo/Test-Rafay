beginner spanish class
i took an excellent beginner spanish class with danica radeka. i loved the participation factor of the class. you had to do your homework and be involved in the discussions to add value to the class and to develop your personal learning. danica was an enthusiastic and patient teacher who pushed you to do well and advance your language skills. i highly recommend taking spanish with abc languages.





danny a.






beginners arabic
i have been taking beginners arabic with josef, and it is a really fun and interesting class. he is a wonderful teacher, with a great sense of humor. i love my saturday lessons and can recommend abc with all my heart.

german
peter, my german teacher is wonderful. he is very thorough, putting much effort and thought into helping us acquire the skills to speak and write successfully. as an english lit. teacher i highly recommend this school and instructor.





juliette s.






communication, professionalism, quality, value
this school is amazing! accommodating staff, well-structured courses, and professional teachers.
i have been taking basic arabic with joseph halabi. such a fun teacher! arabic is not an easy language when you have absolutely zero knowledge. but joseph made it fun, accessible, interesting, and motivating! i highly recommend abc languages.





natalia s.






japanese
after i graduated from college i was looking for a place to continue studying japanese so i wouldn’t lose my skill. i started studying at abc language exchange with shimada-sensei on a weekly basis. every week i got the personal attention i needed in class for my skill level and saw a vast improvement in my reading comprehension and conversation skills. i even took the jlpt test and passed! the staff is awesome! i highly recommend it!





keegan p.






arabic 12 weeks.
i enjoyed studying here. i took advanced arabic for about six months with rabah. the staff is helpful and flexible. rabah is a very good teacher; he does a great job of getting new students up to speed in the class, too. i am very glad that he doesn’t just teach from the textbook, but also leads discussions of news or culture.

6-week beginner’s italian course

i took a 6-week beginner’s italian course with abc language exchange. i had some issues with my schedule, but the staff was helpful, courteous, and understanding. they allowed me to change my class and get a better professor. my italian instructor, tony, was extremely knowledgeable about the language, history, and culture. i learned a lot from him and really enjoyed the class, as it allowed me to gain a basic understanding of the italian language. i look forward to using it later this year when i am in italy!

our story
we are the nation’s leading independent language school


rachel meyer and elizabeth zackheim started abc languages to right some of the wrongs of their own language learning trajectory. rachel and elizabeth are native english speakers now fluent in several languages and know the dos (and don’ts) of learning a new language with confidence. using the knowledge they’ve acquired as expert educators, they’ve created a school built on the foundation that effective language learning should be fun, social inspirational, and accessible. abc languages was founded in new york city in 1998 as a place where rachel and elizabeth could share their decades of learning and teaching experience with eager learners. starting with just 4 classes in 2 languages, abc languages is now one of the nation’s leading language institutions, with classes in over 20 languages in new york, the bay area, and online.
