about me





dale hoytz


hi everyone! my name is dale, and i have worked in human resources for over 15 years. during this time, the job market has radically transformed. where workers used to work for the same company for 30 years and retire, they now change jobs on average every 2-3 years and often have multiple jobs to support themselves. i created this blog with the hopes that i can help point out some great entry level jobs for college graduates and provide applicants with some interview advice they may not have received in college. i hope you enjoy my blog, and i look forward to posting about all the exciting opportunities there are in today's job market!
