what is the bhd project?the mission of the bhd project is to break down stigmas surrounding mental illness and create a culture of understanding and acceptance. bad hair day on planet earth — a book that provides a raw, unadulterated view into mental illness and the messy journey through recovery — is the first step in fulfilling that mission. barbara ruzansky, owner of why, tells her intently personal struggle of crisis and recovery through this memoir. it’s a story told meant to engage and, in the deepest sense, help others.
