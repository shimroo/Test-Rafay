canexas life coaching

from overwhelm to confidence: 
your transformation starts here








designed for high achievers

here’s how i can help you:

reduce overwhelm: learn how to take back control of your time, energy, and priorities.
build confidence: break free from self-doubt and start making decisions with clarity and purpose.
set boundaries: learn to say “no” without guilt and protect your time for what matters most.
rewire limiting beliefs: shift the thought patterns that keep you stuck and replace them with empowering habits.
achieve goals: with a personalized plan and accountability, we’ll work together to make your vision a reality.



what’s the difference between counseling and coaching?
this is a question i often get from clients, and it’s an important one!

counseling focuses on healing, processing past trauma, and addressing mental health concerns. it’s about understanding “why” and working toward emotional wellness.
coaching focuses on the present and future. it’s about growth, goal-setting, and creating actionable strategies to move you forward in your life. coaching is not therapy, but it’s a powerful tool for change.



what makes my coaching unique?
with over 30 years of experience in the mental health, education and personal development field, i bring a unique combination of expertise, empathy, and proven strategies to my coaching practice. my clients tell me they appreciate the balance of practical tools and compassionate accountability i bring to every session.
what you’ll get when you work with me:

a tailored roadmap to achieve your goals.
practical strategies to address your challenges immediately.
high-touch support, including weekly sessions and personalized guidance.
a focus on real-life results that align with your values and vision.

this is not a cookie-cutter program. together, we’ll create a plan that’s as unique as you are.


how it works
my 8-week coaching program is designed to give you the tools, clarity, and confidence you need to create lasting change.
here’s what to expect:

weekly 1:1 coaching calls – we’ll meet virtually to dive into your challenges and goals.
personalized daily check-ins – stay on track with text or email accountability throughout the week.
tools and worksheets – you’ll get resources to apply the strategies we discuss in real life.
a focus on results – this isn’t just about “talking it out.” it’s about creating measurable progress every step of the way.


is coaching right for you?
coaching is perfect for you if:

you’re ready to take action and make meaningful changes in your life.
you want a structured approach to reaching your personal and professional goals.
you’re looking for support, strategies, and accountability to move forward.
