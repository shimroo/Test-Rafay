charlemagne's lie of 794 ad, the greek latins of alba longa and of rome, the byzantine empire lie and balkanization
© john s. romanides
mettius fufetius, the latin king of alba  longa, claims that the romans of tullus hostilius (672-640 bc), the latin king of rome, are no longer pure greeks, whereas his albans (alvanoi) are still pure greeks. within this context we shall study

examples of the science of the ethnic cleaning of history

and a vision of the future

united states of franco-romania





the joke is on the fibbers. why?
because the primitive romans of latium  (as the reader of this website will see) were a union of such greek speaking tribes as: pelasgians, aborigines, sabines and trojans. this is the football we are passing on the specialists in roman, greek and so-called byzantine history to play around with. in other words charlemagne believed and knew that he was lying, but without knowing it he was telling a truth, i.e. that the ancient romans were indeed greek speaking. this football is on this website. have fun!some underlying positions of this website







conclusion

the names by which things are called are important in shaping our interpretation of reality. people are often surprised to discover that historical labels which define the past are inventions of later scholarship and ideology, not parts of the past itself. men and women of the middle ages did not know that they lived in the middle ages: people who lived in classical athens or renaissance italy suffered the same disability. the people of the "byzantine empire" had no idea that they were byzantine. they regarded themselves as the authentic continuators of the roman world: the romans living in romania.
