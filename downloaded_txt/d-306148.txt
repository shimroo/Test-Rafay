the ten 
                commandments





					      
i am hashem
            thy god, 
                     who brought thee out          of the land of egypt, 
					         out of the house of         bondage. thou shalt         have no other gods         before me.
					         (ex. 20:2-3)
 



      
					thou shalt not 
            make        unto thee a graven        image, nor any manner        of likeness, of any 
					        thing that is in heaven 
				        above, or that is in         the earth beneath, or        that is in the water        under the earth:        (ex. 20:4)





					      thou shalt not take the 
            		        name of hashem thy        god in vain; for 
					        hashem will not hold        him guiltless that
					        taketh his name in        vain. (ex. 20:7)





					      
					remember the sabbath        day, to keep it holy.        (ex. 20:8)





					      
					honour thy father and        thy mother: that thy        days may be long upon        the land which 
					        hashem thy god giveth        thee. (ex. 20:12)






					    
 thou 
            shalt not murder.
                    (ex. 20:13)





					    
 thou shalt not commit        adultery. (ex. 20:14)





					      thou shalt not steal.        (ex. 20:15)
					





					    
 thou shalt not bear        false witness against 
					        thy neighbour. 
				        (ex. 20:16)




					      
					thou shalt not covet        thy neighbour's house,        thou shalt not covet 
					        thy neighbour's wife, 
				        nor his manservant,         nor his maidservant, 
					        nor his ox, nor his ass,        nor any thing that is 
					        thy neighbour's.        (ex. 20:17)

 be it known unto you all, 
    and to all the people of israel, that by the name of 
jesus christ of nazareth, 
    whom ye crucified, whom god raised from the dead, even by him doth this man 
    stand here before you whole. [11] this is the stone which was set at nought 
    of you builders, which is become the head of the corner. 
[12] neither is there salvation 
    in any other: for there is none other name [yeshua] under heaven given among 
    men, whereby we must be saved. 
(acts 4:10-12) 




 this site is dedicated to 
	the salvation of the jewish and gentile people.  we love the jews and will 
    faithfully stand with them until our lord yeshua calls us to his rest.

does god exist

 brethren, my heart's desire and prayer 
            to god for israel is they might be saved. 
(rom.10:1) 



 for what is a man 
            profited, if he shall gain the world,  and lose his own soul? 
            or what shall a man give in   exchange for his soul? (mat. 16:26)          
    		                    
    		

let us hear the 
            conclusion of the whole matter: fear
            god, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man...
            (eccles.12:13-14)
