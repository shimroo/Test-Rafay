chen family old frame taijiquan
chen family old frame taijiquan is the ancestor of all taiji styles.  like every legitimate taiji style, it is a martial art, not new-age meditation.
		the basic exercises provide health benefits to people of any physical condition, though advanced levels of training are mentally and physically
		demanding.
the system encompasses a wide variety of training methods that are performed solo or with a partner, and contain both slow and fast
		movements.    these include:

post standing ~  (zhan zhuang)
first form ~  (lao jia yi lu)
second form ~  (lao jia er lu), also called
			"cannon bashing" ~  (pao chui)
single sword ~  (dan jian)
single saber ~  (dan dao)
double sword ~  (shuang jian)
double saber ~  (shuang dao)
spring-autumn glaive ~  (chun qiu yan yue dao)
âfive tigers swarming sheepâ staff ~   (wu hu qun yang gun)
long pole (form)  ~    (da gan)
three-opponent staff tapping ~   (san ren gan dui ting)
pear blossom spear with white ape staff ~  (li hua qiang jia bai yuan gun)
taiji ball  ~  (taiji qiu)
ruler  ~   (xing gong bang)
pole shaking  ~    (dou gun zi)
push-hands  ~    (tui shou)
joint locking and grappling  ~  (na fa)

the empty-hand forms contain the core principles of chen family taijiquan: silk reeling
		( , chan si jin), redirection
		( , yin jin luo kong),
		neutralization ( , zou hua),
		waist movement, etc. in addition to these skills, weapons are used for training explosive force
		( , fa li), sensitivity, and agility.
