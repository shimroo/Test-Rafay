						    math in science						






the german mathematician carl friedrich gauss referred to mathematics as the "queen of the sciences". in doing so, gauss not only identified math as a science itself in that it is defined as the study of numbers and their operations, but also as the underlying foundation for all other sciences  allowing scientists to describe patterns in data, relationships between variables, and fundamental principles discovered in our quest for knowledge. from the study of a wave, which can be described by its length, height, and frequency, to the measurement of the rate at which the tectonic plates in the earth's crust are moving, mathematical principles are fundamental to understanding and doing science. our math in science modules discuss select mathematical principles in context of their use across different scientific disciplines, focusing explicitly on how these principles are used in science.

						    process of science						






what is it about a scientific theory that sets it apart from other ideas? how does one conduct and control a scientific experiment? why do statistical statements weigh so heavily in science? scientists often talk about the findings of their research, but they are less likely to talk about the processes and methods that lead to those discoveries. yet these processes and methods, and the surprises scientists face while pursuing them define science. our process of science modules use in-depth examples to introduce the methods used by scientists, the ways that scientists work with data and communicate their findings, and the culture and diversity of science.

science is a collections of facts.

						    scientists and research						






for many people, the first thing they imagine when hearing the word "scientist" is a man in a white lab coat, maybe with crazy hair. but not all scientific research is done in a lab, much less wearing a lab coat, and science is not just for men! scientists are diverse in their backgrounds, the topics they study, and the methods they use. this section introduces readers to scientists who work in the field studying big cats or penguins, who do research in greenhouses and with a microscope, who design experiments using novel techniques and who hail from a host of different backgrounds and cultures.
