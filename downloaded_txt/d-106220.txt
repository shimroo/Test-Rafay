    the command's formation & purpose

after the dunkirk 
    evacuation of the defeated allied expeditionary force in early june 
    1940, churchill decreed that a new joint or combined fighting force (land, 
    sea and air) was required, whose unique challenge and sole purpose was to 
    plan, train for and undertake offensive 
    amphibious operations against the enemy, avoiding distractions arising from 
    defensive considerations.

initially, 
    small scale amphibious raiding forces were formed, 
    which soon developed into larger, better trained and equipped 
    
    commando units, each around 500 men in strength. they raided coastal 
    areas of enemy occupied territories from northern norway to south west 
    france, causing the germans to reinforce their coastal defences including 
    the deployment of thousands of additional troops taken from other duties. 
    special forces, including the special boat service (sbs) and special air 
    services (sas), took the commando concept to a new level for clandestine 
    operations behind enemy lines.

[photos below, in 
    order of appearance are; churchill, keyes, mountbatten and laycock].


concurrent 
      with these developments, plans were prepared for large scale landings 
      (invasions) onto unimproved beaches in countries occupied by the enemy, 
      which culminated in the d day landings. the combined operations command 
      was not to be distracted from its offensive operations task by the 
      unfolding events of war as the three traditional services concentrated 
      their resources in defence of the uk and her interests.

in fulfilling this 
    task, raf actions included the battle of britain, bombing raids, coastal 
    defence patrols, u-boat detection and support for combined operations raids 
    and landings, while the royal navy defended trade routes, detected and 
    destroyed surface raiders and u-boats, maintained a maritime blockade of 
    germany, defended uk coasts and escorted and supported combined operations 
    raids and landings. 



after 
    a period of re-equipping and training, including combined operations landing 
    craft training, the army saw action in north africa, madagascar, sicily, 
    italy, east africa, southern france, normandy, holland, the rhine crossing 
    and the far east, assisted throughout by the forces of the combined 
    operations command during amphibious landings.

for the purposes of 
    training and offensive amphibious operations against the enemy, all rnvr and 
    rn landing craft officers and ratings, and their royal navy landing craft, 
    were attached to the combined operations command, itself staffed by royal 
    navy, army and royal air force personnel under the command of naval men 
    keyes and mountbatten from july 1940 to october 1943 and major general 
    laycock until 1947. 


under 
    their stewardship and close liaison with the joint chiefs of staff, 
    extensive training in the use of landing craft through dozens of 
    
    training establishments, mainly in central scotland and the south of 
    england, were set up. for pay and accounting purposes 
    hms copra was established for rnvr and rn personnel attached to the 
    combined operations command.


       



the training 
    included general seafaring, joint army/navy training in all aspects of 
    amphibious warfare using landing craft with raf support, particularly at the 
    no 1 combined training centre at inveraray on loch fyne. 


in 
    the final stages of training, 516 squadron raf (also attached to the 
    command) created realistic war conditions by attacking the landing beaches 
    with live ammunition, small bombs and smoke canisters. this was 
    usually followed by many months of joint army/navy training exercises in 
    loading, unloading, forming and maintaining position in convoys and mock 
    beach landings.
 

the 
    command's development

on june 4th 1940, as 
    the last of the troops were evacuated from the beaches of dunkirk, churchill 
    sent a memorandum to his chief military assistant and staff officer, general 
    ismay. he was churchill's main communications link with the chiefs of staff. 
    the memorandum warned against the dangers of concentrating too much on the 
    defence of the united kingdom against enemy attack or invasion. "it is of 
    the highest consequence to keep the largest numbers of german forces all 
    along the coasts of the countries they have conquered, and we should 
    immediately set to work to organise raiding forces on these coasts where the 
    populations are friendly." two days later, he continued on the same theme, 
    "i look to the chiefs of staff to propose me measures for a vigorous, 
    enterprising and ceaseless offensive against the whole german-occupied 
    coastline."


    on the 14th of june, the chiefs of staff appointed lieutenant-general alan 
    bourne to the amply described post of "commander of raiding operations on 
    coasts in enemy occupation, and adviser to the chiefs of staff on combined 
    operations." bourne was 58 and had been in charge of the royal marines for 
    about a year. his wide experience on land and sea, and attendance at the 
    imperial defence and army staff colleges, were no doubt factors in his 
    selection for this new and challenging post. 

churchill was not consulted about the 
    appointment during these frenzied and anxious times. whilst he held bourne 
    in high regard, he felt he was too close to the admiralty to be able to 
    operate without undue influence from them and he lacked the seniority and 
    authority to deal with the three ministries. on the 17th of july 1940, 
    churchill appointed admiral of the fleet, 
    roger keyes to the newly named post of 

    director of 
    combined operations. 
he was succeeded by 
    lord louis mountbatten, who held the redefined 
    post from 27/10/41 until he moved to burma in october 1943. major general
          
robert laycock then held the post until 
    1947. 


    combined operations made a huge contribution to the successful outcome of 
    the second world war by undertaking dozens of commando raids and landings, 
    mostly against the axis forces, from norway in the north to madagascar in 
    the south and from north africa and the mediterranean in the west to the far 
    east, culminating in the 
          d-day invasion 
          on the 6th of june 1944. 

the command drew on 
    the best practices and expertise the royal navy, the army and the royal air 
    force had to offer to create a  unified force. many of their top 
    planners and experts formed the nucleus around which the command was formed 
    and, as the requirements of offensive operations took on an international 
    dimension, the service personnel of many allied countries proudly wore the 
    combined operations badge. 



    in addition to the nations represented by the flags in the banner heading, 
    german speaking refugees from the following countries served in no 10 
    inter-allied commando, particularly no 3 troop. they were; austria, 
    czechoslovakia, denmark, germany, hungary, romania, russia and yugoslavia. 
    greece's sacred commando squadron was not 
    part of combined operations but in all regards they served the allied cause 
    in defence of their homeland.

the 'all pages index' 
    in the page banner heading has brief descriptions of around 190 web pages 
    about this amazing and ubiquitous wwii organisation whose auspices included 
    such diverse subjects as
          commando raids and major 
    landings, landing craft training 
    for hundreds of thousands, 
    mulberry harbours, the 
    pluto pipeline 
          project, "hobarts funnies" tank adaptations and even top secret 
    experiments on an unsinkable 
    "ice ship" in the rocky mountains.


it's a testimony to 
    the enduring nature of the combined operations concept that the 
    combined operations badge, designed 
    by 
    

lt d a grant,
          rnvr, in 1942, is still in use to this day in a number of 
    countries worldwide. 
    

the 
    combined ops memorial

if you plan to 
    visit the memorial, you'll find useful information on the link to help 
    you make the most of your day.

on thursday, july 4th 2013, 
    in the presence of her majesty's lord lieutenant of staffordshire, mr ian 
    dudson, cbe and 200 guests, including 25 ww2 veterans and 6 standard 
    bearers, the combined operations command memorial was unveiled by general 
    sir richard barrons kcb cbe adc gen, commander of the joint forces command. 
    it was dedicated by the reverend prebendary, tony wood.

no greater honour 
    could be bestowed on the service personnel of yesteryear, than for the 
    commander of their modern equivalent force to honour their memory, 
    sacrifices and achievements in this way.



a 
    spontaneous act of heartfelt appreciation


in the summer of 2004, a
          ww2 veteran from canada and his friend were travelling north to 
    scotland by rail, having attended the 60th anniversary d-day commemorations 
    in normandy. they engaged an elderly lady in conversation and found they had 
    much in common. the veteran had served in combined operations as an lac on a 
    radar vessel off the beaches of normandy and her late husband had been an 
    officer in the combined operations pilotage parties (copps). his clandestine 
    visits to the landing beaches prior to invasions, provided invaluable 
    intelligence on enemy defences, hidden obstacles and beach and tidal 
    conditions. 




the miles drifted by almost unnoticed as 
      they relived their youthful memories of wartime... for she had also served 
      her country in the waaf, including some time at raf charterhall, near 
      kelso, in the scottish borders. 


    unbeknown to them all, a young business woman, sitting nearby, overheard 
    much of the animated conversation over several hours. at york she slid a 
    sealed envelope onto their table as she left the train. she was gone before 
    they had time to gather their senses.


wherever you are in 
    the world, your life has certainly been touched by the achievements and 
    sacrifices of those who served under the combined operations command in ww2. 
    viv felt compelled to show her appreciation and gratitude having heard but a 
    tiny fraction of the experiences of just a couple of veterans.
