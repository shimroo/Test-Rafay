buy, bye





mike wallace, cbs news  ‘60 minutes’ sad, funny, undeniably authentic, tabloid baby tells the tale of what befell too much of mainstream television news over the past couple of decades as the bad drove out the good. maury povich burt was there for the birthing of tabloid, he became the heart of the genre, and now he’s written the bible. paula zahn,  fox news channel it was a fun read.  i laughed out loud! jim ryan, good day new york,  wnyw-tv this one is terrific!  this one puts you there.  it gives you the flavor of being there and it gives you the kind of off-the-wall gonzo journalism that was going on there!  j. max robins, the robins report,  tv guide tabloid baby is a compelling, vodka-laced chronicle that pulls back the curtain on the helter-skelter world of tabloid tv. celebrities’ bad behavior—illicit sex, substance abuse, betrayal and revenge— are commonplace in the weird world of tabloid baby…  some of the incidents in tabloid baby are laugh-out-loud funny… i can corroborate how accurately he captures the era… kearns does his subjective best to show how the tabloid genre stripped away pretensions from the news.  he demonstrates how a bare-knuckle style of reporting often produced exclusives, while occasionally even bringing insight to the most sensational stories of the decade.  john strausbaugh,  new york press he helped change forever the way the news gets told on tv.  kearns is defiantly, happily unapologetic. that’s part of what makes his memoirs such an absorbing read. tabloid baby  is a funny, brash, packed-with-anecdotes account of his role in the trashing (my usage) of tv news. if kearns lays on the mythologizing a bit thick–his portraits of colleagues like steve dunleavy come straight out of 1930s hero-worship of the two-fisted, whiskey-pounding newspaper reporter–it’s probably just because he’s looking to sell hbo the movie rights, and why not. besides, even his heroes show their warts, and portraits of powerful media figures like barry diller, diane dimond, anthea disney and jeff greenfield are boldly unattractive.  on the broad scale, tabloid baby  is a simple and familiar tale about the aussification of the news: that is, it’s about the enormous, and many would say enormously detrimental, impact rupert murdoch and his piratical aussie crew have had on news, both in print and electronic, both here and in england, over the last decade.   on a more petty level, various other famous asses get satisfying comeuppances in tabloid baby.  he tells some great hollywood-sleaze stories. the straits times, singapore pop culture history of the best sort -- dishy, gossipy, delivered with the unerring ear of a tv reporter for the good soundbite and a healthy dose of cynicism.   a rough and tumble, zippily-entertaining pop history of the birth of american tabloid television.  in this kiss-and-tell, after a fashion, book, he provides the lowdown on how american television reporting got from the buttoned-down, wasp mentality of anchors like walter cronkite to the sleaze-driven mania of the lewinsky phenomenon in the 1990s. today’s librarian magazine tabloid baby is a realistic account of how the medium of television emerged from the mass of “infotainment” programming it now embraces. a master at taking the reader behind the scenes, author burt kearns goes one better and shows in detail who’s calling the shots and the cut-throat nature of the business.  kearns relates the down and dirty to us—all first hand. the industry philosophy of  “do whatever you have to do to get ratings, no matter who you hurt” is the underlying theme throughout the book, and kearns’ experience as the former executive producer of a current affair and hard copy makes him more than qualified to give us this accurate account.  the reader is given the obvious advantage of hearing about the people, the drinking, the sex, the drugs, from someone on the inside who lived, ate, and breathed tabloid tv shows.  kearns’ book has all the makings of a best-seller. it pulses and moves, and, like the medium it speaks of, presents us with a hook, teases us, and leaves us wanting more. as a former television show producer, i know many of the people kearns writes about. like myself, many in the industry will be nodding their heads in agreement, and the ones who won’t are those who will know they’ve been found out and that the jig is finally up. throw away any other book you’ve ever read about television shows, and welcome to the real world of tabloid baby.  it’s powerful, addictive reading, and despite the 500 pages to go through, i kept wanting more.  sequel? neal travis, the new york post the navel-gazing that's going on at the tv networks right now will be enhanced by the publication of burt kearns' enthralling book, tabloid baby in which the veteran of shows like a current affair and hard copy reveals the m.o. of the programs that changed the way the medium covers news. steve dunleavy, the new york post con men, criminals, celebrities, politicians - all seemed to remain part of a current affair’s extended family, even when we beat them up.  burt kearns, in his new book "tabloid baby," takes us on a delightful and raucous romp through that world.  it was a world that will never be seen again. the wildest bunch of pirates imaginable. i know because i was there.   in eloquent if sometimes brutal prose, kearns, a senior producer on the show, unmasks all the usual suspects, which would guarantee that tom brokaw wouldn't let himself be buried in the same cemetery as any of us.  "we'd taken television to a delirious and dangerous edge," kearns writes.  in varying doses of scandal, celebrity, crime, politics and morality, the tabloid television tales riveted a nation for a decade and kearns grabs it all in print.  the title of the book, "tabloid baby," tells you how it all went full circle until kearns goes respectable, marries beautiful british tv anchor allison holloway and has a lovely son called sam. all wrapped up in los angeles suburbia.  those wedding bells are breaking up that old gang of mine.  of course, i normally would have sued the son-of-a-gun for what he wrote about me, but i can't - it's all doggone true. frank digiacomo, the new york observer in the opening pages of tabloid baby, television producer burt kearns’ memoir about the rise and fall of tabloid television, he writes that new york post  reporter steve dunleavy, "the ageless legend with his silver pompadour, eagle beak profile and rakish charisma, was the paragon of everything that made journalism romantic and dangerous. he was friend to cops and criminals, bums and kings. he knew the words to any show tune you could toss at him." and then mr. kearns gets to the point: "dunleavy, it was said, would fuck anyone, do anything–fuck anything–for a story."   in journalistic parlance, that is the nut graph to mr. kearns’ first-person account of his immersion in the sweaty, up-all-night 120-proof world of tabloid television that media mogul rupert murdoch brought to america when he imported a band of australian "wild pirates," as mr. kearns referred to them in a phone interview, to run the american tv and media properties that he had purchased… indeed, if the book justifies anything, it’s that mr. dunleavy deserves his title as the keith richards of tabloid journalism. the sunday age, melbourne, australia young enough to be steve dunleavy’s son, kearns arrived in new york city from a sleepy suburban newspaper the night john lennon died, and elbowed his way up in television newsrooms before getting his big break—working with dunleavy and several other australians to set up the hugely successful tabloid show a current affair.  it was a rollercoaster ride, and prompted kearns to write a book about the era—a rollicking number called tabloid baby.  it’s during the launch that he coins the keith richards line about his old mate, whom treats as a loveable but eccentric uncle.  there’s plenty more where that came from, in the book. the australian, sydney, australia “what’s wrong with you?” my wife asked, as i lay in bed on saturday morning, recharging the batteries, laughing, chortling and giggling.  i was just reliving a part of my past, utterly engrossed in burt kearns’ book, tabloid baby.  it tells the rip-roaring, devil-may-care, booze-fueled story of the explosive rise of tabloid tv in the u.s.   kearns tells it all in a vivid, brutally honest account that is riveting, funny, yet ultimately sad.  not only do the central characters fall, one by one, victims of booze, fatigue and hollywood politics, but so does the genre itself…  in a sense, tabloid baby is a tabloid history of tabloid itself; a potted, bovrilized, cut-to-the chase story about a ten-year tv subset of the wider newspaper genre that grew, blossomed, and wilted within the 20th century… the tabloid era maybe well behind us now, but that’s why tabloid baby  is such a good read—it’s pure nostalgia; a portrait of the way we were, for those who may prefer to forget… ed breslin, seek books update, seekbooks.com tabloid baby  provides as much high-octane entertainment as any hollywood expose, and, in the bargain, it concerns a very serious subject, and sheds a sharp light on it: the nature of journalism at the dawn of the millennium.  every big news story of the 80s and early 90s is showcased in here.  what’s more, burt kearns proves the old journalism adage that the story behind the story is often the best story.  all of these guys would have attacked the great wall of china with a safely pin if a great story had been on the other side.  reading about them in tabloid baby, you feel that burt kearns has done for them as marauding journalists what robert louis stevenson did for pirates in treasure island.connie martinson talks books  (pbs & beverly hills courier)  burt writes like a young harold robbins, fast paced, character descriptive and true situations that do not always speak well of the teller.  it is, as burt says, an uncensored account of the revolution that gave birth to 21st century television news broadcasting.  burt’s story of office politics from a current affair to hard copy is riotous. la weekly the best parts of the book are his candid confessions of the sleazy tactics — ranging from stealing a joey buttofuoco tape off a new york satellite feed to copying the infamous rob lowe sex tape off an atlanta television screen— that got him into trouble.  kearns also pops off some good caps at pompous media figures, including jeff greenfield, who greeted a tabloid cameraman who baited him during the o.j. trial by saying, “this is the kind of lack of civility that i really think is unfortunate.”  and the boozy, vegas-stomping, strip-club-hopping, sammy davis jr.–fawning life he describes, in vomit-in-the-office-trash-can detail, is emulated by mainstream media personalities today. tim blair, the australian kearns's book is a brutal chronicle of how exposure to the australian tabloid ethos drove him to the brink of alcoholism.news of the world, london tv boss confesses… sensationally! the jerusalem post a lively, compulsively readable account of his experiences as a producer at the american tabloid television shows a current affair and hard copy! the hartford courant kearns relates dozens of raucous adventures in his new memoir, tabloid baby.  it's a rollicking remembrance that romanticizes tabloid tv, as if the shows a current affair and hard copy were hearst and pulitzer battling over the spanish-american war in the early days of yellow journalism.  kearns, however, suggests that the respectable press has always overstated the differences between itself and the tabs. to him, a tabloid story is simply one with a lot of emotion, real characters and a moral at the end -- a story with all the elements and drama of real life. he's started a new web site -- tabloidbaby.com -- that promises links to the best tabloid stories of the day, and he revels in how they come from places people might not expect, like the new york times, the los angeles times and the dallas morning news. the malibu surfside news tabloid baby  is as entertaining a read as the television shows it describes.  the book chronicles the last great communication revolution of the 20th century, providing a behind-the-scenes look at the birth of a new approach to network news. the palisadian-post, pacific palisades, ca we cannot print the title of chapter 4, but kearns’ new book tabloid baby features detailed accounts of scandals involving rob lowe, the kennedys and everything else he covered during his decade in tabloid television.  producing for a current affair and later hard copy, kearns did anything, sometimes resorting to illegal measures, to get the story.  kearns never claimed that such stories were vital information to american viewers… to him, the torrid tales served a much different purpose: humor. victor neufeld,  executive producer, abc news 20/20 i enjoyed the book a lot.  i am a closet "current affair" aficionado here at abc news… although some of what i learned happened at the program from reading the book i trust would never happen here! the web page, tv guide a hilariously scandalous account of the birth of tabloid tv! salon.com tabloid television isn't dead.  shows such as a current affair and hard copy that thrived on news, gossip and scandal and brought the world dramatic reenactments and hidden-camera scoops were simply made redundant.   burt kearns was a producer on both of those shows.  to hear him tell it, tabloid tv simply morphed into network news magazines, syndicated talk shows, ceaseless cable "news" coverage and those morning programs where the men all wear sweaters and the coffee is decaffeinated. the chattanooga times & free press  do you remember when the national news shows were serious, dull and only watched by your parents who felt some obligation to turn it on before dinner?   do you remember when all that changed?  during the '90s, the lines that once divided real news, real life and real entertainment were completely erased and replaced by a tv gumbo that includes cop shows, paramedic shows, judge shows and more news magazines shows featuring real people than there are real people.  burt kearns was there at the beginning, and he has written a book about tabloid tv and its rise to prominence and eventual merger with "real news."  tabloid baby  is the story of how shows like a current affair and hard copy, with their behind-the-story stories of real people, went from industry joke to industry leader to the industry norm… the trumbull (ct) times at times his life sounds as

account of what goes on.  believe us, this book is undeniably true and authentic. you can be rest assured that you, the reader have been given the obvious advantage of reading about the people, the

densely-packed and exhaustive inside history of the phenomena of tabloid tv during its reign. michael raffaele, author, "the editor:  steps to saving a dying newspaper" tabloid baby  was tremendous.   it is a breath of fresh air and should be taught in j-schools (and bars) across the country. rafael abramovitz, legendary tabloid tv correspondent burt kearns is a very lucky man.   because best

danny gans' manager settles lawsuit aganst donny & marie; apologizes for "hurtful" comments that "may have been made"





danny gans' former manager chip lightman has gotten the "amicable" resolution to the lawsuit he fired against donny & marie osmond for firing him as producer of their show at the flamingo in las vegas, after all.lightman released a statement yesterday:“i am pleased we were able to resolve  this matter and am sorry that, in the heat of battle, comments may have  been made that were hurtful to the osmonds. both donny and marie are  talented, hardworking artists and i wish them continuing success in  their careers.”donny responded:“my  sister and i want to thank chip lightman for great contributions he  made in launching our show at the flamingo. we look forward to the  opportunity to work with him again in the future.”"comments (that) may have been harmful"?"...work with him again in the near future?maybe lightman really did have material for a tell-all in his pocket, as he'd threatened on twitter before deleting the tweet.in his suit against the toothsome twosome, the unloved lightman accused donny of being "underhanded, devious, fraudulent and greedy," being out to "line his own pockets with ill-gotten gains to fund his lavish lifestyle of exotic cars, luxury hotel suites and private jets," and acting in a manner that's "contrary to the wholesome, all-american, good-natured image that he presents to the public."as for marie? lightman says the tragic mother was "liable for the fraud perpetrated by donny through her acquiescence, awareness, and utter failure to disclose" his action.

randy travis divorces his old lady





country music superstar randy travis has divorced his wife lib hatcher after 19 years of marriage.randy travis is 51.  lib hatcher is somewhere around 70.though there have been rumours lib might have been randy's "beard" (they did have a house in hawaii), there were reports back in july that randy was cheating with the wife of his dentist.  lib reportedly caught him by sticking a spycam on his tour bus!randy and lib have been together in one way or another for 34 years, ever since he, as the teenage randy traywick won a talent contest at the nightclub in charlotte, north carolina that liz owned with her first husband. randy was 17.  liz was 37.  she left her husband for young randy.randy and liz' relationship raised eyebrows in nashville and beyond in the 1980s.  as far as anyone knew, the older woman liz was the only girlfriend randy ever had. they married in 1991.the couple has a home in sante fe, new mexico. randy travis filed the divorce petition in nearby albuquerque on thursday.  the petition calls for an equal split of assets, and doesn't give a reason for the split besides saying a "state of incompatibility exists between the parties."lib will stay on as his manager.randy travis was considered "too country" when he broke in nashville in the eighties, but lib hatcher got him a record deal.  his first album, storms of life, was released in 1985 and is one of the greatest country music albums of all time.

katie couric thinks you need a bath





once was a time when network news nabobs considered everything between the new york-dc corridor and los angeles as "flyover country"-- the vast middle of america that looked eastward for guidance and leadership, and west for news of dead celebrities and earthquakes.,not worthy or economical for coverage beyond the occasional natural disaster or shooting spree.  that time passed abut twenty-five years ago, as cheap satellite technology made it possible to set up camp in any part of the world, and the advent of tabloid television era broke the elitist network news grip on coverage and influence and changed the news coverage palette for good.so it's quaint at the least to see that "katie" couric, who's taken over as "anchor" of the anachronistic cbs evening news, still refers to everything west of the hudson as  "this great unwashed middle of the country.""unwashed" or "great unwashed" is a derogatory term for the multitude of "ordinary" people.cbs news handout photonow you know why you haven't noticed those network news shows, and why it's probably a good idea, as howard kurtz's article in the daily beast indicates, that she stay on the job for a few more years at a reduced salary.

art vargas brings touch of prima to the palms





art vargas himself summed it up in hipster code for his facebook friends early this morning: "mondo lounge was a gass!... swingin time with the swank set... very cool crowd, swank settin' hipsters... diggin the scene, layin it down old school style... like no other dig it the most daddy!"the red hot vargas brought down the house at the palms' key west ballroom in las vegas last night, working the mondo lounge convention crowd and giving bookers, agents and  tastemakers another solid reason why the man who's played the big rooms reviving the ghost of bobby darin while working lounges and bistros with his own retro-themed classic vegas act, deserves a showroom of his own, his name on a giant marquee and billboards in and on the way from the airport as big and ubiquitous as danny gans'.and while vargas has the potential to take danny gans' role as the living embodiment of las vegas entertainment, the mantle he's really in line to assume is that of louis prima, the all-round entertainer who turned the vegas lounge into the center of vegas cool, and deservedly ascended to headliner status. nothing made that more clear by the guest shot in last night's show by none other than prima's daughter, lena. lena, youngest daughter of louis prima and gia maione, has carried on with her louis-centric career and is regarded as vegas loyalty.posted vargas: "what a gasss it is performing with you lena!! lets build a barn and do a show! just like mickey & judy! you are great, you must have your dad's heart and soul, what a legacy, the passion and performance is so real, what a thrill, and the audience so loved it! it is magical ..."the vegas media will catch up soon enough. stay tuned.

tragic kingdom: disneyland's haunted parking structure of terror





the suicide last night at disneyland's mickey & friends parking structure adds an unintended real-life macabre twist to the park's halloween time celebration.  attractions including space mountain, pirates of the caribbean and the haunted mansion have been tricked out in special halloween themes.  how many parents, while walking their kids to the escalators on their way from their cars to the trams that lead into the magic kingdom, will spin tales of the ghosts that haunt the parking structure?fun facts: the garage holds 10,500 car and was the world’s largest parking structure when it was constructed in 1998. it may still be.  the last disneyland suicide we reported was in 2008.

"dear burt: while you always had quite a flair for the dramatic, you never had much regard for the truth... apparently you can't be bothered to read anything carefully. maybe that is why you, like o'reilly, make half your crap up.
