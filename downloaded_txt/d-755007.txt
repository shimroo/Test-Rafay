lara poe – a composer name to keep in mind
american finn composer lara poe wrote a song cycle co-commissioned by the lahti and oulu symphony orchestras. this impressive work  was premiered in lahti on 12 october and was a proof of poe’s exceptional talent. the onerva songs for mezzo-soprano and orchestra are based on poems by l. onerva and the soloist was virpi räisänen.lara poe is a young composer whose works are being commissioned at an increasing rate. she has already attracted international attention with her existing orchestral and instrumental works.
