nintendo wii 
					game review



the 
					delivery of big brain academy, essentially a sequel 
					to the handheld nintendo games for the wii, is simple yet 
					appealing as a family or party game. it's not going to truly 
					build young brains, but children are required to 
					think as they play.

it's
      considerably easier
                     to get creative with digital cameras, although
      "old-fashioned" cameras will do the trick as well. when children
