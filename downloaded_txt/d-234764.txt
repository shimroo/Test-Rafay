this site features new ideas for easy-to-build simple electric motors originally designed by stan pozmantir for his grand prize winning science fair project.
on this site you will find:



real brushless dc motors based on different physics principles – fast, powerful, and great for science experiments.
detailed step-by-step assembly instructions (with pictures).
easy explanation on how these motors work and essential project research information – from beginner to advanced levels.
17 different simple motor kits for all ages and levels of education.
simple electric generators and motor speed measurement tools.



from inventors of the first ever reed switch motor kit (© simple motors, 1999) – the easiest electric motor to build (and understand how it works!)

easy to build quiklock™ kits


original brushless motor kits


simple motors for less than $6


experiment with your motor!




kit #11 – basic reed switch motor kit
this is the simplest motor kit that could be assembled in 30 minutes!
despite its simplicity it is a perfect learning tool to make first steps into wonderful world of electricity and magnetism.
efficient design (rotational speed up to 2100 rpm) guarantees this motor to work every time.
lots of fun for years!

kit #13 – advanced motor kit
in addition to all features of a basic motor this kit includes extra parts:

variable speed control that allows changing the motor speed from full stop to maximum speed (up to 6000 rpm).
second rotor parts and extra magnets for experiments with 2 and 4 magnet rotors.

lots of experimentation possibilities!

kit #15
this is our version of well known simple motor that provides the ability to do some experiments with it.

you may build one of four configurations with one or two magnets placed at the top, bottom, or on the sides.
experiment with 4 different voltages: 1.5, 3, 4.5 and 6 volts.
enough wire to experiment with different size wire coils.

kit #16
another version of simple motor with rotating coil in the magnetic field designed for these experiments:

compare regular grade ceramic magnet with strong neodymium magnet (grade n50).
easily change the distance between the magnet and the coil.
make different size wire coils.

no messy glue. no tools required.

rpm measurement tools
simple inexpensive attachment for measuring the speed of any conventional motor where the wire coil rotates in the static magnetic field.
highly recommended for groups of students – they love to compare their motors!
connects to frequency meter; if you do not have one you may consider rpm measurement kit #2.

all-in-one kits #8 and #9
all-in-one kits include all parts required for assembly of 4 brushless motors:

simple reed switch motor
reed switch motor with transistor
motor on a hall effect ic
motor with optical control.

with easier kit #8 you can build one motor at a time.
kit #9 (shown above) allows for easy switching between different motor configurations. it is an advanced kit.

simple generator kit
most electric motors built from our kits are powerful enough to rotate precision industrial motor which can generate enough power to light up a super bright led.
adding a simple generator to your motor is the best way to demonstrate how electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy, and then back to electrical power.
it is also a helpful tool to measure and calculate torque and efficiency of your motor.

solar panel kit
if you are looking for a renewable energy project – solar power module is a perfect addition to your motor kit!
this powerful 1.6 w solar panel could be added to motor kits #1-9, 13-14.
it provides enough power for the motors to work under direct sunlight. solar panel can also recharge the batteries.
this kit adds a main power switch.

motor speed measurement
advanced multimeter and assembled attachment for real time motor speed measurement.
it works on all brushless motors available at our site.
the rpm measurement tool is based on frequency measurement. if you already have a multimeter that can measure the frequency in hz you might be interested in inexpensive standalone rpm measurement attachment.
