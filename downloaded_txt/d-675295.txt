finding their furever home
































































welcome










our dogs are strays and shelter dogs.many of the collies that come into our facility are owner turn ins due to loss of family member or illness, or just a change in living arrangements. the dog is often the one that has to sacrifice his place in the family when these unforseen changes come about, so it is the teamwork of the volunteers to see to the rehoming of, and continuing the quality of life for the collie.
