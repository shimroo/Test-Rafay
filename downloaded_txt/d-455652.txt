2-oct-2024in celebration of my favorite old-timey website fark celebrating its 25th anniversary, i added ruffle's flash emulator to the farkman episodes hosted here for posterity. in other words, you can once again watch old flash stuff, possibly while reminiscing about ytmnd, sports by brooks girls, or even happy tree friends.
				





22-apr-2024damn, $150/year sunk into webhosting for this old site, just so i can post updates 2 or 3 times a year. whatever! this one's a fun one! announcing dave's drawings! you'll find characters from rab, barfman, dux, sci-fi guys, and pretty much anything else i've ever drawn or animated! link just goes to the facebook page for now; maybe there'll be a dedicated website down the road.
				





23-jul-2023hello! it's been a while since my last post, but it's also been twelve years since my last short film! i believe that's long enough. go check out a new film i created called "cats against humanity". just in time for the twentieth anniversary of a certain animated series.
				





8-jul-2022it's been over three years since i've drawn up a new packrat comic! there's a brand new oberheim synthesizer comic out, and it'll be the first new bit of gear that i buy myself in eons. my inner packrat is resurfacing, so why not include the comic?
				





10-may-2022here's a long-overdue update about my latest music project... octokong! parallax appreciators are sure to enjoy this extremely synthy original band. please follow the band on facebook and youtube, and check out a live youtube performance of one of our originals, "all new us"!






12-feb-2022something i've been doing for a couple years now is creating insanely complex, hand-cut paper snowflakes called artflakes. i have dozens of them up on my relatively new ig page called atelier artflake. i also have an etsy shop where you can purchase some of the larger ones.
				





11-feb-2022hello, strangers! today i have updated the rps-101 page to include a link to a basic, playable version of the game online.
				





31-may-2021today is my brother's birthday! it's also the birthday of the one and only sam kass, the original creator of rock paper scissors spock lizard. so in their honor, today i created rps-5: the birthday edition!






1-mar-2021my novel beelzebuds is officially released today. whew! only took seven years! there are only 225 first editions, all hand-signed and numbered, and i don't plan on getting rid of every single one. so grab yours now... it's sure to be the bitcoin of books before too long.
				





3-dec-2020i wrote a novel! it comes out march 1, 2021! fans of my drawings, such as the packrat, and especially the book of beings, might like to see what kind of writer i am when i set out in earnest to create a 1980s fantasy/comedy! granted, it took six years to finish! this book is just under 300 pages, and includes a couple dozen woodcut-style illustrations. it should appeal to fans of things like good omens and stranger things. pre-order your copy right here on the beelzebuds page!
				





11-aug-2020today i updated my car history to include my sixteenth car! at this point, it should've probably been a hearse, considering what happened to car #15! hint: it was on a friday the 13th...
				





6-apr-2020today, for the 17th anniversary of rab, and since i'm stuck at home during a global pandemic, i decided it was time to get back into drawing anything napkins again! now you can have a custom drawing of absolutely anything, drawn on a virtual napkin and emailed to you personally, along with being posted on the facebook page!
