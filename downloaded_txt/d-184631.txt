museums of history
we invite you to step back in time and explore our two museums. located in the heart of grovewood village, the biltmore industries homespun museum traces the history of a force in american craft and textiles founded by biltmore’s first lady, edith vanderbilt, and two inspired teachers. learn how this little cottage industry (relocated to this site in 1917) grew to become one of the largest producers of handwoven wool in the world – worn by u.s. presidents, first ladies and many american icons.

our other museum showcases a collection of vintage automobiles dating from the romance-filled days of wooden steering wheels and polished brass headlamps. these antique beauties were owned by local legend harry d. blomberg, who purchased biltmore industries in 1953 and saved it from going under. after downsizing the business, the industries’ weaving shed was eventually transformed into a car museum to shelter harry’s prized collection of vehicles.

“grovewood village is asheville’s hidden gem. the grounds are beautiful beneath the shade of mature pine trees, inviting you to pause, take a deep breath, and soak in the views and the historic heritage of asheville. to miss this is to miss what first made asheville the ‘arts and crafts capitol of the south.’ ”
—  bruce johnson, author of built for the ages: a history of the grove park inn
