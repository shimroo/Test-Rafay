			we want jordan beauty tours to be your favorite travel partner



                       
					     
					one day tour from amman to jerusalem:
					
					early in the morning transfer from amman to allenby bridge 
					and there is also a possibility to take a short dip in its 
					very unique healthy water in the dead sea. then we ascend to 
					the holy city, jerusalem. we start with a panoramic view 
					from the mount of olives – a good place for an introduction 
					to the city and its history. then we visit the holy sites of 
					the three monotheistic religions, represented in jerusalem: 
					we start with the wailing wall, which represents the last 
					remnants of the jewish temple, destroyed by the romans. 
					usually you can see the various types of jews who come to 
					worship at this holy place. if open to visitors, we ascend 
					to the temple mount, where we can take a look at the famous 
					dome of the rock. then we continue through the arab market 
					("suq") to the "via dolorosa", jesus' "way of suffering", 
					which leads us to the church of the holy sepulture, where 
					according to the christian tradition jesus was crucified and 
					buried. evening back to amman.


					incentive travel


jordan beauty is 
					ready to create a custom incentive program to match your 
					motivational goals. in addition to arranging all aspects of 
					incentive travel itself, we offer clients assistance in 
					designing incentive program criteria so that participants 
					achieve the corporate objectives desired. after all, the 
					ultimate goal of any incentive program is to create 
					qualitative or quantitative results. while the goal of most 
					programs is to increase overall sales, we can also help you 
					create a program that targets improving market share, 
					raising customer satisfaction scores.
