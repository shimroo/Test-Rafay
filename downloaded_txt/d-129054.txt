award categories



uk technology fast 50
a ranking of the ukâs 50 fastest-growing technology businesses, based on percentage revenue growth over the last four years.



women in leadership
recognises companies within the technology fast 50 ranking that are either led by a female* ceo or have a founding team comprised of at least 50% women.* the terms âwomenâ and âfemaleâ are taken to include all those who self-identify as women or female and engage with their current colleagues/company as such.



cleantech
recognises climate technology companies within the technology fast 50 ranking for their contribution to the ukâs net zero target.



regional winners 
the fastest growing companies within each region of the uk. 'region' is determined based on where your head office is located. view the definition of regions here



rising stars
each year deloitte and our programme sponsors nominate rising stars. this award recognises the innovation and achievements of uk tech businesses who are leading the way, but arenât yet eligible for the technology fast 50. this may be because they havenât been operating for four years, or their year 1 revenue doesnât meet the eligibility threshold. learn more about the eligibility criteria here.










you only need to submit one nomination form. depending on your eligibility, you will be automatically considered for four tech award categories: uk technology fast 50, women in leadership, regional winners and cleantech.
