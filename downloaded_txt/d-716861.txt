american made quality 



there are many different stoves and tents available today, but we feel that our products surpass those of our competitors because of our unrivaled quality. our products are hand built here in the united states, not imported from overseas like some of our competitors products are. in this industry, if the product isn’t built in america, then it probably isn’t worth having.

                                        i've been using a cylinder stove for over 20 years now during my guided hunts, they have never let me down.  highly recommended stove for anyone who is looking for something extremely reliable.

                                        thank you cylinder stoves! i needed a new wall tent for my elk hunt last fall and after doing a bit of research i came across these guys and boy do they really know their stuff. they set me up with a sweet 15x21 camp package that made all the guys in my hunting group jealous.

                                        we like to keep at least a couple cylinder stoves on hand for our customers use during our fall camping events.  we have used a lot of different camp products over the years, but i can honestly say that when it comes to heating a tent, you'd be hard pressed to find something as sturdy and efficient as a good cylinder stove.
