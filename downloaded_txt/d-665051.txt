testimonials




“your service, your kind and comforting words and your patience and empathy were more than i ever expected humanly possible. angela, my sister agrees. (she said that she’s spoken to you three times already!) on behalf of our wonderful father, we want to thank you and let you know that you are our ‘angel’.your company has filled a void that leaves our most precious loved ones in limbo. so, for that i can only say, ‘thank you, thank you, thank you!’”

— barb camilleri-mcmanus




“from the moment i spoke to you you really listen to my needs and concerns and helped me to identify exactly what my father needed as you spoke from personal experience. you helped me to find the right place that would meet all of my father’s needs and it was located just around the corner from my home which was a huge factor for both my father and i. the moment i walked into the facility and met the staff i knew my dad would be in caring hands.”

— d.k. sanchez
