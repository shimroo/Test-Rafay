do you share transport when you play your sport?
sport can involve a lot of travel. it can also involve sharing transport to and from venues. would you be properly insured for this though?
the easy way to lose your driving licence
just before the last covid lockdown three friends of mine drove from manchester over to leeds for a pub football match. john (not his real name) provided the transport. the match was a draw, ther weather was awful, but both teams retired to a local pub for a beer or two. luckily (he thought) one of john's passengers was a teetotaller and he offered to drive back. john naturally assumed his driver was insured and one day car insurance was the last thing on his mind.
just before they reached the m62 the driver had a problem with the gears - he was used to driving a manual car after all. an officer in a nearby police car pulled them over into a slip road, checked the driver's documents - then discovered that he wasn't insured after all. he did have insurance to cover his own car but he had assumed that his policy covered him to drive any vehicle that didn't belong to him - it didn't.
there was some discussion about impounding the car amongst the police officers and since everyone else in the car had had a few drinks this is exactly what happened. a truck came to collect it and at least they gave the occupants of the car a lift to a bus stop. it was several hours before they all got home via a mixture of bus and train.
the driver received a â£500 fine and six penalty points on his licence. john received the same - allowing someone to drive your car whilst uninsured is as serious as doing that yourself. john however had already had two speeding convictions so his points tally meant he was banned from driving for six months. it also cost him â£150 plus a day off work to arrange for his car to be released at elland road police station.
in a way he was lucky. one of the police officers wanted to charge him for being drunk in charge of a vehicle. he did after all own it and the driver he nominated was uninsured so was he in charge of it or not? the prosecuter decided not to proceed with that charge luckily.
the moral is clear. before taking the wheel of any car, or allowing anyone else to drive yours, make sure that proper car insurance is in place. you can buy it for as little as one single day, or for longer periods try this short term car insurance company.
even if someone driving someone else's car is insured to drive any other vehicle not belonging to that person the cover is invariably third party only. this means that although the minimum legal requirements have been met the insurance company would not pay anything out for the car itself if was damaged and the driver was held to blame, or if it was stolen. losing or wrecking a mate's car, and being unable to pay for it, is a good way to destroy a friendship completely. on the other hand a short term car insurance policy is usually comprehensive which gives a huge safety net.
is short term car insurance dear?
not really. the insurance market is very competitive - and the small premium is far less than the potential expenses, fines and stress that driving without insurance, even accidentally, can cause.
