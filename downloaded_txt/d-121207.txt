first icecube search for heavy neutral leptonsby alisa king-klemperer | 14 feb, 25 | research | neutrinos are tiny, nearly massless particles that traverse long distances across the universe, interacting with matter only through the weak force. during their journey through the atmosphere and earth, they can transform, or “oscillate” from one “flavor”—electron, muon, and tau—to another. this phenomenon has led scientists to conclude that neutrinos [...]read more »









icecube search for extremely high-energy neutrinos contributes to understanding of cosmic raysby alisa king-klemperer | 12 feb, 25 | research | neutrinos are chargeless, weakly interacting particles that are able to travel undeflected through the cosmos. the icecube neutrino observatory at the south pole searches for the sources of these astrophysical neutrinos in order to understand the origin of high-energy particles called cosmic rays and, therefore, how the universe works.  icecube [...]read more »









week 5 at the poleby jean demerit | 14 feb, 25 | life at the pole | a white rainbow? well, yes—it’s also called a fogbow! fogbows are rarer than rainbows, and guess what—they’re sometimes referred to as “ghost rainbows.” sound familiar? more and more summer personnel were leaving the pole last week, as final touches were put in place to winterize icecube upgrade equipment.
