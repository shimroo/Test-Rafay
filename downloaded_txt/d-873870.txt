nhwp has brought me new friendships, new ideas, new opportunities, and best of all - a supportive community of fellow writers.









 

wkxl





 
as a radio talk show host my goal is to accentuate the many positive people and organizations we have in this amazing state. 
in a recent interview i conducted on wkxl my guest,laura knoy, mentioned the new hampshire writers’ project and its’ chair, masheri chappelle. 
shortly thereafter, masheri joined me for a fascinating hour which further opened my eyes to the quantity and, more importantly,
the quality of the writing community that we have here in the granite state.
