welcome to the association of seventh-day adventist librarians (asdal).  asdal is an organization for individuals interested in seventh-day adventist librarianship.  the association was formed to enhance communication between seventh-day adventist librarians and to serve as a forum for discussion of mutual problems and professional concerns of seventh-day adventist librarians.
the association holds an annual conference, publishes asdal action, awards the d. glenn hilts scholarship, and is a sponsor of the journal of adventist libraries and archives and the seventh-day adventist periodical and obituary index. the adventist library information cooperative (alice) is a service provided by the association to provide member libraries with enhanced database access opportunities at reduced costs through collective efforts and resource sharing within the cooperative.
