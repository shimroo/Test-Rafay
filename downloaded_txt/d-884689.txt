handmade tradition
at ryba’s fudge shops, the art of handcrafting creamy, delectable fudge transforms into a delightful public spectacle. here, delicious new flavors are born, filling the air with the irresistible scent of freshly made fudge, drawing in visitors from near and far. fondly referred to as ‘fudgies,’ tourists eagerly gather to indulge in ryba’s signature treats in the iconic pink box. our grandfather, harry ryba, was known as the “fudge king” of mackinac island, a legacy passed on to our father, victor callewaert, who in turn taught us. today, as we prepare the next generation to continue our family tradition, every moment spent at ryba’s promises to be a sweetly unforgettable experience, ensuring that our legacy of crafting the creamiest fudge on mackinac island lives on.
