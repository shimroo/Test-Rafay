fun! 















spaamfaa is a diverse organization of firefighting enthusiasts who share a passion for new and antique fire apparatus, and the history and traditions of the fire service.  members include: men and women; children and adults; firefighters, retired firefighters, never-been firefighters, and wanna-be firefighters (fire explorers).  we have photographers, collectors, historians, and fire buffs.  some members own antique fire apparatus, while many others do not.  some document fires and fire apparatus though photography, while still others collect books, patches, toys and models, and all manner of fire fighting memorabilia.  you do not need to own an antique fire truck to join.  anyone with an appreciation for, (or preservation of), the fire service is welcome. 
first established in syracuse new york in 1958, the organization is still based primarily in the united states and canada, but it has grown to encompass fifty local chapters, and boasts more than twenty-four hundred members living around the globe. 















local vs. national 



the spaamfaa organization consists of both individual local chapters and as an overall national (international) organization.
members may choose to join a local chapter, several different local chapters, and/or the national organization as a whole.  joining spaamfaa national does not include membership in a local chapter, and membership in a local chapter does not include membership in spaamfaa.  each option provides different benefits.
local chapters (found in most major metropolitan areas) are the vanguard.  they provide face-to-face (and often hands-on) support and organizational resources for fire apparatus enthusiasts living and working in a given geographic area.  most local chapters organize regular meetings and host special events, and their members are also often more focused on documenting fire service and fire apparatus history on a local level.     
the spaamfaa “national” organization, provides an exceptional organizational network and resources to support the “local chapters.”  they also provide an array of benefits and resources above-and-beyond those which are provided by most local chapters, and are also an outlet for those members not living in or near a local chapter.
