"this program is life changing for families at a time when they desperately need it."



 

parents from toddler program
designation











 

the program offered was unmatched with 1:1 ratios, its level of educated staff, in-home sessions and a fun facility. as parents learning how to support [our son] and how to navigate the system we felt such a sense of support. everyone was so invested in [our son’s] growth and development it made it easy to tackle the next challenge.



 

parents of eip child












 

our son was with sass for 9 plus years. from the first day we walked through the door, we knew we were in the right place. they truly understood autism.[…] his needs were met with caring and compassion. the therapists identified and helped him with skills he required, including toilet training. i can’t thank them enough for that! decisions regarding scott were joint efforts between our family and sass. the lines of communication were always open. he was always treated with respect, as were we.[…] we will always be grateful for the support for scott and our family.
