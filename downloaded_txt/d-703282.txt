 if you're upcoming party is in long island, nyc, ct or nj and you're thinking of entertainment ideas, my caricature style is complimentary and fun with the just the right amount of exaggeration. your guests will love them and most likely frame them to hang on their walls, they are kind of like cartoon portraits, once the cartoon bodies and backgrounds are added.


the two caricatures above used pre-drawn backgrounds that i take with me (i mention more about those below the "empire state building - king kong" scene pictured below). note the logo sticker on the star trek couple, that was during a corporate bbq, they supplies the stickers which i inserted where ever they fit best.

this statue of liberty background is another pre-drawn one. i'll sometimes draw people on the island, this time i surprised the kids by making them into balloons.
it's funny how people get tongue tied when trying to pronounce and spell caricature, lots of times they'll end up asking if i'm a character artist, a live party sketch artist, the cartoon artist for parties, a cartoon drawer for hire, sketch artist for hire or a quick sketch portrait artist. whatever you call it, your guests, clients and friends will love this special fine art illustration experience which is fun and only takes a few minutes.

at parties like communions, christenings, first birthdays and bar/bat mitzvahs when the kids are done theirs usually a number of adults want their caricatures drawn too. book my unique entertainment service for your next great event.



for this caricature drawn during a spring carnival for a health care company in queens ny (similar to drawing at company picnics) i used one of my pre-drawn backgrounds. i take a large selection of pre-printed caricature backgrounds for both kids and adult parties with me. they come in handy to speed things up while i'm drawing caricatures at parties where it's usually noisy with lots of people around. i have a bunch of small cartoon scenes on a board that people can pick from or they tell me what they have in mind, it gets them thinking before they sit down. not many artists go through the trouble of taking pre-print scenes with them, i can make up custom party themed backgrounds also.
the kid in the caricature to the left wanted to be in a plane, i surprised him with this picture. instead of coming up with something from scratch i pulled out this background which is just the empire state building and part of king kongs face. these cartoon backgrounds can be customized so that they won't always be the same. i usually draw king kong holding a man, woman or a couple, this was a first for me. caricaturists drawing party cartoons, for kids and adults.

this is from a thank you letter i received after drawing caricatures at a local long island high school graduation party. (june 2017)
"my husband richard and i just wanted to thank you again for such an amazing time. my guest raved about you and your awesome talent! your professionalism and warm presence really made everyone feel comfortable and enjoyed themselves. thank you again. i will definitely be seeing you again at one of my many other events, i'm sure i will be hosting."- take care, thank you joanna(some clowning around with caricatures :o)

looking for ideas to entertain party guests, here's a caricaturist for hire!

i arrive early and find a place where people can watch over my shoulder. it's just as entertaining for those watching as for those being drawn, it even adds to their suspense.


this picture is still on my drawing board before i gave it to the couple. they loved it and i had to "shhhh" the people around me so it would be a surprise when they saw it. the pinch was on the spot, i  thought would be fun after seeing his expression.


this is my basic setup, i only need three chairs (i take my own table) and somewhere not too far from an outlet in case i need my light. i'm pictured here during a backyard wedding. on either side of my table i have boards showing the pre-drawn backgrounds i take with me, on the side by me are the 11x14" backgrounds, i also have blank sheets to make things up on the spot.
