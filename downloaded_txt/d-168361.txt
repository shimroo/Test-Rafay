academics













“[lee] has prepared me to excel in business, politics, journalism, and community leadership. professors emphasize real-world application and critical thinking beyond the classroom. events like geico, cox contenders, ndcc, and nevada gold mines helped me apply concepts to real challenges. the focus on teamwork and results shaped my growth as a campus leader and laid a strong foundation for my career.”
