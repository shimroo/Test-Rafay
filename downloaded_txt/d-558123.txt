we would like to acknowledge and respect that that we are publishing from tiohtià:ke, the mohawk name for a historic place for gathering and trade for many first nations. it is unceded traditional indigenous territory, where the lands and people have a history and legacy that is long and deep, and on which there have now been non-indigenous settlers for more than 375 years. it has been home to many indigenous people from across turtle island, as are the many traditional territories in which all canadian publishers work and live. as publishers we know we cannot re-write our history but we can be part of a concerted effort to contribute to reconciliation between indigenous peoples and settlers—we have a special role to play in that process.


véhicule press acknowledges the generous support of its publishing program from the book publishing industry development program of the department of canadian heritage, the canada council for the arts, and the société de développement des entreprises culturelles du québec (sodec).
