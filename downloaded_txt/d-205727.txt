"hi tom, just a note to say thanks for the rush order, zeke arrived with plenty of time to put him together.  k was a little shy about rocking at first because zeke really rocks!!   but once she got into to it she was unstoppable.  she really loves him and he will be a great family treasure for all of us.  thanks again" - susan, new york
