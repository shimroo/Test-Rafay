our mission
the arizona music & entertainment hall of fame has been created to recognize and honor the contributions of musicians, entertainers, venues and individuals who have had a significant impact on the evolution and development of the musical and entertainment culture in the state of arizona and to educate the public about these accomplishments.
in the fall of 2002 a like-minded group of individuals formed the arizona music & entertainment hall of fame. all non-profit incorporation papers were developed, a board was formed, officers elected and two deserving individuals were inducted into the newly formed arizona music & entertainment hall of fame. our first inductees were wayne newton on december 8, 2002 and alice cooper on december 19, 2002.





inspiring the future by remembering the past.
