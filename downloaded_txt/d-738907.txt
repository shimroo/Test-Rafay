        story 

"a 
          mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its 
          old dimensions."    
~

"as part of 
        the wellness program instituted for the firefighters, i had the opportunity 
        to coach with jackie. at first, i didn't know much about coaching but 
        decided to try it as a way to learn more about diet, exercise and stress 
        management. 
after coaching 
        with jackie for 7 months, i not only achieved my physical health goals 
        but also learned new techniques and disciplines that improved me as a 
        person both at work and at home. 
i recommend coaching 
        as part of a wellness program for any employer, but especially emergency 
        services. offering opportunities such as this makes employees feel valued 
        and gives them techniques to deal with the extra stress of work. 
coaching enabled 
        me to be more patient, mindful and observant. this allowed me to become 
        a more focused, efficient firefighter; a better person for my family; 
        and have more fun!
i also highly recommend 
        jackie as a coach and wellness consultant. along with being a committed, 
        caring and intuitive person, she is very professional and knowledgeable, 
        making her an excellent choice as a coach, speaker and consultant to create 
        a motivating and healthy workplace."
