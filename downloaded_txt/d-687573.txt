for over 20 years, the city of doral has been home to anta's fitness and self defense, the longest running martial arts center in doral since 1998. like many of you long-time residents, my sons took classes from julioanta as did i. besides self-defense and fitness, so many have learned humility, respect, self discipline, and self confidence! julio and his wife elena are open for business! learn more today! doral councilman oscar puigour studentslove our classesupon my arrival at the u.s. as a sophomore in high school, i decided to indulge myself in the world of martial arts. as i left everything behind in venezuela, my confidence and physical well being were deteriorating. i was too shy to approach anybody and meet new people; i developed insanely lazy habits and started to grow fatigued with the most simple of activities as a 16 year old. my grades in school started to drop along with my drive to get out of my room to do anything. however, i came across the place that would change all that and improve all those characteristics that were a liability to my wellbeing. anta's fitness and self defense was the place that would change me for the better. their muay thai classes and fitness program improved my fat percentage, increased my muscle mass, and got rid of the lazy, detrimental habits. anta's has given me confidence, perseverance, and discipline to succeed in anything i strive for. my grades in high school skyrocketed, i was president of the national honors society and class representative in the student council in which i hosted various events such as blood drives, food drives, and many more donatives. i am currently a freshman in college majoring in biological sciences as part of the pre-medical program. moreover, my goal is to get my m.d. in boston university and become a cardio thoracic surgeon, and i thank anta's for all the opportunities they have opened up for me.carlos langas parents, we wanted our daughter to have the proper tools and knowledge to be able to defend herself in a dangerous situation.  i think we always knew that madison was going to be in some kind of martial arts program; however, we did not imagine just how amazing her experience would be.
madison started at anta’s fitness and self defense when she was just a few weeks shy of turning 4 years old.  we still remember her first trial class, she was part of a group called little ninjas and during her first class madison kept smiling, laughing and she was just having an amazing time.
over the years, that “little ninja” has turned into an amazing martial artist who loves kung fu and has true passion and dedication for her sport.  
presently, with the help of mr. anta and mr. arcia, madison’s determination and strong spirit continues to grow.  they aid in building character and strength, with a great deal of focus on discipline and respect toward others.  our daughter has learned how to be socially confident and has an impressive drive and determination towards all aspects of her life.  thanks to her experience with mr. anta’s academy, madison excels in school and with outside activities.   she even had the chance to participate in a statewide martial arts tournament placing 1st in open hand/traditional forms.  all of these experiences are helping us in shaping an amazing human being with determination, drive and respect.  both her instructors have been a significant component of everything it takes to shape a confident, humble and loving human being.madison barios momsee morecheck out
