journal de deuil d’un enfant
baby’s breath serves and advocates on behalf of canadian families who have experienced the tragic loss of an infant
for over 50 years, baby’s breath has been canada’s only national foundation focused on sids, and more recently also dedicated to supporting families and encouraging research aimed at reducing all sudden and unexpected infant deaths including stillbirths. the death of an infant is devastating not only for the parents, but for the entire family. siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins and friends are all affected by the sudden death of a baby. baby’s breath believes no one should endure the grief of such loss alone. our foundation and volunteers are here to help.

**baby’s breath canada acknowledges the land on which we work is the traditional territory of the haudenosaunee and anishinaabe peoples, many of whom continue to live and work here today. this territory is covered by the upper canada treaties and is within the land protected by the dish with one spoon wampum agreement. today this gathering place is home to many first nations, métis, and inuit peoples and acknowledging reminds us that our great standard of living is directly related to the resources and friendship of indigenous peoples.
