welcome!
the leibniz institute for astrophysics potsdam (aip) is dedicated to astrophysical questions ranging from the exploration of our sun to the evolution of the cosmos. it focuses on the study of stellar, solar and exoplanetary physics, extragalactic astrophysics and the development of research technologies in the fields of spectroscopy, robotic telescopes and e-science.

observation evening on 14th february, 7pm

everyone is welcome to the observation evening in the large refractor on the telegrafenberg in potsdam! if observations won't be possible due to the weather conditions, visitors can still admire the fourth largest refracting telescope in the world and will receive a short demonstration of the telescope with explanations.

last starlight for ground-breaking gaia

the european space agency’s milky way-mapper gaia has completed the sky-scanning phase of its mission, racking up more than three trillion observations over the last decade to revolutionise the view of our home galaxy and cosmic neighbourhood.

unveiling the uncharted milky way: completing the galactic stellar map

by peering into the cosmic dance of stars, a team led by researchers from the leibniz institute for astrophysics potsdam (aip) has unravelled the complex structure of our milky way galaxy. assuming that each observed star represents a larger population of stars sharing the same orbit, they have reconstructed the properties of these “hidden” stars, filling in gaps in the galactic disc that holds the secrets of our galaxy's past, present, and future.

a star’s surface revealed: 16-year study shows chaotic dynamo

the stella observatory in tenerife studied a star’s surface for 16 years. unlike the cyclic spots on our sun, this star exhibited chaotic, non-periodic star spot behavior, revealing a fundamentally different dynamo mechanism. the groundbreaking study has now been published in nature communications.

have you heard?



 

                  
                    the leibniz institute for astrophysics potsdam (aip) has suspended communication 
                    on its x account (formerly twitter). the decision reflects concerns about the 
                    current direction of the platform, which is seen as inconsistent with our values 
                    like openness, scientific integrity, transparency and democratic discourse. 
                    aip will continue to share news via its website and other social media platforms, 
                    such as mastodon and bluesky.

abstract: the field of planet formation is in an exciting era, where recent observations of disks around protostars have revealed a diversity of substructures, some possibly planet related. it is therefore important to understand the physical and chemical nature of the protoplanetary building blocks, as well as their spatial distribution, to better understand planet formation. each one of the fundamental disk properties – disk mass, surface density distribution, outer radius, vertical extent, temperature structure, and transport – is of fundamental interest as they collectively set the stage for disk evolution and corresponding planet formation theories. furthermore, constraining and comparing the chemistry of disks to the compositions of exoplanet atmospheres – a major priority for current space missions – informs our understanding of the planet-formation process. in this talk i will review our understanding of the fundamental properties of disks including the relevant observational techniques to probe their nature, modeling methods, and the respective caveats. finally, i will present preliminary findings from the alma large program deco (the disk-exoplanet c/onnection).
