vice presidentâs message
greetings everyone.  
i trust everyone had a great thanksgiving! i 
would guess everyone is finishing up their 
breeding season for spring lambing.   winter is 
starting to show up here in the south with 
temperatures dropping into the lower 30's, at 
least hurricane season is over with. 
our field day that was held in lake charles, la., 
in october was successful.  the highlight, of the 
event in my opinion, was a demonstration of a 
liver biopsy on a standing ewe.  the purpose of 
the live liver biopsy is to determine copper 
levels on the farm in real time instead of having 
to sacrifice an animal everytime copper levels 
are needed.
our annual gathering is set for may 30th and 
31st 2025, in new albany, ms. we will begin 
finalizing items for the event after the first of 
the year. i feel we have a great lineup of 
speakers for the event. i hope everyone will 
save the date and many of you will be able to 
attend our meeting.  i hope each of you have a 
safe and blessed holiday season.
