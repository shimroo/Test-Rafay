word builds

                while watching my pre-school great-grandson build a
                startlingly complicated rocket ship out of little lego parts, i was struck by
                the approach: lots of small pieces, together with very detailed instructions
                – in this case in the form of step-by-step pictures. word builds consists of
                45 word exercises based on a variation of that lego approach: the
                construction of long, complicated words out of many small parts and
                several kinds of clues. word builds are meant to help in the teaching of
                spelling and vocabulary and thus of reading and writing and to replace, or
                at least supplement, what has become – especially in the teaching of
                spelling and vocabulary – little more than rote memorization of short
                weekly word lists. (june, 2019)

lineages from indo-european roots
upgraded in november, 2019
interactive maps of the lines of descent, or lineages, from 52 indo-european roots. the maps show modern english bases, affixes, and words that descend from each root. the bases and affixes are drawn from the explications in the lexis database. the words are drawn from the lexis and the commonwords databases. the venue also presents a map of the indo-european family of languages, the short essay "why study indo-european roots?", and a datatable that allows users to search for (i) all of the words in lexis that descend from a given root, and (ii) the root from which a given word descends.

word maps

                word maps extend the lego principle introduced in word builds. here is a sample from the student's version of the word map for words that contain the bases aster, astr, astra, and astro "star":
                


                students' version
            

                the students' job is to follow the clues and instructions in the green, yellow, and pink topics to construct the words that fit into the light blue topics. thus they have a chance to think their way to the word, gradually and systematically.
            

                the maps — and the class discussion of them — encourage learning that
                emphasizes the synthesis of parts and procedures into words as the
                students work their way out along a map's branches.  and the class
                discussion encourages the synthesis of the bits of knowledge individual
                students bring to the discussion with the bits brought by their classmates,
                their teacher, and the map. the maps also encourage an emphasis on
                pattern and predictability in a subject that can seem to be filled with
                disorder and arbitrariness, two lethal enemies of deep and lasting learning.
            

                as they work with the maps, students are encouraged to see patterns in
                meanings, in structure, in history. they are encouraged to see their
                language as something alive and changing. as they think and talk about
                the earlier meaning of the words and by adding up the meanings of the
                words' parts, they are also pondering the changes in meaning that got the
                words where they are today, which can — and should — encourage some
                sleuthing with a good dictionary.
