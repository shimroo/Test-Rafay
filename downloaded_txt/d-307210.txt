james
allen

(1864-1912)


an
unrewarded genius













james allen is a
literary mystery
man. his inspirational writings have influenced millions for good. yet
today he remains almost unknown...... none of his nineteen books give a
clue to his life other than to mention his place of residence -
ilfracombe,
england. his name cannot be found in a major reference work. not even
the
library of congress or the british museum has much to say about him.
who was this man who
believed in the power of
thought
to bring fame, fortune and happiness? or did he, as henry david thoreau
says, hear a different drummer?...... james allen never gained fame or
fortune. that much is true. his was a quiet, unrewarded genius. he
seldom
made enough money from his writings to cover expenses.
allen was born in
leicester, central england,
november
28, 1864. the family business failed within a few years, and in 1879
his
father left for america in an effort to recoup his losses. the elder
allen
had hoped to settle in the united states, but was robbed and murdered
before
he could send for his family.
the financial crisis that
resulted forced
james to leave
school at fifteen. he eventually became a private secretary, a position
that would be called administrative assistant today. he worked in this
capacity for several british manufacturers until 1902, when he decided
to devote all his time to writing.
unfortunately, allen's
literary career was
short, lasting
only nine years, until his death in 1912. during that period he wrote
nineteen
books, a rich outpouring of ideas that have lived on to inspire later
generations.
soon after finishing his
first book, from
poverty to power, allen moved to ilfracombe, on england's
southwest coast.
the little
resort
town with its seafront victorian hotels and its rolling hills and
winding
lanes offered him the quiet atmosphere he needed to pursue his
philosophical
studies.
as a man
thinketh was allen's second book.
despite its
subsequent popularity he was dissatisfied with it. even though it was
his
most concise and eloquent work, the book that best embodied his
thought,
he somehow failed to recognize its value. his wife lily had to persuade
him to publish it.
james allen strove to live
the ideal life
described by
russia¹s great novelist and mystic count leo tolstoy - the
life of
voluntary poverty, manual labor and ascetic self-discipline. like
tolstoy,
allen sought to improve himself, be happy, and master all of the
virtues.
his search for felicity for man on earth was typically tolstoyan.
his day in ilfracombe began
with a predawn
walk up to
the cairn, a stony spot on the hillside overlooking his home and the
sea.
he would remain there for an hour in meditation. then he would return
to
the house and spend the morning writing. the afternoons were devoted to
gardening, a pastime he enjoyed. his evenings were spent in
conversation
with those who were interested in his work.
a friend described allen as
a frail-looking
little man,
christ-like, with a mass of flowing black hair...... i think of him
especially
in the black velvet suit he always wore in the evenings, the friend
wrote.
he would talk quietly to a small group of us then - english, french,
austrian
and indian - of meditation, of philosophy, of tolstoy or buddha, and of
killing nothing, not even a mouse in the garden.
he overawed us all a little
because of his
appearance,
his gentle conversation, and especially because he went out to commune
with god on the hills before dawn.
james allen's philosophy
became possible when
liberal
protestantism discarded the stern dogma that man is sinful by nature.
it
substituted for that dogma an optimistic belief in man's innate
goodness
and divine rationality.
this reversal of doctrine
was, as william
james said,
the greatest revolution of the 19th century. it was part of a move
toward
a reconciliation of science and religion following darwin's publication
the origin of species.
charles darwin himself
hinted at the change in
belief
in the descent of man.
in
that book he wrote, the highest possible
stage
in moral culture is when we recognize that we ought to control our
thoughts.. 
allen's work embodies the
influence of
protestant liberalism
on the one hand and of buddhist thought on the other. for example, the
buddha teaches, all that we are is the result of what we have thought.
allen¹s biblical text says, as a man thinketh in his heart, so
is
he.
allen insists upon the
power of the individual
to form
his own character and to create his own happiness. thought and
character
are one, he says, and as character can only manifest and discover
itself
through environment and circumstance, the outer conditions of a
person's
life will always be found to be harmoniously related to his inner
state.
this does not mean that a man's circumstances at any given time are an
indication of his entire character, but that those circumstances are so
intimately connected with some vital thought element within him that,
for
the time being, they are indispensable to his development.
allen starts us thinking -
even when we would
rather be
doing something else. he tells us how thought leads to action. he shows
us how to turn our dreams into realities...... his is a philosophy that
has brought success to millions. it is the philosophy of norman vincent
peale's the power of
positive
thinking and of joshua liebman's peace of
mind.
we become spiritually rich,
allen writes, when
we discover
the adventure within; when we are conscious of the oneness of all life;
when we know the power of meditation; when we experience kinship with
nature.
allen's message is one of
hope even in the
midst of confusion.
yes, he says, humanity surges with uncontrolled passion, is tumultuous
with ungoverned grief, is blown about by anxiety and doubt. only the
wise
man, only he whose thoughts are controlled and purified, makes the
winds
and the storms of the soul obey him.
tempest-tossed souls, allen
continues,
wherever you may
be, under whatsoever conditions you may life, know this - in the ocean
of life the isles of blessedness are smiling and the sunny shore of
your
ideal awaits your coming.
and thus allen teaches two
essential truths:
today we
are where our thoughts have taken us, and we are the architects - for
better
or worse - of our futures. 
the works of james allen
are eminently
practical. he never
wrote theories, or for the sake of writing, or to add another to the
existing
books. according to his wife, allen wrote when he had a message, and it
became a message only when he had lived it in his own life, and knew
that
it was good. thus he wrote facts, which he had proven by practice.
