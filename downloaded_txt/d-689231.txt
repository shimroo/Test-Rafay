what is a standard?



standards are documents which provide best practice guidelines, recommendations, specifications, or requirements.
they are developed by industry experts who work together to ensure consistency, safety, quality, and compatibility across different products, services, and systems.
standards can apply internationally, nationally, or within specific industries. they are vital tools in helping governments, industries, organizations, and consumers to achieve their goals.
organizations of all sizes and sectors can benefit from standards, whether they are doing so to demonstrate best practice, or to ensure compliance with laws and industry regulations.


                                            find out why standards matter to organizations
                                        




what are the benefits of standards?



standards benefit organizations, industries, society, and individuals. by providing frameworks of best practice, they enhance the quality, safety, and reliability of products and services. standards also help products and systems work together seamlessly - which is essential in today's globally connected world.
they drive efficiency by streamlining processes, reducing waste, and minimizing errors. standards also foster innovation, providing a foundation for new technologies and helping organizations access new markets.
by demonstrating adherence to standards, organizations can build trust and credibility with customers and stakeholders, thereby strengthening their reputation and competitive edge.


                                            find out how standards can benefit smes
                                        




how are standards made?



standards are developed through a rigorous process involving collaboration among experts, industry stakeholders, and standards-developing organizations.
the process typically begins with identifying an issue that requires standardization. once consensus is reached by stakeholders on the scope and objectives of the standard, technical committees are formed to develop it.
throughout this process, there is extensive consultation to ensure that the standard reflects current best practices, technological advancements, and regulatory considerations.
once approved, the standard is then published for adoption and implementation by organizations who can benefit from its contents.





what is standard certification?



standard certification is when a third-party verifies that an organization, product, or service meets the requirements of a specific standard. this helps build trust with consumers and stakeholders, as well as provide credible proof of compliance.
however, it's important to note that not all standards have a certification scheme.
the real value of standards come from implementing their best practices across your organization. this implementation leads to benefits such as process improvements, enhanced efficiency, and cost savings.
for standards that do offer third-party certification, obtaining this can be evidence that your organization is committed to following best practice.





who uses standards?



standards are used by a diverse range of organisations across various industries worldwide. they help create consistency, innovation, and build trust across global markets.
organizations of all sizes use standards to enhance operational efficiency, maintain product quality, and comply with regulatory requirements.
industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, and construction rely on standards to keep processes consistent, ensure safety, and facilitate compatibility among different systems and products.
government agencies also adopt standards to develop policies, regulations, and codes that safeguard public health, ensure environmental sustainability, and promote fair trade practices.





how do i implement a standard?



implementing a standard typically involves several key steps to ensure processes, products, or services meet its guidelines.
these steps include checking where your organisation’s activities differ from the standard, creating a plan to meet the standard, training staff on the requirements, and setting up regular checks to make sure you stay on track and get the full benefits.
the time it takes to implement a standard can vary depending on its complexity and the size of your organization. however, it's important to maintain steady progress and not rush the process, as thorough approach will lead to long-term success.





what standard should i use?



with approximately 110,000 standards and related document available, choosing the right standards for your organization requires careful planning and research.
start by assessing your organization's objectives, customer requirements, and legal obligations to help you find the most appropriate standards to adopt, ensuring they align with your strategic goals.
this process can involve engaging with your key stakeholders to get different perspectives and foster a collaborative approach to standard selection.
it's also important to stay informed about industry trends and regulations that might impact your choice of standards.

impartiality is the governing principle of how bsi provides its services. impartiality means acting fairly and equitably in its dealings with people and in all business operations. it means decisions are made free from any engagements of influences which could affect the objectivity of decision making.as an accredited certification body, bsi assurance cannot offer certification to clients where they have also received consultancy from another part of the bsi group for the same management system. likewise, we do not offer consultancy to clients when they also seek certification to the same management system.the british standards institution (bsi, a company incorporated by royal charter), performs the national standards body (nsb) activity in the uk. bsi, together with its group companies, also offers a broad portfolio of business solutions other than nsb activity that help businesses worldwide to improve results through standards-based best practice (such as certification, self-assessment tool, software, product testing, information products and training).
