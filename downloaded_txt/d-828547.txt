intelliscan inc.elections+surveys





what we dosince 1991, intelliscan has provided election and survey services to assist organizations in gathering vital information.we offer development and implementation of online, print and telephone data collection systems. intelliscan works closely with our clients to develop the most cost efficient solution for each project's specific goals utilizing any combination of these technologies.we’re a small company with big experienceour competitors take pride in their large client bases. we take more pride in our experience. election and survey vendors serving thousands of organizations delegate tasks to large teams of employees to increase their efficiency. clients are left with inadequate customer service as no employee has a full grasp of the election or survey specifications. intelliscan’s clients are provided with direct contact to one account manager and one programmer who handle all of their election and survey needs. our smaller yet highly diversified client base of over 150 organizations receives unparalleled customer service to ensure a seamless election or survey process. many of our clients have remained with us for over ten years. please visit our elections and/or surveys pages to learn more about our services.
