companies lose your data and then nothing happens
data breaches are everywhere and consequences are ???
at this point, it’s hard not to imagine that at least some of your personal information isn’t for sale in some dark corner of the internet. after all, data breaches are happening constantly. companies suck up customers’ details and then, try as they might — and let’s assume they really try — declare that it’s been leaked or hacked. you know the drill; the subsequent breach announcement goes a little something like this: “oops!! we were the victims of a cyberattack, and by extension, so were you! it affected ??? people and we think ??? information was involved, but we’re still kind of guessing here at what happened. hopefully you have some sort of identity theft protection, which maybe we’re offering and maybe not. but regardless, love you! we’re family! please come back soon!”

the whole situation isn’t great.

high-profile data breaches have been in the headlines for years. in 2013, target lost the credit card, debit card, and other information of tens of millions of customers. in 2018, marriott disclosed a data breach that impacted up to 500 million people; in 2020, it got hit again. in 2021, hackers got a bunch of customer information from t-mobile that the company reportedly tried and failed to get back. the list of breaches goes on and on.

of course, these companies would surely rather not be dealing with these situations — data breaches cost firms millions of dollars and are often accompanied by reputational damage and sometimes fines. at the same time, that doesn’t mean the constant loss of consumer data is acceptable. sure, we live in the era of the internet, and some security risks are inevitable. but that shouldn’t mean that you have to throw your hands up and accept your data is safe, basically, nowhere. the targets and equifaxes of the world got hit with big fines, but they still get to exist — lucratively. and they’re still constantly sucking up and monetizing consumers’ personal information.

there’s a simple reason companies collect so much of our data — money — but why they get to collect so much, keep it, and monetize it is more complicated. there are some laws around data privacy and security, but they’re scattershot and generally handled state by state, and they could be better. companies keep screwing up with our data, and there are no good answers on what to do about it.

yahoo data breach is among the biggest in historyat least 500 million user accounts have been stolen from yahoo, the company confirmed on thursday.
the data breach is the largest from a single site in history, according to a database of other hacking incidents. in august, hackers were discovered trying to sell 200 million yahoo accounts, which would have been the second-largest single breach.
recode reported on thursday morning that the company was poised to confirm the compromised data and that it was even worse than originally believed. the data, which was stolen in late 2014 by what the company called a “state-sponsored actor,” may include names, emails, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords, and security questions and answers, but not financial information, according to the company.
russian hackers pulled off what seems like a much bigger haul of 1.2 billion users in 2014, but that data was stolen from hundreds of thousands of sites and combined into a single collection.

hutchinson community foundation suffers data breach

the hutchinson community foundation is making donors, vendors and other stakeholders aware of a data breach that might have compromised personal and financial information.
letters explaining the nature of the breach and the steps being taken to remedy the situation will be delivered to affected individuals this week, and donors and others with relationships with the community foundation are asked to be looking for this communication.
the breach came to the community foundation staff’s attention sept. 19 when ransomware was discovered on the foundation’s network server. ransomware encrypts files until a “ransom” is paid. fortunately, the foundation’s it service provider was able to restore all data from a backup and no ransom was paid; however, the security violation could have allowed hackers access to files and databases on the server.
“the hutchinson community foundation’s network was well-protected with data backup, and while staff also had confidence it was secure, you never know at what remote point of vulnerability a resourceful hacker might gain access,” said john montgomery, hutchinson community foundation board chairman. “it goes to show that no one is immune, including our charitable institutions.”
to help relieve concerns and restore confidence following this incident, the community foundation is providing identity monitoring at no cost to affected parties. the letter details the services and how to use them and also provides a call center phone number as a resource.
“we pride ourselves in our relationships with donors, service providers and others in the philanthropic community. confidentiality and discretion are at the core of our business ethic. though the likelihood of identity theft to affected people may be small, we are offering these protections out of an abundance of caution,” said aubrey abbott patterson, hutchinson community foundation president & ceo.
“we encourage everyone who receives a letter from us to use the id number provided to enroll in the identity monitoring services. we want our stakeholders to be assured we are taking action to safeguard them and to reinforce the security of our stored data from future cyber threats,” patterson said.
not all donor records stored in the community foundation’s database contained financial or other sensitive information. because those donors are not thought to be at any risk, they will not receive a letter of notification.

hackers who kicked xbox and playstation offline are selling their toolshackers who kicked xbox and playstation offline are selling their tools
data that helped hackers access sony’s internal network came from another group targeting the firm’s gaming network, reports the washington post. in an interview, a self-proclaimed lizard squad member said it had given stolen data to the guardians of peace.

editor : david jackman 







lizard squad, the group behind a cyber-attack that took xbox live and playstation network down on christmas day, are now offering the chance to do the same to anyone that will pay.
the attacks were apparently marketing for a tool called ‘lizard stresser’ — which is sold as a way of testing whether your own network could withstand a similar attack, but could just as easily be used to attack any other page.
similar tools have been offered across the shadier parts of the website for years, but lizard squad’s tool is unique in the spectacular way it has been marketed — and, if the group are to be believed, its power.
both the tool and lizard squad’s takedown of xbox live and playstation network used a distributed denial of service attack — using a network of computers to flood servers with requests, leaving them unable to handle them and shutting them down.
a message on the introduction page says that the tool is “famous for taking down gaming networks such as xbox live, playstation network, jagex, battlenet, league of legends, and many more!”
the tool’s terms of service stress that: “permission is granted to stress test dedicated servers and networks owned by you. this is the oppurtunity to make your firewalls better, not to misuse against the law.”
the terms also make clear that attacking anyone attacking websites that are not their own is banned by the use license, along with using the tool for personal gain and profit.
the site bans the use of virtual private networks, a tool that can hide a users’ location, and so makes it hard to stay anonymous while using the tool.
the group is selling eight packages, which begin at $6 a month and go all the way up to $130 a month. paying more allows customers to use the tool for longer, with options going all the way to eight hours.

customers can only pay in bitcoin, but the company has said that it will offer paypal soon. it also said that it will be adding more options, tools and packages to the service.
