about me

name:  bob 

moonshine is a music show that happens twice a month in the klang valley, malaysia. 

the acoustic installment happens every 3rd saturday at apartment suria klcc and the electric installment happens every 2nd thursday at laundry in the curve. 

produced with the sole purpose of adding one more gig to an already growing roster music avenues, the idea is to help populate the local independent scene with as much music as possible, giving performers more chances to play and the general public more chances to listen. 

moonshine is organised by local singer-songwriter reza salleh.
