washington state's premier rhône varietal winery






mccrea cellars is washington state's first winery entirely dedicated to syrah and to rhône varietal wines.


in a region never before explored for this family of grapes, winemaker doug mccrea 
dedicated nearly two decades seeking and establishing appropriate vineyard sites that 
would nurture syrah and each rhône varietal according to its individual requirements. 


today's wines express the culmination of this effort, made possible only by close 
relationships between mccrea cellars and several of the state's finest growers who 
shared the vision of syrah and rhône varietal vines flourishing in washington.


we invite you inside the world of washington rhône wines, skillfully crafted 
to capture the depth and grace of these noble vines.
