borrelli's in the news
nassau coliseum (spencer hazen)
a long island family-owned restaurant reunites islanders fans
"we're going to borrelli's!" shouts frankie borrelli of east meadow, long island, tightly hugging his father, frank jr. borrelli, live-streaming during a new york islanders win. the video, which is a routine for the borrellis, captures the iconic father-son bond alongside the whirlwind emotions of watching an islanders playoff game. the phrase, coined by borrelli and synonymous with "we're going home," signifies an islanders win and a popular postgame destination to enjoy great italian food with fellow islanders fans who feel like family.
borrelli's restaurant in east meadow, long island was opened in the fall of 1955 by al, phil, and frank from naples, italy. the three brothers were a trifecta comprised of a pizza man, waiter, and cook who began serving the long island community with authentic italian cuisine and family-friendly service. with much success, the restaurant expanded in the 1960s, and in 1972, borrelli's had a new neighbor moving in that would transform the family-owned business forever: the newly built nassau coliseum. read more...

customer reviews

borrelli's restaurant cafe & pizzeria

		i cannot say enough wonderful things about this amazing restaurant.  my wife and me were looking for a place to have our wedding‚Äôs rehearsal dinner. our family/friends group was almost 100 people so we a) needed to find a place that could accommodate us, b) find a place near the long island marriott (where everyone was staying) and c)find a place with delicious food and exceptional service.  borelli‚Äôs enthusiastically checks all 3 of these boxes.  foremost, their service staff and bartenders are out of this world.  amanda and courtney were our primary contacts and servers.  they worked tirelessly not only during our planning phase, but certainly during the event itself.  they really made everything perfect!  from helping us select the menu, to treating our guests like family‚Ä¶to never batting an eyelash when somebody needed something.  i really feel like everyone (owner/chef frank included) bent over backwards to make our dinner as special as it could possibly be.  the food was exceptional (chicken francesse, rigatoni with vodka sauce, meatballs, cheese tortellini, eggplant parmesan, and stuffed shrimp)!  i can‚Äôt recommend borelli‚Äôs highly enough.

		this past weekend i hosted my sister's bridal shower at borrellis and it was beyond great. the staff was amazing and worked so hard to make sure my sister had the best day. the food and drinks were excellent. my guests were raving. they took proper precautions when it came to covid. the buffet had plexiglass in front which made guests feel safe. tables were spaced out 6 feet apart for social distancing. i highly recommend having your future party at borrellis.

		i came here for a private event. the space was spacious and private. the service was attentive and courteous. the bar even has some beers on tap which i haven't seen at too many italian restaurants.
		i had the rigatoni with meat sauce followed by the veal parmigiana. both were delicious. the pasta and meat was perfectly seasoned and cooked. it had a great balance between savoriness and saltiness. the portions were handsomely generous.

pizza from east meadow to long beach
borrelli's pizzeria opens a taproom on the west end combining well-loved food with beer.
posted may 21, 2023

the well-known and well-loved east meadow staple, borrelli's pizzeria, has taken its pizza and traveled down the meadowbrook parkway to open borrelli's taproom in long beach.



the taproom is located on the corner of beech street in long beach‚Äôs west end.


located on beech street in long beach's west end, borrelli's taproom features wood fired pizza and craft beer. taking the reins of the new location is stephen carbonaro, nephew of owner frank borrelli. 


"the opportunity came up for us for that location which was formerly the beach house which has been there for years and they were looking to get away from some of the crowds that they had and bring in some good food," borrelli said. "it was just a great opportunity for that area and we‚Äôre trying to mix the young and the old and combine it."


the new location opened may 1st with a comedy show and a selection of beer. this past weekend, they fired the brick oven up and started serving pizzas.
