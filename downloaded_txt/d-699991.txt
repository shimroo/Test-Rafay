​molecular biology core facilities
















welcome to the molecular biology core facilities
the molecular biology core facilities (mbcf) at dana-farber cancer institute (dfci) provide expertise and access to cutting-edge genomic and proteomic technologies in a shared use setting. although these services are primarily focused on cancer and aids research, most services are broadly applicable to other areas of research. we are proud to highlight some of our new services here.



what’s new?
august 2024:novaseq x plus grant awardmbcf has been awarded funding for the novaseq x plus. if your project utilized sequencing data from this platform, you must acknowledge this grant in your publications as follows:this work utilized an illumina novaseq x plus that was purchased with funding from a national institutes of health sig grant 1s10od036228-01.



july 2024:novaseq 6000 to be retired october 2024due to broad uptake of the new illumina novaseq x plus sequencing platform, mbcf will no longer support sequencing on the older novaseq 6000 platform beginning october 1, 2024.the novaseq x plus is essentially better, faster, and cheaper than the novaseq 6000. as a result, almost all projects and services have already been transitioned to the novaseq x plus platform. we do not anticipate that suspending novaseq 6000 services will have any significant impact for ongoing projects.please reach out to us if you have any questions or concerns.



march 2024:illumina novaseq x plus sequencing 10x single-cell sequencing: lane on 10b flowcell 1.2b reads for $1,500/$1,800 (internal/external) per lane.rnaseq: qc, library prep, 50m 150bp clusters (read pairs), $300/$350 (internal/external) per sample.cut & run: library prep, 20m 150bp clusters (read pairs), $185/$200 (internal/external) per sample.whole exome sequencing: 100x coverage.coming soon 1.5b flowcell and 25b flowcell lane pricing (inquire)
