subaru legacy – record holder 35 years later

june 17, 2024 dave 


i hadn’t realized that the legacy still held this record, but road & track highlighted that on it’s introduction to the word, the legacy set records that stand to this day in 2024.
back in 1989 subaru set the record for time to reach 100,000km in the 1.5-2.0 liter class. three legacies completed the task, over the course of 18 straight days, the fastest averaging 138mph.

rip subaru legacy

june 14, 2024 dave 


it’s been 36 years, but the legacy is ending it’s model run.
most people prefer five-door setup, either a tall wagon, crossover, or suv. the legacy wagon has been gone for 15 years, replaced in the north american lineup with the outback entirely.

new look and feel – same legacy central

june 5, 2024 dave 



so, what’s new?
it’s been a very long time since i updated this website, and there’s kinda one big reason for it: ease.
the system that the classic legacycentral had been using was well over 20 years old, based on an arcane news posting program, and surely i’ve been lucky that it’s not been compromised in some way shape or form simply because of obscurity.
well, it’s easier now to install cms systems like wordpress and still maintain old things, like classic.legacycentral.org for you to look at. also, for me to refer to, as i copy content over. it’s likely that i will remove some of the old content, but we’ll see.
in car news, well, i’m back in an awd, turbocharged, white wagon. this one was made in mexico, but for a german manufacturer. it’s a 2017 vw golf alltrack, which replaced a 2012 honda fit, which replaced a 2009 fit. i’m quite enjoying the ownership and some of the creature comforts of the vw, including a quiet ride, adaptive radar cruise control, and effective air conditioning. maybe i’ll post later about the last 8 years in cars, but let’s just get this up and running for now!





lotta years

december 7, 2016 dave 


yes, the last post i made was in 2010.
i owned a 98 legacy l then, green, bk5 wagon, 5mt, ej22, and enjoyed it. wrx seats, wrx wheels, intake, muffler. sold in 2012 i think.
moved on to a 97 outback limited. ej25d (my only dohc motor) with a 5mt. white with black leather. really nice, loud exhaust that i struggled with for a long time. lowered on wrx dampers and springs. sold in 2013 i think.
replaced with the previously owned 2001 outback (bh) which was boring as hell. slapped some jdm gt-b wheels on it and endured it. sold in 2015.
while i had the bh, i also owned a bp outback xt, 2005, 5eat. silver with many bells and whistles. it had a reasonable amount of miles, lots of work done including a replaced turbo. a bit of a foolish purchase, i sold it less than a month after buying it because i feared it wasn’t what i really wanted.
november 2014 i bought a 2009 honda fit sport, 5mt. this is what i’m driving as of this post in late-2016. it’s light, small, agile, economical, and cheap to run (a/c compressor notwithstanding) and i have few regrets leaving subaru.
the bbs goes on, with one of the best communities i’ve ever encountered. the first-generation legacy continues to be a popular car because it’s so well built. japanese cars in the late-80s and early 90s have this reputation, and it’s well deserved. with the earlier models now being more than 25 years old, they’re now classics, or whatever you want to call them. jdm versions will likely begin to trickle over from japan and through canada. this will keep the spirit alive for a long time.
thank you for your support, and while i can make no guarantee concerning the next time i update this home page, i will keep the site and bbs going regardless.




a few things

march 2, 2010 dave 


the bbs is undergoing an upgrade from an older version of the software. if you’re reading this, and the bbs isn’t working, that’s why. it should be done in a few hours, with some tweaks to follow.
my gt is sold. i was able to find a local who was willing to do some work in order to get it back on the road. i did end up selling much of the aftermarket part catalog i’d had on the car, but i am definitely pleased that it’s in rolling condition and is being looked after. the last thing i wanted is for it to end up at a salvage yard.
my 98 legacy l wagon is going strong. i have a hesitation that’s bothering me right now, so the warming weather means i’m less reluctant to spend time in the garage.




the gt is for sale

april 28, 2009 dave 


i have a new car…don’t worry, it’s another legacy, but i am selling the 2000 legacy gt limited to make room and so i can do some neat things to the new legacy.
email me if you want more details about the price, specifically, but you can get more information by going to this thread on the legacy central bbs:

ten long years

march 18, 2009 dave 


i realized that not long ago the site had turned 10. the first archived post i have was from early february 1999. crazy.
well, the site itself doesn’t get a lot of added content, but the gallery and bbs/forum do, so if you’re looking for new and interesting stuff, make sure you check out the legacy central bbs.
oh, and it’s time to clean that air filter again.




clean/change your air filter

may 28, 2008 dave 


october was the last time i cleaned my air filter. it was filthy.
clean or replace yours. better power, better fuel mileage and better sound.




clogged again?

april 30, 2008 dave 


overheating has been an on and off problem with this car, literally from the day i bought it. there were a few years of no problems after i got the heads shaved, gaskets and radiator replaced, but the tide is coming back in (or leaving).
i found a new radiator and i’m going to put in another bottle of the subaru coolant system conditioner to make absolutely sure that the headgasket is sealed as much as it can be, then swap the radiator in this weekend after another 100 miles or so of driving.
i did find out that the 04-07 sti radiator should be a direct replacement for that of the 00-04 legacy. many sti owners with lots of modifications like to upgrade to thicker and more effective radiators, so they’re not hard to find on sites like nasioc.
oh, i forgot to mention that i sold my prodrive p-wrc1 wheels and picked up a set of 04 wrx sti bbs wheels for the car. they’re much lighter and still look good. some 225/45-17 bfgoodrich g-force kdw-2 tires are on them and so far i really like it:
(click for gallery)

the rota sdrs stay on for winter duty because they also look good and are very light. my hankook ice bear w300s still have plenty of life left in them, so no need to make changes there.
i am in the process of downgrading my brakes from the 05 legacy gt 12.3″ setup to the more reasonable 11.4″ wrx/outback/lgt parts, but it sure has been a pain to get everything together and find the time.




it’s winter here

february 5, 2008 dave 


in the spirit of winter, please have a look at this gallery to see what it’s been like here in northern utah. we’ve had huge snowfall, but the legacy pounds right through it and is more fun than trouble:(click for gallery)i’ve added a few new dress-up parts to the car, courtesy of people upgrading, changing cars, having excess parts and whatnot.prodrive anthracite aluminum oil cap(click for gallery)prodrive black aluminum shift knob(click for gallery)painted interior trim pieces(click for gallery)i do have a few more things in the pipeline, so stay tuned!finally, check out the my legacy link at the top. i’ve updated a bunch of the modifications to my gt with links to the appropriate legacy central galleries for the part(s).
