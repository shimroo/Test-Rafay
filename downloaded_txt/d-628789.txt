welcome to southport
a fun-loving seaside town with attractions for all the family, and an abundance of independent restaurants and bars making it a foodies’ haven, and full of culture. whether it’s our historic victorian architecture, iron pier, spectacular series of year-round events, shops, or boutique accommodation, there’s plenty on offer all year round.
when it comes to beaches, you're spoiled for choice. we have 22 miles of coastline from formby beach, ainsdale beach, crosby beach (where you can visit the famous antony gormley 'another place'), and southport beach itself. you can enjoy some of the most stunning views along our coast.
we’re full of attractions for the little ones. there’s southport pleasureland, marine lake, splash world, botanic gardens and king’s gardens, to name a few. or if you’re after a more relaxed pace, there’s formby, birkdale, ainsdale and churchtown, where you can enjoy the serenity and landscapes of these beautiful towns and villages. across southport, there are several spots for shopping, eating and drinking and we have our own hub for culture vultures at the atkinson.
join us for one of our year-round events, we’ve got the spectacular southport air show and british musical fireworks championship, the southport comedy festival, the free southport food and drink festival, and the relaxing southport flower show.
southport is well-known for being a place to live well. we’ve got miles of paths through the dunes perfect for a run, a walk, a family stroll, or a bike ride. you can head into the formby pine woods to spot a red squirrel or two, enjoy an afternoon of golf, go on a nature trail, visit nearby martin mere, or perhaps hop on your bike and explore our coast. summer means that any activity can finish with an ice cream - perfect!
southport is the perfect spot for a staycation, whether it’s a romantic weekend break, a long-awaited family get-together, or a proper seaside holiday. we’ve got carefully curated boutique hotels perfect for pampering, self-catering, stylish modern apartment breaks, and seaside bed & breakfast's and caravan parks. make southport your base and discover new hidden gems to explore.
