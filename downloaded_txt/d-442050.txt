a safe place to experience healing and growth














serving and equipping hurting families




    zoom meetings
  



northstar community is a group of people who have survived something hard. things like trauma, substance use disorder, mental illness, loss, fractured family relationships, harmful church experiences, and more. we work together to find hope and healing through personal and spiritual growth. we do this through offering support groups, mental health and substance use counseling services, addiction education for family members, and faith-based community.














what we do







            support groups
          










we host some support groups (na and nar-anon). we run a few support groups of our own which help people learn to navigate life crises and become more effective helpers to people living with a substance use disorder.our schedule








            counseling
          










our executive director, scott, works as both a pastor and a mental health counselor. he offers substance use, family, and other forms of mental health counseling free of charge. or you can come in for a consult where you describe a problem you or someone you love is facing and learn about the best resources in our area to address it.request a free consult
