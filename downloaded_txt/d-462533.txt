              uniting people & animals for nearly a century            

as animal lovers ourselves, we do everything in our power to save dogs, cats, and small mammals in need and find them loving families. from the moment they're in our care to when they find their fur-ever home, we offer nose-to-tail support to keep them happy and healthy.our work takes a team, and we're proud to work with generous volunteers, donors, and community partners.

from underdog to family dog
“we saw asher on the news and wanted to help him because he looked so sad. our family knew we could show him what it’s like to be part of a family who loves him!”
read asher's story








 


the skye is the limit
“i went to the nevada humane society, trying to find a new doggy to help fill the hole my 14-year-old lab left in my heart. i fostered skye with the intention to adopt her. she is proof that with love and patience, anything is possible.” 
read skye’s story








 


from struggles to snuggles
"when i first peered into his cat kennel, it looked empty. suddenly, prismo launched from the other side of his litter box, now covered in shredded paper litter bits. i knew at that point he was coming home with me!"

turn your love for animals into action

support animals in our care and around our community by making a monetary gift or donating wish list items.

from dog walking to cat cuddling, you can spend time with our animals while they wait to find loving homes.




foster

some animals have never experienced a warm bed. give an animal (or few!) a taste of the good life through fostering.











our resources & programs
we've got you covered, from nose to tail






                  pet pantry                

if you’re a pet parent who needs a leg up in feeding your fur-baby, we can help. swing by our reno or carson city campuses during business hours to learn more about our pet pantry.





                  vet clinic                

we provide essential, lifesaving vet care to pets in northern nevada, including low-cost vaccine and spay/neuter services. appointments are required.





                  pet owner basics                

first-time pet parent? we have handouts with tips on dog licensing, spaying/neutering, barn cat care, how to keep your pets comfy in all seasons, and more. 





                  dog dates                

make a dog’s tail wag by taking them on an adventure! it boosts their moods and lets them explore the world outside their kennel, while giving us more insight about the pet.





                  lost & found pets                

sometimes our pets slip out when we're not looking. check out the lost & found page for resources on how to help keep your pet safe, and - if lost - get reunited asap.





                  animal rehoming                

while we want every pet to have a forever home, we know certain circumstances make it hard to stay together. reach out if you need to surrender an animal.
