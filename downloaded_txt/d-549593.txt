thanks for attending the  everglades awareness   concert!

saturday night was pretty cool!  the 11th annual everglades awareness   concert at the jackie gleason room at the fillmore brought a lot of   people together on a few different levels.  

      big thanks to all of the   people who made it out despite the rain - having the entire production   at an inside venue certainly made a difference!  lots of love to the   fillmore crew for hosting the event and providing the space to reach new   people.  super shiny thanks to all of the performers and artists (army   gideon, the spam allstars, above the skyline, tamboka, iko-iko, venus   rising, stephan mikes, kuyayky, grant livingston, michael weikopf,   alonso, raven, dita devi and anibal fernandez) who contributed their   time and talent to inspire and entertain as we celebrated the   everglades!  special thanks for all of the speakers and organizations   who participated and shared information to our community before and   doing the event. shout out to houston cypress - love the everglades   movement, betty osceola - walk for mother earth. michael gibaldi -   surfrider foundation, matt schwartz - s. fl wildlands assn. and prof.   dean whitman - fiu geology dept. along with imagine our florida, siren’s   cove and the wallflower gallery!


 big thanks to progressive rags   and jack lieberman for printing the new shirt - it came out great with   the artwork by anastasia sultzer and christa lanatra - based on a   photograph by aeric moskowitz.  special thanks to all of the media   outlets who included the event in their listings and added more   recognition to the everglades as a crucial issue.  shout out to mut comm   and michael mut!.  shout out to paradise key media and jared jacobs for   the virtual reality canoe experience - modern technology giving a taste   of the everglades to people far away!  big respect to the production   support (7th circuit productions and ray orraca along with resurrection   drums and jeffrey lee) who provided the gear and tech - most people   don’t realize how much the gear has an effect on the flow of the show.    big thanks to one love miami photography and thomas fleming who   documented the entire event in photos - they will be posted on facebook   and ploppypalace.com soon! 


 special big love to the sponsors who contributed and provided the   financial means to cover the expenses for the production, promotions and   talent.  shout out to the miccosukee tribe of florida, miami dade   cultural affairs and the city of miami beach!!  super shiny love to all   of the volunteers and organizers who donated their time, effort and   spirit to make this event happen and spread the word!!  all of your   support makes a difference!!! 


 love the everglades movement is a   volunteer organization that works to reach more people and inspire   positive actions on behalf of the everglades, the water, the wildlife   and our society.  we strive to provide outlets and opportunities to   empower people as we engage the populace.  this event is   multi-dimensional in the sense that it is able to interact beyond the   show itself.  starting with the promotions, we have been able to bring   the everglades into more prominence as we were connecting people with   this event.  through word of mouth, flyers, social media and traditional   outlets, we have been able to interject the everglades into   conversations, event listings and personal interactions.  with the   social media platforms, we have been able to share the event and reach   new people who have been empowered to expand the outreach further.  all   of this has introduced love the everglades movement and our efforts to   unite with more people.


 by embracing the arts and the diversity   of south florida, we provide a platform for individuals to utilize their   dynamic talents and share their voices with others.  music, art, dance,   spoken word and other creative mediums share the essence of culture   with unique flavors that touch souls.  while sharing perspectives with   personal style, these expressive voices manifest to bridge the divisions   within the segments of our society.  as we work to connect people, it   is important to recognize that “water unites us!”and the arts can   empower us!


 this event is a team building exercise that has   helped us improve our working coordination and expand our resources as   we develop a more organized structure.  additionally, this showcase is a   beacon to others who want to participate and get involved.  we   demonstrate our efforts and seek out others who believe in the cause as   we activate within our community.  there are many kind and considerate   people who care about social issues, but are not aware of the public   policy or history of the everglades and its relevance for south florida.    with the right words or experiences, we can spark consciousness that   reverberates within and allows the everglades to be a reflective part of   actions.  understanding how the everglades impacts our region is the   key to protecting it.  that connection between the everglades as the   source of out water and the taps in our homes literally brings our   environmental concerns to a new level for some people.
