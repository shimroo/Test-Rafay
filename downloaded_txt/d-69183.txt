children (and many adults) universally waved and hollered hellos as we pedaled pastâone man giving a few of us a tour-de-france running push when he saw us struggling up a hill. we had a jam-packed schedule of riding, hiking, visiting temples, photographing elephants on a safari, getting a cooking demonstration (and recipes!), going on an epic train ride, swimming in the indian ocean, visiting a tea plantation and processing plant, seeing coconut husks turned into rope; taking tea, stopping for fresh pineapple, eating delicious sri lankan curriesâ¦.it was an amazing adventure with really lovely, fun, game people.

a most enjoyable trip made excellent by our guide george (jorge).  i was not sure what to expect of belize so everything was new and interesting. a good balance of nature, culture, history and tropic island.  the people of belize were very warm and friendly and helpful so nice to travel amongst them.
