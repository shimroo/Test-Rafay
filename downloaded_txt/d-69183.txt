what a beautiful country with such a variety of things to do and see. incredible buddhist sites and sights, glorious scenery and wildlife.

children (and many adults) universally waved and hollered hellos as we pedaled past–one man giving a few of us a tour-de-france running push when he saw us struggling up a hill. we had a jam-packed schedule of riding, hiking, visiting temples, photographing elephants on a safari, getting a cooking demonstration (and recipes!), going on an epic train ride, swimming in the indian ocean, visiting a tea plantation and processing plant, seeing coconut husks turned into rope; taking tea, stopping for fresh pineapple, eating delicious sri lankan curries….it was an amazing adventure with really lovely, fun, game people.

a most enjoyable trip made excellent by our guide george (jorge).  i was not sure what to expect of belize so everything was new and interesting. a good balance of nature, culture, history and tropic island.  the people of belize were very warm and friendly and helpful so nice to travel amongst them.
