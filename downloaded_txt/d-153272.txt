allstate resource managementwhat our clients are saying about us“every company should model themselves like this one….. customer service is still a valued factor with this team of professionals. every person i have spoken to with this company has done what they said they would do. even if it meant relaying a message to someone else. that alone speaks volumes for a customer. no sugar coating the facts, which saves time and effort for the customer. jana, colleen, matt to name a few are all wonderful to deal with. if you want a stress free, professional and dependable business relationship, look no further. this is the company for you!
tamica lloydproperty manager“allstate resource management has been a wonderful company to work with. they are quick and efficient in getting the inspections and maintenance for the storm water for several of our locations in florida done. a++ for wendy, she has been making sure that we are on top of our permits and has suggestions to help the process run smoothly.
roni delagarzaproperty manager“i love working with this company. as a property manager you need a company that you can rely on. working with companies that don’t know what are they doing or are not responsible enough makes your job unnecessarily stressful. this is the number one company for me to go and wendy and jana are just a call or an email away. keep up the good work allstate resource management!
carol garciaproperty manager“allstate is the best lake company i’ve worked with; they are professional, very knowledgeable, and respond immediately to anything we need for many years now. we also sincerely appreciate the quality of work they provide on a constant basis. thank you allstate!
