attention old world monkeys! nintendo of europe has added a "donkey kong pop-up store" to its various websites across the british isles and the continent, allowing european fans the chance to pre-order some of the new products first available in nintendo's japanese shops. the selection includes many of the goods also available in the americas, including the donkey kong fleece hoodie (£49.99/59,99 €), the donkey kong banana pouch (£19.99/24,99 €), the dk barrel shoulder bag (£39.99/44,99 €), and the donkey kong and diddy kong keychains (£12.99/14,99 € each). however, one product that hasn't cartwheeled into nintendo of america yet is the diddy kong fleece jumper (£44.99/54,99 €), meaning those in japan and europe have earned the right to challenge wizpig first.

all products are scheduled to officially be released on june 18.
