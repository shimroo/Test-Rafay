elmer's great north parade
elmer’s creator david mckee was a childhood hero - his artwork is still an inspiration to this day. so i jumped at a chance to help raise funds for st. oswalds hospice in newcastle and to paint my own elmer. 






























atlas of amazing birds - pavillion books
matt sewell has made his personal selection of the most amazing birds from around the world and illustrated them in his dazzling style, accompanied by witty and informative descriptions and maps of every continent. did you know that the bald eagle holds the record for the world's biggest nest - weighing more than two tons? when the elf owl gets into trouble, it plays dead rather than fighting? the adelie penguin can hold its breath for six minutes and leap up to three metres out of the water? discover these and many more fascinating facts in this fabulous book. every bird chosen to appear in this book is amazing in its own individual way - birds that migrate thousands of miles, have strange and showy mating rituals, survive in extreme environments, are brilliant builders, are super-fast, super-brave or super-big! sections on each continent - europe, asia, africa, australasia, north america, south america and antarctica - include maps to pore over. travel the world to see magnificent eagles, resilient penguins, tiny hummingbirds, towering ostriches, stunning peacocks and many more. colourful, clever, song-filled, strange and stunning - this book is a celebration of bird life!signed copies are available from my shop

drumtalk - vinyl artwork
caroline true records are very proud to present a striking & singular brand new release in the matt sewell's a crushing glow presents series!drumtalk - out of the blackness, into the blue (12")formats: strictly ltd edition (500) 12” blue colour-in-colour vinyl & striking limited edition matt sewell phenakistiscope print with initial copies.caroline true records are very proud to offer a brand new matt sewell's a crushing glow collaboration with esteemed london based producer drumtalk.his output has graced labels such as soundway, huntley & palmers & get me ! matt has curated this release & created, once again, very lush sleeve artwork. a lush cosmic journey through sound & vision ..-----------------------it was amazing to work with my good old friend drumtalk with his two tracks for my a crushing glow presents series on caroline true records. inspired by nathaniel's beautiful, spiritually elevated and cosmic music the artwork hopefully transcribes a cosmic journey, carried on a whirling wheel of celestial birds through the stars. always being one to try and capture a little bit more magic i created an phenakiscope print accompany the pieces. - msthanks to richard hammerton for photos and jk from ctr as ever.some glowing words.piccadilly records: continuing their endless string of essential releases, caroline true bring us the latest collaborative project from the mighty matt sewell, this time with london producer drumtalk. taking to the secret sundaze studio, drumtalk drifts away from the club-focus of his releases on tru-thoughts, soundway and huntley & palmers, syncing into the sublime vibrations of a crushing glow for two meditative synth suites. on the a-side, "out of the blackness, into the blue" delivers drum box bossa, dreamlike sequences and celestial bliss-tones, making a connection with a wider cosmic consciousness. if you dig on the library styles of clara mondshine, the spacier, synthier end of the kosmische spectrum or the slow and spangled moments of patrick cowley's porn oeuvre, you're gonna love this. the flip continues the cosmic voyage, enjoying a little extra thrust from a blorpy bass synth as we lose ourselves in the nebulous goo of e-flute, fluttering sine waves and warming white noise. i imagine this is what arthur c clarke's starchild listened to when he was getting stoned...ban ban ton ton: the celestial garden sort of electro-sambas towards its breakdown. where upon it floats in a flurry of synthesised flute. kind of antena, given 21st century bass heft, meets new age. if mixed by motion graphics.out of the blackness, into the blue is a tune for dawn. electronics that evoke images of woodland, and wildlife. nature`s chorus. if not organic, then decidedly analogue. with vintage sounds sometimes fuzzy, distorted. as if they might have been sampled from a 78. a rhythm box metronome stuttering “tch tch tch tch tch tch tsssss” and the kosmische pastoral of cluster`s sowiesoso sharing birdwatchers binoculars with basil kirchin`s charcol sketches and brian bennett`s early spring.test pressing: a new two track drumtalk 12”, released in collaboration with celebrated illustrator / enthused ornithologist matt sewell’s ‘a crushing glow’, came a little out of nowhere; but then that’s what this record’s all about – surprises. ‘out of the blackness, into the blue’ develops the sound set of previous, more muscular drumtalk releases but these tracks take a different tack, finding freedom in serenity, loose from the mechanics of the club. not so much an about-turn, more a drift towards new horizons.the first moments set the tone for the next 15 minutes: a rising melody joined by its double, wandering bassline, auto-rhythm, fx, noise. both sides of the record open up and find space to breathe, pausing for a few moments to check you’re caught up before setting off again. there’s a lot of playful nostalgia here for sure; berlin/whatever-schule, japanese avant pop, eno etc. but these are for reference only, quick coordinates that put you in the right hemisphere – but still off course. like the sadly departed subway, drumtalk takes these sounds as a starting point for analog pop that’s never saccharine and comes highly recommended.
















































matt sewell's dinosaurs - pavillion books
i had so much fun with my second children's book for pavillion books. having the chance to go back and paint all my favourite dinosaurs from when i was a kid was pure joy, then moving on in a voyage of dino-discovery finding out about all the new creatures that have been recently dug up and all the new scientific theories made this project a roaringly good time!---------------------------matt sewell is fascinated by dinosaurs and in this book he examines the many types of dinosaur that lived during the prehistoric periods. packed with large illustrations and interesting information on these amazing creatures, this book also looks at up-to-date findings on dinosaur appearance, colour and habits. all done with matt's brilliant humour and charm. a must-have book for all dinosaur fans, young and old.publisher: pavilion books isbn: 9781843653509 number of pages: 96 weight: 870 g dimensions: 300 x 230 x 16 mm

gayatri mantra - vinyl artwork
a crushing glow presents is a continuation of the a crushing glow compilation series with caroline true records via the 12" vinyl format. curated and designed by my good self, licensed and produced by john kertland of ctr. there maybe one or two left at the ctr shop if your not too late."the gayatari mantra is a devotional chant intoned in daily prayer and ceremony in india since time immemorial, a beautiful verse of unknown mystical origins, written it is believed, by god. the revered mantra of the vedas has been sung in many different ways, this melodious version is sung by the famous bollywood playback singer anuradha paudwal and her daughter kavita and was recorded in the 90’s. it is a joyous, magical and curative adaptation of the holy mantra, that is much loved, immensely popular and unescapable - being played publicly in shops, taxis and as ringtones, doorbells  and more throughout india. i give all my thanks to my wife jessica who introduced me to this work of celestial art. she fell in love with the song on one of her trips to india and brought back a cd. that disc now worn out and unplayable it is a delight to be able to bring you the divine gayatari mantra on glorious yellow vinyl."the artwork is inspired from a crop of a josef frank repeat pattern, creating a perfect framework to explore and get magical in the garden. everything was hand drawn and then painstakingly coloured digitally on the olde mac.never one to miss out on a good opportunity to explore a vibe deeper i worked with my friends at creomore mill to create a limited run of wooden incense burners in the shape of bird heads. get that nag champa burning and the beak catches the ash.to go further we have also included a very special mantra box for mediation, yoga and general vibe controlling purposes. containing 5 loops including the gayatari mantra and repackaged in a special acg present sleeve. ommmmmmmmmm"i heard the voice of angel, in a language i didn’t understand, singing to me with the tone of “don`t worry it`s gonna be alright”, and as tabla and fingers cymbals sounded, the song of mother and daughter danced a duet. the experience, fittingly, akin to aural sunlight. the “folk” melody woven throughout must have travelled across continents & millennia, as i could somehow just as easily hear it sung by the old boys in a galway pub as on the busy streets of bombay. a universal hymn. a reminder that music links us, all and everything." testpressing september 2016

a crushing glow - lp artwork
artwork for the double vinyl gatefold compilation a crushing glow that i compiled curated and designed for caroline true records.now long since sold out... check discogs - dont ask me i was honoured to be asked to compile a compilation with free reign of artwork - is there a better job than that!? i dove deep into my record collection pulling out all kind of otherworldly and esoteric delights to create a journey perfect for working, relaxing or getting deeep to. the artwork is of a similar magical vein, a 4am in the alchemists cave vibe that charts a transmutation in the gatefold in my watercolour medium. the first 50 records came with a extra special waxwing riso print for the collectors.press releasecaroline true records (ctr) has joined forces with celebrated and revered uk artist and illustrator matt sewell in creating a unique, eclectic new album release, matt sewell's a crushing glow. a little known fact is that matt is also a dedicated and knowledgeable music aficionado and music collector. a regular contributor to the caught by the river website, a painter of walls around the world and the bird brain behind the bestselling books our garden birds, our songbirds and our woodland birds. acg gives an intriguing insight into matt's world and his art via his musical choices.this diverse album, featuring many tracks never before released on vinyl or else long deleted, develops over 13 tracks through the pastoral post-punk of the durutti column, the bucolic pop of parsley sound to the panoramic kosmique of ashra. reimagined edits from lobt noch irrt, the acid of tin man via the indo-prog of the third ear band.  “i felt that matt would choose some great tracks for the album – freedom to put together the compilation that he wanted without any genre limitations. a voyage of musical discovery. he has done exactly that. “(john kertland – ctr md)featuring all-original artwork from matt inside and out, the album is strictly limited to 500 copies. artwork is contained within a deluxe full-colour gate-fold sleeve, with full colour inner-sleeves – on coloured double vinyl and detailed sleeve-notes carefully crafted by matt. full tracklisting: side a:parsley sound-twilight mushroomslux harmonium-camel bonesluke howard-portrait gallerymeic stevens-love owed side b:the durutti column-otisashra-77 slightly delayedtin man-falling acid side c:lobt noch irrt - heizgas meterthe st just vigilantes-panzer vs arrowthe habibiyya-eye witness side d:third ear band - stone circlesaddhu brand-i give you johnnée the truthchitti babu - komala koyala - veena (the cuckoo song)popol vuh-angel of the air (part 2) 
























art & sole - a few of my favourite sneakers
text took directly from the amazing blog art & sole and buy the poster hereit's been a long time coming, but at last we can show you the next in our ongoing series of 'a few of my favourite sneakers'. in an interesting twist on the project concept, artist matt sewell (well known for his illustrations of feathered wildlife) has chosen to draw a selection of his favourite sneakers alongside birds that the sneakers remind him of. as he explains, 'some people see faces whilst other people see cocks or tits in everything. me, i see birds, always have. in particular i see them in cars, buildings, people and trainers...'sewell is an avid ornithologist, a regular contributor to caught by the river and author of the bestselling book our garden birds. he has illustrated for the guardian, v&a, gravis (a project we featured in the art & sole book), levi's, helly hansen, the big issue and has also painted underpasses for the rspb, and exhibited in london, manchester, tokyo and paris.usually we ask the artists who take part in the 'a few of my favourite sneakers' project to draw 10 of their favourite shoes, but, as matt was drawing both sneakers and birds, we've made an exception to the rule meaning that he has drawn his top five shoes (with five birds).in order of appearance, the list of sneakers and birds illustrated (including the creatively-named latin titles for both) includes:fila hiker & bullfinchcasualia ambulo & pyrrhula pyrrhula'a girl in our year had been hanging out with bigger boys (and going to rezerection and other raves that i wished i'd been to) and came to school in these. i thought i was cool in my travel fox's but these took the biscuit. strong and bright, proper bullfinch. i think i remember trying to talk my old man into buying me a pair but he wanted me to get a regular pair of hiking boots. not quite the same effect really.'nike air safari & zebra finchvictoria aer venator & taeniopygia guttata'i've never had a pair of safari's, but i have owned a zebra finch - loads in fact. my dad built this aviary/cage type thing in a covered over area outside of our house. they thrived for a while, had loads of lil' chicks and were the cutest of things until this sharp frost came from out of nowhere and froze them all to death. i was of course mortified and i must of repressed this horror deep down as i totally forgot that i had ever even seen a zebra finch, never mind owned one. skip on twenty years, to me and my girlfriend walking around uluru in the searing heat when suddenly i heard the very familiar tinkling/chiming sound of a flock of zebra finches having a great time. everything came flooding back to me. i was gutted but it was amazing to see them in the bush, with that bell-like birdsong which helps aborigines find water in the scorched desert. no wonder the poor buggers couldn't handle it in the frozen north-east.'nike dunk sb 'oompa loompa' & stonechatvictoria nullam tabula pumilio magus & saxicola rubicola'these sb's belonged to my mate gaz in brighton - he loved them but i was always a bit "meh". brown and orange is always and good combo though and they do remind me of a stonechat, so he can't be all wrong.'travel fox & goldfinchperegrinationes vulpes & carduelis carduelis'i had coveted these for ages until i managed to get a pair myself. i have no idea how i managed to talk my folks into forking out for these. although now it becomes clearer, as i distinctly remember getting them from a 'budget' shoe shop in bishop auckland, rather than a fancy boutique. it doesn't really matter if they were knock-off or not, as i was only interested in the colours and the massive rubbery travel fox logo emblazoned across the sole. ironically, i think these met their end in a bonfire misadventure where i managed to melt a nail right through one.'nike meika & blue titvictoria puteulanus aureus specialis & parus caeruleus'god knows where i first saw these delectable rare runners. it doesn't even matter that they are the mirror image of one of my favourite birds, i just want them on my feet.'
