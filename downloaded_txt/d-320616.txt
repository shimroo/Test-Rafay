thank you for your inquiry into one of our premium domains! a member of our team will get back to you within 24 hours.






the 5 step process to buy a premium domain w/ qeipsubmit form - please submit the form above to start the purchase process - indicating the domain (w/ the price) of which you want to acquire. agree to terms - after confirming your purchase, we will then create a transaction on escrow.com where you will be directed to accept the terms (inc. deal size, escrow fees, etc.) after receiving a corresponding email.send payment  - once all parties have agreed to terms, we will request that you send wire transfer payment to our 3rd party escrow partner (credit card is available for transactions under $5k).follow transfer instructions - after your payment is secured/received, we will contact you with personalized instructions on how to get the domain quickly transferred to you. for most cases, we are able to transfer the domain to you within 24 hours of purchase. confirm delivery - for your safety, your payment will be held in escrow until transfer is confirmed by you so there is no risk of loss. upon receiving domain and confirming receipt, the transaction will be complete!if you are leasing the domain, a separate individualized process will be used.



to be noted: we do not respond to inquiries that we deem to be unserious = unserious inquiries include those with too small of offers, ones without traceable contact/company names, & anyone potentially using shady tactics. we believe it’s imperative to operate with the upmost transparency and goodwill as it relates to helping companies find the right brand - we will only do business with people  who respect our values.we understand that domain value is something not taught in business school but we ask that you do some research on it before attempting to make contact or putting together an offer. the domains we sell vary from $10k-$10m usd+ (and the prices we have are backed by market data) - chances are that if the domain in question is a high use generic ‘term’ domain, it will be priced between at least 500k-5m usd. if you don’t have this kind of capital laying around, we are open to talking financing (but only to accredited individuals). thank you for taking the time to read this.
