student testimonials 





the two years of my m.m.s. journey in jbims provided me with the opportunity to understand the requirements of the finance industry. i owe a large part of whatever i have achieved to jbims. the amalgamation of the theoretical concepts of management with practical exposure through case studies provides holistic learning and makes us ready for the business world. it did a great job of equipping me with the knowledge and skills required to excel in a finance job, particularly in analysis and research. we had the opportunity to learn through the extremely interactive and engaging lectures from the full- time faculty and visiting professors with both industrial experience and academic experience. all the college activities are student-driven and various committees ensure the smooth functioning of the college, which helps the students improve their leadership and management skills. in addition to the academics, it is the podium that jbims has given me for the development of skills that i would cherish for a lifetime.

jbims’s unique and distinct learning proposition, which provides both theoretical concept clarity and an application-oriented approach, has aided me in better understanding management topics. the two years i spent in the most fascinating and picturesque surroundings not only helped me gain knowledge and skills but also instilled in me a unique zeal to set out and embrace transformation. the industry exposure through various corporate seminars provides you with a holistic approach, and the pedagogical tools used by faculty members motivate you to be innovative, creative, and competent. it has provided me with numerous opportunities to grow holistically and explore new paths beyond academics through experiential learning, real-time case studies, and industry engagement.

the red brick building is full of rich history and culture. you can feel it in the air as soon as you step inside on day 1. each day as i learnt from industry experts, interacted with alumni and brainstormed with my peers i felt fortunate to be a part of such a heritage! in addition, the rigorous curriculum ensured that each one of us is ready to make a mark for ourselves in the respective fields and take the legacy of "humara bajaj" forward

being a full time mhrd student at jbims (19-21) has been a great experience. the full time & the visiting faculty for human resources has been one of the best. during the course, we got immense exposure to industry stalwarts in the field of people management who eventually became our mentors. we were already living and breathing hr and experiencing cases and stories of great depth and insight. i am grateful to have received the knowledge, network and experience i did during my course and it has given me a good and solid ground for the rest of my journey as an hr professional.

my journey at jbims mhrd gave me an in-depth learning experience. the course is very focused on an all- inclusive growth mindset, and it could not have been more effective given the virtual setup. mhrd has always focused on escaping the barriers of theoretical knowledge and helping the students gain insights into the real world applications of hr concepts. the students are provided with plethora of opportunities and continuous learning process under the guidance of professors and corporate mentors. since completing the program, i can truly say that it has reinvigorated my way of thinking in the business world.
