                  great tex-mex food.  waiter was friendly and very accommodating. the salsa was great, the best i've had that wasnt my own.  lots of cumin.  young lady made guacamole at the table which was very good. would have liked some cumin in it. we had people with difficult allergies but they made sure everyone was taken care of and they were very careful about the food...review by - yelp

                  been loving this place for many many years, over a decade for sure! my monthly treat is the top shelf margarita and fish tacos or poncho enchiladas with heavy tomato slaw! yummy. there's a limit of 2 margaritas, but i'm always super good with just one. plus they're my most favorite margarita in town.review by - yelp
                  jordan h:
                  we always go for the limit two margaritas and stay for the street tacos! canyon cafe is one of my personal favorites, you can never have to much of their chips and salsa and my favorite combination of their street tacos are the bison, al pastor, and crispy chicken! everything on their menu tastes amazing and we are never disappointed! they atmosphere and the staff are very friendlyreview by - yelp

                  my all time favorite texmex st. louis joint. from the table chips (a delicious home made blend) to the table side guacamole. the meal is always worth the wait and overly pretentious "frontenac" location.  plenty of choices and always great service. i can't wait to return.review by - yelp

                  just had a wonderful meal at canyon cafe.   the food is always delicious, the top shelf margaritas are great and our waitress, judy, was phenomenal. tomorrow the leftovers from the enchilada combo will be just as good as they were today. stop reviews carousel play reviews carouselnewsletterlocation1707 s lindbergh blvd store #2st. louis, mo63131hours
