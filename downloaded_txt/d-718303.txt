                            "prior to making my first phone call to mmi i was very skeptical, but after talking to the representative i knew that this is what i truly needed to do. it is definitely a life changing program and without the use of any credit cards you have to face the fact that if you can't afford something you save up for it or you just don t buy it."

                            "i had over $24,000 in credit card debt and was paying over $900 per month and drowning. my adviser at mmi helped me lower the payment and come up with a plan that helped me get rid of that debt. it took just over 3 years, but i did it! i have no credit cards and have managed to not incur any more debt, even at christmas with four teenagers! my credit took a bit of a hit, but it bounced back and i have had a score over 800 for the last 2 years. it was a long road, and difficult at times. but i know for sure that i would still be paying off those credit cards if not for the help i got from mmi. my advice: just do it!"
