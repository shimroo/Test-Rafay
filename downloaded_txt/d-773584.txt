about
we're here to help multiple myeloma patients, their families, and loved ones. multiple myeloma need not be seen as a death sentence, but rather a disease to be managed. education and support are key. we have newly diagnosed patients as well as patients diagnosed more than 10 years ago. we share what we know about myeloma diagnosis, symptoms, markers, treatments, side-effects, clinical trials, quality of life, and many other topics of interest. we invite expert speakers such as oncologists, nutritionists, naturopathic physicians, and integrative/alternative specialists.
