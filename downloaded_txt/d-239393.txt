we are passionate about students reaching students with the good news of jesus.

christian unions are groups of students from a range of local churches who join together to help everyone at uni engage with the life-changing message of jesus.
students have an unparalleled opportunity to reach their friends with the gospel. as they study on campus and live alongside their peers, time and again they unashamedly and boldly seek to speak of jesus. with your support, our work ensures that cu students are supported and trained to impact the university for good, in jesus’ name.
