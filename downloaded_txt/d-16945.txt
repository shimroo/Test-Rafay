                                        very pretty flowers, but the red container was a fail because it clashed with the red of the roses. fortunately we had a black one from previous purchases which works much better as it is inconspicuous and doesn't detract form the beauty of the arrangement.

                                        i am so pleased with the flowers i ordered as a gift. while i didn’t see them in person, my daughter in love took a snapshot and shared with me. gorgeous!!
i don’t live in tx so it’s wonderful to find a florist who lives nearby to my family and does such stunning creations.

                                        i ordered four for a dinner party. they look just like the picture and are a perfect height. i will add them to the raffle prizes because they are that gorgeous.

                                        about 2 years ago i stopped sending flowers to my wife at her west lake office - prices were too high for the arrangements sent. but i had to send flowers for her 50th birthday and found westbank flower market.  they were fantastic - delivered them first thing in the morning (as requested), the price was reasonable and the bouquet was beautiful.  my bride loved them - especially the handwritten note.  strongly recommend westbank flower market.
