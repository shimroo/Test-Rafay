 for latter-day saints, a temple is different from other church buildings. the temple is a place where latter-day saints receive special instruction about god and jesus christ. in the temple, members make eternal covenants (or promises) with god. this includes promises to keep the commandments, live the gospel of jesus christ, be faithful in marriage, and to help take care of each other by sharing what we have. also, because we believeâ¯families are forever, much of the work done inside temples is to make family bonds even stronger. marriages in the temple are performed to last eternally, not just âuntil death do you part.â parents and childrenâ¯become eternal families in temples. ancestors can also receive all the blessings of the temple if someone performs the sacred ordinances in their behalf and they accept that act of service.â¯temples are busy places!what is the book of mormon?
