conrail cabins & cabooses : home


































this is the place to exchange information about conrail's fleet of cabins and cabooses.
i would like to collect and post for all to use, modeling data, photographs, drawings,
locations of existing cars and references to other materials.







update! july 14, 2000 
two new class pages, n-21a and the proposed n-22. 
still working on a mystery cars page for cars that belonged to some of conrail's 
minor components and did not end up on any roster sheets. i still have more 
new content to add, more sightings, look for some more updates in the next few weeks.

those of you 
looking for a caboose will find some helpfull contacts in the 
owners exchange section, take a 
look! thanks for continued contributions. if you see any problems please let me know, i have 
not checked external links in a very long time.
