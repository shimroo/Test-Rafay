made it through my first day of work! today was a lot of reading about policy and meeting people and such, but so far so good. it's a bit of a long drive, but i suppose i'll get used to my new schedule. hopefully mona the cat wasn't too lonely today.this weekend was rick's birthday-- my sweets turned 30! we had some people over for a poker night (rick won)... that was pretty fun. and we had cake and other yummy treats.now i have to start trying to go to bed early so i can make it through my work days!

only a few short days until our arizona trip! we have a couple wedding things to do, a visit to tucson, and of course lots of thanksgiving feasting planned. you can't really get a direct flight from here to phoenix, so that's a bummer, but hopefully everything will go smoothly.i'm finishing up reading into thin air... i'm near the end and it's so intense! jon krakauer is an author i like a lot (based on reading under the banner of heaven), and to write about something so personally upsetting and life-changing seems quite a feat. i also want to read into the wild. i may be taking a trip to the library today or tomorrow. on saturday when we get to az, we're going to "coffeehouse," a fundraiser my high school choir started putting on when i was in the choir. it's going to be a blast from the past. i'm sure all the performers are going to look so young to me now! but i'm excited to see my old choir director (not old, but former) and her son is doing a comedy routine (she was pregnant with him when i was a junior and now he's in my mom's 4th grade class!).for now i'm watching kate & allie and working up to going to the gym.

this weekend has been a good one so far.  rick's aunt passed away about 6 weeks ago, so her brother and his wife were in richmond putting on an estate sale. we went and hung out with them, ate some food, and watched a couple movies. this morning we went to church, i went for my run, and we're getting ready to go to home depot for some yard supplies... who knows what else we might find? we're slowly planning little home improvement projects. i want to fix up our bedroom, and the yard (front and back) is a longer-term project. we're going to arizona in less than a week. i'll be able to show rick and his mom our reception location and we're going to go check out the church where i want to have the ceremony. otherwise, i hope we can just relax a lot and enjoy the warm temperatures and thanksgiving foods. mmmm... pie.

so... my future sister-in-law recently started a blog, inspiring me to at least log on to mine and post something new. (i'm kind of surprised i remembered my log-in info!)  since my last post, i:-turned 25-finished my master's degree-got engaged!-went to france-moved to virginia-looked for and finally found a job-joined the church choir...those are the biggest things.i feel like i could write almost anything because i know there are so few people left who check this blog anymore.  in my period of unemployment, i have spent a good deal of time watching tv, and a bit less of it reading. i also clean occasionally. things i like watching on tv:daytime-- ellen, the daily show, paula's home cooking, sometimes law and order, oprah, and arthurprime time-- oh, where to begin? beauty and the geek, house, boston legal, pushing daisies, the office, without a trace, grey's anatomy, cold caseupcoming trips of importance:  for thanksgiving-- in arizona with my family. rick's mom is also joining us.  for christmas-- in minnesota with rick's family.  just after christmas-- i go to trinidad for my friend sarah's wedding. yes, trinidad! and then december 3rd-- my first day of work.that is my update for now. oh, i'm also training for my first-ever half-marathon.  perhaps i'll update more frequently now.

yesterday, i planned to go practice piano for a little bit in between practicum and class. i decided that since i didn't have a lot of time, i would just park in one of the 30-minute spots outside the music building (no, this is not a parking ticket story, though it easily could have been). so... i'm driving to the lot and a girl in a car pulls out of the lot right in front of me (no looking) as i'm about to turn in. she proceeds to take my 30 minute spot, the only one left, while i swore at her. to drive around to the residential area and then walk to the building would now take too much time, so instead i went to kaldi's and got some iced tea and sat in my car next to the park with the windows cracked listening to npr. i missed out on practicing, but it turned out to be a nice little break from routine. in other news-- hilary decided to let each of her bridesmaids pick what style of dress to wear and she chose the color (she's still deciding between blue/green and pink). i think this is a good plan, as hopefully everyone will be comfortable, yet still coordinated. spring break is next week and i leave for williamsburg on sunday. i am going to sleep a lot and watch cable television. and i'm going to dc for a day to see long-lost (but not forgotten) friends. i love spring break.

this morning i went to the family service at the cathedral. it was pretty neat. they use a lot of musical instruments and the liturgy is really inclusive and family-friendly.  i wondered what it would be like to grow up going to a service like that, where the kids are free to roam around and color and participate in the service.  i really value having grown up in the episcopal tradition and learning the words of the service through sheer repetition.  but it would have been nice, especially for church-challenged people like my brother, to have a little bit of fun in church too.  maybe i'll start alternating between the family service and the "regular" one.
