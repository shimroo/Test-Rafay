                      lets get healthy   
                      how to eat right
                    

                      eating right is all about making smart choices to support your health and well-being. start by incorporating more fruits and vegetables into your meals, aiming for a colorful variety every day. opt for whole grains over refined ones, and choose lean proteins like fish, poultry, and legumes. remember to hydrate with water instead of sugary drinks, and practice mindful eating by listening to your hunger cues and savoring each bite. small, consistent changes can lead to big improvements in your overall health.
