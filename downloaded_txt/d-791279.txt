 general dentistry




healthy bodies start with happy smiles. it’s true! healthy teeth and gums are an essential element to your overall wellness. and you can protect your oral health (and boost your body) with a variety of preventive dentistry services such as exams, x-rays, and diagnosis; fluoride treatments; composite fillings; preventive gum therapy through hygiene; cleanings; and even oral cancer screenings.

 periodontal treatment




say good-bye to gum disease and hello to happy teeth. our periodontists are experts in treating gum disease (including gingivitis), an infection of the tissues that surround and support your teeth. while this can be a major cause of tooth loss in adults, it is definitely treatable. with careful monitoring and treatment, you can achieve healthy gums.

 endodontic treatment




do your teeth need a tune-up? bring them in! our endodontists are experts at root canals, and can repair and save your tooth if it has become severely damaged or infected. beyond restoring your health and comfort (and happy smile), having a root canal performed will reduce pain and discomfort; maintain your original teeth; and remove and eliminate infection.

 implants




a dental implant is a metal post that functions as a replacement tooth root. it provides support for artificial (fake) teeth, such as crowns, bridges, or dentures. it can even support full or partial dentures and give them more stability in the mouth.

 oral & maxillofacial surgery




sometimes it takes a specialist to make a great smile—and we’ll connect you with them. oral surgery may be the solution for impacted wisdom teeth, or when a tooth is damaged from disease, trauma, or crowding. our specialists may also work closely with your dentist as part of your treatment plan, that may include extractions and implant placement.

 orthodontics




sometimes, teeth need a little extra help. so we offer a comprehensive package for orthodontics. you want a great smile- and a great bite. we can help you get there. our orthodontists want you to have everything you need during and after your smile is perfected.

 children’s dentistry




going to the dentist should be fun—and memorable! make your child’s first visit by their first birthday or first tooth. little teeth need extra special care and attention. here, they’ll get it. we take care of baby teeth and big kid teeth, while encouraging healthy habits and good hygiene to keep growing happy smiles.
