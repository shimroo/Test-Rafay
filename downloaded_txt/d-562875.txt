              i began knitting custom kilt hose in the 1980s and before that,
              on-demand work for a famous dallas department store's custom
              boutique, all while earning my keep with a "real" job.  1992
              was when i went full-time fiber arts, dyeing all the fibers and
              yarns myself.  silk, wool,  and blends! 
i am now happily online-only except for private trunk shows
              & workshops.

i've
                had patterns in knitter's, knitting digest, threads, lion brand
                yarns and others.  i've exhibited & taught at many
                festivals, including stitches midwest, estes park, taos, big sky
                (mt), dfw, interweave yarn fest, georgia fiber fest, albuquerque
                fiber fiesta, and plyaway!  i've been workshop coordinator
                for both estes park and taos in the past.  see the showcase
                    areas in the blog and on the workshops page for some fun
