        glen acres has specialized programs for all ages, starting from with our nursery on up through our children's, youth, young adults, and adults programs.  developing and teaching everyone to be a disciple of christ is our main focus.
    






        the lord's supper is the primary focus of our gathering every sunday (acts 20:7). this is our special time of recommitment and remembrance of the body and blood of christ sacrificed for our sins (1corinthians 11:23-28). as the emblems are passed all christians are invited to freely partake.
