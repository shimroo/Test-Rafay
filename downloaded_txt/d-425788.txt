  "when it rains it pours" by miles metzger is one of the most popular sculptures in hamilton. this piece was discovered by gayl underwood (richards pizza) on a trip in st. helena, ca. she loved the sculpture so much that she knew she needed to get it to hamilton. gayl contacted city of sculpture and we worked together to purchase the piece and find the perfect location for it.

you can see "when it rains it pours" in person at armstead park, at the corner of main and d.
