adaptive clothing provides easy dressing solutions with adaptive designs for seniors and disabled people. clothes for seniors should be easy to wear so they don’t have to struggle needlessly with narrow neck openings or difficult to button pants waist bands to dress or undress.
adaptive clothing features open back functionality in tops, side open designs in pants, hidden magnetic snap fasteners instead of conventional buttons and easy touch closures in footwear. all these helpful features enable seniors or disabled people to dress with dignity, comfort and style.
who can wear adaptive clothing?
seniors with physical disabilities, wheelchair users, elderly with limited mobility and the infirm who may have difficulty dressing without assistance can benefit from adaptive wear. silvert’s adaptive clothing line is for those individuals who need struggle-free and pain-free dressing options.
for seniors, one of the main difficulties in dressing is not being able to fasten buttons or zippers due to loss of fine motor skills and movement with hands and fingers so materials such as velcro®, easy access snaps, side zippers, and stretchy fabrics are used to provide solutions for self dressing or undressing.
some of the most beneficial features of adaptive clothing options:
magnetic closures on adaptive pants and shirts
easy touch closures
open back tops
side open pants with zippers
elastic waist pants
anti-strip jumpsuits
incontinence clothing
how does adaptive clothing help caregivers and healthcare professionals?
adaptive clothing helps caregivers assist their senior loved ones with special needs with getting dressed. family caregivers and healthcare professionals can greatly benefit from the advantages of adaptive clothing because it makes their task easier and safer. our sensory friendly clothing and adaptive apparel reduces the risk of injuries for caregivers, healthcare workers and the people with disabilities getting dressed.
