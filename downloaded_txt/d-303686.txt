welcome to tamara's backdrops!














































  "if you can dream it, we can paint it." 

back in 1984 we only had three backdrops for rent.  since then, our staff has grown from 1 to 7, and consists of graduates from some of the most prestigious art schools. now, we have over 1800 backdrops on site all available for rent or purchase.
we're pleased to be working with commercial 
photographers, tv production companies, residential and commercial interior designers, architects and now, even those in the internet.  we're creating backdrops and trompe l'oeil murals, for corporate sales meetings, events, tv productions, and elegant residential interiors. restaurants and museums also use our talents.
we've provided you the ease and convenience 
of being able to browse through all our images.  all of our canvas and muslin backgrounds are available for rental or purchase.  if you wish, we can even create a custom backdrop designed to suit your specific needs.
so, please browse our site and if 
you find something you like, call and we can give you a bid for your project.
