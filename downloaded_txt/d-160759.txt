the original series premise 
(1989-1993)        
   

 
"theorizing
that one could time-travel within his own lifetime, dr. sam beckett led
an elite group of scientists into the desert to develop a top secret
project known as quantum leap.

pressured
to prove his theories or lose
funding, dr. beckett prematurely stepped into the project
accelerator... and vanished.


he awoke to
find himself trapped in the past, facing mirror images that were not
his own, and driven by an unknown force to change history for the
better.

his only guide on this journey is al, an observer from
his own time, who appears in the form of a hologram that
only sam can see and hear.

 trapped in
the
past, dr. beckett finds himself leaping from life to life, striving to
put right what once went wrong and hoping each time that his next
leap will be the leap home."



 the
revival series premise (2022-2024)

"dr. ben song risked
everything when he used the
quantum leap accelerator to travel back in time. 
as
he leaps between bodies with no memory
of who he is, he still has one hope:
that
his next leap takes him back
to the place and people he calls home."
