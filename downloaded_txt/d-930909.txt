	 fusia asian cuisine
	 
    


 i had low expectations for a restaurant that offers "sushi bar, thai, vietnamese, malaysian, chinese," but the description of the malaysian curry chicken broth noodle ($7.50) — "spicy curry, creamy coconut milk" — gave me hope of a laksa lemak. no such luck: my noodle soup wasn't very spicy or coconutty; the white-meat chicken might have come straight from the salad bar.  fusia asian cuisine677 lexington ave.

 banks dih, the company that manufactures i-cee soda (10 fl. oz.; $1.25), sterilizes and refills those bottles until they reach the breaking point, to judge by the wear line just below the painted label. by looks alone, there's no way of telling which of their 13 flavors lurks within; after a taste, i'd guess cream soda. as for the spices, the selection here is fine if you're in the neighborhood but not worth traveling far out of your way.spice world168-39 hillside ave., jamaica, queens

	 adnan fish market
	 
    


 not a fresh-fish market; what seafood there is must have been tucked in the top-opening freezers in the back room. the spelling of "guyanise food & spices" is a tip-off that this grocery is now under old world ownership, though the counterwoman, from bangladesh, was very friendly. matouk's hot chow (375 ml.; $3.59), from trinidad and tobago may soon find a home on a hot dog.adnan fish market147-11 hillside ave., jamaica, queens718-297-7146

	 suibi
	 
    


 my first encounter with bitter melon, perhaps ten years ago, was not an enjoyable one. my friend jesse's dad, irv, treated a tableful of us at golden unicorn one sunday afternoon. lovely time, but as for the gourd in question, i did not like it at dim sum. (given the size and energetic eating style of our table, you might also say that i did not like it in a scrum. on later occasions, i would not, could not, with my chums, not even with a tot of rum.)why then try it here? first, at dinner this japanese restaurant offers a handful of set meals from okinawa, new territory to me. second, i'm very fond of scrambles, stews, and other such non-composed dishes — and most of the okinawan set meals feature goya champuru, a mix (champuru) centered on bitter melon (goya). here it's tossed with spam, tofu, and egg (i believe) and topped with shaved bonito, all serving to mute the melon that didn't seem that bitter after all. served with white rice, pickles, and a small bowl of wispy red seaweed than constantly slithered through my chopsticks.for $15.95, a dollar more than the standard version, i ordered the goya champaru with pork brisket — "oki 2," my waitress dubbed it — for a taste of two exceptional fat slices of multitextured pork belly. given another visit, i'd insist on a full serving.okinawan: do try some!suibi232 east 53rd st.

	 frankies 17 spuntino
	 
    


 "that's a tough choice," said my waiter, when asked for his preference between two house-made pastas, tagliatelle with braised lamb ragu and cavatelli with faicco's hot sausage and browned sage butter. we eventually settled on the tagliatelle ($15), a well-proportioned tangle of fresh pasta ribbons, tomato, red pepper, broccoli rabe, and lamb. gently sized, though; even after two fat slices of crusty sullivan street bakery bread with very good olive oil, a side of roasted parsnips ($5), and the tagliatelle, i easily could have polished off the cavatelli, too. (i did skip lunch.) prunes, mascarpone, and a red wine sauce ($6) combined for some intriguing mouthfuls, but i needed a richer cheese on a not-yet-sated stomach. frankies 17 spuntino17 clinton st.

	 momofuku noodle bar
	 
    


 even from the sidewalk, the sight of blonde, bare-wood surfaces warned of a noisy dining room; a crowd of enthusiastic eaters guaranteed it. noting my sideways looks, the couple to my right lavished praise on the folded-over pork buns and the smoked chicken wings with chili, garlic, and scallions, then put them away in convincingly quick fashion. "you really can't go wrong here," said one, as they hurried to their next stop.i lingered somewhat longer over a bowl of pork neck ramen ($13), filled with lots of braised, flavor-packed meat, plus a poached egg, peas, scallions, and (perhaps) bamboo, over thick noodles. nice clear broth might be even better when it's filled with shreds of smoky pork at the bottom of the bowl.momofuku noodle bar163 first ave.
