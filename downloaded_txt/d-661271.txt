why dosprn?
      nowadays, many laser and inkjet printers have powerful features but cannot 
      print simple text accurately. besides, some inexpensive printers (the so-called win-printers) can not 
      print in text mode (dos print or dosprinter mode) at all.
 
dosprn helps to extend the life of old dos programs. this program allows you to print reports from a good old dos program into new printers 
      irrespective of their types (yes, usb and network printers, print-servers, and pdf-printers too!)

dosprin will also be useful if a dos program is in your  native

      dosprn will be a good helper.
dosprn is distributed as shareware. download it 

      now and make dos print free.
