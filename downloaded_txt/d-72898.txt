flight-toys.com | boomerangs, atlatls, slings, chackrum, bolas and panama canal zone with information about artifacts, collectibles and resources










boomerangs, slings, bolas, atlatls and throwing rings.
         all of these aerodynamic devices have their roots as
         primitive airborne missiles used by early man for both
         hunting and sport. these devices are still in use today as
         toys, hunting and sporting implements. flight-toys is your
         one-stop-source for information about these flying objects.
         the links below will take you to the best web pages on the
         internet to obtain information about how they work and where
         you can find them. i have also added links to books and
         collectibles from the panama canal zone which is another of
         my interests. thanks for visiting. if you find any new or
