60 minutes: ex-execs at countrywide & citigroup expose systemic fraud

read more: http://www.businessinsider.com/countrywide-mortgage-fraud-60-minutes-2011-12#ixzz1hqdib0fp and columbia journalism review
a transcript of the interviews is posted at cbs news




4 videos from cbs 60 minutes were taken offline:
1) eileen foster, countrywide and the failure of corporate criminal justice
eileen foster, countrywide and the failure of corporate criminal justice
last month, eileen foster was at the national press club to receive the $10,000 ron ridenhour prize for truth-telling. in 2007, foster was a vice president in charge of investigating fraud at countrywide financial. a full time job, if you can keep it. which she couldnt.
because she took her job seriously.
a countrywide employee in boston called foster with evidence of widespread loan fraud in the boston area.
foster investigated and confirmed the employees report and eventually shut down six countrywide offices in massachusetts.
she started to pursue what appeared to be systemic fraud at the company when the executive suite got itchy.
on september 8, 2008, they came to foster and put a 14-page document on her desk. foster calls that a gag order. they also offered her $228,000. foster calls that hush money. she was told if she accepted the money and signed the document, she could quit. if not, she would be fired.
she was fired.
foster filed a complaint with the department of labor under the sarbanes-oxley whistleblower provisions.
twenty-one out of 1,500 whistleblowers have gotten a favorable response from the department of labor.
so, foster knew it was a bit like hitting the lottery.
but lo and behold, she hit it.
in october 2011, the department of labor ruled in her favor.
and in december 2011, the cbs news show 60 minutes did a story titled prosecuting wall street that featured foster.
now, bank of america, which acquired countrywide, is appealing the department of labors ruling.


2) whistleblower richard bowen hits citigroup, then federal government
whistleblower richard bowen hits citigroup, then federal government
the dallas-based senior vice president for citigroup became one of americas first whistle-blowers on the mortgage crisis. yet, he says, nobody cared.
he battled not only the forces of his mega-corporation but also the federal government, which he says pretended to investigate his allegations but actually covered some of them up.
as readers of the fort worth star-telegram dave lieber watchdog column first learned, in a public talk at the university of texas at dallas school of management, where hes a senior lecturer in accounting, bowen revealed a new set of allegations. this time, his target wasnt his former employer. it was the federal government, which he said did its best to protect top leaders of american finance.
bowen lost his job as senior vice president and senior chief underwriter in citigroup after he complained to top boss robert e. rubin about mortgages bought from other mortgage companies.

video: msnbcs dylan ratigan has a meltdown over the meltdown
visit msnbc.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy

as explained by yahoo news on 8/9/11, 
msnbc's dylan ratigan is mad as hell about the u.s. financial crisis--and he's not gonna take it anymore!

while convening a roundtable discussion on the market meltdown on his eponymous msnbc show on tuesday, ratigan exploded.
"we've got a real problem!" an exasperated ratigan shouted. "this is a mathematical fact! tens of trillions of dollars are being extracted from the united states of america. democrats aren't doing it, republicans aren't doing it. an entire integrated system, financial system, trading system, taxing system, that was created by both parties over a period of two decades is at work on our entire country right now. and we're sitting here arguing about whether we should do the $4 trillion plan that kicks the can down the road for the president for 2017, or burn the place to the ground, both of which are reckless, irresponsible, and stupid."
"i'm sorry to lose my temper," he continued. "but, i tell you what, i've been coming on tv for three years doing this, and the fact of the matter is that there's a refusal on both the democratic and the republican side of the aisle to acknowledge the mathematical problem, which is that the united states of america is being extracted."

mass joinder lawsuits against wamu/chase, countrywide/bofa, gmac etc by a savvy lawyer
most lawyers charge $5,000 to $8,000 plus $2,000 a month to file and maintain a lawsuit.
i find that most people can't afford that, but class action lawsuits only give pennies on the dollar.
there is a lawyer that is joining multiple clients as plaintiffs in 1 lawsuit, and charging very low per month.
(i don't represent him, and i understand he won't let me publish his name.  email me with your phone number, if interested.
or call me at (562)867-3230 if you want to try a lawyer that i've heard is doing a mass joinder.  i'm still reaearching him.

did wamu rip you off when you refinanced?
there is a class action case "cassese v washington mutula, inc" that will allow you to join them.

(this is not for people that currently have a loan that was originated by wamu, only if they refinanced out.)






new cases: court findings against wamu/chase:




florida court finds convincing evidence that wamu, chase and fishman & shapiro committed fraud on this court!




recent 1st lawsuit against chase in georgia:
tammy jo long, castle, davidson v. jpmorgan chase, bank of america, et al
(defendants include 2 retirement plans that are also suing chase) -fulton county superior court	case # 2010cv189005 7/30/2010
just some allegations: "fraud in the factum &a,p; inducement, fraud, assignment & title fraud/ slander of title, violations of the georgia residential mortgage act & mortgage fraud, violation of fair debt collection act, negligent supervision, tortious interference with contract and business relationships, violation of fiduciary duty, violation of duty of good faith & fair dealing"
result = dismissed
defendant removed case to federal court (case#1:2010cv02551  august 13, 2010), asked for a more definite statement, plaintiffs asked for a month extension and only got 2 days, so plaintiffs had to voluntarily dismiss out in dec 2010 for lack of time.




my analysis (i'm not a lawyer, just my non-legal educational opinion):
i find this typical: if there are federal issues like tila, respa, fdcpa, defendant lenders will remove to fed court and get dismissal.
some people allege that federal court sometimes is business friendly, especially in california, and prefer not to allege federal law violations except as state (fraud) causes of action, so you can remain in state court.
(in contradiction, i talked to 1 juris doctor that stated that most federal courts are better than state courts, except california and 9th circuit)
1 good strategy is to fight with adversary proceeding in bankruptcy, where you can often request the original of the note.   most federal and even state courts won't help you with that.
optimum is to find a good lawyer that can do adversary proceeding or state complaints well and knows the securitization issues taught by neil garfield and others.





refiled - 2nd ga case filed 11/1/2010 case # 2010cv192811 fulton county superior court
tammy jo lon, castle home builders v. jpmorgan chase, bank of america, et al
(1 less defendant, no defendant retirement fund, lps added etc)
(this new case is in progress in state court)








horror story 2011: chase forecloses during loan mod, while promising not to
anaheim, ca: the husband got sick a few years ago with advanced diabetes his kidneys have failed, hes on dialysis heart disease hes spent time on a respirator while hospitalized.   the asked for a loan mod, and fulfilled the first payment plan, but instead of giving them a loan mod, chase gave them a higher payment plan, and foreclosed in the middle of it.  a chase rep always told them to ignore the notice of sale because of the loan mod.  we trusted the bank, the mom says, like idiots.  at unlawful detainer, the ud mill lawyer for mccarthy and holthus (kevin mello) used threats to force their signature on an agreement to move in 30 days.  [as kevin mello approached them, they heard him tell someone im so sick of all these sob stories.).   luckily, a local lawyer is filing a lawsuit for them.  read more by mandelmann matters






more fraud: robosigners discovered by attorneys general
fraud found by courts = recorded documents by major lenders were found to be "robo-signed"
some title companies will no longer offer title insurance on foreclosed homes?

gmac mortgage, of ally bank, was sanctioned by courts in both maine and florida for affidavits signed under penalty of perjury
without the signor reading anything. gmac has now woken up and stopped the practice, perhaps too late.
the avalanche has started against these "robo-signed" affidavits.   title companies, attorneys general, lawmakers are very upset,
the backlash has started -and the effects are becoming devastating to lenders, especially gmac, wamu/chase, indymac/onewest, bank of america, and pnc financial.

2 title companies (fidelity national and old republic national title) are now refusing to insure loans by some lenders, especially gmac

a 3rd title co, stewart title is making it difficult to get insurance on foreclosures by jp morgan chase, bank of america, onewest bank or ally/gmac.


at least three more lenders stop foreclosures after admitting to paperwork problems.


cnbc: jp morgan chase is also temporarily suspending its foreclosures while it looks into the truthfulness of affidavits signed to support those foreclosures.


sept. 30 / washington post: an executive from onewest bank, successor to failed indymac, admitted that nobody on her team reads the 6,000 documents they sign in a week.


on october 8, bank of america is the first u.s. bank to institute a nationwide moratorium on foreclosures as anger grows at how lenders have prepared documents to support evictions.   
litton loan servicing lp, ally financial's gmac mortgage unit and jpmorgan chase are reviewing procedures and halting some foreclosure


the texas attorney general's office has called for a halt on all foreclosures, all sales of properties previously foreclosed upon and all evictions of persons residing in previously foreclosed upon properties until companies have completed a review of their processes.   
the review includes "robo-signed" affidavits and other documents which were recorded in the state of texas.   
the ags office sent out letters to 30 loan servicers.


maryland lawmakers requested the state's highest court to temporarily halt foreclosures


iowa attorney general tom miller is calling on ally financial's gmac mortgage unit, bank of america, and jpmorgan chase to halt foreclosure proceedings in the state while he investigates problems with documents filed with the courts.


the attorneys general of up to 40 states plan to announce soon a joint investigation into banks' use of flawed foreclosure paperwork.jpmorgan chase & co., ally bank's gmac mortgage unit and pnc financial have stopped foreclosures in the 23 states where foreclosures must be approved by a judge.    
sen. christopher dodd, d-conn., the chairman of the senate banking committee, said he would hold a hearing on the issue next month.



2005-2008 wamu investment securities trusts purchased the note -not a "loan"
no disclosure of asset-backed investment securities = fraud?
asset-backed security trusts purchased notes = not a "loan" entitled to a trust deed
most "loans" by washington mutual, indymac, countrywide, and most  other "lenders" in the past 5 years were actually purchases of notes by  special purpose vehicles created by lehman brothers.   these special  purpose vehicles were securitization trusts pre-funded by investors for  the purpose of purchasing notes to enable the trust to be an asset  backed security.    

the "lender" named in the note and deed of trust or mortgage (e.g.  wamu, indymac, countrywide, etc) did not fund the transaction, and  therefore was not really the "lender".    they acted only as a "nominal  lender", named in the note only to facilitate the creation of a deed of  trust or mortgage to secure the note as a loan, when it was not a  loan, but rather an investment security.        frank j. fabozzi and vinod  kothari, in their book "introduction to securitization" state on page 5  "the asset securitization process transforms a pool of assets into one  or more securities that are referred to as asset-backed securities." 

securitization is one type of structured finance, and in the case of  wamu, indymac, countrywide, and most other "nomimal lenders" in the  past few years, applies to the inclusion of most notes into asset-backed  securities.

the legal ramifications of this process are that there was no loan funded  by the "nominal lender".  in fact, it can be alleged in court that the  "nominal lender" was paid in full, plus a commission.   also, the deed of  trust or mortgage can't secure an investment security, and the  homeowner was tricked into thinking he was a borrower in a loan,  when he was a seller of a note to an investment trust.   the investment trust had no right to a deed of trust or mortgage to a purchased note  that was not a loan.    the "nominal lender" shouldn't be able to foreclose on an asset in an investment security with an invalid deed of trust or mortgage,  fraudulently procured under the guise of a "loan", when it wasn't a loan,  but rather the "purchase of a note" into an asset-backed investment  security, and the "nominal lender" was paid in full, plus a commission  for something it did not fund.

can a "nominal lender" that didn't fund the transaction, but rather  fraudulently allowed its name to be put on a note and deed of trust or  mortgage to trick a homeowner into signing a deed of trust or mortgage  to secure an investment security, assign a beneficial right it never had  to another beneficiary?

wamu almost never assigns the deed of trust or mortgage, but  forecloses directly or through chase, its new owner.

wamu is the servicer, and trust wording also calls it the originator, but the trust purchased the notes directly -wamu did not fund the loan.
the trust was fully formed before the purchase, and it wired the funds into escrow.  the originator almost never funds directly to sell it.
fraud can be alleged that the borrower was tricked into believing it was a loan to procure a deed of trust or mortgage, and the true nature of transaction was not disclosed.
fraud can also be alleged (after research) that the pool insurance paid the investors after multiple defaults and foreclosures.  if they were paid, why the foreclosure?
further, fraud can be alleged that the deed of trust (ucc 9) is invalid for an investment security (ucc 8) (you can't have both).  a foreclosure is improper, and should be voidable.

credit enhancement is used to sweeten securitization trusts. trusts containing sub-prime notes usually have pool insurance to cover defaults and foreclosure.   if enough notes go into default and foreclosure, the insurance pays off the investors.   the servicer usually continues to foreclose, even though the investors were paid poff.
other insurance is often procured for fraud arising in the origination process -if you win for fraud, they can collect that insurance, as well.  
indymac was foreclosing itself, but now it often forecloses through either  onewest bank, its new owner, or through deutsche bank, trustee for  the asset-backed security.

reject "fake customer service"
from the "bank from hell"
it appears washington mutual commits fraud by:

1) non-disclosure and false disclosure,   
2) violating respa by never answering letters of dispute (qualified written requests), 
3) violating ca civil code 2943 by not supplying a payoff demand statement requested by mail,
3) illegal accounting that doesn't follow generally accepted accounting principles
4) predatory practices, such as forced escrows, & logging payments weeks after receipt,
5) giving primarily "liar's loans" (no document loans), where they know most people can't qualify otherwise,
6) refusing to do loan workouts, & failing to contact hud for client help & signoffs,
7) often combining all of the above to foreclose on whole neighborhoods nationwide.

wamu, indymac and liar's loans
indymac bank just went under because it had acquired lots of "liar's loans" (no document loans) where borrowers are encouraged to lie about their income.  the bank doesn't ask for 1040's or other documents, because they know most people don't qualify, so they encourage fraud by not asking for any documentation.  washington mutual bank also has lots of liar's loans, and some speculate that it will be the next big bank to fall after indymac bank.  some say liar's loans were sought after, because it was an easy way to acquire more bank-owned properties faster.  i guess they didn't know how fast!

the orange county register (ca) printed 2 articles on case no. 02cc15162:
oct. 9, 02: wamu "sold clara and francisco alonso's $650,000 yorba linda
house from under them because of a $51.56 error."  
on tuesday, a judge called the foreclosure "horrendous."
  
"undo this transaction," orange
county superior court judge james p. gray told washington mutual

oct. 23, 02: "bank returns family's home" (wamu "sold house due to $51.56 error")
(judge: "... make sure this doesn't happen again." "we're really dealing with people's lives here."


according to a usa today 10/8/02 article:  "they received a default notice, but in july
2002 entered into a repayment agreement with the bank by which they would
make monthly payments in the amount of $3,994.89, beginning in august
2002. on august 30, 2002, mrs. alonso went in person to washington
mutual to make the first payment, but did not have a copy of the repayment
agreement with her. she asked a teller to look up her home loan account and
was told that the amount due was $3,943.33. relying on that information, she
wrote a check for that amount. 
on september 10th, the alonsos received a letter from washington mutual,
returning their check and informing them that, as partial payments were not
acceptable, the loan was immediately in foreclosure. their efforts to pay the
remaining $51.56 fell through as they were never able to connect with the
bank's designated officer, even though repeated attempts were made.
washington mutual informed plaintiffs that if they did not enter into a
modification of their repayment plan, they would foreclose on the house on
september 24, 2002. to their complete shock, the alonsos learned that their
home sold at foreclosure on september 20, 2002."

reader feedback on this website: (just a few of the many)

i just recently quit wamu....  you can not be an honest person and work there.  everything you have stated here in your website is true.  

do you know if any class actions have been started to address the predatory way wamu charges checking accounts (in my
daughter's case) hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees which they incur by timing postings to the disadvantage of the account
holders?

i am a former loan consultant with wm. i was terminated for criticizing the poor customer service the clients
received and for sending a copy of a credit report to the customer who had been involved in an auto accident and did not understand
what was going on. i was only trying to help the poor woman. in the 13 months i was employed by wm, i had witnessed some of the most
appalling incompetence ever. documents were routinely lost and clients could never get the status of their loan. some loans lasted over a year.
wm is company of failures and does not fire incompetent and mediocre managers, just recycles them.
customers do not realize the risk they run by applying online or over the phone. just a punk kid on the other end
who really does not care.

i fedex'd a cashier's check to bring a mortgage current on behalf of a client that wamu received and signed for 1/3/02.  they did not post the funds until june. 
 the entire time they threatened to begin foreclosue (again).  i had to get the dept of commerce involved for them to admit they even received the money

i have had nothing but problems with washington mutual from the day they took my loan over. i would say that my
experiences mirror all the others i have read.
my husband filed a complaint with the u.s. attorneys office in san jose, ca. in order for the u.s. attorney to
have the fbi  investigate the charges and not treat it as a civil matter i need everyone who has posted to all the
sites to send their information to :
united states attorney
federal building
third floor duty attorney
280 so. first street
san jose, ca 95113


few weeks ago i refinanced my mortgage. my previous lender was fleet bank (i was very happy with them), approximately 1 year
ago my loan was purchased by washington mutual. since the day it happened the process that used to be a "regular bill payment
procedure" became a lengthy, confusing and full of surprises set of events. i found that by sending my bill between 1 and 5th of each
month hardly made it to be paid by 16th !!!!!!!! 
my point is i tend to agree with you that they might have been posting payments late just to charge the late fee.

june 2001 wamu lost a electronic payment which put me delinquent 30 days every month untin january 2002. they have proof
that the payment was sent but claim never to have recieved it. one of the customer service reps actually told me that the post
office was to blame for the damage done to my credit and there was nothing that they would do for me. 

wamu gave 
my loan to their sub-servicer, litton loan servicing, over 60 days ago. i 
filed a respa complaint and a dispute may 11 with litton, and now they are in 
violation of respa and my loan contract also! 
my att'y believes that wamu has violated my contract, meaning wamu should 
have to pay all attorneys fees.

i filed for a car loan with wm, during 
this initial sign-up, we paid to have the vehicle registered. well, come a 
few months later, i get pulled over because the vehicle shows up 
unregistered.  we finally discover that the papers 
for the registration could not be found.  in other words, the vehicle was 
never registered, and the papers for this loan are missing.  we had the 
cancelled check. after about a year of playing phone tag with at 
least 4 different wm departments, they finally decide to cut a check to dmv 
to pay for the registration.  yet, refused to pay for our car rental fees, 
since we could not drive the vehicle, nor our time off from work, we had to 
take to get this matter taken care of.  

wamu let someone walk into a branch office, switch addresses on both a
money market account, a checking account, and set up telephone banking.  a few
days later, this guy does about 5 telephone transfers from the mm acct
into the checking acct and, of course, writes checks to everyone.
i didn't realize that this was happening or that statements had stopped
coming...  wamu tells me that they're not going to
provide restitution claiming that i'd exceeded the statutes for notifying
them of a problem.
i filed an id theft report to the california department of motor
vehicles and the woman who took my report said that just that morning, her
fraud unit had this big "what's-with-washington-mutual?" discussion.  the
california dmv gets a lot of these id theft claims, but she said that a
large percentage of them centered around wamu and the dmv investigators were
questioning if something was up with that bank.  i'm sure it's more than
coincidental--that bank is out-of-control.





washington mutual appears to have explicitly broken 4 federal laws:
1) 15 usc § 1601 et seq.:  truth in lending requires that banks disclose all details of the transaction
2) 12 usc § 1831n(2)(a):  requires banks to follow "uniform accounting principles consistent with gaap"
3) 12 usc § 2605 respa: requires that banks acknowledge & respond to a "qualified written request".
4) 15 usc § 1611  whoever willfully and knowingly (1) gives false or inaccurate information or fails to provide information which he is required to disclose under the provisions of this subchapter or any regulation, 
washington mutual also appears to have broken state laws:

1) business and professions code 17200  (for unfair and deceptive business practices), 
2) unjust enrichment, 
3) breach of fiduciary duty, 4) conversion,    
5) negligence and 
6) violations of the (wa & ca) consumer protection act
7) violations of california civil code 2943 for not supplying payoff demand statements, if requested by mail
wow!! they and the trustee (calif reconveyance) break civil code 2943, too!!!
i have repeatedly requested the payoff demand statement by mail: they just ignore it!



i have found washington mutual impossible to work with
mortgage payments sent in plenty of time were always posted as late, so i have had to go into the branch and buy a money order and have them send it to avoid more late charges.  it appears from lawsuits and complaints from others that this is how they make extra money.
i had a prop. 13/prop. 58 property tax reduction that the la county assessor disallowed until i won the appeal.  (after that, the tax collector just wasn't coordinating with the assessor yet.)  when i wrote washington mutual on 11/13/98 about the situation, they refused to answer my letters and paid the tax collector the wrong amount, and caused near foreclosure many times by extorting larger payments and late charges, until i got the tax collector to refund their overpayment ($3,000).
i have found major irregularities in their disclosure and accounting practices.  i started writing them on this in november 2001, and have been writing them since.  they overtly break respa law by refusing to even acknowledge my letters (all sent certified mail w/ return receipt), let alone answer them.
i have filed complaints with the bbb and the federal office of thrift supervision, among others.
washington mutual will not answer any letters on any subject!
(this is a direct violation of respa law! -do they want lawsuits?)


they break california civil code 2943 by not providing a payoff demand statement when requested by mail, as well.




we should all complain to the office of thrift supervision, but they try very hard to close the case, even for a bogus reason.  when i found out wamu's ceo kerry killinger was on the board of directors of the ots, i learned why.  the fox is at the head of the chicken-coop security.

washington mutual argued that the claims should be dismissed because the federal real estate settlement and procedures act preempts state laws and there is no federal private right of action for respa violations. washington mutual also argued that respa does not prohibit lenders from adding extra charges onto the actual costs of services obtained from third parties such as credit bureaus. 
if you were the judge would you rule the federal respa law prohibits home loan borrowers from suing lenders in state courts for overcharges? 
the judge said no! 
the primary purposes of respa, the judge explained, are to prevent illegal kickbacks and rebates, as well as to inform home loan borrowers of their complete costs. these disclosures are made to borrowers on hud-1 forms, he noted. 
neither respa nor regulation x, which sets out the rules for the good faith estimate of loan charges, expressly preempts private borrower rights of action under state laws for violations, he emphasized. if borrowers were prohibited from suing lenders in state courts for alleged disclosure violations, consumers would be left without any practical legal remedy, since respa does not establish a private right of action under federal law, the judge added.

more about what i have discovered, which most lawyers do not raise in current lawsuits:
washington mutual mortgages are funded by exchanges not loans


when i entered into the mortgage, i thought that the bank was "loaning" me funds from depositors.
i thought that because there was a risk to depositor funds, the interest rate charged was justified.
most others believe the same, and this is considered "generally accepted accounting principles" (gaap) by cpas and other accountants.
the agreement called for a repayment of over $300,000 over a period of 30 years for a "loan" of $144,000.  is this usurious, if they never lent me their own money, and risked nothing?

after reading tom schauf's books at 
  i got and studied booklets published by the federal reserve banks themselves.
in these booklets, i learned that the bank risked no capital.

tom schauf is a cpa & an expert lecturer on banking,
but the booklets themselves tell the truth of the nature of the agreement.
i have learned that banks can deposit my promissory note into an account and take that money and hand it back to me.  this is an exchange, not a loan.  the promissory note that i gave them was the instrument that was deposited to create the money that was given to me.  this was an exchange, not a loan of depositors' money: no bank capital was risked.


recommendations:
i recommend buying tom schauf's 2 books ($20 each): 
america's hope to cancel bank loans without going to court & 
the american voters vs. the banking system the technical guide to america's hope.
(they are easy to read, but often repetitious).
tom schauf's approach requires taking the bank to court.
cpa opinion letters from other cpas, which explain the actual exchange (not loan) process can be enlightening in court.  you should hire a cpa to testify and explain the process in court, as well.  i'm using a great cpa here, near la.
for a while, i suggested letting lawyers zero out mortgages by
depositioning wamu officials and forcing wamu to release the mortgage by reconveyance

full disclosure was not made of the nature of the transaction.
because the nature of the transaction is contrary to gaap (generally accepted accounting principles), and is against what the public believes in general, i believe this non-disclosure of the true nature of the transaction is fraud.
i firmly believe that the public needs to know about this deception, and i believe that a jury would be appalled to learn of this massive deception.  i believe it is necessary for someone to properly use discovery in a court of law and set precedent in federal court, especially in appellate court.  if possible, this should be brought to the supreme court.
to complicate the situation, washington mutual is breaking respa laws, because it is apparently afraid to answer my questions.  i have been asking washington mutual questions about these matters since november 2001, and they refuse to answer.  respa requires them to acknowledge my letters and clarify the dispute.  they appear to prefer to break the law than to answer my letters.
