tournaments















we host two marquee tournaments during the season.
we kick off the season with the jr. amerks kyle's slap shot tournament, our annual fundraising supporting kyle's slap shot challenge foundation to benefit ur medicine golisano children's hospital.  this tournament is exclusively for jr. amerks players. players of all ages at all levels of play come together for friendly 3v3 competition and a chance to win some big prizes in our hardest slap shot competition!
each spring we host our annual big thaw hockey tournament in memory of willard "bud" parker, jr. our official celebratory end to the season, house teams from all over the region join us to play a four-game minimum and compete for division championships. there are medals, tournament awards and player mvp awards for participants.
a portion of the proceeds from the big thaw tournament is donated to the jr. amerks sean shortsleeve memorial scholarship fund to help families in need cover their season dues.
