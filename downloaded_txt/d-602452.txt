welcome to moddinstep by step solutions to common it problems











hi there! i am allan geyer. moddin is my online collection of hardware and software tips.



















i've been passionate about hardware since the 90s, when i got my first computer.it was using a buggy processor, because my parents couldn't afford to purchase me one with an intel cpu. so, after seeing that many applications refuse to run properly, i had to work hard for a few years before getting myself a proper replacement. truth be told, to minimize any incompatibility risks, i've only purchased intel-based computers for myself since then.these days i work as a hardware engineer for one of the leading computer makers. moddin is my constantly growing collection of articles which aim to help beginners get as much value as possible out of their hardware and software purchases. so, feel free to pay my site a visit every now and then; you may discover interesting computer-related guides.
