with potential government funding cuts, nonprofits must resist fear-driven reactions and focus on what truly secures their future: philanthropy. grants come and go, but donor relationships, major gifts, and planned giving provide long-term stability. relying on political shifts is a gamble—fundraising is the only strategy that puts nonprofits in control. every handout comes with strings attached, and eventually, those strings can tighten. now is the time to invest in donor engagement, think strategically, and build financial independence. the strongest nonprofits aren’t the ones that panic; they’re the ones that plan.
