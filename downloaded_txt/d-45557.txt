sticky post

of friendingif you are here because i friended you, don't be so bewildered! it's because i saw something i like about you, be that metas, fics, or other things. i've never been arrested of stalkering before, don't worry. :)of de-friendingwhen i friended, i read, and it's hard to keep up sometimes. if i couldn't give you the attention you deserve anymore, or our interests divert, or some other things, i might eventually de-friend you.anyone who want to friend me, go ahead, you don't have to ask me first.comment to be added | report broken links & images

my year in fan fic/fan art 2010!


dec. 31st, 2010 at 1:49 pm



 

fanfic:i've written 2 fics in bakuman fandom"seeing the forest for the trees" / 3,088 words / spoilers for chappie 71 to 73 /  akira/mashiro moritakameeting hattori by chance at a diner, mashiro seized the opportunity to ask what had been plaguing his mind and even though he didn't plan to go further than a few questions, it's not like he regret it. hattorimy comment: i ♥♥♥ hattori a lot, maybe even more than the ashirogi duo. xd i couldn't help but write something when i read chapter 71 and saw how upset the duo was over hattori's actions. heck, i've been entertaining this thought since maybe after their editor was changed to miura. i think i could write a lot more on this story, but i guess it will have to stay like this at least for a while. :p"love, love, love!" / 381 words / spoilers for chapter 113 / implied eiji/moritaka"dear ashirogi-sensei, you are going to teach me about loves"my comment: i don't even know! it's totally random and so silly. i'm not even sure why i posted it in the first place. xdi've written 1 fic in hikaru no go fandom"one story (twelves things to dream about)" / ko yeongha/shindo hikaru1st story: ko yeongha is a mean, mean boy...fanart:nil, nada, zilch... sowwy... >_>

double standard, much?


dec. 14th, 2010 at 2:47 pm



 

it annoys me when people stated their dislike about a manga, and got told by others to stop reading, because "don't like, don't read". that is actually generally good policy, but when you start saying that it's wrong to share opinions on things one doesn't like because one shouldn't be reading it in the first place; that's where the double standard came into action.by saying that sharing opinions about things one dislikes is wrong, don't you think you are being contrary to your preach? you are reading the opinions you don't like, and decided to do something about it.if you truly believed in your preach, stop reading such opposing opinions and let it go. and if you must do something about it, do it in your own place.and don't get me start on the "free speech" craps, it might get ugly...edit to fixed typos and such

ibuprofen is something sent from heaven!


sep. 29th, 2009 at 9:19 pm



 

yes, yes, you know you want to see me update twice a day.health update: i'm suffering from a slight case of common flu. nothing serious. what worried me is my left knee...last saturday (20 sep) i slipped in the bathroom and my kneecap impacted pretty hard on that slightly-raised-floor-thingy-in-the-doorway-that-prevents-water-from-spilling-out-of-the-shower (not bathtub!).my doctor sent me for an x-ray. the specialist wasn't too sure if my kneecap was broken from this impact or not, but right then i felt fine. i was taking ibuprofen for my period though, so i wasn't reliable to judge my own suffering. :p but the bruises are still present today and when i was at work the pain got pretty bad. it got worse when i took the bus home. dddddd:it hurt like hell. probably need to see the doc again, just in case.
