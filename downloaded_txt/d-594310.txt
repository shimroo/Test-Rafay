energy briefing event 2024



the annual energy briefing event of the paul scherrer institute's center for energy and environmental sciences (cee) took place on 15 may 2024.under the theme "hydrogen in the energy sector", experts such as stefan oberholzer (sfoe), bruno michel (ibm), nicolas crettenand (hydrospider ag), russell mckenna (psi laboratory for energy systems analysis (lea) and werner tillmetz (h2connect.eco) gathered to present pioneering projects and discuss the strategic steps for integrating hydrogen into the swiss energy industry.the lively debate emphasised the central importance of cooperation between research, education, industry and politics for the development of a sustainable energy future. from neighbourhood solutions to the development of a european hydrogen network, key ways of tackling the challenges and seizing opportunities were outlined.we are eagerly awaiting the hydrogen strategy that the federal council will present this year!
