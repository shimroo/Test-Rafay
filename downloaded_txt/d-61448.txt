kansas city boat & sportshow®

february 2-5, 2023

2023 cancelled



h. roe bartle hall









show info / tickets







show cancelled indefinitely 
we regrettably are cancelling the kansas city boat & sportshow until further notice.  unfortunately the kc convention center (bartle hall) gives date preferences to larger conventions before offering space to public expos.  for 2024 they have offered us only early january or easter weekend dates, neither of which will work.  we cannot produce an event in 2023 without options to successfully stage one in 2024.  we continue to pursue options within the kc market to find a partnering venue which will provide acceptable dates annually allowing us to successfully produce an event for the outdoor sporting and boating communities.
