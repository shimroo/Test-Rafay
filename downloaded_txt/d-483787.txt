our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion 



the board of pensions shares the presbyterian church (u.s.a.)’s commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion and to dismantling structural racism. we are moving with intention to ensure a workplace culture that inspires a sense of belonging. and we are engaging throughout the church to remove barriers to participating in plans and programs that provide wholeness.  


 







our mission, vision, and values 



as an agency of the presbyterian church (u.s.a.), we serve employers and employees with hospitality, excellence, and grace amid a culture of hope and belonging. the benefits and programming we offer support holistic well-being, reflecting god’s desire that all people flourish. the faithful stewardship and accountability we practice ensure that we keep our commitments.
 








who we serve

the board of pensions partners with presbyterian church (u.s.a.) congregations, agencies, and mid councils as well as affiliated employers — like educational institutions, camps and conference centers, retirement and senior housing communities, and human services organizations — to serve approximately 65,000 people through the benefits plan. 






what we offer

we offer a broad range of benefits, including medical, dental, vision, retirement, death and disability, and flexible spending accounts. build a benefits package that best meets the needs of your organization and your employees.

                                                        committed to wholeness
                                                    

our commitment to members' wholeness is reflected through our benefits. programs like call to health, lifelong learning, and credo focus on one or more areas of wholeness: spiritual, health, financial, and vocational.
