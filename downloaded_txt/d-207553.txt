    thunder through the valleys: low level flying - low level photography 
two books in one, my book covers military low flying and the challenges faced by the photographer. the main subject is about military low-flying - the skills, reasons and dangers from a pilot's perspective. the many commanders, pilots and mission planners interviewed explain the challenges they face flying fast and low day and night. pilots describe their training, planning, systems and their most memorable missions flying the aircraft they love from the; a-7 corsair, f-4 phantom, tucano, tornado, sk 60, b-1b lancer, f-16 fighting falcon, f-16i sufa, f/a-18 super hornet to even the f-22 raptor. as the sole photographer i reveal how and where images were taken from mountainsides to desert canyons and from cockpits for air to air images.
