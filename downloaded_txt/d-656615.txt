i was unable to get an appointment with my regular vet when my dog was sick and the kind folks at rau fit us right in. they made us feel welcome and so comfortable -as if we were long time clients! great, compassionate care and thoughtful follow-up phone calls. thank you, rau!

joan










i continue to be thrilled with the care that my dog and cat have received. recently, my black lab had dental exam, cleaning and extraction of a cracked tooth. i knew what to expect and the doctors communicated very clearly and promptly, and their care for my dog was outstanding.

we are so pleased with the care and attention given to our cat when she underwent surgery at rau animal hospital. dr. jill rosenblatt handled everything so beautifully and we recommend her heartily.

robert










i have been bringing my pets- cats and dogs since 1987. everyone from the people at the front desk to the nurses to the techs in the back to the vets have always been courteous and helpful.
