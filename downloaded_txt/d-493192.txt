 falling on the reputational grenade, part ii





the other day, i had the thought that, sometime in the next four years, we will likely see the first legal filing by a government lawyer that will include some ai-hallucinated citations. leaving aside that this is already happening with private firms (including sizeable ones) and so it only seems a matter of time, we also are entering the realm of overconfident and underqualified tech bros ransacking their way through washington. ai-generated legal briefs are exactly the sort of "optimization" i can imagine musk and his doge youth pushing out onto the bureaucracy, with predictably farcical results.generally, courts have responded rather mercilessly to lawyers who've submitted ai-generated hallucinated cases. their reputations are ruined, and the underlying case is permanently discredited. and that thought got me thinking -- what would happen if an enterprising government lawyer decided to sabotage their own case by deliberately inserting ai-hallucinations into it?imagine the birthright citizenship case -- already viewed as a legal non-starter, with the usual conservative guns-for-hire flailing about trying and failing to whip up an even halfway plausible mechanism for circumventing the constitution's clear text and history. in court, the doj files a brief citing some late 19th century caselaw that seems to endorse a narrower view of the citizenship clause than currently prevails ... but it turns out that the citations are all made up.such a move would detonate the department's credibility. as a form of internal sabotage, it would be devastatingly effective -- but (in here's the rub) only if the public didn't know it was sabotage. if the ruse was revealed, the plan doesn't work (having one's own attorney deliberately sabotage your case is not the sort of thing held against the client). but if the public remains unaware, the attorney who made the "mistake" would have committed career suicide twice over -- first, in putting his name on a defense of whatever neo-fascist trump policy is before the court, and then second being a public laughingstock by "defending" it via inept use of generative ai.during the first trump administration, i wrote about actors who were knowingly wrecking their reputation by working in the oval office on the (probably correct) theory that if they didn't do it, someone worse would. they knew that history would view them as a villain, and accepted that judgment in order to avert greater evil. the above example is a perhaps even more extreme case -- a sort of reputational suicide bomber. the attorney would sabotage some great evil, but at the cost of everyone for all time thinking of him as trump's most incompetent lickspittle.we saw recently a longtime doj attorney, ed sullivan, agree to file a motion to dismiss the eric adams indictment, reportedly to avert a complete and total purge of the public integrity unit by one of trump's cronies. the order to dismiss the adams case had already led to widespread resignations over what was transparent quid-pro-quo corruption -- trading non-prosecution in exchange for adams' cooperation in enforcing trumpist immigration policies. sullivan reportedly agreed to fall on the grenade so as to spare his colleagues; this has in turn generated a roaring debate over whether sullivan was right to do so or should have forced trump's lackey to fully reenact the saturday night massacre. i don't here make any judgment on which side of that debate got things right. but we're going to see more difficult questions as those on the inside consider how to resist abuse and forestall catastrophe. and while we like to imagine that the "right" choice at least comes with the perk of being viewed heroically, the more interesting choices may be ones where it is precisely one's reputation that must be sacrificed in order to truly avert the greatest evil.

cry, the beloved infant





my baby is one month old today.at one month, he doesn't do much. one month is too young to crawl or sit up or babble. he doesn't even make many facial expressions yet. crying is really his main move.perhaps unsurprisingly, i've been reflecting on baby cries of late. and i don't think we give them enough credit. in particular, a baby's cry is a profound expression of trust. a baby cries based on an innate, unshakeable trust that if they communicate they are in distress, someone will try to help them.that's hardly something to take for granted. we could imagine instead the logic of "if i communicate i am  in distress, a predator will know i'm vulnerable." or "why bother communicating i am in distress, nobody cares." but babies operate on the firm belief that when they are truly in need, others will care for them.we could take a bit of inspiration from that. all around us and all over the world, there are people in need of help. and too often, their sincere, agonized, plaintive cries for help are ignored -- a truly awful sensation. of course, none of us (well, maybe not none of us) can help everyone. but most of us can do more. we can try to be a little better than we were yesterday. we can respond to the cries of others, and vindicate the first, most basic trust we are born with.

they're the same picture





the jta has an interesting profile on a "new" right-wing zionist organization, betar ("new" in quotes because it claims to be a resurrection of a much older zionist outfit active before israel's founding). betar has distinguished itself by its "confrontational" approach -- meaning that it engages in acts of vandalism and violence, and openly calls for things like ethnic cleansing of palestinians and the expansion of israel's borders well beyond the west bank and gaza and into modern jordan, egypt, and syria.critical readers will spot a lot of commonalties between betar and the more hardline elements of the pro-palestinian movement. most obviously, betar uses almost identical rhetorical maximalism -- compare "we don't want two states, we want all of it" heard at pro-palestinian protests with betar's recent statement "we don’t want peace. we don’t want co-existence" -- and simply asks listeners to "choose a side". pick your preferred ethnic cleanser and cleansee.but there are some other commonalities. perhaps the most important one to flag is that betar hates "moderate" jews as much if not more than it hates palestinians, and its definition of "moderate" includes many jews whom external observers would view as hardliners. consider betar's confrontational relationship with columbia professor shai davidai, who has organized aggressive (to say the least) counterprotests aimed at pro-palestinian activism on campus and had to deal with a betar element crashing his event:despite their tiny size, the betar contingent immediately worried davidai. most of them were young men, he recalled; several covered their faces; one had a flag of the jewish defense league, an extremist group that the united states has designated as a terrorist organization. “all they did was scream ‘f— gaza,’ ‘gaza is ours,’ ‘here’s a beeper for you,’ ‘deport them all,’ ‘ice, ice, ice,’” he said. “just violent rhetoric.”davidai is no stranger to provocation: last fall, columbia barred him from campus after months of his vocal criticisms of the university’s handling of antisemitism. yet he views betar as a serious obstacle to the movement he was trying to build, not least because they were adapting the same tactics as the pro-palestinian side: expressing support for a terror group and hiding their faces as they did so.“i think it’s hypocritical to spend 16 months blaming all protesters who are in this free palestine movement for not policing their own protesters, but then let hatred and violence take root in yours,” davidai said. “i said, ‘look, you’re doing exactly what we’re telling them not to do….’  at some point i asked them, ‘go do your thing, but don’t be associated with us.’ they refused.”after the rally, betar and its followers began targeting him online. on instagram he blasted them for only joining counter-protests, while never showing up to rallies for israeli hostages. the rhetoric has only escalated from there, as betar has mobilized its followers against him, in public and private. “you will be disrupted at all future speeches,” torossian messaged davidai on whatsapp, according to communications shared with jta. “you are a radical.”davidai has also urged his followers against supporting any further killings or mass expulsions in gaza, a stark contrast to betar’s own stated views. yet in the comments, many of davidai’s own followers have begun taking betar’s side, accusing him of naively trying to make peace with the enemy.there are some lessons to be learned here. one lesson is that there will always be someone more aggressive, confrontational, and hardline than you, and those actors will prove almost impossible to police. moreover, they (in many ways correctly) view more "moderate" elements of their own community as their most important and salient competition and will ruthlessly try to attack and suppress those they deem "traitors" or "appeasers" in order to accumulate more power to themselves as the "authentic" voice of "true resistance" (this certainly characterizes how the bds movement has been going after standing together, for instance). and finally, leaders of social groups that simultaneously play footsie with the sort of extreme rhetoric while assuaging themselves that of course their actual politics are humanitarian and egalitarian, they're just revving up a crowd or exaggerating for effect, will quickly learn that much of their base isn't in on the bit. they're in it for the hate, and when someone offers that hate better, they won't listen to your attempts to rein things back in.there's also a very important lesson not to learn here. for some people, it is important to hear about groups like betar so to disabuse any notions that calls for ethnic cleansing and political violence are only something "they" (the other side) does, whereas "our" movement is purely one of peace and coexistence. that illusion is dangerous and must be dispelled. but for others, the main function of groups like betar is to give people a permission structure for their own counter-maximalism, because "this is what they're really like". if they're out there saying "gaza is ours", what choice do we have but to fling them into the sea? if they're out there saying "israel must be rooted out and destroyed", what choice do we have but to "transfer" them out of gaza? there are a lot of people who just love the betars or the within our lifetimes of the world, and are constantly searching for examples of the genre. it's not because they agree with them. it's because their existence gives license to be as extreme and uncompromising and hateful as you want, because have you seen what they want?the only way out of that trap is to recognize that it's the same picture. these organizations may have different preferred winners and losers, but they're fundamentally on the same side -- trying to convince you that the only choice there is to make is choosing your preferred extremism. and that is a false choice. as important as it is to name and shame these sorts of extremists, if you're main motivation in doing so is to validate your preconceived notion that this sort of extremism is the actual true authentic core of an entire people or culture, then you are not shaming anyone -- you are joining them.the true enemy, as always, is anyone who rejects the equal dignity and democratic equality of israelis and palestinians alike. anyone who rejects that there are two authentic nations whose homeland is in this territory. anyone who rejects that there are two communities have legitimate claims to democratic self-determination. anyone who rejects those premises is fundamentally on the same side, and the wrong side, no matter what flag they fly.

happy birthday to me!





it's already been a very eventful year -- and, for me at least, not even primarily for horrible death-of-democracy related reasons!that said, i have this terrible worry that we're going to be coming up on a "day of infamy" -- a stock market crash, or a decision to bomb canada, or a mass arrest of dissident politicians. and i just really hope it isn't today, of all days, because i don't want my birthday being a date spoken in grim and somber tones for the rest of my life (sorry 9/11 babies).

how many robert indianas are lost per year?





this is robert indiana's screenprint "autumn", from the "four seasons of hope (gold)" portfolio. executed in 2012, it was produced in an edition of 82. there were also some printer's proofs and hors commerce proofs set aside, so let's say that a total 100 of these prints were created.robert indiana is a prominent artist and he has an active secondary market. a copy of this piece, for instance, is up for auction next week with an estimate of $3,000 - $5,000. that's far from jaw-dropping by art world standards, but it's definitely something worth keeping around if it's in your house.so here's my question: of the circa 100 copies of this print that were created, how many do we think are "lost" per year? or put differently, how many copies of this print still are, functionally speaking, "in existence" in the art world?by lost, i mean to include things like:the work being damaged beyond reasonable repair.the work being thrown away or otherwise disposed of.the work being in a location where it is forgotten about, or its owner not knowing what it is, such that it is unlikely that it would ever reemerge into the art world.the last category does not include circumstances where the work is in someone's private collection and have no interest in selling it (but they know what they have), but does include situations where someone just puts it in a box in their garage and forgets about it because they don't realize it is a prominent work by a prominent artist.presumably, all editioned art (or all art by a given artist, if we consider their entire career production as a whole) has an attrition rate. once the edition is produced (or the artist dies), no more is created. meanwhile, as life goes on and entropy takes its course, work progressively gets lost. pieces in museum collections are, relatively speaking, safe from becoming "lost". but pieces in private hands are a different story -- it gets gifted to someone who doesn't realize the work is important, or someone dies and the print is tossed while the house is being cleaned up, or it is ruined a natural disaster. stuff happens, in short, and so practically speaking that 100 figure is going to progressively tick down as time passes.but i'm curious what people think the rate is. when one sees an editioned work by a prominent artist, how many of those works have disappeared?maybe 2012 is too recent for much of this particular edition to have been lost. robert indiana was very well-established by then; one would imagine most people who obtained his work would be people who knew what they were getting. the proportion of "lost" pieces for earlier works may be higher -- in part simply because of the passage of time, but in part because earlier in his career his work was more likely to end up in the hands of people who didn't really think of it as an artifact to be preserved.my parents have a couple of great limited edition prints by some of the most famous artists from the mid-20th century, and last year i did a little project where i tried to "account for" as many copies of those pieces as possible -- looking at auction records, museum collections, gallery inventories, and so on. even for the most prominent work with the smallest edition size (28 with 7 asides), i was only able to find info on less than half; for most of the works the number was far less. that doesn't mean those unaccounted for prints are "lost" as i defined it above -- i suspect many are in private hands with owners who know full well what they are* -- but it was still interesting to witness how much of even the most famous artwork in the world is, in practical terms, missing.anyway, no deep thought here, just a musing of the day.* for example, my research would not have revealed anything about my parents' ownership of these prints, but for the fact that i obviously knew what they had.

lies, and the lying liars who believe them





 the above conversation captures two different accounts of why people voted for trump. in one corner, there are those who voted for him because "he'll do what he says" (unlike, presumably, other more feckless politicians who make big promises but never keep them). in the opposite corner, there are those who voted for him because he won't do what he says -- it's all bluster and trolling and hyperbole to trigger oversensitive woke libs, but in reality he's just playing a transactional game and will be reasonable.emma briant flags these two accounts with the observation that it's interesting how trump has been able to effectively activate both camps even though they have seemingly opposite priors. i'll suggest, though, that paradoxically these two opinions about trump are not as far apart as they seem, and can -- albeit with a very healthy dose of self-delusion -- coexist in the same voter.start with the premise that trump "tells it like it is." obviously, this seems absurd to anyone who spends a half minute listening to trump -- he's a grade-a bullshitter whose open lies can be spotted a mile away. but for a certain type of observer -- the self-styled cynic who prides himself on knowing that every politician is some type of liar or fraud -- trump's very brazenness loops back around into a form of trustworthiness. at least he isn't trying to pull the wool over our eyes. the lies are so obvious that they don't even count anymore. but they're deemed to be in service of some greater agenda, an agenda which the listener is confident trump very much believes in.once one adopts that approach, one can absolutely simultaneously believe that trump obviously won't do what he says he'll do and that he alone will do what he says he'll do. simply put, if one doesn't like something he says or if some ramble taken "literally" is acknowledged to go too far, then it is one of those obvious lies that can be discounted -- the listener patting himself on the back for his sophistication in not taken the clearly absurd seriously. and everything one does like is slotted into that greater agenda that is presumed to represent a substrata of absolute, passionate commitment -- the core promises that the listener does want to believe in, desperately, and so is willing to project onto trump with reckless abandon.others have categorized trump as a classic scam artist, and we see that here too -- the trick is convincing his followers that they're in on the con, as opposed to the marks. seeing the lies doesn't drive them away from trump, it makes them feel like they're insiders. believing they've spotted the ruse, they become more confident that the underlying play is whatever they're being sold.i've said before and i'll say again: it's no accident that arendt identified this sort of cynical outlook as a harbinger of totalitarianism, because it leads to worse than believing lies -- it leads to an indifference towards truth. there's no falsifying this outlook, since it can equally and happily accommodate belief and disbelief in equal measure.

can one man really stop the senate?





as donald trump's disastrous march through america's legal institutions continues unabated, progressives are desperately looking for something -- anything -- that can stem the tide. one possibility folks have seized upon is senate obstructionism. the line goes that even a single senator can do a ton of things to throw sand in the gears -- objecting to unanimous consent, slowing down hearings, delaying votes -- that can extract real costs on the maga agenda and provide democrats with some negotiating leverage. so far, no senator has taken this approach, and that in turn is a source of considerable frustration to progressive partisans who feel that democrats have been rolling over without a fight.but for me, the fact that no senator has done this raises a different question: if this strategy was so effective, wouldn't someone have done it by now?there are 47 democratic (or democratic-aligned) senators in congress right now. and as a collective, i absolutely believe there are plenty of plausible explanations for why they're hesitant to adopt the defiant, resistant pose so many of us are thirsting for. if you told me that (too) many still harbor a gut desire for "bipartisanship" and "working across party lines", i'd believe you. if you told me that (too) many remain attached to senate norms of civility and comity, i'd believe you. if you told me that chuck schumer has attempted to unify the caucus around a strategy that, for whatever reason, doesn't include maximal obstructionism, i'd believe you.but if it's really true that just one senator has in his or her power the ability to grind congress' gears to a halt, is it really possible that not one of the forty-seven would try it? there wouldn't be a single defector?do you really think bernie sanders is afraid to rattle cages? do you really believe that adam schiff has in the past few weeks become enamored by venerable senate traditions? do you really imagine that tammy baldwin is inclined to cower before any and all chuck schumer diktats (do you really believe chuck schumer is that good at keeping his entire caucus in absolute ramrod lockstep)?it just doesn't seem plausible to me. someone would have defected by now. in fact, even if this strategy was considerably less effective than it's cracked up to be, or even if you think senate democrats are all fat cat posers who don't actually care about resisting trump at all, you'd still think someone would have tried it simply to be a clout-chaser. the fact that nobody has done it suggests that either it is a lot less effective than people think, or there are a lot more (and more serious) hidden costs to it than people recognize.i won't claim to be an expert on senate procedure, and reading about the various machinations around blue slips and unanimous consent and holds makes my head spin. so it's entirely possible i'm missing something here. but whatever i'm missing has to explain not why "senate democrats", collectively, aren't adopting an obstructionist strategy; it has to explain why every single individual senate democrat has so far refrained from using their power as a one-senator army to bring things to a halt. and i just don't see what that explanation is, aside from this alleged silver bullet not actually being one.

it's "historical significance", not "contemporary significance"





a south carolina rabbi's speech at a holocaust memorial ceremony was deleted from rebroadcast by the state's holocaust "council on the holocaust". the rabbi took aim at such actions as book bans, anti-immigrant and refugee policies, and anti-lgbtq policies, and noted the parallels to the run-up to the holocaust. this, the council decreed, was far too "political" for an event commemorating the holocaust, which of course was not enacted by "political" actors but rather was, i don't know, some sort of meteor strike? who can really say.the council's remit is to "instruct their students about the facts and historical significance of the holocaust." apparently there's a strong emphasis on the historical in that mission statement.i'd say that witnessing "anti-woke" politics take aim at holocaust education was predictable, but that would suggest that this is some sort of new evolution and it definitely isn't.

this is not jewish




your last post reminded me of my maternal grandfather, bless him, who was 
originally from kiev and came to mexico at 16 years of age. my father, 
whose parents were both jewish poles, asked him if he ever thought of 
visiting kiev again, to which he answered “never– the ukranians have never 
given me a reason to go back.” how fucking horrible it must’ve been to 
disassociate oneself from his place of birth because of the hate towards
