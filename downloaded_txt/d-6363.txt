2008-2013 nissan electro instrumental

i loved this background music from a nissan commercial (95% sure it's nissan, but remaining 5% could be hyundai) that played in canada somewhere between 2008 and 2013 i would say. i tried to find it at the time and didn't succeed. it's been stuck in my head eversince.

visuals of the commercial : grey gradient and metallic. shots of the car driving downtown, alternating with shots of a slick masquerade party, people dancing while wearing masks.

the music: instrumental, around 103 bpm, electro. the bass goes like this for every 4/4 measure. and also for every 4/4 measure, on top of that bass, there's a synthetic effect that makes a sort of pio-io-io-ng, like a spring underwater?
