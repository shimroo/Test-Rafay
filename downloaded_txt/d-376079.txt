about us

adopt or foster today
forgotten paws is a small group and we usually have between 15 and 30 dogs waiting for adoption of all ages and sizes. since all of our dogs live in foster homes, we do require an approved application prior to scheduling a meeting of a pet outside of the adoption sites
