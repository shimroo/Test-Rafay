kahea
a call from the people of hawai'i
at the state capitol, honolulu, 2012




"from
this place of honor and shared voices, we, the people of hawai’i nei,
issue this kahea to our own souls, to each other and to the world for a
renewal of forgiveness in our lives."




read, reflect, participate



 

a
not-for-profit community organization, celebrating forgiveness in all
its forms
part of a network of festivals in more than 80 countries


“behold not
with anger the sins of man, but forgive and cleanse.”
--queen lili'uokalani

































hawai’i is a
multicultural society whose people deeply respect
the values of the first people who first settled our islands, long ago.
a life of forgiveness is demonstrated clearly by traditional
hawaiian culture, through the spirit of aloha (welcome, love)
and the practice of ho`oponopono (balance, understanding).

we support forgiveness in all its religious, artistic,
personal, judicial, educational, social and political forms.
hawai'i is an example for the world, both small in size
and large in significance, of what is true and possible.
