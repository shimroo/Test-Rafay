		filling out the 2025 schedule now.  who were your favorite bands from the past???  anyone new you'd like to see?   (remember, keep it reasonable!  we want to keep the lowest ticket prices around!)edited to add:  generally, bands can't play more than every 3rd festival.... two festivals between bands.   so if they played in the fall of 2024 (labor day), they can't play again until spring (memorial day) of 2026.  we had a lot of good bands in the fall, and i'd love to see them back, but have to wait until 2026.
