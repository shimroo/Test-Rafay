	 my 2025 new year's poem
    


 earth angle (poem for january 1, 2025) everything in here is angles. in the glare ofday and the dead of night. the waythe walls meet the ceiling. the rectangularityof the windows and squareness of the panes.the dresser is angles. the chairis angles. the mirror in the corner,angles. the light fixture is perfectlycircular, a sneaky angle disguised as an anti-angle. the cobweb stretches acrossthe ceiling at a 52-degree angle. the merestdraft and it’s 53 degrees. the paintingsby barbara caruso contain angularshapes in precise colours on canvasesmounted on wood squares and rectanglesbuilt for her by nelson ball. wherethe paint flakes off the ceiling above,it does so at deliberate angles. the clotheshanging from hangers: their per-pendicularity is angular.                                      and i am this dollop,riddled with bristles and filled with gutsand aqueducts, lying on a rectangle,typing on squares within a rectangle, myroundish head propped up atan angle against a wall that holdsa window through which, if i werea periscope, i could see a fewblackbirds pecking at the hard snowcovering the parking lot next door,looking for stray seeds or frozen snails.one of the birds says to another,“happy new year.” “what’s,”the other says, “a ‘year’?” thenall the birds laugh and performan extraordinary terpsichorei swear i’ll never forget.  stuart ross1 january 2025

	 new short stories popping up all over the place!
    


 i've been working for a few years on a collection of very short stories. a few of them have seen print, including in the nyc-based the nu review, edited by jordan davis. another has popped up in calgary-based filling station. two more appeared in ampersand review, out of sheridan college. hey, there was one in the now dearly departed taddle creek, too, a toronto literary gem.and a couple have shown up online. a few years ago, one of the stories appeared on talking about strawberries all of the time.and just this morning, another one emerged on the glacier journal, and i couldn't be happier.i'll be in banff for a few weeks this winter, and maybe i'll get that ms finished! let the bidding war begin!over and out.

	 chris banks reviews the sky is a sky in the sky
    


 gratitude to ace poet chris banks for his thoughtful, generous, lengthy review of the sky is a sky in the sky — on his amazing review blog, the woodlot.chris writes:the sky is a sky in the sky by stuart ross is a thorough exploration of the various forces that animate ross’s poetry–things like wordplay, artistic allusions, a kind of surrealist dexterity that cannot be imitated, but which can only be honed over forty plus years of writing. no one writes a stuart ross poem except for stuart ross.you can find the full review right here.and here's the astonishing book trailer i created!over and out.

	 the sky is a sky in the sky has dropped out of the sky
    


so, a few days ago i fulfilled a dream of five decades. my first book with coach house books was officially released. the sky is a sky in the sky is my 12th full-length poetry collection. it is full of crazy poems, personal poems, long poems, short poems, experiments, embarrassments, poems of homage, memorial poems, collaborations, and poems of collegiality. this is another one of my books that celebrates the glory of miscellany, but i think — at least, i hope — this is the one that does it best.i first visited coach house press when i was about 15 years old. i was attending an alternative high school in north york (in the north of toronto), and our creative writing class welcomed a variety of amazing writers who instructed us as various times: joe rosenblatt, victor coleman, robert fones, david young. one of them — i think it was joe — brought us downtown to visit coach house and workshop our stuff up on the old wooden table on the second floor. we were surrounded by books the press had published, as well as photos from the 1960s and early 1970s (this was about 1976). it was a literary hippie dream. and i had this dream of someday being published by coach house. i had a lot of dreams in those days. one had already been fulfilled: that same year, a dozen of my poems were published, alongside poems by mark laba and steve feldman, in a small book called the thing in exile, published by books by kids (which later became annick press).years went by, and i published a ton of chapbooks, and then "real" books began appearing from fantastic publishers. over the years, i've been fortunate enough to have books from the mercury press, ecw press, anvil press, wolsak & wynn, freehand books, dc books, mansfield press, contra mundo books, socios fundadores, and a whole writhing bunch of chapbook presses. and most of the those publishers even let me bring aboard my own artists or designers along for the covers, which i think is pretty rare. the cover of the sky is a sky in the sky is by montreal painter nadine faraj, with beautiful type treatment by coach house's crystal sikma. (i've been collaborating with nadine for a year and a half on paintings w/ text: the first ones to see the light of day will appear soon in a mexican arts journal: stay tuned for more info!)oh yeah, back to the main thread. around 2008, i send a fiction manuscript, for my novel snowball, dragonfly, jew, to coach house. my first-ever submission to the press. coach house editorial director alana wilcox, a hero in the realm of canadian literature and an amazing human, is a dear friend of mine, and so it was a bit excruciating for her, i think, to reject the book. i swore i'd never put her in that position again.but a few years ago, i was visiting with one of my students from my days of being writer-in-residence at u of ottawa. she asked me what aspiration i might still have as a writer. i told her i'd always dreamed of a book from coach house, but i just couldn't send another ms their way. she told me i was a goof—what the hell was my problem? and i thought about it. and i realized that coach house has a poetry team now, so it wouldn't all be on alana. i send the ms for neither foot forward (the book's original title, which my editor talked me out of: too self-deprecating!) to the press. a couple of the poetry editors were interested in it, and alana wrote to tell me the book was a go.damn, it was exciting! and it was exciting to come to toronto see my book on the press.i even got to trim a few copies the following week. holy mackerel!so…i'm so grateful to alana, and to my editor, nasser hussain, who worked hard and imaginatively with me, and crystal, and publicist james lindsay, and john de jesus and the gang in printing/binding, and the rest of the amazing coach house team. i mean, i was grateful to them before, for all the great books they have published over the past six or so decades. but now i'm grateful that my book is a cousin to all those other books i've loved.the book has three dedications. 1) charlie huisken — onetime proprietor and co-owner of the legendary toronto indie bookstore this ain't the rosedale library; he's an unsung hero in the toronto and the larger literary and cultural world, and a great friend. 2) steven feldman and mark laba, two childhood friends with whom i embarked on this poetry life: together, we had a book out from books by kids back in 1975, when we were 16 years old; it was called the thing in exile (i've got a few copies for $75 if you're interested…). and 3) laurie siblock, my partner; her support (and tolerance!) go above and beyond.so far i've had wonderful launches in montreal, kingston, and peterborough! on october 3, i launch in the town from whence i came, toronto. it's going to be a launch unlike any i've had before!and how will my book be received? one never knows. and i never get my hopes up. i'm the guy who originally called this book neither foot forward, after all.over and out.

	 an interview and two reviews, courtesy of monsieur mclennan
    


ottawa poet and production machine rob mclennan has been very supportive of me lately—or maybe just particularly interested in what i'm up to. anyways, either way, i'm glad for any attention my writing attracts.on his substack, he wrote about my 2022 short-story collection, i am claude françois and you are a bathtub. i'm extremely proud of that book, and i think it is unlike any other short-story collection released in canada in the past many years. but it got almost zero attention — just a couple of reviews. but i guess that's the way the cloclo crumbles.shortly after he posted that piece, rob posted the first review of my new poetry collection, the sky is a sky in the sky, officially out on september 10 from coach house books. i have no idea how the collection will be received. maybe it will vanish into thin air. but i am determined to sell lots of copies!and just today, rob posted an interview with me conducted by my friend stan rogal, a very fine poet and fictioneer, and a very fine guy. it musta been like pulling teeth getting those answers from me. it took me months to send stan back my responses. but i think stan and i covered a lot of ground, and it turned out well.and that's where it all stands today.over and out.

	 aisp, the poem (by request)
    


 back in may of 2010, i attended a reunion of students from my toronto high school, aisp — the alternative independent study program. i don't know how i would have survived the school system without that place.someone on social media this week asked to see the poem again, so here it is. aisp did i ever tell you about this schoola school made up entirely of initials: apples in silver pursesastronauts integrating small pandasask in sequence pleaseagatha ivanov speaks portguese it was a free schooland we were freeto create our own learningto call our teachers by their first namesto hang a parachute from the ceiling of the common room(until a fire marshal told us otherwise) we were free to rebelto make super 8 filmsto scream sound poems in the hallwaysto make xerox art in dorothy’s officeto make comic books instead of essayscomics books about global domination by venus fly traps we were free to invent our own coursesskip classes walk out of classes sit in on classesthat we weren’t even takingfree to take the side of mao tse-tung did i ever tell you about the initials? actively irrigate subtle plantationsanything irritates shirley’s pianoabe’s integers smoke potangels illuminate soryl’s pecadillos we were free to get beat up less thanat jeffreys, mackenzie, flemingto read any goddamn book we wanted toi mean truly weird shitto take three courses a year, or fifteenand write revolutionary communiquésto hang a parachute from the common room ceilingi’m seriousbecause it meant we were alternativeand we were independentsometimes we studiedand we were never programmed we ate french fries at dairy freezefried liver and onions in the cafeteriacarl ate cookies in his officeand then he brushed his teeththus providing a lesson have i mentioned the initials?always investigate snoopy parentsarmadillos invest snappy premiumsafrica israel switzerland polandasia istanbul spain peru on torn sofasin the common roomwe argued sports and politicsunder an actual parachutethat hung from the ceilinga ceilinga parachutea fire marshal we were free from beating each other upfree from conveyor beltssausage educationparticle board learningwe were free from catcher in the ryeif we wanted to befree to take a class with a teacherwho’d fold our poems into paper airplanesand fly them across the room plus we had a parachutea common rooma ceilinginitialshave i told you about the parachute?    27 may 2010stuart rossover and out.

	 did i mention that last year i won the trillium book award?
    


i haven't been keeping up with things on this blog. blogs being an almost-thing-of-the-past. but it's worth documenting that in june 2023, i won the trillium book award for my memoir, the book of grief and hamburgers, published in 2022 by ecw press.back in 2000, i was shortlisted for the award for my second poetry collection, farmer gloomy's new hybrid. i didn't expect to win then, and i didn't, and i didn't expect to win this time. i figured they just put me on the shortlist when they needed a book with a stupid title.but the book of grief and hamburgers is a very important book to me. it was painful but cathartic to write. i wrote it for myself, and for my dear friend michael dennis, the ottawa poet, who didn't have long to live in fall 2020. i didn't intend to show it to michael, but i did show him the dedication, which is to him. with an epigraph by him: "we are the lucky men." he said that to me in the last month of his life.here i am giving my acceptance speech. my editor at ecw and friend michael holmes is holding my award. man, he and ecw have stuck with me through seven books and i am so grateful.and here i'm signing the placard for my book on the big night.oh yeah. this is the moment when my name was announced as the winner. as you can see, i really didn't see it coming. paul vermeersch caught my expression in this photo.here's a letter the mayor of cobourg addressed to me to mark an evening in my honour at the art gallery of northumberland. it was a pretty lovely occasion, organized jointly by the gallery and our local indie, let's talk books. the brilliant katie cruel was my musician of choice for the night. and i was introduced, really beautifully, by cobourger, writer, and former mpp david tsubouchi, who has always been a great champion of the written word.and here is my winning book. this gorgeous cover was created by my friend the london, ontario, artist angie quick.no book of mine has brought me as much response (or money!) as the book of grief and hamburgers. as i said, i wrote it in part for michael dennis, but it was a tribute to all the important people in my life who have died. and one important dog.miss you, lily.over and out.
