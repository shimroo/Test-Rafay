i am not currently breeding any birds for sale.




shanna dollarhide, certified avian specialist

color on the wing
 is the san francisco bay area's finest breeder of exotic birds.
established in 1990, we have grown to become a premier dealer for hand-fed birds in northern california. all of our birds are raised with lots of love and attention from the day they hatch, to the day they meet their new parents. this makes for very special birds with great personalities.
we are a wholesale breeder and sell directly to the public. we do not sell to retail stores since we are very selective as to where our birds go. it is our intention to make sure our birds go only to good, loving homes.
i will also handfed babies if you do not have time or the experience to hand feed yourself. i can do any size from parrotlet to macaw, and any age from day 1 to weaning. please contact me for pricing.
you may contact me at shanna@coloronthewing.com for more information or any questions you may have. thank you for visiting color on the wing!
