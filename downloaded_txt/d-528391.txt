                                        i always have a high quality experience with arlington heights florist, which is why i come back.  but, in this case, the arrangement and the customer service (e.g., multiple delivery attempts, thoughtful communication) was especially excellent.

                                        this is a beautiful bouquet -- well worth the money. sunny from the sunflowers on one side and elegant with roses on the other. the actual delivered arrangement was as pretty as or prettier than the photo.
