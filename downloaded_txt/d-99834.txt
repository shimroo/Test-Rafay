3 paths to adoption in tennessee


 many families in tennessee consider adopting each year. there are several reasons why parents may want to adopt a child. some couples are unable to conceive. others might have serious health conditions that would make pregnancy very dangerous. some couples fear that they could pass on genetic diseases or disorders to their birth children. in other situations, a single parent may wish to start his or her own family. there are close to half a million children in the united states living in foster care. this fact inspires some adoptive parents to provide permanent homes. 

domestic adoption
 domestic adoption is the private adoption of an infant within the united states by parents within the united states. this type of adoption is not associated with foster care. according to https://www.americanadoptions.com/adopt/what-is-domestic-adoption, this is the an adoption where a woman with an unplanned pregnancy has chosen adoption. future adoptive parents work with an adoption agency to meet the requirements. this includes the creation of a profile that is shown to the birth mother who will choose a family for her baby. private domestic adoption is best for people wanting to adopt a newborn. other types of adoptions will not always ensure that a family will receive a newborn. only two percent of foster children who were adopted in 2017 were newborns. while it is a fact that each child awaiting adoption needs a home, it is also important to honor your truth. you must decide whether you are more equipped to adopt a baby or if you are better equipped to adopt an older child or a teenager.

foster care adoption
 typically the adoption of older children involves foster care adoption. this type of adoption allows you to grow your family and help a child in need. the primary goal of foster care is reunification but sometimes that is not the best option for the child. a foster child will become lawfully available for adoption only if they can’t be reunited with the biological family. in this event, the current foster parents are likely given the first opportunity to adopt. in the state of tennessee, around 80 percent of foster children are adopted by their foster families in a process called “foster to adopt”.  because of this, tennessee foster parents are approved to adopt and to provide foster care. although a tennessee foster child may be adopted by parents who have never been foster parents, most are successful through “foster to adopt”. contact the department of child services to find out more.

independent adoption
 in the case of a family adoption or independent adoption, the birth mother has chosen prospective adoptive parents that she is related to or whom she knows personally.  with this type of adoption, it is still helpful to have a private adoption agency to outline the required steps. an adoption attorney is also necessary to handle any legal aspects. an experienced tennessee adoption lawyer can provide you with details. 

adoptive parents should strongly consider several factors before applying for adoption. what is your current state of living and are you happy with it? do you have a healthy support system such as family and friends? raising a child requires the ability to adapt to change. if the child is older, are you able to allow the time it will take for them to grow to love you?
 adoption is a beautiful way to start or expand a family. tennessee adoption laws make successful adoptions reasonably attainable. the main objective is centered around the child’s well-being. before starting the process of adoption, you must make certain you meet the requirements to adopt. first, you must be a resident of tennessee. you will also need to show proof that you are financially and emotionally able to carry on the adoption. there are several other requirements necessary for successful adoption. visit https://www.tn.gov/dcs/program-areas/foster-care-and-adoption/fca/adoption.html for more information.
