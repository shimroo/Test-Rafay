mnl's christmas blog, 2004


september 2004:

what's my movie hero?  from www.liquidgeneration.com:

(please excuse the language!)
my movie villain was the short-tempered guy from goodfellas.
i'd have copied that image, too, but it contained a word i'd rather not display here.


august 2004:

to do my part for the 2004 presidential election, i'm opening this website:

christians for kerry/christians against bush

christians who are tired of being automatically identified with the
right-wing agenda are looking for each other on the internet.
look here!


february 2004:

happy v-day!

to the heavenly bridegroom,
   from a single woman
 
you are the only intimacy
      i know.
you draw me close in spirit.

i knead in my mind
grains of truth
mixed with living water
the milk and honey
     of the promised land
 
add the salt of the earth
and the oil of gladness
leaving out the yeast
     of the priests and scribes
but folding in
the leaven of the kingdom
 
baked in refining fire
until it rises
     and emerges
the bread of life
served with wine of joy
 
and golden apples served on silver plates.
 
i take you into my body
as you have taken me
     into yours.

if you're lonely this valentine's day and didn't get a valentine,
first of all, here's one from god.

something to brighten up your day!

god is crazy about you.
if god had a refrigerator, your picture would be on it.
if he had a wallet, your photo would be in it.
he sends you flowers every spring.
he sends you a sunrise every morning.
whenever you want to talk, he listens.
he can live anywhere in the universe, yet
he chooses your heart.
face it, friend-he is crazy about you!

pass it on ... to brighten up someone else's day. 

secondly, send someone a valentine yourself!  send one to yourself,
and one to family members, friends, maybe a kind, subtle one to 
someone you've had your eye on!

this year, being extremely low on funds, i made my family's 
valentines out of construction paper and cut-outs from tv guide's
insert ads: you know, the ones with statues of native americans,
elves, pets, hummel-like children, soldiers, etc.  those items 
look really beautiful!  such items appear online at 
www.lenox.com or www.collectiblestoday.com


december 2003:

we got code orange for christmas
(to the tune of "nuttin' for christmas")

we got code orange for christmas!
bush and dick cheney are mad.
we got code orange for christmas
'cause some folks ain't nothin' but bad.

they flew two planes at the towers tall.
somebody's after me!
and now we fear for the shopping mall.
somebody's after me!
some anthrax in the mail came through.
they shot a plane in scotland, too.
they blew a boat in yemen--ooo!
somebody's after me!

oh, we got code orange for christmas!
bush and dick cheney are mad.
we got code orange for christmas!
'cause some folks ain't nothin' but bad.

we rounded up lots of foreign men.
somebody's after me!
they see no lawyers; they see no kin.
somebody's after me!
you'd better watch out what you say,
'cause we can take your job away,
or put your rear in gitmo bay.
somebody's after me!

oh, we got code orange for christmas!
bush and dick cheney are mad.
we got code orange for christmas!
'cause some folks ain't nothin' but bad.

you'd better watch your precious rear
because america's hyped with fear!
we got code orange for christmas!

***************************

a step up: for six weeks i've been teaching a special writing course
at my college, designed to help the students pass a cuny writing test
and to write better essays.

things on the home front are way taxing: illness in the family.
please pray for us.

in fact, i wrote a letter to santa about it, and if you've received
my letter and are reading this website as a result: 
thanks for caring!

a plus:  i'm taking a musical theater writing course at the new school,
and the teachers, aaron franken and howard marren, are very
enthusiastic about my work.  anyone out there need a lyricist?

merry christmas!  happy hanukah!  happy kwanzaa!  happy 2004!



october 2003:

my halloween costume inspiration:

picture 1 and picture 2!

on the bill maher message board: my 666th post!
(scary if you think about it!)

and this year's halloween message, my handout to go with my costume:
left versus right: where is the love?

**********

to my california compatriots:

shame on you.

you saw fit to heed a radical rightist, repub-backed recall 
and fire a man elected less than a year ago, 
whose worst crime was imposing an unpopular tax.

california, you have made your bed. enjoy the screwing. 
for your sake i hope ahnold is better than i think. 

to my fellow nyc'ers:

so, when do we recall mayor michael bloomberg
(whom we're angry at for ticket-blitzing)
and replace him with neil simon?

btw, even though i'm not a ca'n, i've received two conflicting e-mails
re the recall, which i've posted here.

"between trying to impeach bill clinton, florida 2000 and 
the recall in california, i'm beginning to think that 
republicans will do anything to win an election -- except 
get the most votes." - bill maher

aren't the republicans always speaking against moral relativism?



august 2003:
back in ny, ny...

in a fit of unabashed self-revelation, i shamelessly share:
which winnie-the-pooh character am i?

roo!
some would call you a baby, but that's because youtruly are (and it's cute as hell). you take joyin the simple things in life, like happiness,family and friends.
 which winnie the pooh character are you? brought to you by quizilla

hmm...i wonder what any detractors of mine might do with that information?


july 2003:
i'm participating in a mission trip to:

(click image--they can use a lot of help!)

read my blog: mnl, pine ridge, sd
that is, if i can have fairly good computer access out there!


june 2003:
well, i have my degree from queens college (flushing, ny):
master of arts, english-creative writing, 
with a 3.97 gpa.

i thank my brother and sister for attending the graduation ceremony!

i also thank my friends and relatives for their good wishes
and for a couple of nice "parting gifts"!


april 2003:

i saw this on the bill maher message board: religion forum, 
and i thought it was worth checking out.  here's a sample:


here are eight arguments i am finding less and less productive 
whenever they come up in any thread around here that includes the word god.

i am equally sick of both sides.

atheist: you believe in god because you are too weak to accept 
that your life is meaningless.

theist: you deny god because you are too cowardly to accept 
that your life may have a purpose you dont want it to have.

theist: you cant bear the thought that there may be forces 
in the universe you cannot understand.

atheist: you cant bear the thought that the universe 
as revealed by science may be all there is.

theist: your parents were religious, and you are just 
rebelling against them in a childish way.

atheist: your parents were religious, and you are just 
parroting them in a childish way.

there's more; please look!

february 2003:

in honor of valentine's day, i'm moving up two poems
about the love of god: the first one by me, 
the second send to me by a friend.

as of february 1, 2003, i hold a masters of arts degree
in english-creative writing from queens college (flushing, ny),
with a 3.97 gpa.

*******

in memoriam:
pray for the seven lost in the shuttle columbia,
and their families and friends
*******

while hunting around yahoo! i found this paper:

satan is not a literary character:
teaching early modern literature to religiously committed students

written by dr. carrie hintz of queens college's english department

it stands to reason that anyone going to a secular college--
and hopefully, anyone going to any college--
will be exposed to viewpoints that challenge their own.
i believe that a faith that can't stand to be challenged
is no faith at all.

always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you 
to give the reason for the hope that you have. 
but do this with gentleness and respect...
--from 1 peter 3:15 (niv)

**************************************************************

well, i'm on the eve of what looks like 
my final semester at queens college.
my thesis semester.  i'm writing a musical play,
lyrics and libretto.  even a few tunes.

after i graduate, can anyone suggest some good jobs
for a person with a masters degree in english-creative writing?

*******

a great movie for lent (or anytime) is 
chocolat (2000)
about a french chocolatier who feels compelled,
in 1959 provincial france, to open her chocolate shop
during lent?  why couldn't she wait?
because her actions expose the true sins of that community--
bigotry, compromise, even violence.
and what better time to face up to your hidden faults
than lent?

while i'm at it, i may as well refer you to a list
i created on amazon.com:


god and chocolate? about food and the unseen world

and the tract/website i based that list upon:


god and chocolate?

have you noticed that you can buy a christmas/hanukkah combo card,
but you can't buy (to my knowledge) a passover/easter combo card?

my life goal:

my goal on this earth is to glorify god, and to write a piece,
preferably a stage play or screenplay, which lives on after i die and
which makes people think, feel, and get uplifted or challenged.

"act justly, love tenderly, and walk humbly with your god."

my one-act musical play of the first passover

phil hartman, 1948-1998we still remember you.




when a life explodes
   the fragments fall

a letter here
a memory here

put the pieces together
and you get...pieces.

when a life explodes
only god can mend the pieces.
