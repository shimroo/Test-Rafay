what our clients say 





seda-cog helped me realize many programs, loans, grants, and support designed to help small businesses success. the loan allowed us to reduce our monthly payment by 50 percent, freeing up capital for other operational expenses.

steve kenepp owner architectural precast innovations




i wanted to start living that american dream – working for yourself. … this has been one of our busiest years. [seda-cog] put us on the state’s bid-matching program that helped us get these contracts. … anything we ever need, [seda-cog staff] are right there.

carolyn mcglinn owner a new design landscape & stone




the community’s here, the resources are here, and seda-cog has been so crucial in our development that there’s no way in god’s green earth we’ll ever leave.

nick gilson ceo/founder gilson boards




the staff worked hard to ensure improved heating efficiency as if it were their own home.

seda-cog put windows in each floor of my house, installed a handicap-accessible bathroom, and installed new entry doors. i just can’t believe it was done the way it was; seda-cog really helped me out a lot.
