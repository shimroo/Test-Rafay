the art of exotic dancing®
the aoed difference  the art of exotic dancing for everyday women's program is unique and incorporates exotic dance movements found in bellydancing and burlesque dance styles.  since 1998, the art of exotic dancing's  exotic dance program has spawned or influenced many classes around the country including poledancing, stripping lessons or stripping classes, cardio striptease, striptease aerobics, lapdancing classes, how to strip for your lover classes and even celebrities have developed their own program like carmen electra's aerobic striptease. 
while of their own merit, these types of dance classes, such as pole dancing, only begin to scratch the surface after several weeks of intense and rigorous practice.  in the art of exotic dancing's signature workshop, you will learn to dance and, in three short hours and in a safe and supportive space, you will begin to re-invent your body image and powerfully express your femininity through your individual, unique sensual body movement. .
