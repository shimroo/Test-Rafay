double your impact with a donation this holiday season




men live six years less than women. but this isn’t just a statistic — it’s a call to action. the gender lifespan gap is at its widest point in three decades. we believe men can learn from women's successes in embracing healthier lifestyles and obtaining the care they need.
men's health network is committed to closing this gap, but we can’t do it without you. we’re currently developing the gap guide — a new resource featuring the top six things men can do to live healthier and longer lives.
thanks to a generous anonymous donor, every dollar you give this giving tuesday and holiday season will be matched up to $10,000! your donation helps us create this essential guide and supports our outreach programs to spread life-saving information to high-risk men everywhere.
donate today to double your impact and help men catch up to women in the lifespan gap. every donor will be among the first to receive the gap guide as soon as it’s available.
together, let’s build a future where men and women live longer, healthier lives side-by-side. your support matters — donate now!
