terryâs tails n trotters





custom-made horse tail enhancements and potbellied pig sanctuary



iâve been making tails beautiful for over a decade
when i started i was tying in hair extensions. this is a long procedure which requires the hair 
strand to be tied individually to each hair on a tail that needs to be extended or expanded. this 
sometimes takes days to finish. while the end result is fairly permanent, it is very high 
maintenance. 
as the add-on tail pieces became more popular, i received requests for more and more of them. 
i studied some of the current products available and decided that most didn't look like the real 
tail...just "horsehair on a rope" hanging from the tail. i knew there was a better way to create a more natural look.
my tail pieces are totally custom made for each horse from quality, genuine horsehair. they include multiple sections, 
which can be tailored to accommodate your horse's natural length, volume and color. they look like the real thing and 
hang like a normal horse's tail. they are easy to attach and remove, and require only the same care you would give your 
horse's natural tail. plus, they are comfortable for the horse to wear.
why multiple sections? they're more comfortable for your horse to wear & carry. the smaller sections hang more 
naturally, follow the horse's movement more rhythmically, and attach to multiple points to distribute the weight more evenly 
making for a prettier, happier picture!
best of all, a custom made tail enhancement from terryâs tails is reasonably priced. i will also replace or repair any 
section that becomes damaged during normal wear. once you've browsed this site, i am confident that you will allow me 
the opportunity to make your horse's tail beautiful. i truly want your horse to look good from head to tail. see more 
pictures of tails and tail colors on our products page.
i am now also making weighted tails, as approved by apha - see 
product photos for info on weighted tails and additional photos of our products available. see

legality
i am often asked if t-tails are "legal."  t-tail pieces are accepted by aqha & apha, and others. however, they may be prohibited by certain 
breed affiliates for show ring use. here's the provision from the aqha rule book that allows tail extensions. you can find it on page 129 of 
show rules & regulations, rule 441 prohibited conduct, section (g)(10)(h)(8): âtails may be lengthened by hair to hair attachment only with 
no attachments of any kind to the tail bone.â  i strongly suggest you contact your breed or governing body, such as usa equestrian 
federation, to determine if tail enhancements are acceptable for your use.
