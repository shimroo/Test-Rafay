"pink worlds" opening friday at aftermodern sf!







hello everyone!i have a 2 person show with dana carlson (one of my all time favorite contemporary painters!) opening this friday at aftermodern in san francisco:pink worlds (and white icing)an exhibition of recent works byfawn gehweiler and dana carlsonopening friday, may 23rd, from 6 to 8:30pmaftermodern fine art gallery445 bryant streetsan franciscofor more information please visit:http://www.aftermodern.comabout pink worlds:taking a cue from the show's namesake "pink worlds and white icing", a collection of poems written by a 12 year old girl in late 60s, artists dana carlson and fawn gehweiler each present a collection of recent works that take a turn for the pastoral, pop and pretty, albeit with a dash of dark comedy thrown in for good measure. awash in preteen nostalgia, strangely baroque and alternately naive, precocious, and deeply introspective, these tiny poems about "color, the beatles, bubblegum, nature, and the universe" lend both a perfect title and a perfect backdrop to their respective candy colored dreamscapes and imaginary narratives of head-in-the-clouds teenage psychedelia.about the artists:dana carlson combines traditional painting methods with embroidery, beadwork, and appliqué to create hybrid-handiworked dream worlds. her intricate paintings conjure up a pretty, romantic absurdity that is part down-home psychedelia, part angsty gesture painting, and part earnest teenager. dana earned her mfa from hunter college in new york in 2000 and continues to exhibit in the new york area and worldwide. originally from des moines, iowa, dana currently lives and works in brooklyn, new york.http://www.danacarlson.comfawn gehweiler's signature character based paintings have exhibited in galleries around the world and appear in a number of prominent private collections. originally from hawaii and currently based in the pacific northwest, her work combines the influence of a bohemian upbringing, sartorial escapism, and her own family tree. widely considered a major influence in the recent explosion of young feminine art in the united states, her aesthetic hinges on a delicate balance of past and present, building obsessive narratives through personal artifacts that reflect the imaginary worlds of little girls, treading the fine line between wide eyed innocence and dark fairy tales.http://www.fawngehweiler.comcome on out if you have the chance, it would be great to see you!xoxoxoxofawn

odds and ends...







so, we finally made it to the northwest with all of our worldly possessions intact and are now safely tucked away in a thicket of trees just outside of portland! our neighborhood is about 95 percent german and 95 percent cute old ladies, with a sausage place on every corner, so of course i kind of love it!come spring we'll be looking for a place to call our own, but in the meantime, here's a shot of our first tiny snowstorm in our new temporary backyard...note: this fairytale shed is possibly my new favorite thing ever!also, now that we're settling in, i'm slowly but surely, and finally, organizing and updating my website, and, in lieu of a pending major overhaul for now, will be adding new stuff practically every day. for starters:some drawings and studies and odds and ends from a few recent shows are finally up for sale here!and, even more exciting for the budget conscious, a whole new slew of prints have been posted to my shop!
