                      "you cannot multiply wealth by dividing it."
"you cannot legislate the poor into 
                      freedom by legislating the industrious out of it. you 
                      don't multiply wealth by dividing it. government cannot 
                      give anything to anybody that it doesn't first take from 
                      somebody else. whenever somebody receives something 
                      without working for it, somebody else has to work for it 
                      without receiving. the worst thing that can happen to a 
                      nation is for half of the people to get the idea they 
                      don't have to work because somebody else will work for 
                      them, and the other half to get the idea that it does no 
                      good to work because they don't get to enjoy the fruits of 
                      their labor."   adrian rogers, 1984
 

a nation can survive its fools and even 
                        the ambitious. but it cannot survive treason from 
                        within. an enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he 
                        is known and he carries his banners openly against the 
                        city.
but the traitor moves among those within 
                        the gates freely, his sly whispers rustling through all 
                        alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself.
for the traitor appears no traitor; he 
                        speaks in the accents familiar to his victim, and he 
                        wears their face and their garments and he appeals to 
                        the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men.
he rots the soul of a nation; he works 
                        secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the 
                        pillars of a city; he infects the body politic so that 
                        it can no longer resist. a murderer is less to be 
                        feared. the traitor is the plague. â marcus tullius 
                        cicero, from a speech given to the roman senate, 
                        recorded in approximately 42 b.c. by sallust.
