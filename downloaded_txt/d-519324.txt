reliable solutions
conveyor dynamics, inc. (cdi)
born in 1981, cdi pioneered the use of dynamic analysis to design modern, long (> 2km), high capacity (> 10000 tph) overland and underground conveyor belts.
not only do we design the longest and strongest belts in the world, our engineers create and sell the leading conveyor belt design software tools, the most reliable control systems, and develop improved belt, brake, and idler designs for manufacturers.â we partner with the leading epc and oem's around the world to supply the most cost effective and reliable conveyors in every major market.  
in additional to designing new machines, our engineers conduct forensic engineering studies to diagnose and fix failed conveyor belts. our engineers understand the physics of conveyor belts, from the complete system, to the individual proportional brake valve better than anyone else in the world.  if your conveyor is unreliable, cdi is here to change that.







yubei: 15 km pipe conveyor



impumelelo: 27km overland conveyor



los pelambres: 25 mw downhill conveyor
