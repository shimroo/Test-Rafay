tv today- a golden age for creators & storytellers
we're in a new golden age of television where outlets and appetites for great storytelling have flourished as a new space for filmmakers and screenwriters to see original projects come to fruition, and for new creators to find opportunity in what used to be an extremely insulated business.

how to pitch a tv show: idea power & creating tv pitches that sell
a tv series does not come into existence without it first being an "idea" that is compelling enough to drive the entire development, production and marketing process. ideas open doors, fuel the development process, and ultimately connect with viewers.
