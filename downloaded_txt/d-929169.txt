recipe:shrimp, white bean and tomato skilletthis 20-minute skillet dinner will become a weeknight star! with shrimp, creamy white beans, cherry tomatoes and spinach it‚Äôs the perfect dish to serve over rice or pasta.
make reciperecipe:maple bacon baked beansbaked beans are hearty and delicious comfort food. this quick version uses both canned black beans and white beans, making them an ideal weeknight side-dish. with sweetness from the maple syrup and smokiness from the bacon, not to mention other aromatics such as espresso powder and dijon mustard, it‚Äôs no wonder why people flock to the kitchen while they‚Äôre in the oven. rich and deeply flavourful, these baked beans just need some crusty bread or corn bread on the side.
make reciperecipe:tex-mex quinoa skilletthis tex-mex quinoa skillet is a budget-friendly, flavourful, and hearty meatless meal perfect for any night of the week.¬† it comes together in one pot and the whole family will love it.
make reciperecipe:aji verde dense bean saladthe internet is buzzing with dense bean salads right now. after some tik tok investigation, i was surprised to learn that i have been making them for years! a big, protein bomb salad that keeps in the fridge all week that i can reach for a couple of times a day keeps me alive when life gets super hectic. it gets better every day as the ingredients marinate in the dressing, too. instead of a basic vinaigrette, i like to make my favourite peruvian sauce/condiment for the dressing. despite the mayo (you can use low-fat mayo), it is not heavy, it is a bit spicy, it‚Äôs tangy, and it‚Äôs pretty and delicious.you can make this salad vegan using vegan mayo and feta. it is low fat, protein rich, high fibre and dense ‚Äì it will fill you up and keep you feeling full. i used a combo of white and black beans, but you can use whatever you have. just remember to make it colourful, crunchy and deliciously beany.
make reciperecipe:italian bean soup with homemade maltagliati pastathere is nothing better than wrapping your hands around a beautiful soulful bowl of italian bean soup as autumn comes into the air with its cooler temperatures. this soup hosts lovely tender tasty borlotti beans (also known as romano beans) in a delightful broth made with garlic, peperoncino, mirepoix, prosciutto and aromatics of fresh thyme and rosemary. more so, a comforting homemade maltagliati (oddly cut) pasta that just adds another level of texture and a touch of umami from beautifully aged parmigiano. this soup is a huge hug in a bowl. craving some comfort, try this traditional italian dish! you won‚Äôt be disappointed!
