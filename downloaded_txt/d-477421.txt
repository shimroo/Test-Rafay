sharing aloha








the sharing aloha program was created for hawai‘i residents to provide an opportunity to exchange promotional items when they participate in special events outside of hawai‘i. local residents are among the best ambassadors for the hawaiian islands when they travel and share aloha with the people they meet!
we offer the following promotional items to non-profit organizations based in hawai‘i when they travel outside hawai‘i. supplies are limited so please kōkua and order only what your non-profit needs. 
the sharing aloha team reserves the right to evaluate each request for compliance with program guidelines and availability of requested items.
you may submit your request up to three (3) months prior to your event. please allow at least ten (10) working days to review your request. you will be notified by email when your order is ready for pick-up. orders must be picked up from the hawai‘i visitors and convention bureau’s office located in waikīkī.
