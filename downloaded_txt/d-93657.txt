american quarterhorse
champion 'impressive'
~ willie's sire.
manes & tails
organization rescues quarterhorses, however, we will not pay one thin
dime to the american quarterhorse association due to their
pro-slaughter position.

american quarterhorses are the most overly bred and commonly
slaughtered breed of horse in the united states.

all of our american quarterhorses have excellent bloodlines, but
despite their breeding, they are lucky to be alive.

pastel light!
pastel is a 9 year old thoroughbred mare who suffered an ankle injury at the age of 3. her 

owner paid for her surgery, however, the party who was caring for her after her injury left her in her stall for two years! we were told that pastel 

would only be 'pasture sound.' not so. ms. pastel, who won 43k at the track, is now galloping around every day in the big field.'willow'!sponsored by some of the fans of barbaro,members of n.e.r.c., and friends.we thank them 

all for their kindness and generosity.willow will be ready for free lease as a dressage horse in the spring. this lovely 12 year old canadian bred thoroughbred 

mare is a liver chestnut color, which is rare for thoroughbreds. she is very sweet, but has some attitude!

the
manes & tails organization

the manes & tails
organization was incorporated in june of 2004. we rescue slaughter bound
thoroughbreds, quarterhorses and paints and free lease them. among those we have rescued are a
son of 'seattle slew', a grandson of 'secretariat', a great
granddaughter of 'secretariat', a son of quarterhorse champion
'impressive', a 'dash for cash' daughter and granddaughter, and a
'sahlih' son, and two great granddaugthters of 'mr. prospector.' we never sell our horses; this enables us to guarantee
them wonderful homes for the duration of their lives. every
horse we rescue from slaughter continues to contribute to the economy.
we have horses ranging in age from 7 years old to 18 years old.





our
board member dr. lester friedlander, dvm is a former usda chief
inspector. dr. friedlander is now a vegetarian. listen to what he has to say here.


national mounted
police horse appreciation day


the
nypd is the oldest
mounted police unit in the united states and they currently have over
90 horses on their force. nypd mpu has over 55 horses in
retirement.  manes and tails organization has committed to
adopting a retired nypd mpu horse!



could officer reilly perform
his job if he had
to ride a bovine, bison, porcine or fowl? clearly not.
this
is what distinguishes horses from so called 'food animals.'



manes & tails' 'willie' & nypd 

mpu officer john b. reilly, jr.


some brief notes of
interest:  the baltimore force uses only draft horses rescued
from the amish, the lexington, ky force has two percheron appendixes
who  are brothers (in addition to eight other horses on their
force), and the hoboken, nj force has standardbreds and one
appendix.
