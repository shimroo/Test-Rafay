something a little different for my workout





today i did something a little different. i wanted to get in the gym but not kill myself. so i did some high rep stuff with the suspension straps.

first group of exercises.
5 rounds of...
1. suspension strap planche push ups x 20
2. suspension strap inverted rows x 20
3. double unders x40
4. landmine rainbows x7

followed that up with
5 sets of...
1. suspension strap triceps extensions x 20
2. suspension strap biceps curls x 20
3. side plan lateral raises x 15

that did it for the day. nothing too fancy but it got the juices flowing. ready to hit it hard on monday.

one arm row variation





the one arm row (oar) is a great back exercise. it's a staple in my training routines. not only do i do it myself but i put it into the programs i design for others.

i'm not a big fan of the bent over row. but i do include it in my training from time to time because of the big loads that can be used and the overhand grip.

what i have found to be a great alternative to the the bent over row is what i like to call the business end landmine row.

withe the belm you can load up the weight and use the pronated grip to get more back activation.

if your dumbbells don't go up that high this exercise is a must.  

if you want to get an incredible grip workout do a few burnout sets without straps. this will set your forearms on fire.

for the heavier sets straps are needed.

check out the business end landmine row and let me know what you think.

my upper body workout - sept. 2, 2014






quick upper body workout
for the next little bit i'll be doing more frequent workouts. the volume for each will less. but at the end of week the volume will add up to be more.

i'm going to take this approach for a couple of months, then change things up again.

1a. - barbell incline press 4x8
1b. - hammer row 4x12 (pronated grip)

2a. - db flat chest press - 4x10
2b. - db one arm row - 5x5

3a. - cable flyes 4x15
3b. - parallel bar dips - 4xmax reps at bodyweight

lower body workout 09/01/14





it's been a while  since i have posted a workout. i've been in the gym. just a lot going on and it's keep my fat fingers from posting.

i have written a few thing you may want to check out...

a question from you... do i need to kill myself in the gym to see results?
this getting in shape thing isn't working. time to give up.







lower body workout


box squats - 10x3 w/ pause... done on the minute. gave about 45 seconds rest for each set.
elevated reverse lunge - 4x5... did all the reps on one leg before doing the next.
leg curls - 4x10... done with a single leg. went from one leg to the next until all the reps were done.
leg extension - 4x15... same as curls
rdl - 3x12... superseted with roll outs
swiss ball ab roll outs - 4x12... superseted with rdls


finished with a 10 minute walk on the treadmill. went just over a 1/2 mile at a steep incline.

25 bodyweight exercises to replace traditional weight lifting exercises






the great thing about body weight exercises is that you can use them anytime anywhere.

i hate to have my workout slowed down waiting for equipment or weight. bodyweight exercises are perfect in these situations.

another way i like to incorporate body weight exercises into my workout routines is to use them as part of a superset.

example for a chest workout.

exercise 1a is a heavy dumbbell incline press.
exercise 1b is a push up variation.

depending on how tired i am will dictate what push up variation i use.

deloading

bodyweight exercises are perfect for deloading weeks. they're easier on your joints. it makes a nice break from heavy lifting.


below is a list of 25 different bodyweight exercises that you can do instead of traditional free weight exercises. give them a try.
