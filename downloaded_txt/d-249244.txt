                    from our humble beginnings, we have grown to the largest, most complete comic book price guide with well over 1,000,000 comics in our database. we have values for any marvel, dc, image, idw, darkhorse, or dell comic book that is in your collection. (plus several hundred other publishers)
                

                    you can lookup values, organize your collection, put in virtual boxes, create want lists, sell comics and so much more. once comic books are in your collection, prices automatically update as the market changes. you can pick up our app if you're going to a convention and have your entire collection and want list with you.
                

                    set up a free account or opt for a paid membership, either way, you can see prices for every comic book in our database. some features are limited on the free option.
