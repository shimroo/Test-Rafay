if you have fresh fruit in your home, you’ll get fruit flies. big ugly house flies and their kin find their way in. not to mention the bloody fungus gnats which can kill houseplants.  this one was just over £20. it’s gotten a bit knocked about in transit, but will recover. d. muscipula, out of its growing medium, resembles bulbs or onions, so it’s easy to propagate by division.  two key things: they must get watered every day, otherwise the foliage goes black and dies. and growing medium must be very low nutrition
