about janeta southern california native, robin’s musical education began the moment she met her guitar teacher, randy rhoads (quiet riot, ozzy osbourne). under rhoads’ tutelage, robin became an ace six-string player and, while still in high school, parlayed this education into a position as the lead guitarist for the all-female rock band precious metal. discovered by rodney bingenheimer of the legendary l.a. rock radio station kroq, precious metal was soon signed to polygram records. later moving to chameleon/capitol records, precious metal released several albums, wrote with heart, poison and cheap trick, toured extensively and gained accolades from both fans and critics alike.read more→
