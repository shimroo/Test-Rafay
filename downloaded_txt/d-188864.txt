professional longarm quilter ~ quilting hideaway




















welcome to the quilting hideaway website. if you are looking for a professional longarm machine quilter, you've come to the right place! i specialize in edge-to-edge quilting, which is a great way to get those unfinished quilt tops machine quilted at an affordable price. edge-to-edge quilting refers to a design that is repeated across the entire quilt from side to side and head to foot.
new customers receive a 10% discount on the machine quilting portion of their first edge-to-edge quilting invoice. if you aren't sure what design might complement your quilt, i can offer suggestions. border designs are available upon request for an additional charge. if your quilt needs custom quilting, i can work with you to select designs and give you an estimate.
the quilting is done with a gammill longarm quilting machine which is controlled by a statler stitcher for precise and consistent stitching. the software allows designs to be scaled precisely to fit your quilt. the equipment can accommodate small projects as well as king-size quilts. i provide high quality workmanship and exceptional service. please contact me with any questions you have.
