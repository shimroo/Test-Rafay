the north east diving equipment group
                  (nedeg) is a group of individuals dedicated to
                preserving, promoting and diving a variety of underwater gear
                from all around the world.
these include historical gear such as vintage and modern navy
                diving helmets, modern lightweight commercial diving helmets,
                double hose regulators, and other open circuit gear. learn about
                the history of diving and the equipment that evolved from the
                past.
we give a chance for sport scuba divers to actually dive some
                of the gear you would normally only see on television or old
                movies!

                memorial day weekend rally, 2025
 the north east diving equipment group will be holding a working  equipment rally on memorial weekend: may 24 - 26, 2025. our traditional dive location  is now called lake hydra! the lake is now under new ownership and has  reopened primarily as a location for diver training and  certifications.  all dives must be guided or under the supervision of  an insured dive professional.
there are two ways  to come dive with nedeg this year.  option #1 is to contact your  local dive shop about organizing a visit to dive lake hydra.  their  staff can arrange for professionally-supervised scuba diving tours / training at lake hydra.  while there, come over and see us at the familiar east-side  dock to dive with us on any day of our rally.

the second way is to  contact us directly with your information.  you will then be given instructions on how to purchase your entrance tickets from lake hydra and   dive with nedeg.  currently, we have one instructor that will be  covering divers on umbilical and their support from the dock.   unfortunately, that means that we cannot also supervise independent outgoing scuba  excursions.  if you are an insured instructor or divemaster and would like  to help, please let us know!

there have been many  changes to the land surrounding the lake, but the underwater  attractions remain the same.  upon arrival, you will see the new  shipping warehouse which is occupying most of the old siteâs open area.   parking, therefore, is very limited.  divers are encouraged to  carpool, and we will be shuttling persons between the dive site and  atlantis aquatics, which operates lake hydra.

*** if you are interested in diving at this rally, tickets for lake hydra are purchased online.  tickets must be purchased before 11:00 pm the evening before the day you plan to attend the lake.  there are no same-day sales for entry tickets.
please email tuckerr@twcny.rr.com your information and we will send you instructions to register and purchase entry tickets.
