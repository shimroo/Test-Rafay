rest in peace singlenfabulous






what's up beautiful people!!!!







as i sit on the beautiful island of anguilla reflecting on my
life, where i am and where i want to be, i've come to the conclusion that my life is going in a new direction...and i'm okay with it. i'm definitely thankful for all my
blessings and i'm so grateful to have been invited to attend an absolutely gorgeous wedding this weekend with my twin sister in the eastern caribbean.¬†



this relaxing and serene environment was the perfect opportunity for me to take the time to talk to my followers as i haven't posted a blog since the beginning of this year!



unfortunately i've come to the sad conclusion that there is no longer a need for
me to write this blog anymore (sad face) as i believe this phase of my life has
passed, but it was definitely fun while it lasted! thank you to all my
fabulous followers for being supportive and taking the time to read about my
shenanigans! i hope you enjoyed reading about them as much as i enjoyed writing
about them.

i may have retired the blog but resheda hasn't changed one bit ... i will always be fabulous!!! lol 






what i'm hoping is that i won't always be single but that's not
for me to decide...i leave that in god's hands. but what i want to focus on now
is making decisions that are intentional and directly affect how i want to live
my life.



recently i've had multiple changes happen in my life and if you
know me you know that i don't like "change", lol. i like consistency
and structure but life happens so i've been doing my best to adjust to these
changes! to get my life back in order i made it a point to make my 2017 vision board
and created some serious goals that i look forward to accomplishing.



this vacation to anguilla couldn't have come at a better time as
i felt like my life was in disarray! i moved into my own apartment (no longer
living with twin sister, it's bittersweet but it was time to separate) and now i'm living out of boxes and unpacking little by little. i was also dealing with
maintenance people who have the worst communication ever trying to fix things
in my apartment and failing miserably to get the job done. a few weeks later my
office space moves to a new location as well and now we need to unpack those
boxes too! in addition, i was preparing to go on this trip to anguilla. i felt so overwhelmed and had a lot going
on so naturally adjusting to these transitions have been very stressful.







right when i thought a weight had been lifted and i was going to
relax of course one more thing had to happen to stress me out even more. our first night
in anguilla the charging port on my phone decided it didn't want to work
anymore and so now i have no phone on my vacation and of course i didn't bring
a camera to use as back-up and i was so mad at myself for it. i was glad i had
my ipad but it just wasn't the same, the device itself is too big and it's not
convenient to use. so not being able to document this trip through the use of
the camera on my phone was frustrating. did i eventually relax and have a good
time yes! can you tell i have some control issues, lol, that's my type c personality rearing its ugly head. in the end, we had a great trip and enjoyed every
minute of it!





well beautiful people, i didn't want to leave you guys hanging and so i at least wanted to let you know that this particular part of this journey for me has come to an end and to say farewell to
my followers. in social work terms we call this "terminating" lol.¬†



please know that i will continue to go out and have fun in la as
that's just what us la girls do!



feel free to follow me on instagram @singlenfabla for any future
shenanigans! but don't expect much to be posted on snapchat that thing is a
pain in the ass! i don't have the patience for it and it takes up too much of my
time to keep that thing updated. 



but keep your eyes
and ears open because you never know... i just might reinvent myself and come
back to you in the near future!

smooches!

2017...try to take over the world






happy new year beautiful people,



i‚Äôve missed you guys!



2016 has finally ended and it‚Äôs time to start the new year
off right!



i am happy to report that last year i downloaded the league and bumble dating apps and have been doing my best to make a
‚Äúconnection‚Äù by swiping left and an occasional right, lol. it isn‚Äôt as easy as
it looks but i‚Äôll keep you posted on how it goes. 



as much as i love to go out and meet people organically it‚Äôs just been difficult
trying to figure out where to mix & mingle in l.a. ¬†since
i don‚Äôt discriminate and i am an equal opportunity dater (smile) i‚Äôm open to
going almost anywhere! 



i know the lord has a plan for me but i'm just trying to help him/her out a little bit, lol.



thankfully i came across this web article from timeout - the
best bars for singles in l.a. ¬†

my goal is to go to at least one of these bars every month and report back to
you my success üòâ bare with me people i‚Äôm
trying to think positive and be proactive!¬†



i'm also on a mission to loose weight (a never ending battle with my bad eating habits) so i can't be at the bar every week! this time i have enlisted an accountability partner ...¬†i downloaded the¬†my diet coach¬†app from my iphone to help keep me on track. i'll let you know if it's any good.



i also plan on going speed dating with some girl friends so
i‚Äôll let you know how that goes too!



my loyal fab followers you will definitely be the first to know when i finally go out on a
date!



also on my list of things 2 do is create my new vision boards for 2017: topics will include developing and committing to a healthy lifestyle, becoming spiritually focused and exploring
more career opportunities that create residual income!



i‚Äôm on a mission peeps and this will be one of the most
productive years yet!



stay tuned...¬†









the adventures of singlenfabulous will continue in 2017



smooches!!

disappointed and confused






hi beautiful people,





so far i'm enjoying my relaxing mini labor day weekend staycation and so i thought this would be the perfect time to check-in with my singlenfab followers and give you an update on how i'm doing.


unfortunately i haven‚Äôt been consistent with my blog updates but
i truly have a good reason‚Ä¶i really don‚Äôt have any shenanigans worth telling you about... it's just sad!





i love to report the juicy stuff right when it happens but i just
haven‚Äôt had any interesting singlenfabulous adventures.



i‚Äôve definitely been going out and attending different events but i
haven‚Äôt made any ‚Äúreal‚Äù connections with any interesting guys.



let's review my past social activities:¬†


i‚Äôve been to kiss n grind at the sofitel‚Ä¶no love
i‚Äôve been to tiffany‚Äôs on vine for nikki‚Äôs birthday‚Ä¶no love
i went to the l.a. soul music festival‚Ä¶no love
i went to an all white party at the sheraton at lax‚Ä¶no love
i went to a kappa alumni event with live music‚Ä¶no love
i attended a gerber kawasaki investment services mix & mingle event in santa monica and met
some cool people but still‚Ä¶no love



i may not be on the move every weekend but when i do go out
it‚Äôs intentional. my goal is to have fun and meet people organically! but
i'm just now having any luck. i spoke to some of my girls and apparently i'm not the only one experiencing this "dating slump".¬†



sidebar - oh and the guy i met at the essence festival that i still
keep in touch with, on occasion, had the nerve to hit me up randomly one weekend and asked me to come hang out with him?! he lives in
another state a few hours away and that would require i buy a plane ticket at the last minute!¬†ummmm
are you paying for my ticket? am i just suppose to drop what i‚Äôm doing and just
fly out of lax because you asked? no boo boo you don‚Äôt have it like that, and i
know you wish you did but sorry i‚Äôm not the one! hilarious



so now i‚Äôm back to square one! although i‚Äôve been told i
need to give online dating a try again, we all know i didn‚Äôt really give it a
chance the first time, lol, i haven‚Äôt fully committed to updating my profile
yet‚Ä¶i‚Äôm getting there! i‚Äôve been told i have to be prepared to kiss a lot of
frogs to get to the prince. but honestly i don‚Äôt have the patience i'm getting too old for this $hit, lol. i‚Äôm not trying to rush into anything but if i can go out on a couple of dates, achieve a 1st down, work my way into the in zone and then
make a touchdown, well that might be a game worth playing (wink)!





honestly peeps, as much as i love my hometown, i‚Äôm thinking
that l.a. may not be the place for me! should i consider moving, is that even an
option? are there quality eligible bachelors in other cities or states, or do women have the same problem no matter where i go? should i
look into taking my career on the road and open myself up to other social
opportunities? create a new home away from home?






i don‚Äôt know the answer to any of these questions but i know
that what i‚Äôm currently dealing with right now is for the birds!

so i will keep doing what i do best...continue to go out and have a good time every chance i get.



stay tuned as the adventures of singlenfabulous¬†must go on!¬†smooches

live a day in the life...in someone else's shoes





hi beautiful people,

let me start by saying that this isn‚Äôt one of my typical blog posts.

my loyal singlenfab followers know that the sole purpose of my blog is to give you an inside look "my perspective" on what it's like being single in l.a. "adventures and struggles." it is strictly for entertainment purposes.

however, in light of the most recent shootings that have occurred my heart is heavy and i want to take this opportunity to use this platform to share what it's like to live a day in the life...in someone else's shoes.

i would have posted this blog sooner (it took me an entire week to write it) but i was experiencing such a range of emotions that it prevented me from being objective and i couldn‚Äôt identify the right (appropriate) words to express how i was feeling at the time.

i've had several conversations with close friends and family, especially my sister keesha and brother bruce a "fellow social worker", trying to process what the hell is going on in our society right now! so i'm just going to share with you some of my concerns and leave it up to you to decide whether you agree or disagree.
let me start by saying that the african american community is historically known for rallying together in times of need to address civil rights and social injustice. if we are all human beings and equal to one another why is it that minority communities always need to fight for rights that are naturally given to "others"?
if you do your research the black lives matter movement never stated that no one else's lives mattered but wanted to bring attention to the ‚Äúbroken‚Äù justice system.

‚Äúblack lives matter was founded by patrisse cullors, alicia garza, and opal tometi as both a hashtag and a political project after the acquittal of george zimmerman in the 2012 killing of trayvon martin. distraught at the verdict, oakland, calif., community activist alicia garza wrote an impassioned facebook plea ending with the words "black lives matter." patrisse cullors, a community organizer from los angeles, shared the facebook post and put a hashtag in front of those three words. the ideals expressed ‚Äî the economic, political and social empowerment of african-americans ‚Äî resonated nationwide. since 2013, black lives matter has moved from social media platforms to the streets, morphing into an organization and a movement that gained national recognition during demonstrations after the 2014 police-involved killings of michael brown and eric garner. black lives matter is not inherently anti-police or anti-white, nor does the phrase black lives matter mean other lives aren't important. the most important directive of black lives matter, is to deal with anti-black racism, to ‚Äúpush for black people‚Äôs right to live with dignity and respect‚Äù and be included in the american democracy that they helped create.‚Äù (usa today article, ryan miller, 7/12/16).



you don't have to agree to the hashtag created and how each chapter chooses to protest but understand the reason why it was created in the first place.

not all police officers are corrupt, but there are way too many that are using their badges as a form of power and control. police brutality needs to be addressed.

for black mothers and fathers to have to worry about whether their child is going to make it home because they're afraid they will be "executed" by a cop is absolutely insane! this doesn‚Äôt automatically mean that their children don‚Äôt know how to react to police when they are approached. but ask yourself why is this particular group of people constantly being put in the position of being questioned?

try being racially profiled on a daily basis solely on the color of your skin, based on the type of car you drive, because of the neighborhood you live in or happen to be driving in, or that you are being told you "fit the description". why is this experience "the norm" for black people but for no one else?

just take a minute and ask yourself if you'd be okay with being treated like an african american in 2016? professor jane elliott video¬†(only 47 seconds).

you never know what another person is dealing with until they tell you, so don't assume you know. once you know then your whole perspective will change.

do i believe people who commit crimes should be punished yes! do i want to be protected from those who are truly "criminals" and don't have any regards to anyone else's life absolutely!

but please explain to me what egregious act was alston sterling committing in front of the store that put others lives in danger that warranted he be shot multiple times? philando castile was cooperating with police, informed them he had a gun in his possession (with a permit to carry) and died with his girlfriend and a child in the car?!

yes, there is a lot of information we do not know but what if this was your relative? wouldn't you ask what other ways they could have handled these "alleged" suspects? was killing these men absolutely necessary??

take a moment to view this¬†deadly racial double standard¬†video! several different scenarios showing white men armed with weapons being approached by police officers but not killed.

please don‚Äôt assume that just because a person of color was pulled over by a police officer that they are not a law-abiding citizen. just because they may have a criminal record doesn‚Äôt mean that they are "actively" committing a crime. why is it if a black man asks questions about why they were pulled over, what they did wrong, or if they are being detained all of sudden they are labeled as "aggressive" or "resisting??" how many times is it going to take for you to get pulled over before you become frustrated, annoyed and feel disrespected?? oh you don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶why....because it doesn‚Äôt happen to you.

overall my goal is to make sure people understand that clearly no one life is valued over another but when one group of people are dying, at an alarming rate, at the hands of police officers and they are not being ‚Äúindicted‚Äù we have a "serious problem" with our justice system!

let me be clear! this world has a history of hatred for those who are "not white." so when i hear people say that this world is made up of ‚Äúpeople‚Äù and we are all apart of ‚Äúthe human race‚Äù i agree with them and then i correct them and let them know the reality. those of us who walk around, that do not look white, are constantly being judged solely off the color of our skin and the stereotypes that come with our race because there are people out there who‚Äôve been taught to hate. ‚Ä¶we are not being judged on our religion or our sexual orientation because those are the things they don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶until you tell them. because ‚Äúhatred is taught‚Äù please know that there are still people all over the world who continue to teach it, hence the problems we have today. so forgive me for kindly agreeing to disagree with you because my experience will always be different from yours.

important side note - my comment about religion and sexual orientation is not an attempt to ignore the recent acts of violence that have been inflicted upon the lbgtq community, muslims, latinos or any other minority population. it just further proves my point that ignorance & racism is alive and well in our society. donald trump is a perfect example of it!



are there great police officers out there in the world doing an excellent job, most definitely! i've worked with a fair share of them in the los angeles area. i was a social worker who knocked on people's doors and removed abused or neglected children from the home, when absolutely necessary, with police officers right there to protect me. but i did it without passing judgement on the family i was investigating, i didn't demean them, i didn't assume what was being said about that family was true, i gave them the opportunity to explain their situation. i de-escalated situations and the police officers were present to watch me do it. they've told me several times they couldn't do my job and in return i acknowledged their courage for putting their lives on the line every day they put that uniform on.

however, i strongly believe that there are certain situations, when appropriate, that it's okay for an officer to have a conversation and ask a few more questions that doesn't come off as threatening to the person they are addressing.

but let's admitted it, there are several officers out there abusing their power and making "life threatening/deadly" decisions without giving black men the benefit of the doubt. i understand that officers are trained to be on "high alert" but they desperately need anti-bias and cultural diversity training.

let me be completely honest, you chose to be a police officer we didn't choose to be black. 

unfortunately, "my people" don't always give a good impression of themselves and feed into the stereotypes we are so adamantly fighting against. yes i am acknowledging that at times we do act a damn fool and it becomes a reflection on all of us. as a result, our whole entire race is judged off of what these particular individuals do. (black folks you know what i'm talking about. just look at world star hip hop and love & hip hop, we need to boycott all those damn shows).

at the same time, we as a community need to take responsibility on educating our children on appropriate behavior. what happened to "it takes a village to raise a child?" i work with youth and i've seen a major change on how i was raised when i was growing up and there are definitely some kids out there who need "ass whippings"¬†and "home training" (don't use any¬†objects and don't leave any marks or bruises, lol, just kidding) i'm just saying we need to get back to "raising our kids" (the ones that need it the most) in an effort to prepare them so that they are aware of what they're about to face in the real world.



so take a moment and think about what it feels like for a whole race to be judged off of a few ‚Äúbad apples‚Äù in the bunch. this is exactly what happened to the police officers in texas. they died at the hands of a vigilante who sought revenge for exactly the wrong reasons! violence begets violence so if our society continues down this path what do you expect is going to happen?? it doesn't make it right but you can only keep your foot on someone's neck for so long until they decide to fight back.

police brutality doesn't only happen to black people it happens to non-blacks too, the only difference is it only becomes an outrage if it directly affects you.

we have to come together as a people and fight for what's right when you know what is happening is wrong whether it directly affects you or not. we have to educate one another and understand each others plight "no matter what the cause is." but until we do...this society will continue to deteriorate and regress.

if you were able to get to the end of this blog entry thank you for taking the time to read one person's heartfelt opinion/thoughts on the struggles of what black people have dealt with, continue to deal with and will fight to overcome in american society in 2016.


we've come a long way but we still have a long way to go!



the adventures of singlenfabulous¬†

will continue to support #blacklivesmatter because it affects me, my family and friends directly,¬†

but i also truly believe that #alllivesmatter!
smooches

4th of july weekend activities






hi beautiful people,






i've been looking forward to this 3 day weekend since the last one, lol, because i've been trying to focus on gettin' my life! sometimes i just need that one extra day off to relax and be productive without any pressure. so guess what i'm doing...writing this blog (wink).¬†



i must say, i am sooooooooo sad that i didn't get to go to the essence festival this year! i haven't been in a couple of years and i'm starting to go through withdrawals. but i also knew that this would be my year to lay low because i really needed to refocus on reviewing my financial & career goals and commit to living a healthier lifestyle.



we are halfway through 2016 and i'm beginning to feel like things are starting to fall into place.¬†



since i changed job locations from los angeles to santa monica i've been blessed to find a co-worker, my girl jessica, who is my "no nonsense accountability partner." we both know what we need to do we just need to commit to doing it.



unfortunately, she is going to kill me because¬†i went rogue this holiday weekend and indulged in all kinds of food & drank!! lol



sidebar - ok so here's a little back story... jessica and i both agreed that we were on a mission to loose weight. so 2 weeks ago we committed to making adjustments to our eating habits. she chose to do the atkins diet, it has a lot of restrictions and is no joke but it fits her personality. when she commits to something she does it at 100%. which is why she's a great person for me to partner with. when i make decisions about what i'm going to eat i hear her in the back of my mind and it motivates me to make the right choice or there will be consequences (jessica don't play, lol).


i chose to get my meals prepped by¬†eatnakedla¬†because i just don't have the time, the energy or knowledge on trying to figure out how to make healthy meals. so i'm leaving it to the professionals.¬†that's my story and i'm sticking to it...lol.



we also agreed to exercise during the week to keep us motivated. i can honestly say that i've done pretty good these last two weeks and my body feels much better. i've never had a problem committing to changing my eating habits, i have a problem with discipline and maintaining consistency.¬†so i'll keep you posted on how i'm able to maintain this summer. i'm definitely on a mission...this weight has got to go permanently!



okay so back to my 4th of july weekend activities. me and my road dawg timi were planning to get into as many events as we possibly could but this time it involved partying with other people. now timi knows me very well and i'm real particular about who i hangout with because everyone isn't always on the same page. so this weekend was going to be real interesting.





first stop - saturday the doover

now we've never been to the doover before but i heard it was real cool so we thought we'd go and try it out. timi and i met 2 other ladies at this spot and found the line outside to be out of control when we arrived. we started to have second thoughts about going in but when the line started moving we discovered the wait wasn't that bad. we got in and it was packed with a mix of all types of people. unfortunately it was more young people then it was grown folks. we checked out the whole place long enough to have some tacos and a drink. everyone in our party wasn't too impressed with the doover so we all agreed to check out the next destination...






second stop - the perch

timi and i have never been to the perch either so i guess this was a good time to go. we proceeded to go to the rooftop where we joined a small crowd of people and observed a beautiful view of downtown los angeles. unfortunately there was no place to sit so we weren't motivated to get a drink and just stand around. around this time we were getting hungry and it was about time for us to find some food. since the last time timi and i went out we tried to go to the cork and were unsuccessful this was the perfect time to try try again, lol...

third stop - the original cork bar & grill¬†
good food, good music and strong ass alcoholic beverages! the seafood platter was excellent and a perfect way to end our night.¬†




it was at this time that timi and i confirmed who all was going with us to sangria sunday the next day! i had already reserved a table for bottle service online that allowed 6 seats at our table.¬†we had already confirmed, me, timi, my sis keesha and rhonda were going for sure.¬†timi also had a friend that confirmed she was going too! we just needed one more person. we had one more potential person who might be able to go but it was guaranteed. whether this one additional person came or not we'd be able to handle bottle service with just 5 people because it wasn't that expensive (i've seen higher tabs). but of course it would be too much like right for everything to work itself out the way we planned it...



sidebar - i sent everyone the detailed information on how much bottle service cost and clearly stated we need people who are not going to trip on spending money, willing to drink and ready to dance! but of course no one can predict what someone else is going to do??



so saturday comes and out of nowhere we had someone bail on us at the last minute...are you fucking kidding me?? (excuse my french, but i was livid)



so let me be clear...we didn't have 6 people, but we had 5 and now we are down to 4, really? i hate being left at the mercy of someone else who commits to do something and then bails. this is why i keep my circle small and don't like dealing with anyone else that i'm not familiar with.¬†



now that bottle service has increased per person it's no longer an option and we are paying $20 a head to get in with nowhere to sit...i'm pissed.



well we still went because wasn't nobody gonna rain on our parade. my sister decided not to go because she just doesn't like to deal with bull$hit and she said that she will go with us next time when it's our own crew doing bottle service! so timi and i met rhonda at ohm nightclub for sangria sundays.¬†by complete accident we met a girl named latasha while standing in line. latasha turned out to be real cool and she just so happened to be at sangria sunday solo. we all ended up hanging out together. latasha was able to get the hook up on a small table (no reservation needed) in the lounge area with "live music" and we ate, drank and danced. the crowd was "interesting" you know there's always some characters in the crowd but we had a good time anyway. we definitely have to find more spots to go to that exposes us to a more "diverse" crowd of people.¬†



as usual no luck with any potential men. i don't know what it is but i'm just going to continue to "do me" and keep going out and having a good time.



stay tuned for more singlenfabulous summer adventures...

smooches!

memorial day weekend was a bust





hey beautiful people,

i did absolutely nothing this weekend but i have to update you on what happened last memorial day weekend.


i didn't plan on doing much because i hadn't heard of anything worth getting into. i was going to just relax and lounge around the house...but then timi called me! she was like "what we getting into"? i told her i had no idea. so she shoots me an invite about this party being thrown my #plei. i saw the flyers circulating around facebook but i had my reservations. timi convinced me to go and said it's only $20 pre-sale and if we don't like it we can leave and find another spot to go to. 


so of course i was in... i didn't have anything else to do!

so let me break this down for you.... in the picture to the right is what this place alleged looked like. pretty, right?! i was expecting it to be "classy" with the cute decor and furniture.

well this is not what we saw when we walked in...this damn place looked nothing like the picture "false muthafukin advertisement".

this party was so bad i started writing this blog while i was sitting there watching all the madness.... smh.

so technically we were in a wherehouse on the 3rd floor with three rooms.

the main room was the largest and had some random seats available for people to sit on, there was also some long tables you could reserve but it definitely was not worth spending the money.

there appeared to be 1 bartender in this room and the line was ridiculously long. if you weren't paying attention people were just cutting in line because they didn't want to wait (just triflin'). the dj was okay but couldn't really make up his mind what genre of music he wanted to play. one minute it was michael jackson the next minute it was drake. can you please focus on one genre at a time!

the second room was a decent size but smaller than the main room. here is where you had the option of playing twister, oversized jenga, connect four, uno, hula hoop, etc. but there was nowhere to really sit because there were more games then there were tables. the dj in this room wasn't so bad and we would have stayed in there but the lack of seating sent us back into the main room.

we made a quick stop to check out the 3rd room which was small and set up like a small casino - blackjack or craps anyone??!! there were more tables in here but it appeared they were for people celebrating a birthday. so we moved on as this area really wasn't that exciting.

so we got lucky and found two seats in the main room and sat back to enjoy the show...

first of all, there was absolutely noooooooo eye candy!



this was definitely a "come as you are" type of party!¬†i ain't never seen so many terrible outfits in my life...gloves and snow boots, church dress and tights, bodysuit with pasties only, and some "non committal pumps" (timi's words, lol). she explained it as the heel that isn't low and it wasn't high but right in the middle hence the term non-commital, lol. i call them church shoes, lmao!¬†the women sitting at the bar looked like they were depressed. we stayed a little longer until we couldn't take it anymore and then left. we sent out an alert on facebook asking if anyone knew of any hot spots we could go to..... we got no response!


it was around 11pm and since i was hungry our next destination was the cork on adams but finding parking was an adventure in itself. every time we tried to follow someone walking to their car there was always a car that was one step ahead of us. we were going to valet but it didn't look so reliable either! we just left and called it a night.¬†

timi invited me to another event the next day hoping it would make up for the night before but i already had plans to go to the movies (sad face).¬†

what kind of memorial day weekend was that??? well at least i can say i tried something different, it just wasn't my cup of tea.



well the summer is just beginning and¬†

i still have more singlenfabulous adventures coming soon...

smooches!

summer's coming...











hi beautiful people,



i've been m.i.a. again... i know, i know.... my
bad, lol. but i really haven't been doing anything exciting...until now :)¬†

unfortunately my life has not been that
interesting these past few weeks but that's not my fault i just haven't had any
hot spots to go to!¬†my birthday was in march and my sister and i
normally do something epic but this year we decided to lay low and just go out
to eat. we ate breakfast at¬†schooner or later, lunch at¬†the strand
house¬†and dinner at¬†the terranea.¬†








in the meantime, i've just been working and
trying to come up with a full proof plan on...how i can take over the
world!!!!!!! lol.

anywhoo, the summer is coming and i will definitely be
planning more weekend shenanigans with my girls because a sista is still
single! smh



the good news is....i've had a few opportunities
to go out and mix & mingle with some cool peeps.









my sister was doing the make-up for the bride at
a wedding and i was her plus 1 guest (smile). it was a beautiful wedding and i
had a good time. there were some nice looking guys but no potentials :( more
couples with kids then single men, oh well...












last weekend, i found out there was a¬†kiss n
grind¬†"day party" at the¬†sofitel¬†and two of my girl friends were down
to go. hot damn, i'm finally going out. sadly it was the weekend that prince
passed away and they did a tribute and played all his songs. we had the best
time! there was a lot of people in attendance and the place got packed real
quick. we sat down and ate appetizers and perused through the crowd of people.
¬†i was worried about my outfit and whether i was going to be cute and
comfortable. but apparently there was no dress code because we saw a lot of
women wearing some outfits that were just unacceptable. i'm going to need these
women to get some "real" friends that's going to tell them what
outfit is flattering to their figure and not just let them walk out the house
looking crazy!¬†





but i digress, everyone was having a good time and it was a good
environment to be in. a great crowd of people, good music, good food, wine and
some nice "eye candy" to look at, but no personal connections with any
one guy in particular (sad face). a room full of men and i gets no love, wth
does a girl have to do???

must go on!
