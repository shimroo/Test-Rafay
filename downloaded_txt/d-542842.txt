this is one of the videos from script sleuth, my youtube channel dedicated to the screenwriting analysis of the greatest films of all time.
these are the general steps i use to create each video essay:


                   screen-capture the film, breaking it down into its eight story sequences
               

                   watch the film again and annotate every line of dialogue and action 
               

                   analyze my notes to identify screenwriting and storytelling tools being used
               

                   craft and write a narration script for the video essay
               

                   record the narration and optimize the audio with adobe audition

                   engineer the sound (film audio, narration, music) with premiere pro
               

                   create an attention-grabbing thumbnail with photoshop
