(from

 "the 
	intelligence support command (inscom) commander has given our provisional ci 
	battalion in camp zama, japan the designation of the 441st mi bn 
	provisional.  unfortunately at this time we cannot tie direct lineage from 
	the 441st mi detachment to the 441st mi bn provisional 
	through the official institute of heraldry, but the naming of the 
	provisional bn to the 441st is a start.  this unit will be the 
	441st mi bn provisional for at least the next two years and then 
	should become a permanent unit.   at that time the institute of heraldry 
	will determine if we continue as the 441st mi bn or receive a new 
	designation. thought you and other former 441st guys would like 
	to know that a 441st mi guidon is once again flying in japan. 
	 the 441st mi bn provisional is planning on having an unfurling 
	ceremony at camp zama, japan in the coming months and i am sure they would 
	be honored if a former 441st member happened to be in the area 
	and wanted to attend.  i will send a firm date once i know. did the 441st 
	mi detachment have a crest or insignia?"

i.            history
of the 441st counterintelligence corps detachment during world war ii



"as early as hollandia, macarthur had told a
                                counterintelligence officer, 'i'm taking the business
                                of dealing with
collaborators away from the
                                philippine government and giving it to you'."
from american caesar© by william manchester,
                                dell publishing
group, new york, 1978 


an early need for military
intelligence investigators was apparent during the early stages of world war ii.
colonel thorpe, who later became brigadier general thorpe, obtained authority to
recruit fifteen enlisted men from a replacement center and to train them in a
special school which was established at melbourne, australia.

on 25 august 1944 in
brisbane, australia, the 441st counterintelligence corps detachment, and one
subsection, the 319th military intelligence company, was organized under
to&e 50-500. (it later became the 441st military intelligence detachment
(airborne in 1966). the responsibility for the conduct of counter-intelligence
operations within units or agencies of the united states army in australia was
vested in the commanding general, usafia (original counterpart of the united
states army pacific).
on 20 november 1944 the
441st counterintelligence corps (cic) detachment was reassigned to the new
guinea campaign with the following missions: cryptographic and disaffection
investigations, ship paneling and allied port security measures including the
checking of native craft moving along the coast, investigation of incidents and
sabotage cases, and provisions for the general security of installations. the
detachment inaugurated a highly effective native police-boy system in
cooperation with the netherlands indies civil administration. these youths
contacted village chiefs, led reconnaissance patrols, helped interrogate native
suspects, and assisted in special investigations and in maintaining an informant
net.

in early 1943, the 441st cic was activated out of the 5227th cic detachment 
(provisional) in brisbane, australia with approximately 100 agents. these men 
were spread far and wide from the 32d and 41st infantry divisions fighting in 
the owen stanley mountains of new guinea to almost every harbor in allied hands 
in the pacific. the agents wore u.s. army uniforms without rank. when 
questioned, they responded that they worked directly for the war department. all 
441st members were hand picked either in the states or in australia. their 
initiative and authority was always encouraged by the general macarthur and his 
g2. mr. edwards' book has extraordinary stories of ingenuity, daring, success 
and failure of cic. his book is a fascinating history of the newly conceived 
counter intelligence effort of the allies. the cic exploits in the pacific were 
"invented" out of experience and necessity. this chronicle of america's greatest 
generation in its greatest test of war is more than history. it is a lesson for 
today in military-political leadership during times of international challenge.
duvall a edwards is 
a unique man: trial lawyer, counter intelligence expert, writer and adventurer. 
his superb books are still available.

the balance of the new
guinea campaign saw a repetition of o previous actions by the 441st. the
detachment landed at noemfoor island, sansapor, new britain, and morotai. on the
eve of the invasion of leyte gulf, the 441st could look back on ten months of
1944 during which its officers, agents and other cic detachments from other
units had functioned in staging, combat, and post-operational phases with 15
divisions, one special task force, one regimental combat team, four corps, and
two armies.
on
13 march 1945 operations of the 441st counterintelligence corps detachment in
the philippines commenced with the attack on leyte province. more than 20 cic
officers,and agents, in addition to attached filipinos, landed on d-day with
elements of the 6th army, and 24th corps, 7th, 24th, 96th and 1st cavalry
divisions.
the
civilian situation in dulag was critical and the detach­ment spent the first
few days interrogating persons in the civilian enclosure. considerable time was
also spent contacting guerrillas and gathering tactical and counterintelligence
information.
a
meeting with representatives of the philippine commonwealth resulted in all
potential political appointees being checked by cic prior to their appointment.
this clearance procedure included all constabulary personnel and municipal
officials, thus giving cic, at the outset, firm and reliable control over
appointees.
experience
gained in leyte made the cic better prepared than ever for the ensuing
operations on luzon and other islands of the philippines. the first cic
personnel landed on luzon, d-day, 6 january 1945. within three hours after the
initial assault, troops had forged a beachhead along lingayen gulf coast of
panagasenan province. by d-plus-2, nine cic combat detachments with a complement
of 22 officers, and more than 100 agents, exclusive of attached filipino
personnel, were in full operation. as in the leyte campaign, control of the
movement of civilians was a major problem. cic road­blocks established at
strategic points proved an effective means of screening natives and provided a
safeguard against infiltration by japanese soldiers impersonating as filipino
civilians. cic operations spread from island to island in the philippine chain
as the activity of the corps mush­roomed. during march 1945, under combat
conditions, 4,140 security cases were handled. the majority of the cases were
possible collaboration and loyalty checks for prospec­tive philippine
officials.

blood chit (updated march 9, 2003)
for
gallantry in action and meritorious service rendered to tactical units with whom
they were assigned during all cam­paigns up to and including the philippine
campaign, officers and agents of the cic were awarded two legions of merit, two
silver stars, forty-six bronze stars, one soldier's medal and thirteen purple
hearts.
as
the philippine campaign drew to a close, attention was focused on the cic,
because, for the first time, american forces would be coming into direct contact
with japanese citizens in their homeland.
the
battle of okinawa opened with the initial assault on 1 april 1945. fourteen cic
agents lost their lives in support of the okinawan operation. overall, the cic
conducted its mission with great skill and appreciation of the poten­tially
explosive situation on japanese home territory.
training
and planning were under way for cic participation in operation
"olympic" and "coronet", the invasion of the japanese
homeland, when vj-day came. armies, corps and divisions that were geared for
combat moved into japan to occupy it peacefully. cic detachments accompanied the
tac­tical units into mainland japan, but their mission was not clear, since no
one knew how the japanese public would react to the american occupation. the
80th metropolitan cic detachment landed at yokohama on 2 september 1945 and
advance elements of the 441st cic detachment on 15 september 1945. the 441st cic
detachment entered tokyo and officially set up headquarters.
on
26 september 1945, i corps units landed at wakayama, accom­panied by a cic
detachment which moved into osaka, kyoto, nagoya, and other japanese cities. by
1 november 1945, it was apparent that the occupation was to be peaceful, and cic
detachments were detached from combat units and set up on a regional and area
basis.


ii. history of the 441st counterintelligence corps
detachment during the occupation of japan
at
the end of world war ii, the 441st counterintelligence corps (cic) detachment
was assigned to japan. along with the 319th mi company, the 441st proved to be
the most important operating agency of the civil intelligence section. these two
organizations formed the major investigating agencies in the field. the missions
included: covering foreign espionage, treason, sabotage, sedition, subversive
actions, security violations, and any act inimical to the policies of the
occupation forces.

early
occupation problems were caused by the wide, pendulum­like swings which
occurred in the power of cic. when an incident took place, extremely restrictive
directives were issued on a case by case basis. finally, the organization was
able to compile and publish a policy guide which enabled the lower echelons of
the cic to become thoroughly knowledgeable in official policies on a wide
variety of subjects.


441st headquarters, norton hall, tokyo, 1946 


in
the interests of efficiency, and to prevent overlapping with other agencies,
activities of cic were limited to: surveillance of subversive activities,
individuals, or ideological movements, national or foreign, that had an adverse
effect on the purposes and objectives of the occupa­tion; and to intensify
security surveillance under the general intent of counter espionage. this
clarification of the mission eliminated an unaccountable number of crim­inal
investigations and other irregularities, not of a counterintelligence nature,
with which cic had found itself involved. while the basic plan of having a cic
unit in each prefecture had remained constant, administrative control of such
units was maintained at corps level. when i and ix corps were located in kyoto
and sendai, cic had its regional headquarters in the same cities.

the
reorganization of the cic from a combat support unit to an occupation agency
took considerable time since frequent rotation of personnel caused by
demobilization reduced the overall continuity of the unit's effort. such
personnel turmoil necessitated extensive procurement and training of
inexperienced personnel.

major
problems included the standardization of operating procedures and centralization
of operational control. based on long personal contact with individual tactical
commanders and g2s', the cic had considerable difficulty in interpreting
directives from higher and more remote commands. with the planned deactivation
of the two corps' headquarters, the cic regional headquarters were eliminated
and liaison officers temporarily placed at corps headquarters pending the deactivation.
the existing cic districts, formed during the major reorganization of september
1948, evolved as major subor­dinate headquarters. at first there were seven
districts. first district included the island of kyushu and part of southern
honshu, an area which roughly comprised the area of operations of the 24th
infantry division. second district included part of southern honshu and the
island of shikoku, an area generally under the control of british commonwealth
occupation forces. third district covered south‑central honshu in another
area controlled by the 24th infantry divi­sion. fourth district took in that
area of central honshu controlled by the 1st cavalry division, less the tokyo
metropolitan area and kanagawa (yokohama) prefecture. fifth district controlled
northern honshu while sixth district supervised the island of hokkaido; both of
these areas were under the control of the 7th infantry division. the 7th, known
as tokyo‑kanagawa district, operated in close con­junction with
headquarters, 441st, until september 1949 when the district was split into two
areas. later these two areas became the 7th and 8th districts, respectively.
under each of the first five districts, there was one counterintelligence corps
area, corresponding to each prefecture in the district.

 in
hokkaido, which was regarded by the japanese as more a territory or colony than
a prefecture, sixth district main­tained offices in the principal cities. in
march 1951 there were eight districts and 50 cic areas or sub-areas. after
considerable study, an overall reorganization of the 441st cic detachment was
completed, using to&e 30‑500, with change 3, dated 15 september 1948.
this reorganization was finally approved by the department of the army, and
became effective 1 march 1950 under authority published in general order 16,
headquarters, and service group, gnq, ffc, dated 24 february 1950.

late
in 1949, with the world situation becoming increasingly less encouraging,
colonel lawrence g. smith, commanding offi­cer of the 441st, directed that
plans be made for intensive combat field training. the training was divided into
three phases: individual basic cic training to instruct new personnel, and
retrain experienced personnel in cic combat operations; field training for
provisional combat teams; and finally, actual participation in field maneuvers
with tactical units.


iii. history of the 441st counterintelligence corps detachment during the
korean conflict.
at
the outbreak of the korean war, the 441st cic detachment was called upon to
furnish combat cic detachments to accom­pany the tactical units moving into
korea. throughout the summer of 1950, many elements of the 441st were success­fully
dispatched to korea with several subsequently seeing action during the inchon
landing. four additional detach­ments were organized in those hectic first 15
days of the korean war.
on
4 july 1950, a cic detachment reported to the 2d logistical command. another cic
detachment left on 7 july 1950 with the 25th infantry division.
on
10 july 1950, a cic detachment reported for duty with the 1st cavalry division,
while another cic detachment went to 8th army headquarters. three more
detachments were organized in august 1950, and on 4 august 1950 a cic detachment
joined the 1st marine division. the far east command liaison group, later
organized as a cic detachment, was ready for duty on the 10th of august, and a
cic detachment joined i corps headquarters on 31 august 1950. experiences in
korea re­vealed that much still remained to be learned concerning cic
activities in combat, particularly in the areas of personnel and equipment
utilization. many unofficial, and sometimes frantic suggestions emanated from
the 441st de­tachments in korea, particularly concerning equipment. due to
hostile activity, individual agents, normally equipped with a .38 caliber
snubnosed revolver, were quickly asking for m-2 carbines and even machine guns.
other suggestions were made concerning additional equip­ment, or modification
and/or elimination of certain mate­rial which was not compatable to the korean
situation. to further remedy the situation, cic units in korea were di­rected
to maintain contact with the 441st cic detachment and to forward reports of
activities and recommendations for changes in equipment to the 441st. 


while
the 441st supplied replacements to augment certain detachments in korea, it
continued to maintain it's nation­wide surveillance of japan to guard against
the development of any possible subversive activity. 


with
the approach of the armistice in korea, the 441st cic detachment was called upon
to play a part in one of the most unique operations in it's history: the
exchange of prisoners of war between the united nations command and the
communist forces. there were two phases of this opera­tion: "little
switch" - the exchange of 149 sick and wounded american prisoners of war in
april and may 1953; and "big switch" - the exchange of 3,629 american
prisoners of war in july, august and september 1953.
during
the processing of recovered un forces personnel, cic's mission was to collect
information of counterintel­ligence interest. when the "switch
operations" were con­cluded, the 441st resumed operations in its primary
mission in japan, the surveillance of all subversive individuals and groups,
both national and foreign, whose presence was a threat to the us‑japan
security pact, and whose ideas were inimical to the best interests of the united
states and the united nations.
with
the signing of the japanese peace treaty in april 1952, cic found itself in the
position of being a foreign intel­ligence agency in the territory of a friendly
power. former occupation troops were suddenly the guests of japan. it was of paramount importance that cic convert itself from
the role of an occupation authority to that of a friendly, tactful, helpful
allied intelligence agency. cic units, therefore, accompanied the former
occupation troops in their withdrawal to specified military bases and
installations. 
 

additional
history commentary from jim cate jcate4@cs.com
: "i served with the 441st cic in tokyo, japan, from january 1957 until its
reorganization in march of 1958.  i served in the counter espionage -
soviet.  the korean war was over in the early 1950s.  in 1958 there
was a general reduction of military personnel worldwide.  the 441st cic
encountered a major reorganization in approximately march of 1958 (need to
consult my orders and records for detailed information.)  it was reduced to
36 people and was officially known as the 36th detachment.  most married
personnel with dependents were returned to the us for other assignments.
 the single or unmarried personnel such as myself at the time were mostly
reassigned to the 308th cic in seoul, korea.  i was in the group sent to
korea to complete our military term of duty.  i personally know many of the
persons that remained behind in japan as a part of the 36th detachment.  in
fact my former holabird classmates, roger hart and will callihan, were retained
in japan as a part of the 36th.  i made a couple of trips from seoul, korea
back to japan somewhat as a liaiaon between the 2 units and some continuing
activity in some open intelligence cases.  i still have an order listing
all the names of the personnel in the 441st at the time of its reduction or
reassignment.  i note col. rainford was listed as the co.  he finished
his tour of duty and returned to the us in 1958.  ltc hontoon (? spelling)
the executive office assumed the position for the short period of time until the
36th was established.  ed meiser, s-4, was then the ranking officer under
hontoon.  ed is still alive and lives in ny state.  i am in constant
contact with him.  i would like to contribute more to this history after
some more careful review of records.  if i can be of specific assistance,
please advise.  i shall be most happy to assist. in japan the 441st
was unique.  mcarthur had cic with a wide range of authority.  this
continued until the reorganization.  the cic did much of the work that the
cia would normally do.  when the "phasedown" occurred, much of
the cic activity was turned over to the cia.  the cic in my years in tokyo
targeted the soviet embassy.  we even ran a number of "defection"
operations.  our best agent was often "followed" by cia personnel
in attempts to learn his sources.  he was the best in the business.  he
is now in his early 80's having been at pearl harbor on december 7 and ending up
wwii being shot down as a bomber pilot over germany and captured.  he now
lives near ft. huachuca in retirement.  i visited with him on january 5,
1999 and then went on the visit the mi museum at ft. huachuca.  his
"right hand" fellow agent now lives in los angeles. incidentally, i
served as president of the national counter intelligence corps association in
2000.  currently, i am vice chairman of this organization."



iv.                 history
of the 441st intelligence corps detachment, (airborne) okinawa vietnam
the
end of the korean conflict saw the 441st cic detachment deactivated. however, in
january 1962, with tension increasing over the developments in southeast asia,
the 441st intelligence corps detachment was reactivated and assigned to the
united states army, ryukyu islands, okinawa, and further assigned to 1st special
forces group (airborne), 1st special forces, okinawa. the detachment's mission
was to train, assist, and advise indigenous military personnel in developing a
mili­tary intelligence capability, and to provide military intel­ligence
support to the counterinsurgency force structure. the 441st intelligence corps
detachment was also assigned as a member unit of usarpac's special action forces
(saf). from 1962 through 1972, the 441st was not assigned to the war in vietnam
as a complete unit; however, a num­ber of personnel were attached in support of
the intelli­gence activities conducted by the 5th special forces group in
vietnam. from january through may 1963 personnel of the detachment presented
intelligence instruction to the 1st special forces group (airborne) operational
detachments as part of their pre‑deployment training in preparation for
assignment in the republic of vietnam. during november and december 1963,
members of the detachment began debriefing "a" and "b"
detachments of the 1st special forces group (airborne) as they returned from tdy
assignments in the republic of vietnam. it was felt that these debriefings would
enable members of the 441st detachment to acquire a more comprehensive knowledge
of "a" and "b" detachment activities and problems in the
republic of vietnam, so that more effective and pertinent instruction could be
presented to deploying detachments. the first-hand, cur­rent intelligence
information derived from these debriefings also assisted the 441st intelligence
corps detachment in preparation for the deployment of‑operational
intelligence teams into the republic of vietnam. 
in
addition to the pre-deployment training and debriefing of "a" and
"b" detachments, the unit participated in re­searching, preparing and
maintaining area studies of southeast asian countries with emphasis placed on special forces areas of
operation in the republic of vietnam. from 1962 to 15 may 1972, personnel from
the unit also supported the usarpac intelligence school on okinawa by writing
and teaching intelligence subjects.
on 12 august 1964 under the provisions of general order 150 headquarters,
united states army, pacific, personnel in all slots of the 441st detachment were
placed on airborne status. during the period 1 january 1963 through 31 december
1965, the 441st intelligence corps detachment continued in its primary mission
of assisting the 1st special forces group (airborne), 1st special forces in
their intelligence plan­ning, and operations, as well as providing operational
as­sistance to those interested agencies engaged in intelli­gence activities
and operations. the month of march 1965 saw the first concentrated efforts to
organize, place, and operate personnel of the 441st intelligence corps
detachment in the republic of vietnam as an integrated intelligence team. this
was the first time that any tactical intellignece unit was committed to the
conflict in vietnam. se­lected personnel composed an intelligence team which de­parted
okinawa for a period of 180 days tdy. upon arrival in the republic of vietnam
the were attached to the 5th special forces group (airborne and located in
various portions of the country. intelligence operations commenced with emphasis
on accurate and timely processing of infor­mation received. certain field
agencies that had previously had only vague indications of impending actions now
had centralized facilities, manned by trained intelligence personnel who
processed, analyzed and disseminated vitally needed intelligence.


on many occasions, this arrangement resulted in
accurate predictions of when, where, and how an attack could be expected to take
place.
for their infantry actions in the republic of vietnam, and their exposure
to hostile fire, all members of the team were awarded the combat infantryman's
badge. in addition to being awarded the combat infantryman's badge, members of
the team were awarded one bronze star, seven air medals, and ten army
commendation medals. other awards for other detachment personnel on different
missions in the republic of
vietnam consisted of one bronze star, two air medals, and two army commendation
medals.
in
addition to the republic of vietnam, personnel from the detachment participated
in operations and exercises in the republic of china and thailand. these
assignments included specialized intelligence operations as well as mobile train­ing
teams (mtt's), and duties as advisors.
typical
duties included: counterintelligence officers and advisors; defense against
sound equipment (dase) advisors; defense against methods of entry dame)
advisors; intelligence analysts; order of battle specialists; and security
control officers.
441st
intelligence corps detachment experienced personnel problems during 1965, since
it was performing the dual role of housekeeping on okinawa and deploying teams
on operational missions throughout southeast asia. serious personnel problems
existed, primarily due to shortage of administrative personnel. this resulted in
a concentrated program of cross­training selected personnel to perform both
administrative and operational duties.
on
15 october 1966 under general order 244, dated 17 october 1966, the 441st
intelligence corps detachment was redesignated as the 441st military
intelligence detachment (mid) airborne. the 441st mid (abn) had the
responsibility of supporting saf asia missions by compiling timely information
in the areas of strategic and tactical intelligence. to meet these requirements
the 441st was divided into four basic sections: (1) the administration section
to provide administrative and supply support to the unit; (2) the
counterintelligence section to provide the commander with information in the
areas of passive intelligence and counter­intelligence, personnel security,
document security and physical security; (3) the military intelligence section
to provide the commander with tactical intelligence evalua­tion of various
areas of interest to saf asia; (4) the area intelligence section to provide
strategic intelligence evaluation. personnel were trained in such specialities
as imagery interpretation, order of battle, and interrogation of prisoners of
war.

with
the new reorganization., detachment planning and operations were improved to a
great degree; however, difficulty was experienced in getting personnel
replacements and addi­tional personnel needed to fill to&e slots.
programmed re­placements were slow in arriving; in addition, several scheduled
replacements were diverted to other units. intelligence support of special
forces projects, both on and off­isiand,,was hampered by this shortage of
personnel. however, morale among detachment personnel was excellent despite the
extensive additional duties being placed upon individuals who were.not on off
island tdy.,
during the calendar year 1966 441st detachment personnel
participated
in nineteen ('19) off island missions. .these included twelve (12) security
missions to the 9th logistics command.; thailand; one (1) liaison mission to
"operation dropdown" in europe; two (2) missions to the 5th special
forces group (abnt,vietnam; two (2) training missions to korea; one (1) photo
mission to yokosuka, japan; and support to exercise "li ming " .in
taiwan, republic of china.
during
1967 the 441st increased its intelligence support to the 9th logistics command
in thailand. personnel of the 441st detachment continued to gain valuable
experience in the inner workings of counterintelligence activities in the
counterinsurgency situation of southeast asia.
operations
in south vietnam with the 5th special forces group during 1968 resulted in the
unit's first combat death, ssg dale r. karpenske. the combat operations in south
vietnam provided members of the 441st mid with valuable experience in
intelligence support of combat operations.
  

during
1969 and 1970 personnel of the 441st participated in twenty five (25) missions
in the republic of vietnam with the 5th special forces group. these operational
mission consisted of operational order of battle, imagery interpretation and
area intelligence. in addition to vietnam, other unit members were deployed to
thailand, korea and the philippine islands. during 1971 operational missions to
vietnam subsided considerably due to the phase down of american involvement in
that area. however, other off-island missions continued in thailand, taiwan and
korea.

from
march 1972 through july 1972, personnel of the 441st mid participated in project
friday gap, an attf to the republic of vietnam to instruct khmer republic
personnel in special forces staff procedures. the students eventually went back
to cambodia to become the staff for the khmer special forces.
during
april 1972, five members of the 441st augmented detachment a 122 of the 1st
special forces group which presented a 30 day period of instruction to the rok
special forces. instructional subjects included the use of intelligence in
unconventional/counterinsurgency warfare. in­struction to the seventy rok
officers and ncos also included aspects of evasion and escape,
counterintelligence, counterinsurgency intelligence, order of battle and combat
intelligence.
from
28 april 1972 to 13 august 1972, ten members of the 441st participated in an
intelligence mtt to bangkok, thailand. the purpose of the mission was to train a
select cadre of royal thai army military intelligence unit per­sonnel in four
major intelligence skills: human resource operations, counterintelligence,
interrogation, and hand­held aerial photography. a total of 90 students were
trained by this mtt. many were subsequently assigned to royal thai army
divisions operating in the field against the communist terrorists of thailand.
others were utilized by thai police special branch in their bangkok operations
against the communist terrorists in the capital city.
on
15 may 1972, two officers from the 441st and five enlisted men from other 1st
special forces group units deployed to the republic of the philippines for a
forty five day attf mission. the mission of the team was to provide selected
intelligence and demolition training to republic of the philippines offi­cers
and non-commissioned officers. training was conducted in three phases over a
thirty-seven day period. the first week of instruction consisted of
counterinsurgency subjects; the second and third weeks covered interrogation,
and counter­intelligence; the fourth and fifth weeks covered booby traps and
the graduation ceremony.
a
mission to assist the republic of china army in constructing a division level
intelligence command post exercise (cpx) was conducted by the 441st from july
1972 to september 1972. the training team consisted of seven personnel. working
through counterparts, a combat situation was written, using actual chinese
communist and republic of china army order of battle, to conduct a five day cpx.
while translations and rehearsals were taking place, a combat intelligence
refresher course was presented to player personnel. the actual cpx began with
the us team and their counterparts supervising the 84th roca division g2/s2
personnel who conducted the cpx.
the
mission was considered to be a success for the following reasons: (1) the
present state of division level intelligence efficiency was identified, (2) the
need for trained intelligence personnel within the division was noted, (3) areas
of weakness within the mechanics of combat intelli­gence were identified, and
(4) future programs of intelli­gence training and their priorities were noted.
during
may 1972, the 441st deployed one man to seoul, rok to assume the duties of g2,
director headquarters (dhq) exercise foal eagle fy planning staff. it was the
g2's responsi­bility to provide the input for the intelligence annexes of the
exercise's general plan and operations order. the intel­ligence input comprised
about one third of the exercise's plan and order. one of the g2's major
responsibilities was the creation of an escape and evasion (e&e) plan. in
october the same individual again deployed to the rok to serve as the e&e
umpire for exercise foal eagle. the training phase was successfully completed
and the e&e net operation looked promising. however, the declaration of
martial law in the republic of korea precluded the e&e operations, and
eventually exercise foal eagle was cancelled in its entirety.
during
the latter part of 1972 and early 1973 extensive special forces training was
conducted by members of the 441st mi detachment in anticipation of the approval
of the revised mto&e which would specify that all detachment personnel be
special forces qualified.
from
9 october 1972 through 8 january 1973, mountain training was conducted on camp
chinen by all members of the 441st mi detachment. in addition, 441st instructors
gave mountain training to personnel from 400th asaod, 539th engineer battalion
and 1st civil affairs battalion. during february 1973, the unit conducted
demolitions, land navigation and survival training.
on
29 june 1973, under the provisions of general order 321, cincusarpac, the 441st
mi detachment was reorganized under mtoe 30-500gp301, p30173. the major change
in the mtoe was that there was a decrease in counterintelligence personnel and
an increase in area intelligence personnel. in order for the unit to be more
proficient in supporting the secur­ity assistance teams or a joint
unconventional warfare task force, it was determined that all personnel of the
441st mi detachment should be special forces qualified when a team was assigned,
or attached to an airborne force.
from
january 1973 until mid 1974, the detachment participated in joint escape and
evasion and jungle training at the usaf jungle survival school located in the
republic of the philippines. the detachment normally provided two personnel per
class with a total of 17 personnel eventually partici­pating in the joint
training.
from
15 may through 22 may 1973, selected members from the 441st mi detachment
participated in ftx mal hombre, conducted in the northern training area of
okinawa. during this ftx unit members acted as guerrilla forces and were under
the command and control of a special forces "a" detachment.
on
25 june 1973, one warrant officer and four enlisted men were attached to sfod 3,
co a, 1st sf bn, 1st sfg (abn), for pre-deployment training, which consisted of
six weeks of korean language training and preparation for deployment to korea on
an intelligence, escape and evasion mission to korea special forces officers and
non-commissioned officers. training was conducted in eight phases: fifty hours
of order of battle/combat intelligence, twenty-four hours of interrogation,
twenty-nine hours of special forces intelligence skills, twenty-two hours of
counterintelligence and security, thirty-one hours of evasion and escape, twenty
hours of survival training with the training culminating in an ftx conducted
south of seoul, republic of korea.

death of sp6 james l. shirah who passed away on february 6, 2002. james served
in the 441st in the late sixties. he graciously corresponded with many members
of the 441st until his death. he is survived by his wife. many thanks to ssg
frank dynan of the 441st for providing this information. james shirah, a
legendary figure in intelligence circles, was featured in a non-fiction book
entitled,

beginning
in august 1973, the mi section, 441st mi detach­ment became opcon to the group
s-2 in an effort to integrate the intelligence effort in support of the 1st
special forces group mission.
during
september through november 1973, the detachment provided one interrogator in
response to a department of the army-directed emergency requisition to support
the highly sensitive jcs directed project 404.
in
october 1973, the detachment concluded an intelligence mos proficiency training
agreement (u) with the 500th mi group. this agreement provided 441st personnel
an opportunity to present instruction in support of 500th mi group's training
missions conducted with pacom countries. selected personnel from the 441st were
attached for special duty to the 500th mi group with duty station at the us army
pacific intelligence training activity (pacinta) in bangkok, thailand.
from
2 november through 22 december 1973, one order of battle warrant officer of the
441st mi detachment was selected to assist the us army pacific intelligence
training activity mo­bile training team in training twenty khmer officers in
order of battle operations.
in
december 1973, personnel of the 441st mi detachment participated in boat
training on the beaches of chinen,
okinawa. in addition to regular duty functions, linguist of the detachment
conducted language classes for the members of the japanese self defense force at
site 6 outside camp chinen. this training was particularly oriented to those
japanese self defense force soldiers who were going to fort bliss, texas for
further technical training. additionally japanese‑american relations were
improved through better understanding and exchange of each others culture.
during
the period january through march 1974, the detachment provided two personnel to
serve as interpreters in conjunc­tion with 1st special forces group northern
ski training conducted at hokkaido, japan,
the
441st mi detachment provided intelligence and counterintelligence support to 1st
special forces group (airborne) by providing seven personnel in conjunction with
ftx foal eagle, a joint/combined operation conducted in the republic of korea
from february through april 1974. members of the detachment served at all levels
during the exercise to include establishing the escape and evasion problem for
the operation.


in
conjunction with the pacinta mos proficiency training agreement to provide
instruction in support of the 500th mi group, one individual was dispatched to
provide instruction in imagery interpretation and aerial observer techniques to
selected khmer fank students. following the completion of this training, these
students were to serve with fank/g-2, phnom penh, cambodia. this training was
conducted during the period 19 february to 11 april 1974.
on
22 february 1974, the 441st mi detachment received message cincusarpac 20223262
february 1974, subject: parachute jump pay authorization. this message
authorized the 441st a total of eighteen jump positions. on 6 march 1974, an
mtoe change was submitted which programmed three military intell­igence
augmentation "packages" in support of oplan 5001. these augmentation
packages contained the military intelligence specialty skills (interrogation,
order of battle, photo interpretation, counterintelligence, and area
intelligence) necessary for a tactical situation. language qualification played
an important consideration for determining jump positions for the employment and
utilization in a tactical environment.
in
april 1974, the 441st mi detachment received instructions from department of the
army, (da-damo-ods msg) (c), 0218502 april 1974, subject: ppgftrosafa (short
title) (u) to transfer from overseas duty station to conus, effective 30 june
1974, with new duty station located at fort devens, massachusetts. beginning 6
may 1974, the detachment began transfer and turn in of all station property in
preparation for redeployment to conos. individuals assigned to the de­tachment
were ordered to move under individual pcs orders to the new duty station.
departure of all detachment personnel and to&e equipment had been completed
prior to 15 june 1974.


v.              history of the 441st
military intelligence detachment, (airborne), fort devens
a
three man advance party arrived in fort devens, massachusetts on 3 june 1974.
the mission of the advance party element was to coordinate, program and develop
support for receiving the detachment personnel and equipment as they arrived at
fort devens.
the
441st mi detachment was attached to fort devens, massachusetts by forscom
general order 1085, dated 27 june 1974. the detachment was further attached to
10th special forces group (airborne), 1st special forces, fort devens,
massachusetts 01433 by direction of general order 231, dated 8 july 1974 as
directed by headquarters, fort devens. 10th special forces group (airborne)
served as sponsoring unit in receiving all personnel and equipment at the new
duty station.
the
summer months of 1974 served as a reorientation period for the detachment in
order that the assets of the detachment could reorient from a pacific area of
operations to the europe­an area of operations. although critically short.
personnel and completely without to&e equipment until mid august, the
detachment sought to develop and increase its support capabilities to 10th
special forces group (airborne). the detachment was temporarily billeted for
operations in building p-653 located on macarthur avenue.
during
the period 25 august to 10 october 1974, the 441st mi detachment provided four
personnel to support operation flintlock-1974 conducted in europe as an annual
field training exercise. detachment personnel were used to augment and support
normal operations, as well as providing counterintelligence support to the
special forces operational base (sfob) located at bad tolz, federal republic of
germany.
a
memorandum of understanding between the commander, 10th special forces group
(airborne), and the commander, 902nd military intelligence group was developed
in august 1974 to provide for utilization of detachment counterintelligence
personnel to provide support for the 902nd fort devens res­ident office, 902nd
military intelligence group, as a means of maintaining mos proficiency of
detachment ci personnel. the program was first implemented in november 1974,
when one individual was provided to support the fort devens resident office for
as initial period of 120 days.
the
annual acsi general inspection was conducted in december 1974 with the
detachment receiving an overall rating of satisfactory.
1975
marked the first complete training year for the 441st as a part of the 10th
special forces group (airborne). since the 10th sfga was not previously
supported by an mi detachment, it was determined that the 441st could most
effectively serve the group in the role of enemy/evaluators during the ortt
roadrunner i. this afforded the mi detachment an excellent opportunity to
observe the 10th sfga and to learn their special techniques and operating
procedures. in subsequent training, the mi detachment used diverse techniques to
support the 10th sfga operational elements. primary among the methods was the
practice of providing a mi specialist to the deploying area command or
operational detachments. additionally, support for various combat elements in
the 10th sfga.
while
the entire mi detachment participated in ortt road­runner i, only selected
elements supported the 11th special forces group (airborne) (usar) on roadrunner
ii. both read­iness tests took place in the allegheny national forest of
pennsylvania. during this period, elements of the 441st participated in the
joint uw ftx alpine friendship.
furthermore,
the 441st mi detachment participated in a department of the army pilot training
program by mutually supporting and training the 241st mi detachment (usar) under
the "one­army" concept. before the close of the year, the 441st mi
detachment participated in the annual reforger exercise, ftx flintlock.
1976,
the bicentennial year, evolved as the year of complete assimilation of the 441st
military intelligence detachment into the family of the 10th special forces
group organization. in its assigned capacity, the 441st mi detachment completely
integrated into the activities and operations of the 10th sfga in all areas,
ranging from providing intelligence specialist support during the 10th sfga
artep 76 to the establishment and management of operational security at the sfob
during ftx flintlock-1976. various concepts of internal organiza­tion and
operations were considered and developed during 1976, with the emphasis on
providing maximum intelligence support to the family of 10th sfga units. the
concept of bat­talion support teams, representing all of the unit's basic mi
skills, was found to be its most productive and flexible means of providing
direct, geographical intelligence support. another major endeavor of the
detachment during 1976 centered around the organization of a current
intelligence analysis and production capability, dedicated to providing
additional timely and in-depth intelligence support to the 10th sfga. the
detachment also conducted mi training and assistance in a myriad of military
intelligence skills and subjects.

new - by 1979, the two battalion and one group 
hq support teams were known as mi support teams or mist.  the mist provided 
tactical intelligence, counterintelligence, order-of-battle and imagery 
interpretation capabilities in garrison and when deployed.  in garrison, the 
mist continued their intelligence support of the oda area studies program, jcet 
briefings/debriefings, and current intelligence evaluations.  the 441st 
mid provided mist in support of the group sfob and two battalion fobs 
participating in ftx flintlock in 1979 and 1980.  the mist also deployed in 
support of the sfob and two fobs during the groups artep in october 1979.  
meanwhile, unit training focused on mist and individual skills needed to support 
10th sfga war plans, including affiliation training with the 44th 
civil affairs company (usar), warwick, rhode island.  the 441st mid 
was deactivated on 3 october 1980.  its men, and the 402d asa det, were 
reassigned to the newly-organized 10th mi company organic to the 10th 
sfga.
 
the 441st mid 
conducted its last airborne jump at turner dz, ft. devens, ma, on 12 sep 1980.  
not all members were able to participate.  the combat equipment jump manifest 
listed the following 16 participants:

inactivation: 
in september, 1980, the 441st military intelligence detachment was inactivated
at fort devens, ma. members of the unit were reassigned to the 402d army
security agency (asa) (sod) and merged into the 10th military intelligence
company. the unit colors were furled for the last time. (information from david
d. perkins, ltc-retired).
     kevin o'brien, a member of the 441st at the time noted,
"it is always a sad thing to furl a flag, and you will be pleased to know
that the 441st mid went out with the same high standards and panache it always
had in operation."
