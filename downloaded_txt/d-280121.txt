thinking about the many aspects of art, history and culture, is what i do. my questions lead me to the final phases of the produced art which is actually seeing the art work in 3-dimensional space as a book or text, sculpture/installation, painting or drawing or public art. seeing, thinking, doing, questioning and making art from ideas relative to questions about culture, history, today's issues, all peoples and myself leads to a final visible art product.  i will use anything that i know or can learn to realize the art potential of questions i have, to complete an ideasandra rowe is a visual artist, author/writer, consultant, curator, and educator. rowe's work has been included in exhibitions in japan, paris, cuba, nigeria and other galleries and museums throughout the united states.
