thanks from our patrons 










						i want to thank you for saving my life. for i receive no mail from the free world, so these books are my lifeline.					









						i had read my dictionary so much, the pages are giving way. 					









						i have enjoyed every book sent to me by the prison book program. even if i was unable to use it or get into the book, there was always someone here who enjoyed it. 
					









						when one is trapped in so much evil and negative filth, it is a very encouraging reminder that there remains human decency, compassion and warm heartedness. 					









						i don’t feel as if i thank you enough! i now find myself writing books of my own. thank you. you are the reason for it! 					









						the only freedom i find behind bars is when i’m transported to the worlds i find in between the covers.					









						the book sent to me allowed me to escape into my imagination and become part of the book. thank you so much for this program.					









						we inmates are very limited in the things we can access, but because of your great program, i’ve been able to learn more about the law and my rights, draw better and even write my first novel. 					









						thank you for the books you have sent me. they have been instrumental in keeping my attitude positive and helping me get through my incarceration. 
					









						i was absolutely thrilled on my last order. i received “wuthering heights“ which was exactly the type of book i wanted. 					









						i’m in a single cell 24/7, 365 days. it’s lonely and depressing. and i wonder that if i didn’t have you and other places like yours, to send me books, would i have made it this far?
					









						as an incarcerated wiccan in an arkansas prison, it’s unheard of to get or find anyone to respond to a letter or request. they have helped me with books and awesome reads about my faith. 
					









						
thank you! you make me feel that i’m not forgotten.					









						the dictionary is very helpful when writing letters. after years using a computer and having spellcheck fix everything, now i have to retrain my brain. 
					









						the dictionary was the most valuable item to me. i never had my own personal dictionary.
