taxpayer rights
american taxpayers are entitled to open access on the internet to the peer-reviewed research articles and underlying research data funded by the u.s. government.





open access
widespread access to these articles and data is an essential, inseparable component of our nation's investment in research and education.





increase roi
research articles and data should be shared in cost-effective ways that take advantage of the internet, stimulate further discovery and innovation, and advance the translation of this knowledge into economic benefits.





accelerate discovery
enhanced access to and expanded sharing of information will lead to usage by millions of scientists, professionals, and individuals, and will deliver an accelerated return on the taxpayers' investment.








policies



the alliance for taxpayer access works to maximize the return on america's investment in taxpayer funded research by making it accessible to the businesses, healthcare professionals, and any member of the general public who can put it to use.

don’t think open access is important? it might have prevented much of the ebola outbreak
for years now, we've been talking up the importance of open access to scientific research. big journals like elsevier have generally fought against this at every point, arguing that its profits are more important that some hippy dippy idea around sharing knowledge. except, as we've been trying to explain, it's that sharing of knowledge that leads to innovation and big health breakthroughs. unfortunately, it's often pretty difficult to come up with a concrete example of what didn't happen because of locked up knowledge. and yet, it appears we have one new example that's rather stunning: it looks like the worst of the ebola outbreak from the past few months might have been avoided if key research had been open access, rather than locked up.
