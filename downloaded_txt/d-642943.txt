chain link fence
this is one of the most versatile fence fabric available. available in sizes from 3 foot to 12 tall, and wire thickness ranging from 11 1/2 gauge (a thin, light weight, wire), through 9 gauge (a strong, heavy wire) to 6 gauge, which is extremely thick and resistant to dents, but usually only used in industrial applications. our chain link steel fabric uses a hot-dip galvanize process, which protects the wire from corrosion giving you a long lasting product. galvanizing is the practice of immersing clean, oxide-free iron or steel into molten zinc in order to form a zinc coating that is metallurgically bonded to the iron or steel's surface. the zinc coating protects the surface against corrosion by providing protection to the iron or steel in two ways.1. it shields the base metal from the atmosphere2. because it is more electronegative than iron or steel, the zinc gives cathodic or sacrificial protection.even if the surface becomes scratched and the base metal is exposed, the zinc is slowly consumed while the iron or steel remains protected from corrosion.features:installs well on any type of terrainmost economical choicevery durablecan be upgraded with tension wire, bottom rail, center wire and/or barbed wire to suit your needseasy to repairfast installationconforms well to the lay-of-the-landchainlink also available vinyl coated.

wood fence
our primary line of wood is western red cedar but we also carry pressure treated.dimensional stability western red cedar has twice the stability of most commonly available softwoods. the stability is a result of its low density and shrinkage factors. it lies flat, stays straight, and holds fastenings tightly.  workability western red cedar produces long, lightweight lengths of timber with a fine, straight grain and uniform texture that make it easy to cut, saw and nail with common tools. these features also contribute to its ability to be planed to a smooth surface or machined to any pattern. the lack of pitch and resin allows western red cedar to hold glue bonds from a wide range of adhesives and provide a firm base for many types of paints and stains.  natural preservative western red cedar is one of the world's most durable woods. natural resistance to moisture, decay and insect damage has long made western red cedar the premier choice for either interior or exterior home use. cedar fibers in the heartwood contain natural preservatives that are toxic to decay-causing fungi. the two principal extractives that are responsible for the decay resistance are thujaplicans and water-soluble phenolics. the tree's ability to produce these extractives increases with age, making the outer regions of heartwood the most durable.  flame spread and smoke development ratings western red cedar has flame spread and smoke development classifications that are superior to the minimums set by most building codes, which permit the use of cedar heartwood without preservative treatments.  all-weather western red cedar is one of the few wood species that are naturally at home in the outdoors. properly finished, western red cedar will last for decades, even in harsh environments. its natural resistance to moisture, decay and insect damage make it the ideal choice for a surface that is exposed to sun, rain, heat and cold all year round.we recommend that a finished fence be sealed with an uv resistant sealant.board widths are 'nominal'. when we refer to a 4 inch board, it can be 3 1/2 inches in width and when we mention 6 inch boards, the nominal width per board can be 5 1/2 inches. depending on supplier, we will either carry the wide boards or the narrow boards. either board width looks great in a fence project, and the quality of our wood is very good.  we carry two main categories: 'privacy', a solid style fence where boards are right next to one another and 'picket' style fence where boards are spaced apart. within these two categories of fence, there are several different top-styles and configurations:
