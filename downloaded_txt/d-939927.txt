about glenn 



an american
success story 



 from learning how to fry one big egg in hampton roads to selling out american businesses to china with the carlyle group, glenn is a living embodiment of the american dream: getting rich off the backs of hard working people and then running for office on an extreme agenda masked beneath a nifty sweater vest. now, glenn is hard at work fighting for real conservative values: banning books, protecting kids from history, defunding public schools (even sometimes by accident), cutting taxes for massive corporations, and making sure private healthcare decisions are made only between a woman and her local politicians and unelected judges.

the virginia blueprint 







 







restoring excellence in virginia schools 



countless studies that we are unable to cite show that before 2022, virginia’s students lived in fear of the woke bureaucrats who invaded their schools, requiring masks during the worst pandemic in a century and requiring horrific treatments like handwashing. thankfully, glenn’s election transformed our public school system. in just two years, the youngin administration set up a snitch line so that politically-motivated extremists could report teachers who dared to teach, introduced segregation 2.0, and rewrote virginia’s history standards to make sure no student ever learns about anything uncomfortable, complex or that requires critical thinking skills. 











reinvigorate job growth everywhere but virginia 



glenn knows that to create jobs and fuel the economy, you need to invest in one thing: shareholders. we must stop the harmful influx of foreign businesses like ford coming into our communities and assaulting residents with promises of good pay and health coverage. it’s time that our rural residents follow glenn’s example by pursuing a true blue collar career at a large private equity firm. 







 











 







keeping our communities “safe” terms and conditions apply  



glenn knows that we must do all we can to keep our schools and students safe. this means fighting for common-sense reforms, like attacking drag queens who read books to children. but we must do more. that’s why glenn is committed to pursuing unproven solutions that other states like florida have embraced, like bulletproof backpacks, self-locking doors, and arming teachers. when it comes to healthcare, education, infrastructure and other essential services, we must always consider the cost. but when it comes to dubious efforts like introducing additional firearms into our classrooms, no price is too high to defend the 2nd amendment. ultimately, the only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. either that or common-sense firearm reform, but you can be certain that glenn won’t let effective policy solutions get in the way of ideological purity. 











protecting virginia job creators ​  



glenn will always stand up for the true unsung heroes of america: humble corporations. businesses are facing challenging headwinds in this current economic climate, driven by president bidens’ disastrous policies that have only delivered pandemic relief, student loan debt forgiveness, the largest bipartisan investment in infrastructure in american history, and essential supports for 21st century businesses through the inflation reduction act. businesses are now being forced to make tough decisions, like how are they going to be able to continue paying their ceos 624 times as much as the average american worker? that’s why glenn is fighting tirelessly to lower corporate tax rates. it is critical that virginia wins the national race to the bottom, while gutting the social safety net in the process. the voice of multinational organizations has been silenced for too long, and glenn is just the man we need to return them to their seat at the board room table.corporations aren’t just people, they’re the most important people. that’s why glenn is committed to big business equity (the only kind of equity he can stomach), protecting their profits and providing the finest corporate welfare your tax dollars can buy. 







 











 







"supporting" rural virginian communities​  



glenn knows that rural virginians must be treated as more than photo props during campaign season. that’s why he’s so graciously taken brief breaks from his national tours to do things like visit hurricane-ravaged areas of the state; areas facing such destruction due to the worsening impacts of climate change, something glenn is proudly doing nothing to address. rural virginians also deserve our support, which means peddling disinformation in areas of the state that would much rather have access to the resources the youngkin administration has so courageously curtailed.
