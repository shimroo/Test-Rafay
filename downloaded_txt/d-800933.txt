nvd data feeds


apis and data feed types
		
				the following table contains links and short descriptions for each api or data feed the nvd offers.
				please read how to keep up-to-date with nvd data when using the traditional data feeds.
			

				users of the data feeds provided on this page must have an understanding of the xml 
				and/or json standards and xml or json related technologies as defined by 
				www.w3.org.
			


type
description



cve and cpe apis
an alternative to the traditional vulnerability data feed files. the apis are far more flexible and offer a richer dataset in a single interface compared to the json vulnerability feeds and cpe match feed.


json vulnerability feeds
each vulnerability in the file includes a description and associated reference links from the cve® dictionary feed, as well as cvss base metrics, vulnerable product configuration, and weakness categorization.


cpe match feed
a feed that provides the product/platform applicability statement to cpe uri matching based on the cpes in the official cpe dictionary.


vulnerability translation feeds
translations of vulnerability feeds.


vulnerability vendor comments
comments provided by vendors regarding a particular flaw affecting within a product.


cpe dictionary
dictionary containing a list of products.


common configuration enumeration (cce) reference data
reference data for common configuration items.





cve and cpe apis

the 2.0 apis are the preferred method for staying up to date with the nvd.
				users interested in learning where to begin with the api should visit 
				the nvd developers pages.
			

				benefits of the apis over the traditional data feeds include:
			

the apis are updated as frequently as our website (unlike the traditional feeds which have explicit update intervals)
the apis provide search capabilities based on the advanced search feature of the website
the apis provide cve and cpe based searching capabilities, including the ability to search for single cve and cpe entries
the ability to view only the information that has changed since a given date or time
simplified methods of identifying cpe matches to applicability statements

how to keep up-to-date with the nvd data using the traditional feeds

				the vulnerability feeds provide cve® data organized by the first four digits of a cve® identifier 
				(except for the 2002 feeds which include vulnerabilities prior to and including "cve-2002-").  
				if you are locally mirroring nvd data, either the apis or the data feeds may be used to stay synchronized. after performing 
				a one-time import of the complete data set using the compressed json vulnerability feeds, the "modified" 
				feeds should be used to keep up-to-date.
			

each feed is updated nightly, but only if the content of that feed has changed. for example, the 2004 feeds 
				will be updated only if there is an addition or modification to any vulnerability with a starting cve® identifier 
				of "cve-2004-". the "recent" feeds are a list of recently published vulnerabilities and 
				the "modified" feeds are a list of recently published and modified vulnerabilities. the "recent" 
				and "modified" feeds only contain vulnerabilities changed within the previous eight days. these feeds are
				updated approximately every two hours.
			


meta files

				users should always consult the meta file to determine if a given feed has been updated since the last import. 
				if no changes have been made there is no benefit to downloading either the .zip or .gz files.  this approach should 
				result in a reasonable use of less than 200 requests per day.
			

				each of the data feeds is described by an associated plain text file with the same name as the .xml/.json file 
				with a .meta extension. these files are updated approximately every two hours to reflect changes within their 
				respective feed file. for example, if the name of the file is nvdcve-1.1-modified.json then the .meta file 
				name will be nvdcve-1.1-modified.meta. the .meta file contains information about the specific feed file including 
				the last modified date and time, the size of the file uncompressed, and a sha256 value of the uncompressed file:
			


				lastmodifieddate:2015-09-10t08:40:09-04:00
				size:1273382
				zipsize:91619
				gzsize:91477
				sha256:ac782e2db403e2b09ad5dd676501e8755fda3f2bef347b7503491700c6c5eaff
				



json feeds

				these data feeds includes both previously offered and new nvd data points in an updated json format. 
				the "year" feeds are updated once per day, while the "recent" and "modified" 
				feeds are updated every two hours.
			


the nvd plans to retire all legacy data feeds while guiding any 
						remaining data feed users to updated application-programming interfaces (apis). apis have 
						many benefits over data feeds and have been the proven and preferred approach to web-based
						automation for over a decade. for additional information on the nvd api, please visit the 
						developers pages.

					cpe_dictionary@nist.gov
				 as those cpes may need approved to the official cpe dictionary. this feed is updated once per day.
