the wampum chronicles: mohawk territory on the internet
















 





i have been a student of haudenosaunee history and
culture for more than a quarter century. my research began with my
home community of akwesasne, and quickly expanded to the mohawk
nation and the haudenosaunee confederacy. the st. lawrence iroquoians
and the seven nations of canada are also big blips on my research
radar. i have documented the lives of saint kateri tekakwitha,
colonel louis cook, and saiowisakeron, also known as jake ice and
john fire. if these names don’t ring a bell, you’ve come
to the right place.

the wampum chronicles has been my online base since the
last millennium. this is where i post articles i have written and
documents i have gathered. it is also where i promote my books,
wampum presentations, storytelling gigs, and other projects.

i’m in the process of updating the site with new
and old material. i thought you might appreciate a stripped-down
homepage with a straight-forward index—a respite from the
visual noise and madness of today’s weird wired web. i allow no
pop-ups, tracking, or outside links. you can keep track of updates
here by liking the wampum chronicles facebook page.

see a graphic you’d like to borrow? want to book a
presentation? got a history question? have a wampum belt, treaty,
indian peace medal, or a painting of a black officer from the rev war
or the war of 1812 in your attic? i’m your guy. get in touch
with me on facebook or at the e-mail address at the bottom of the
page.

the
remembrance belt: 

conflicting
traditions of an onondaga wampum




one of the most intriguing
wampum belts of the haudenosaunee confederacy is one known by many
names: the remembrance belt, the defeat of the french record belt,
the peacemaker belt, the prophecy belt, and—to keep life
simple—the peacemaker prophecy belt. it is a bit of a myth that
wampum belts actually had names, but these are the ones that have
been attached to the belt over the years. there are just as many
interpretations. the two that stand out are literally worlds apart.

presentations



wampum
is how the haudenosaunee documented our history and culture. i have
been giving talks about wampum since i wove my first belt. my
collection has grown since then and so have my presentations. i now
employ more than two dozen replica wampum belts and strings in
addition to clothing and items specific to the colonial era. wampum
presentations are suitable for school assemblies, college lectures,
historic site re-enactments, and cultural festivals.

books



i’m proud of the two books i’ve written and
published so far! i put my heart and soul into these projects, which
may explain my current listlessness. i was wise enough to include
some of my capable friends and colleagues in these efforts, which may
explain why they’ve all been blacklisted in the industry. you
can order copies directly from me or by visiting the retail outlets
that carry them. they are also available on amazon.com if that’s
how you roll. (if you are a retailer and are interested in bulk
purchases, or a library looking to order at a discount, you may find
it more expedient to go to createspace.com and register directly with
them.)
