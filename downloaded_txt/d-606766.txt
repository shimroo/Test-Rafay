our story 



as my mom always said, "maria’s is an extension of our kitchen at home." and in our kitchen, food and love were, and still are, the same thing. so come as you are and experience firsthand the love that my mom set on the table each and every day, complete with wonderful flavors, textures, and aromas.

food and love—same thing.
– maddy alfano
