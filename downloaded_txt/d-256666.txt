					| hsbc custody at 2024-11-18

				 (20-nov-2024)
				


knock it off, judiciary: hk courts don't use gavels

				the hk judiciary persists in promoting an object never used in courtrooms as a symbol of law and juridical work. why not promote something else not found in courts, like a rocket? (19-oct-2024)
				


ikea removes smart-home products from hk, citing national security law

				not entirely consistent with the government's goal to make hong kong a smart city by investing hundreds of hk$ billions into "innovation and technology". (12-sep-2024)
				


putting police in the policy address

				a new name would set the right tone. (18-aug-2024)
				


meaningless board games at hkex, and how the uk fca has just made an awful mistake

				we review the proposals for a 6-seat and 9-year limit on so-called ineds, along with other changes that do nothing to address hk's corporate governance deficit. meanwhile, a slow-motion disaster is underway in the uk as it scraps fundamental investor rights. (28-jul-2024)

				 (5-jun-2024)

				 (4-jun-2024)
				


help maintain the webb-site database

				we are commencing the transition of the webb-site database to a crowd-sourced model. whether it survives our founder's doom depends on whether you, the users, are willing to volunteer your time, in a "webbipedia" crowd-sourcing of corporate data. so please get involved, and you may get a free lunch at the end of the year. (19-may-2024)
				


the hk budget supercomputer hallucination

				according to paul chan's budget speech, at undisclosed taxpayer expense, hk is supposed to produce a machine 3 times more powerful than the world's current fastest, within 2 years, and without using the best chips which were banned by the usa from export to hk following imposition of the national security law on hk. (2-mar-2024)
				


hk's rates reforms: damage to property values, needless complexity and misdirected handouts

				it's not too late for the government to return to fiscal sanity with a simple rates system rather than practice the populist politics of petty envy. (30-jan-2024)
				


breaking: hk government withholds task force report, citing threat to financial markets stability

				we asked for the report. they refused. now we're really wondering what's in it. (29-jan-2024)
				


hong kong island, major vehicle exporter?

				transport department data suggest that hk island exported a net 1.25m vehicles in 2022, more than are on the roads in the sar, and the island is on track to beat that in 2023. take a look at the data and tell us why! (9-dec-2023)
