racing
        racing is the exhileration, the sweat, the heartache, the feeling of
        victory, and the pain of defeat. racing is preparing the racecar with
        friends, changing tires, making last minute decisions, and the
        excitement that builds with each passing lap. racing is rivals,
        friendships, good times, laughter, and memories that will last a life
        time.racing is the agony of a bad crash, and the inspiring feeling of a
        well deserved win. it is the knowledge, dedication, and loyalty of pit
        crews and drivers.racing is not only a sport...it is a way of life. 
        you
        become so caught up in the drama of it all, that it becomes a vital part
        of you. the competition takes you in, until you eat, breathe, and live
        racing. you love the smell of the fumes when you start up the engine for
        the first time after a long winter break...you love drawing up a new
        body design...you love working on the car in the middle of february,
        imagining how beautiful it will be on the track. racing is in you...
