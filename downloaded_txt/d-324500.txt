free tarek shams



one year later, my good friend tarek shams is being detained for political reasons, while the officers who killed, threw molotoves and rocks in the same events are not even questioned by the investigation judge. its been alleged that there were instructions to renew his detention for another 30 days, till feb 12th. independent judiciary indeed! the military junta is controlling everything and pushing us over a steep ramp to hell. while they might've prevented him from participating in the anticipated revolutionary events of next jan 25, they have guaranteed that the revolution has gained more than 2000 new activists, evident in his facebook page #freetarekshams.
