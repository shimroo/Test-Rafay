“
musc prepared me well for the next level. my experience here provided me with foundational knowledge and helped me to develop the skills necessary to succeed in a career in medicine.
”

ken kennedy, md, emergency medicine faculty, duke university














“
i’ve been impressed by the intentionality and kindness of faculty members, pre-clinical faculty to physicians, who welcome me into their practice and always genuinely want to see students grow.
”

jackson pearce, m.d., class of 2023, diagnostic radiology residency at yale medicine














“
watching students’ dreams come true at graduation is an indescribable moment of happiness for our team.  to witness the transition from entering student to physician brings sheer joy.
”

myra haney singleton, edd, associate dean for student affairs & student wellness














“
charleston is my home and musc quickly became my family. musc has given me the ability to treat the same individuals who have inspired me to become a physician and has molded me to becoming an equipped physician of the future.
”

ka'la drayton, class of 2020, surgery resident at university of connecticut














“
once you’re a student here, you get to be a part of a whole new family – one that not only wants you to succeed, but also equips you with the tools necessary to do so.
”

stephen patrick, musc class of 2020, urology resident at musc














“
the charm of downtown charleston drew me in, but the residents made this program my first choice. even still, my intent was to return home after residency. then when deciding on my first attending position, i couldn’t turn down a chance to stay at musc in a department with an amazing group of mentors!
”

kristen hood watson, md, 2013-14 chief resident, associate dean for clinical curriculum














“
i had the most incredible experience here as a medical student. i received an unparalleled medical education, met some fantastic people including faculty and peers, and, most importantly, grew so much as a person through it all.
”

michael lugo, md, class of 2019, phm fellow, cincinnati children's hospital
