witch emailed me this joke:the iranian ambassador to the un had just finished giving a speech, and walked out into the lobby where he met president bush.they shook hands, and as they walked the iranian said, "you know, i have just one question about what i have seen in america.president bush said, "well, anything i can do to help you, i will."the iranian whispered "my son watches this show 'star trek' and in it there is chekhov who is russian, scotty who is scottish, and sulu who is chinese, but no arabs. my son is very upset and doesn't understand why there aren't any iranians on star trek."president bush laughed, leaned toward the iranian ambassador, and whispered back, "it's because it takes place in the future."

	 	spending time with the family and working on the new passionate america website.
	 	
    	


i spent the entire day yesterday with my family, running errands, and getting things done. we went to the tag agency yesterday and took care of some things that we have been putting off. we had a parent teacher conference, (it seems my son is one of the best kids in his class and the teachers had no complaints about him, could it be that being there when he gets home and not putting him in daycare could be a good thing?) when we left the parent teacher conference our car, like the wsj called it, "rusty, gray ford tempo" would not start. my son, my wife, and me got our exercise for the day by walking almost 2 miles back to our apartment to get our other crappy car (that needs brakes, badly) so that we could go to autozone to buy a new positive battery cable to get the first crappy car running again. i replaced the battery cable--which did not take me long because i used to be a car audio installer extraordinaire--and we headed to my parents house to pick up our 3 year old.we spent the rest of the night watching 3 movies we rented; over the hedge, the omen, and the proposition. over the hedge was great, the omen was better than the original, and the proposition was one of the best movies i have seen this year. we are going to watch the break-up tonight, i like vince vaughn and jennifer aniston let's hope it is a good movie also.i will be posting more soon. i have been trying to learn wordpress, so i can get the new passionate america up and running. i hope to have the new site up and running by sunday. i will be on the radio today at 4pm central time. click here to listen live to the passionate america show at 4pm (cst).

	 	email that makes you go hmmmmm!
	 	
    	


i received this email and i thought i would share it with my readers. email me and let me know what you think.i don’t believe jordan edmonds deserves sympathy over being ousted he is a self described political whore, a huge ass-hole, who likes making fun of stupid people and fat/stupid people at the gym.and he apparently has no problem stating such on a public blog where he also states he is working as deputy campaign manager for ernest istook on his campaign for governor of oklahoma!so excuse me, this young man does not strike me as a victim! quite the contrary we should demand what the whole truth is, he should be answering questions and answering them now! and why hasn’t he been answering them before?excerpts from jordan edmonds my space blog google cache:last login: 3/5/2006, "i live next to a meth house" general interests:“politics (if you haven't figured out that i'm a political whore yet)”, “making fun of stupid people and fat/stupid people at the gym”.about me: “politics is my passion; i love the game”, “working as deputy campaign manager for ernest istook on his campaign for governor”. “yeah, i'm a huge ass-hole and probably one of the most insensitive people that you will meet”.who i'd like to meet: “i don't want to meet. stupid people, people who don't like politics (politicians make your fucking laws)”.this has changed since then to the way it was posted on your site. i found this information by following a link attached to a lgf comment and i question why more is or has not been done by our media.if as a result of this young mans (prank/not prank im’s) our elections are adversely affected (every single one of us should be out raged).abc seems to be struggling with this story to promote it, and i believe there is no excuse for their actions, i am seeing no proof that they are verifying their stories, and the way information is trickling out causes me more questions. remember rathergate?}orson wells war of the worlds is the best analogy i can think of, when thinking about this situation!i listened to the mp3 of your show, and feel for the situation you are in, and the adversity you are being faced with.i can only imagine the angst you feel, but please be assured that you will survive it. i am sure that you are receiving a lot of advise and help from people, if not now i am sure you will in the very near future, i believe this whole affair will _have a bungee like effect_, in fact it appears to me that people in general are already starting to get a grip on their initial emotional response to this whole sordid affair. and you will come out of this a better and stronger man!in response to the e-mail i sent, you stated: “very good points you have a story research it and post, be ready for the firestorm”.i took a closer look, but since i have nowhere to post the information, and don’t know anyone who blogs (or even knows about computers) it is no good to me and it may even be information you already have, either way it can only help you!you posted an image of edmonds my space account showing his last login as 7/31/2006 (that’s only a few days after the sex predator site began, isn’t it?)edmond lists under (interests) “making fun of stupid people and fat/stupid people at the gym” and under (about me) says “yeah, i'm probably one of the most insensitive people that you will meet.” this is just after saying that he’ll be “working as deputy campaign manager for ernest istook on his campaign for governor” and edmonds finishes with “and fat people are disgusting”so i would say he is both insensitive and/or not overly bright, (in my opinion a walking talking political brain fart waiting for a place to happen) i’m pretty sure istook wouldn’t be too happy! and i am certain the voters wouldn’t like it, (it is almost like it was a deliberate attempt to be insulting)! and this is someone who is a 3rd year political science major and public policy minor at the university of california, berkeley?interesting particularly since i have a google cache of the same my space page showing his last login as 3/5/2006 (link):the page i have is different than the one you posted and i do not know if it is because it is a cache or format was changed (it has his employment history for one thing, or did you remove it from yours), schools, and lists himself as a political operative?the comment about meth heads is different, under (interests)“politics *(if you haven't figured out that i'm a political whore yet)*,” as well as “making fun of stupid people and fat/stupid people at the gym” (about me) he says “yeah, i'm *a huge ass-hole* and probably one of the most insensitive people that you will meet.”over all i am left with the impression that it is almost as though he abandoned the site after removing comments that were detrimental to his own personal image *(if you haven't figured out that i'm a political whore yet, and i'm a huge ass-hole*) and _adding_ another insult “and fat people are disgusting”.listening to your rant today i got the distinct impression that there was more you wanted to say but couldn’t or wouldn’t, and that it was almost as though you felt you were set up in that you followed the clues, found and posted his identity. and now felt trapped, and i certainly do not want to make things worse for you but if there is/was a deliberate effort too spoil our elections something needs to be done. and right now you are the one best able to use this information (if it is anything at all).no matter what the reason the statements made on a public website, would seem to me to make people less sympathetic to his being ousted, particularly since a lot of people still talk like he was an innocent (victim) minor in 2003, i’m not so sure and apparently there are others who are trying to figure it out.thank you very much for your email

	 	ap video of edmund's attorney talking about wild bill
	 	
    	


ms underestimated just emailed me. the subject line of her email  was, video of edmund's attorney on tv threatening billin the video the attorney (he calls me the blogger so i guess it is ok if i call him the attorney) says that his client's life has been turned upside down because of the controversy swirling around former rep. mark foley. the video also says, "that's because jordan edmund has been identified in published reports as one of the former pages who allegedly got explicit emails and instant messages from the florida republican." i never said jordan edmund got emails from mark foley. so did he get emails too? the attorney goes on to say that he and his client have had some physical threats made against them. really? want to check my emails and the comments on my blog mr. attorney?during the ap video they talk about how abc news published the screen name and show and email on the screen. hello, i found the screen name in an instant message from abc news website not an email. does the ap not know the difference between emails and instant messages or are they trying the confuse the two on purpose?the attorney also says they are investigating to see if there is any civil liability by abc news or the blogger (that's me wild bill). so it looks like he might still be looking to file charges against me. i wish i did not have to ask but i could use all of the help i can get with this.ways you can help me:send me an email if you are or know an attorney that would be will willing to take my case for little money or no money.continue sending your emails of support, it means a lot to me and my family that there are people out there that support us.make a donation to me to help cover costs by clicking on the make a donation button on the top right side of the website.thanks to everyone that has already donated and has sent emails.

	 	eric at classical values seems to get it
	 	
    	


eric gets it. then why is it that so many of the other big named blogs don't get it. jordan edmunds identity was information ms. underestimated, me wild bill, and the all of the people we let view the evidence we had before we publish the story believed had to get out so that the facts could be uncovered. ms. underestimated and i got the ball rolling on this story.i have a question for the bloggers that still refuse to give us credit. why do you still blog about foleygate when you cannot even be honest with your readers enough to let them know if it was not for two hard working bloggers (ms. underestimated and me, wild bill) the story would not have advanced beyond some of the lies. once we released jordan edmund's identity, bloggers and media from around the world had an opportunity to search out the truth and report it.oh i almost forgot i have to make sure i say foley is a scumbag (or we will be accused of defending him) and i did not give a crap about party affiliation in this case, our release of our story was about the truth. i did not do this for fame and fortune although it might come to that. i will no longer sit by while others report on this story and pretend that they have higher morals and that that gives them right to not credit our hard work. if i am sued because of this case it will effect every blogger's 1st amendment rights and every media organizations rights as well. if i am successfully sued it will set legal precedence and open the door for each and every blogger and news organization that published jordan edmund's identity to be sued. you may not agree with what we did although someday i believe you will, at least agree that we have the 1st amendment right to freedom of speech. if we cannot all agree on that issue then we will all surly lose.

i recieved this email and thought i would share it with you:dear mr. kerr,i am a citizen of oklahoma city, and like most people in our nation, i have been following the foley scandal on a daily basis.   i was led to your blog "passionate america" via an article published by the oklahoman, news channel 9 and on newsok.com. i must say mr. kerr, i am thoroughly impressed.  impressed so much it compelled me to write you this letter.   wow, was my initial reaction and thoughts when i read the blog pertaining to the identity of the page, who's im's were published on abc news.  i was so taken aback and amazed at your ability to find such info.  i mean i really do not think that even my 9 year old could of done a better job, really its not like this sort of thing is done by millions everyday.   curiosity had now taken hold and i just couldn't stop, i dug further, i read everything, your blog, your comments, your profile, and let me tell you i learned a lot.you mr. kerr are a manipulative genius!  why, would i say such a thing, you ask.   well by all means let me explain!  when i was reading those ims and all the other information you posted on you blog, my heart instinctively went out to jordan edmund.   i mean how mortifying is it to have such a personal, explicit thing be publicly displayed for all to view.  how could anyone in the name of journalism, or mankind be so cruel?   really what does it take?  what drives someone to publicly humiliate an innocent victim?  i say innocent victim, because it has not been proven otherwise, that jordan edmund is anything but just that, innocent!   think about it, i mean really think about it.  how would you feel, your family, your children, what if it was your child?   how would it really be to be in jordan edmunds place right at this very moment?................... let's ponder that for a moment, shall we?  think about the embarrassment, the humility, the fear, of just knowing that you were subjected as a child to a mortifying experience and now the whole world knows your face.   it's almost like those dream sequences you see in the movies you know the ones where you standing in front of a crowd doing whatever only to realize that you are naked, and vulnerable.   do you not have a conscious bone in you body?  wait, no you don't.  you didn't have a conscious at that proverbial moment you stumbled across that impeccable mistake, this was you lucky break, your chance to pull yourself out of the stinking pit of self pity, your chance to be somebody, a chance to rise above and beyond a meager blogsite, and small time internet radio.   "look out and move over rush limbaugh!  william "wild bill" kerr is the new kid in town and he's kicking ass now, and taking names later"  in the beginning of this letter i stated, you impressed me, would you like to know how?  i am impressed by the fact, that after all the angry responses and threats made to you and your family by the public; you managed to turn the tables.   well at least you think you did!  you convinced some schmuck at the daily oklahoman that you were nothing, and that your intentions were not to gain fame and fortune, you had struggled, and made bad choices in the past, you were just using this opportunity to try and better life for yourself and your family.   you were just following your dream, after so many years of thinking your couldn't.  you threw yourself one hell of a pity party in that article.   however; this is not what angers me the most.  what angers me the most what is just down right disgusting is that by claiming you and your family are so poor that you live off of one income and have to use food stamps, all for the sake of your children!   ha!  i am appalled, disgusted, i am pissed, it is my tax dollars that are supporting you and your so called internet pipedream.   "to keep my kids out of daycare", so you claim to be a stay at home dad, but in reality your too busy writing your blog, and hosting you internet radio show, how can you deem yourself a respectable man in society?   you rely on your wife, to provide for you and your family, yet you can't even contribute to the table you eat off of!  you state, "we may go broke, but my kids won't go to daycare".   i myself am not a stranger to the word struggle, i have lived that life.  i was a single mom, i needed and used food stamps, and i had to send my kids to daycare.   i also got a job; i worked hard, and did everything in my power to ensure my children a life they deserved, a good life.  not once, did i ever abuse the system to achieve this, i am successful today, not by bringing down someone else, nor by using tax dollars to fund my dreams, but by hard work!   wow, there's a concept!  how easy is that?  its not easy, never is, still isn't, but at least i am proud!   you my friend are a sorry excuse for a human being, nice try way to grope at the heart strings of oklahoma and the media.  you poor thing, you take the heat, and your wife and children are all starving and for what?   your pursuit of justice, give me a break! you have publicly slandered and defamated the character of a complete stranger.  a victim of a sex scandal, that occurred when this person was a child, and all for your own personal gain. what about jordan edmunds career, his life did you think about that? no i don't think so. you said so yourself, you stated that it wasn't for the money, but you just hoped it would get you a better radio job.   as far as i am concerned, you have ruined those chances.  every profession comes with a set of morals and ethics, albeit some lower than others.   you however; have gone well below the standard.  i find it funny that you are oblivious to your own hypocrisy, you rant about telling the truth and how politics are tainted, but you stoop to that level.   in my eyes as a republican, a mother, and citizen you are now side by side with mark foley.  what you have done does not exemplify compassion, nor does it honor america!  you sir are nothing more than a boil on the ass of evil, i hope this moment haunts you for the rest of your life.  i hope jordan edmund sues you for everything you may or may not have, i hope when your judgment day comes, you look back and are ashamed and remorseful for what you have done.  you call yourself a conservative, you state you believe in the truth!  you may have uncovered the fact that jordan edmund was linked to those ims, but you had no right to go public with it.   your sordid opinions have now averted the attention from where it should be, on mark foley!  this isn't about the victims and whether or not they asked for it, they were kids.   the fact remains the same mark foley is a sick individual, who has disgraced himself, his family and these children.  he should be punished it should be him that is smeared all over the papers and television, not these kids!!!   oh yeah, don't give me the crap that they are no longer minors, it doesn't change the fact that at the time they were, and in no way asked for this.  my advise to you mr. kerr is exactly this, go to school educate yourself, get a real job, quit subjecting your family to your ignorant opinions, quit milking the system to help fund your ignorance, quit mooching off your wife and using your children as an excuse not to stand up and take your place as a father, a husband, a man!   really consider the consequences of your actions before you apply them, learn to write the facts, and when you do publish your opinions, don't run and hide behind your poor lifestyle.   don't expect us, to feel sorry for you, that lifestyle was your choice not ours.  go buy a book about morals, and learn it!   learn that exposing somebody, and humiliating them for nothing more than personal gain is not only wrong but unforgivable.  get a little jesus in you life, but mostly watch your back!   god doesn't like ugly and what comes around goes around.  if i were you i would start praying for forgiveness and writing that public apology to jordan edmund and his family now!   last but not least, remember that everyone has friends in low places.  good day to you mr. kerr.sincerely,l. kingston oklahoma city, okand this was my response:nice idea, but you are wrong, i suspect that you have a big problem with the fact that i said i do not want to put my kids in daycare. if you would like to meet me in person i will meet you anytime you would like and sit down and talk to you and answer any questions you might have. i could take the time to point out your errors in judgment in the email but it would not convince you of who i am. please email me back and we can arrange a meeting at your connivance.

***update i made a spelling mistake in the title if you have linked to this post you will have to correct your link. sorry for any inconvenience.***i have been thinking about changing my nickname to "the blogger" because it seems that a lot of big bloggers out there just refuse to call me by my real name william kerr, my nickname wild bill, and refuse to link to my blog http://passionateamerica.blogspot.com/ because it seems i have cooties.you might not agree with what i did but you can show a little class and a small bit of respect and at least let your readers come to my blog to make up their own minds instead of telling them what to think. i have been a fan of many of the sites that think i am beneath them. i have respect for each of you, whether you criticize what i did or not, it is in very bad taste to talk about someone's work and not provide a link to that work.much of the msm has done the same thing. bloggers deserve credit also if you are talking about or referencing their work. it is the right thing to do.

	 	michelle malkin you do not know me
	 	
    	


***updates at the bottom***i had to respond to michelle malkin's wild accusations about me from this post. i followed a link on that post over to hot air to this post. i had to respond, i have no idea why michelle has what seems to be a grudge against me, but there is no way with what i have been through over the last week that i am going to let her get away what i consider a hit piece against me. below is what i wrote:i tried to have a spine and stand up for what was right and michelle and many other conservative bloggers threw me under the bus. this is in response to this post by michelle malkin.i did the right things for the right motives despite what malkin thinks. she does not know me and to say, "a conservative blogger [wild bill of passionate america] has ginned up publicity for his work outing a 21-year-old young man--a former congressional page and current deputy campaign manager for a heartland republican congressman--who received sexually explicit instant messages from disgraced florida gop rep. mark foley when he was 17 and 18 years old. i have received several e-mails from the blogger and readers flogging the post.i refused to link to the blogger then and even though the drudge report has plastered screaming headlines about the blogger's scoop, i refuse to link to it now. there was absolutely no good reason to expose the former congressional page's name and identity. seizing on abc news' redaction failure and reporting errors (more on that in a moment) to play gotcha in a feeble attempt to avenge foley is not a sufficient reason to obliterate the young man's privacy. the young man was the prey, not the predator."first, my name is william kerr not "a conservative blogger".second, "has ginned up publicity" hey michelle do you know me, do you have any idea beyond speculation and wild accusations as to what my motives were? no you don't, do not pretend to know my motivations, you could have emailed me after i sent emails to you and a press release i could have explained myself to you, but no one listened me (except for real friends). i tried to send this story to other more qualified bloggers and media and no one responded to me, except jay tea from wizbang who told me to never contact him again, but apologized after reading my post. will you apologize michelle?third, when he was 17 and 18 years old, michelle can you prove when the ims were made and can you prove that they have not been altered by anyone before they were published by abc news? no you can not. if you will look at the ims you will notice that the time stamps are not in sequential order and abc news does not even provide a date stating when the emails were made.fourth, "obliterate the young man's privacy" he is 21 now! he is a public figure if it is found that the young man as you like to call him was 18 during all of the ims or has made the whole thing up will you defend mark foley's right to privacy? i said in my post several times i think mark foley is a scum bag and if he is found guilty should have the book thrown at him.fifth, "the young man was the prey, not the predator." can you prove that michelle? no you cannot. when the investigation is complete and i might have to testify in front of the house ethics committee then we will know for sure if the young man, as you put it, is in fact prey. foley is disgusting for what he did, but there are too many questions left unanswered for you to claim to know my motive and pretend to know the truth.i believe you michelle are acting more like a liberal than me by letting your feeling lead you to wild conclusions that you can not back up and impugning my character in the process. i still have respect for you and believe your writing has inspired me over the years to stand up for what is right and that is getting out the truth. i know that is what i did and i hope someday you can see that also.now michelle malkin, say my name wild bill of passionate america and try and remember that i am the guy that likes to back up my facts with screenshots just incase someone decides to say i made up my evidence. below are the screenshots of my comment posted at hot air on october 8, 2006 at 2:47 am on this post.click to enlargei have received so much support over the last few days, everyone please email michelle malkin at writemalkin-at-gmail-dot-com and let her know that it would be a smart move on her part to respond to me and give a real reason why she did what she did. michelle like i said before i respect you i just believe something other than the truth was influencing your decision. i came clean to the world, can you come clean with me?update: still no response for michelle malkin, common sense junction understands my side and takes michelle to task in this post, a potpourri of doublespeak.update #2: my friend terry dillard comes to my aid, standing up for wild bill. thank you terry.update #3: more support coming from big dog and spree, go over to their sites and read what they had to say.
