cleartractâ¢


natural breakthrough for urinary tract health


more potent than cranberry


cranberry only contains a fraction of active ingredients, most of it is different inactive compounds such as fiber, acids, and other organic compounds. so with cranberry you never really know how much active ingredient you are actually getting. with cleartract you get 100% active ingredients, which is why there is such a dramatic difference in taking cleartract versus cranberry. 


rapid action 


when taken cleartract reaches the bladder in about 30 minutes. once there it goes to work quickly, customers often notice a difference in as little as 24hrs.


clinical history 


while this ingredient is new to the public, it has shared a safe and successful history with jonathan v. wright, md who discovered it over 17 years ago.(townsend letter for doctors)
