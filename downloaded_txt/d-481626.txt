extremely sad news





unfortunately due to a terrible accident we have lost our precious hazel just days  before she was due to deliver her pups. hazel has always been an adventurer and yesterday morning she found a way into our enclosed swimming pool area and fell into  the pool and drowned. i found her just minutes after she was let out. this  tragedy has greatly saddened our family and she will be greatly missed by all  who loved her.

hazel has been bred with juneau and is pregnant!  we expect her litter around august 21st.  we expect both chocolate and tans and reds in both solids and dapples.  please check back or email me at kayjewells@comcast.net  if you are interested in one of these pups and would like me to send you a litter announcement when they are born.
