how to use sales funnels to attract more customers & 10x your income
if you are looking to attract more customers and scale your business, using a sales funnel is an excellent way to do it. however, what sales funnel software should you use?
there are many options on the market when it comes to sales funnels. you may have already been looking into the different options that are available.

for most people, price is the biggest consideration. however, it is wise to also look beyond the price point for some funnel builder products as the more expensive ones have a great deal more functionality in most cases.
besides price, most businesses, especially small businesses or solo entrepreneurs want to use an intuitive solution. this helps to save time so you can get your funnel live as quickly as possible. after all, time is money!
it is also important to assess your business operations to be clear on exactly what you need. besides this, you also should have at least some idea of where you want your business to move to. for example, if you are selling your own physical products, do you also want to have the ability to set up an affiliate program so you can draft an army of affiliates to promote your products for you? if so then clickfunnels™ provides this functionality.
it is likely that you will also want your funnel to be able to build your email list for you. a funnel can be used for this as the sole purpose. however, you can also use a funnel to sell a product, showcase other products that may also appeal to your customers and collect email addresses all at the same time.
choosing a solution that has solid customer support is also very important. it can be a nightmare to pay for software that not only has a steep learning curve but also has bad customer support. so keep in mind the level of training support that the software company is offering before you make your purchase.
some sales funnels also offer a free trial period. again, clickfunnels offers a 14-day free trial, so you may want to sign up and experiment with their software. after all, if they’re offering to test it out for free, then why not take advantage of it!
