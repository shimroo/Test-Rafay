how we work
since 1987, conservation international has combined fieldwork with innovations in science, policy and finance to secure the critical benefits that nature provides to humanity.












                innovations in science
            


conservation international is behind some of the most extraordinary, cutting-edge conservation science taking place today. our research is cited more than leading universities.












                innovations in finance
            


from our launch of the world's first debt-for-conservation swap in 1987, conservation international is changing the equation to make nature more valuable alive than destroyed.












                partnering with communities
            


respecting the rights of indigenous people and local communities was one of our founding principles, and it guides our work to this day.












                working with governments
            


our science and expertise are helping governments take action to protect nature and the benefits it provides to people.







conservation international’s approach to conservation puts human well-being on equal footing with environmental goals. we respect human rights, ensure our programs are designed with gender equality in mind and create opportunities for local communities to earn a living while also helping nature.
