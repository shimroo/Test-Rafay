	 happy thanksgiving
	 
    



thanksgiving has been celebrated for centuries and while it’s changed since 1621 (that first year saw seal and swan on the menu), the emotions and time of reflection encouraged by the holiday are still holding strong.  sometimes what we all really need is to pause and think about what matters most.  what are we thankful for? what do we value? do we know why those values or people or objects are important? it’s all too easy to get caught up in the world, and all too easy to forget the beautiful blessings we have in our lives and the reasons we go about our day the way we do. this thanksgiving, pause, reflect, and give thanks before moving on.


and enjoy a piece of apple pie or two along the way.


happy thanksgiving

	 5 new coral reefs- keep our planet beautiful
	 
    


there’s a lot happening in the world, some good and some bad, and a lot of information zooming around the internet.  it can be difficult to imagine that there are any secrets left, but once again, we are surprised by the natural world.  a team of scientists from the university of veracruz and mexico’s national institute of technology have found five new coral reefs that form a 310-mile corridor in the gulf of mexico.  how about that?  it’s a great find, and a great reminder that there are still mysteries out there, mysteries that make our planet beautiful.

	 talking to people with different beliefs
	 
    


we all have strong beliefs, and it can be difficult - if not incredibly frustrating - when we can’t convince someone that our belief is the right one.  it’s equally as frustrating though to feel like we can’t even have a respectful conversation with people about different beliefs.  what’s to be done?  if you want to have productive conversations, there are a few things to remember: clarify what you are arguing about; ask why the other person disagrees; listen when the other person speaks; recognize the other person’s emotions; and attack arguments, don’t insult the individual.

	 notre dame cathedral
	 
    




monday evening, notre
dame cathedral caught fire.  the
horrifying spectacle caught the attention of people around the world as
everyone watched the iconic, 850-year-old building burn for at least 12
hours.  the cathedral’s roof collapsed
but, miraculously, the two medieval bell towers and most of the interior,
including the stained-glass rose windows, escaped mostly unscathed.  investigations are just beginning to discover
what caused the fire, and donations are pouring in to help with eventual
restoration work.  historical treasures
around the world are valued for the way they tie us to our past, the glimpses
they give us of the lives and dreams of those that came before us, and the
marvel they evoke in our souls at the engineering and artistry necessary for
their existence.  we are thankful so much
of notre dame survived the mammoth blaze, and pray the restoration can proceed
quickly and efficiently to restore this cathedral to its former glory.

	 russian global hacking campaign backlash
	 
    




in october several countries issued denunciations of russia
for running a global hacking campaign. 
russia denied the allegations, but there’s no denying that cyber attacks
in general are frequently in the news and on people’s minds.  on march 7th, british foreign minister jeremy
hunt plans to set out a doctrine
of deterrence, “including economic and diplomatic counter-measures,
to prevent cyber attacks that threaten to turn elections into tainted
exercises.”  hunt’s plan points out that
cyber attacks are an incredibly attractive field for any adversaries of free
elections.  they are a threat that must
be taken seriously so that free societies everywhere can be protected.

	 government shutdown
	 
    


on january 9, president trump made his first tv address from the oval office. in it,
he discussed the partial-government shutdown and the border wall with mexico.
the president maintains that the situation at the border is a humanitarian crisis,
while democratic leaders accuse the president of holding the american people
hostage. negotiations, that sometimes seem more like a battle, have stalled, with
people on both sides arguing that the opposing side has the facts wrong.

	 the power of positive thinking
	 
    




living
life to the fullest.  the
power of positive thinking.  encouraging
health through gratitude. 
there are countless articles whose sole purpose is to foster a better
way of life by encouraging a change in your mental outlook.  with thanksgiving fast approaching, it’s an
easy time of year to find ourselves surrounded by pillows, signs, and other
décor shouting ‘give thanks!’  we might
laugh at some of the cartoon turkeys, but the message is important.  in our lives and in our country, what
positive change could we see if we focused more on saying ‘thank-you’?
