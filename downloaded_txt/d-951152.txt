our story



frigid rigid was founded in 1980 in the florida keys. the founder of the company was an avid fisherman. he and his fishing guide buddies needed an ice chest that would hold ice for weeks not days. so by combining the best materials available with innovative production processes, he custom-built the first frigid rigid. over the last 40+ years, we have refined it by using modern cooling technology, superior build quality, and design. hand-built for you one at a time.



mission



our mission is to create your perfect adventure through hand crafting the finest ice chest in the world by combining innovation and durability.
