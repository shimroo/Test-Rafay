what our customers say






still the best fields and the best value around in san diego – the longest-running field under continuous management too! run by people who really know paintball and believe in the sport. fields include a wide variety of cover, concealment, layout, plans, and obstacles. the best “woodsball” fields for over a hundred miles. safety, turnaround, support, and enthusiasm are all top-notch. this is the place to go for beginners, advanced players, or anyone in between! truly loved this field for years and i’ve played at a lot of fields.

the park is amazing, i can’t imagine a better airsoft park than this one.  this is the best place to go for your first time. about 5 months ago or so it was my first time going to airsoft and i was shy at first but the referees. they were really nice and so are all the fields. i come here almost every month to play with my friends and we all have an amazing time. (also alex the ref is super nice) love this place and will always come back!
