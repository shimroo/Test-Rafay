history of kashmir
 

the name “kashmir” originates from the ancient sanskrit term “kaashyapamir,” meaning “abode of kashyapa,” referring to the sage kashyapa, who is credited in hindu mythology with draining a lake to create the fertile valley of kashmir. kashmir’s history dates back to ancient times, with evidence of human settlement as early as the neolithic period. the region saw the rise and fall of various dynasties and empires, including the mauryas, kushans, and guptas, before the advent of islam in the 14th century. kashmir has long been renowned for its cultural and intellectual achievements. it became a center of learning and scholarship, particularly during the rule of the kushan empire and later under the hindu-buddhist kashmiri kings. the valley’s natural beauty and mild climate attracted scholars, poets, and artists, fostering a vibrant cultural milieu. the history of kashmir is a tapestry woven with threads of ancient civilizations, religious diversity, and cultural exchanges. from its mythological origins to its status as a geopolitical flashpoint in modern times, kashmir remains a region of enduring significance, cherished for its natural beauty and historical heritage.
kashmir was known as the “cradle of knowledge” because of its contributions to religious philosophies, contributions towards yogashastra, literature, medicine, art, and aesthetics. however, its major contribution to the world is the highest form of spirituality-kashmiri shaivism, a philosophy that sees shiva as a supreme reality that exists in every human being and manifests itself as shiv-shakti and nara.
the glorious past of kashmir and the grandeur of its kings like lalitaditya muktapida was destroyed by the relentless decimation of its culture by the muslim rulers who for 700 years ruled with tyranny and brutality, forcing its aborigines the kashmiri pandits to either convert to islam or leave kashmir. “seven exoduses” in the context of kashmiri history refers to seven significant waves of migration of kashmiri pandits from the kashmir valley due to various historical and socio-political reasons. these migrations have had a profound impact on the kashmiri pandit community and their cultural identity. here is an overview of the seven exoduses, the ongoing genocide, the last wave that started in 1990. the glorious past of kashmir and the grandeur of its kings like lalitaditya muktapida was destroyed by the relentless decimation of its culture by the muslim rulers who for 700 years ruled with tyranny and brutality, forcing its aborigines the kashmiri pandits to either convert to islam or leave kashmir.

history of genocide/ exodus
 








first exodus (14th century)

the first exodus of kashmiri pandits occurred during the 14th century due to persecution and forced conversions under the rule of sultan sikandar butshikan, a ruler of the shah mir dynasty who sought to enforce islam as the sole religion in kashmir. many kashmiri pandits chose to leave the valley to escape religious persecution.


second exodus (15th century)

the second exodus took place during the 15th century under the reign of sultan zain-ul-abidin (popularly known as budshah). while budshah was known for his more tolerant policies towards hindus, economic factors and political instability during his reign led to a second wave of migration.


 


third exodus (16th century)

the third exodus occurred during the 16th century due to increased religious intolerance and violence during the rule of the chak dynasty. this period saw renewed persecution of kashmiri pandits, prompting another significant migration out of the valley. 


fourth exodus (18th century)

the fourth exodus took place in the 18th century during the afghan and sikh rule of kashmir. the region witnessed political turmoil and instability, leading to economic hardships and violence against hindus, which resulted in another wave of migration. 


 


fifth exodus (19th century)

the fifth exodus occurred in the 19th century, particularly during the rule of maharaja ranjit singh’s sikh empire. this period saw increased social and economic discrimination against kashmiri pandits, contributing to further migration out of kashmir. 


sixth exodus (20th century)

the sixth exodus happened in the early 20th century due to communal tensions and the outbreak of violence during the dogra rule under maharaja hari singh. the shifting political landscape and communal conflicts led to another wave of migration. 


 


seventh exodus (late 20th century)

the seventh exodus is the most recent and well-known kashmiri pandits migration, primarily in the late 1980s and early 1990s. this period was marked by the outbreak of armed insurgency in kashmir, targeting the minority hindu community. widespread violence, threats, and targeted killings forced the majority of kashmiri pandits to flee the valley, resulting in a significant diaspora.  
 







impact of displacement
 

the forced displacement of the kashmiri pandit community in the late 1980s and early 1990s due to conflict and violence has had profound consequences. the entire community was uprooted from their ancestral homes, leading to mass migration of about 3-4 hundred thousand kashmiri pandits, scattered across different parts of india and the world. this had a profound effect on our collective identity, and social fabric, disintegrating our cultural traditions, language, and way of life. the erosion of the support systems, and community network caused lasting damage to the health and well-being of the community. despite the challenges faced by our community we the kashmiri pandits have continued our relentless pursuit to revive our cultural legacy and spiritual heritage as well as to address the historical injustices we have endured. in summary, the kashmiri pandits embody a rich tapestry of culture, spirituality, and intellectual legacy that has profoundly shaped the evolution of kashmir. our contributions underscore the diversity and resilience of kashmiri society and highlight the importance of preserving and celebrating our heritage for future generations.





 
kashmiri shaivism
 

kashmiri shaivism is a profound philosophical and spiritual tradition that originated in the kashmir valley. rooted in the ancient teachings of shaivism, it emphasizes the recognition of the divine presence within oneself and the universe- the consciousness. central to kashmiri shaivism is the concept of shiva as the supreme consciousness, referred to as shiva-shakti, which embodies both the male and female principles of creation and dissolution. the tradition is known for its intricate metaphysical teachings, including the theory of spanda (vibration) and the concept of bhairava (the divine masculine aspect of shiva). kashmiri shaivism also places great importance on spiritual practices such as meditation, mantra recitation, and ritual worship as pathways to realizing one’s true nature and attaining liberation (moksha).
trika shaivism, is a non-dualist branch of shaiva-shakta tantra hinduism that originated in kashmir after 850 ce.[1][2] in its place of origin in kashmir, this tradition is commonly referred to as “kashmiri shaivism.” it later spread beyond kashmir, because of its great scholars utpaladeva (c. 925–975 ce) and abhinavagupta (c. 975–1025 ce), who gave it the centrality of the three goddesses par?, par?par?, and apar?.
the trident symbol and yantra of parama shiva, represent the triadic energies of the supreme goddesspar?, par?-apar? and apar? ?akti. kashmir shaivism was underground for many centuries, and there were no publications until the 14th century except there were some practitioners and yogis who followed this form of shaivism. swami lakshmana helped revive both yoga and scholars of kashmir shaivism during the 20th century. his contributions inspired a new generation of practitioners and scholars who turned kashmir shaivism into a credible field of practice.
