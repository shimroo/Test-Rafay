georgetown’s undergraduate journalism program provides a bridge between an interdisciplinary, service-oriented liberal arts education and the practice of journalism, drawing on the university’s vast academic resources while bringing some of the top reporters in the nation and the world to campus, and students to newsrooms and newsmaking events in washington, d.c. and beyond. 
georgetown graduates have earned pulitzer prizes, emmy and peabody awards, and held key reporting and editorial management roles at some of the profession’s top news outlets, including the new york times, the washington post, the wall street journal, the new yorker, cnn, and elsewhere. others have put their own safety on the line in service of the truth, including austin tice (sfs ’02).
the program, offered as a minor, teaches the essential skills of good journalism: critical thinking, research and investigation, clear expression, and storytelling in every form. it explores the journalist’s duty to the truth, public and private ethics, and the pressures of a changing media ecosystem.
the program’s interdisciplinary approach, rooted in georgetown’s deep strengths in the study of politics, public policy, international relations and law, also highlights the university’s commitment to public service and social justice. it encourages real-world experience and the development of core reporting skills, along with a grounding in of the theoretical, historical and literary context necessary for a fuller understanding of the journalist’s role and responsibility in society.
combining traditional commitments to accuracy, fairness and accountability with a passion for new media experimentation, the program prepares students for careers in a rapidly evolving media environment and a changing world.
the journalism program is led by director rebecca sinderbrand and assistant director ann oldenburg.
