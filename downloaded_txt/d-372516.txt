the second pair of mittens are inspired of mittens i found in an old magazine of amirisu .they are made in tove ,also a yarn 100 % wool,and the mittens are going to be felted a little too so they are going to be warmer.

annas mittens ,a reconstruction of mittens she made for me many many years ago.the colors and the patterns are inspired by sami mittens and hand weaved bands in the area of jukkasjärvi and karesuando.
i have been knitting in siessa,a "kamgarn" 6 ply in wool, and i have bought the yarn on https://shop.stoorstalka.com/sv/start.html

to do these types of patterns are very very relaxing to knit.

december 2016 japan







december 23 our second little grandchild was born and i had the chance to meet her a few days before i had to go back to sweden.her name is clara.what a happiness.hopefully they are visiting us in july.



in the end of my visit we were visiting this store where you could buy wool and you could learn how to spin yarn.a heaven for a spinner but i'not yet there.



you can find information on ananda.jp as you can see they have contact with sweden and they have travels to sweden too.many thanks to ulla-karin on http://ullspinneriet.se/om_oss.html who was the one who gave me this adress.



in this part of tokyo,i think it's called kichijoji,we found a little place where you could buy small items,yes small items .kawai.very near the woolshop "ananda".we also saw people waiting for the chance to eat something,maybe a pizza.the place where you could it this is very small too







yes mumin is popular in japan.no we didn't wait for a chance to eat but it seemed to be a cute and nice place.

mittens in april







dear all

our workshops in different pattern traditions in sweden have ended.6 weekends  from september 2016 to april 2017 filled with inspirations ,pattern,yarns,needles,knitting and a lot of knitting chats.wonderful weekend in stockholmon handarbetets vänner on djurgården.
the mittens in to the left is i reconstruction of a pair of mittens i'v got from a very good knitter and she also made other handicrafts.a women who tried to earn money both as a farmer and a handicraft women.i think it could have been about 1968 or so.the pattern is a combination of different small patterns.the colours she used was red,blue and yellow.these colours were also,still are popular among the lapplanders when they are doing mittens for special situations.it can also be green colours.
when you are looking at folkart costumes you find some of these colours and maybe other too .

the white one is also made in wool,per gynt, and in a little lace pattern.really so nice to knit.these mittens are also made more for special situations

skogsmörker -a wristwarmer in bohusstickning







the first wristwarmer is ready.it's not blocked but you maybe can see the soft fluffy surface.the yarn is made by 50% merinowool and 50% angora.as there are many colours ,1 black ,4 green and 3 blue/blue green colurs there has been hard to knit but in daylight.yes i have been ripping up more than one time but i'm very satisfied with the result.number 2 is on the needles now.


in this link you can see a modern variation of bohus knitting but they have used other types of yarn and the designer has done a version of her own.the typical way to do the pattern is to knit some purl stitches here and there.
http://knitty.com/issuew15/pattzazie/pattzazie.php


here you can find a picture of the one i have done but there is a variation of colour in one "pattern" on the wristwarmer
http://www.angoragarnet.com/se/bohus-stickning/kollektionen/skogsm%c3%b6rkret-20514194
there are many different patterns for different products and almost every item is made in the yarn with merinowool and angora.
