28th-feb-2010 01:20 am(no subject)i think i have a new favorite twilight zone episode. at the very least it runs a close second. number one is, of course, "nightmare at 20,000 feet." i still get a little freaked out sitting over the wing on an airplane. but tonight, oh, tonight i discovered the magic that is "the man in the bottle."  my mom and i couldn't stop laughing by the end, even though she was creeped out by the man in the bottle.superguard9

27th-jul-2009 12:27 am(no subject)saw night at the museum 2 today. unlike other theater-goers my sister overheard in the bathroom, i liked this one better than the first one and it was probably for the same reason. yes there were sight gags and various mannequins coming to life but unless you have a grasp of us history most of the jokes aren't as funny. there were times i'm pretty sure my sister and i were the only ones laughing.superguard9

26th-jul-2009 01:22 am - dohwhile watching the mets game tonight my dad was flipping over to the mecum classic auto auctions between innings. one of the cars was a 1974 datsun 260z coupe but the number 0 and the letter o looked exactly alike. so until my dad mentioned the name of the car out loud i was wondering what kind of car was a 26oz coupe.yeah, he got a good laugh from it when i told him.superguard9

22nd-jul-2009 01:50 am(no subject)at work tonight we were told that parking near the building would be limited tomorrow because there is to be some sort of ceremony honoring the building that was on the property until it burned down 100 years ago. except they started the story with "a hundred years ago tomorrow the building that used to be here was burned to the ground" and i kinda got my hopes up that we were going to get a ghost story about the property being haunted. (i just googled it and fire was in 1913, so not quite 100 years ago. and the story of the fire reminds me of a paper i wrote back in hs about the triangle shirtwaist co fire.)we officially have a sonic's in binghamton now. as i drove past the site this afternoon i noticed it was open but didn't know until later that today was actually their first day. i've never been to a sonic so i have no idea if it's any good but i'm sure i'll go over sometime soon and try it out.finally,superguard9

3rd-jul-2009 11:16 am - a holiday themed questionfor those of you who have seen 1776, which state/statesman best represents what you think your feelings would have been if you were alive at the time? and i don't mean "duh, i would totally be john adams" because no shit he was the most vocal one and hindsight is 20/20. i want to know, based on what you know about yourself, how you think you would have reacted to the impending revolution.i think i would have been like new york although it would have been because i wasn't sure if a complete split was the answer and not because of an inept legislature (some things never change). and i would have ended up on the side in favor of independence before the vote was officially settled, even if i wasn't totally comfortable with the idea.superguard9

15th-jun-2009 06:53 am(no subject)i guess i shouldn't have watched part of the dark knight yesterday because i had a dream that the joker wanted to kill me but when he blasted into my room my dad came in after and clocked him with a cast iron skillet to save me. i've had less then 4 hours of sleep but there is no way i'm going back to bed now. :-/tags:dreamsmood:restlesssuperguard9

1st-jun-2009 01:32 am(no subject)today was perfect weather for attending a high school or college football game. mid 60's, sunny and breezy. too bad it's may 31. not that it really mattered because i'm still tired out from spending yesterday in nyc and didn't do much today but still, i do enjoy summer-like weather in the summer months.my sister and i watched the mtv movie awards but i'm not really sure why because every damn award went to twilight. ugh. afterward we suffered through a sneak peek of some stupid new animated show about 2 guys who watch youtube clips and go to sexual harassment classes (no joke that's all that happened) just to see a preview of public enemies. hellloooo, johnny depp as john dillinger.superguard9
