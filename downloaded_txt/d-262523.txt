crooners like toronto’s matt dusk has taken what he has learned from the greats and molded it for a modern audience.
– la times
blending distinctly sinatra-esque swagger, dusk is waist deep in grandiose arrangements that are dripping with sin city excess and turns the clock back some four decades with excellence
– jazz times
matt dusk impressively brings las vegas back to the glory days as the standards singer sounds remarkably like rat packer frank sinatra.
– billboard
