spinning wheels and accessories


teach yourself to spin with our easy to use drop 
			  spindles! you will be making yarn in no time. if you are already hooked on 
			  spinning your own yarn and are looking for a wheel, be sure to 
			  check out our spinning wheel 
		  	  page for an overview of brands and styles. 

we carry spinning wheels 
              from ashford, kromski, louet, majacraft and schacht so there are lots of styles and models to choose from.
			  

if you are raising sheep, alpaca, lama or angora you may need to have a way to process your fiber or fleece. for that you will need 
			either a pair of hand carders or a larger fiber processing tool called a  drum carder.
