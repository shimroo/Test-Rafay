	 isa must go!
	 
    
(photo courtesy of the obnoxious 5xmom)on 15th sept i went to cathedral of the holy spirit for a mass and candlelight vigil dedicated to justice, peace and truth prevail in malaysia.in his opening, fr fabian quoted opening  words of the vatican ii document “the pastoral constitution on the  church in the modern world”: “the joys and  the hopes, the griefs and the anxieties of the men of this age, especially  those who are poor or in any way afflicted, these are the joys and hopes,  the griefs and anxieties of the followers of christ.”under this inhumane  law the bn government detains without trial citizens of this country  who have not been charged with specific violations of any law in an  open court. the continued use of the isa goes against internationally  accepted human rights standards. the use of the isa makes a mockery  of the teachings of jesus christ which uphold human dignity and natural  justice. we pray now for all  those who are currently detained and for their loved ones; we also remember  those who were detained and tortured in the past under this inhumane  law. as followers of christ  and citizens of malaysia we must continue to condemn this law and urge  the government to repeal it. there is no place for this law on this  earth.  we must all stand united  for freedom of speech and expression within the boundaries of truth  and justice. we must reject all attempts to split us along racial and  religious line.a powerful message to all christian to stand up and be accountable for what happen in our beloved land."the spirit  of the lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach good news  to the poor. he has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and  recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed,  to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord."   luke 4:18-19my father who before this openly supported isa and think that it is still needed to keep the country safe also went for the special mass. i was surprise to hear that he wanted to go during dinner. couldn't be prouder, when we stand side by side, singing out loud hyms, together with 'suara rakyat' to denouce isa. "isa must go, isa must go now!" we sang in union.there are few online petitions to call for abolish of isa, please read them and sign them if u want to be accounted for the future of our country. abolish the internal security act (isa) in malaysiafree teresa, abolish isa!abolish isa and release hindraf leaders so what do u say my friends?

	 pssst! that's guan eng on economy class!
	 

i'm sure by now it would have been all over the internet already.  spotted this in rpk's place. sourced from mr manager's blog.it is very humble of him to fly economy. anyway, kl-penang is such a short flight no need to waste taxpayers' money on flying business mar. well, he walks the talk! he's the man!some comment in mr vernon's blog said seen lge in business glass in 2 occasions. i'll say what's wrong with that anyway? he is not spending nearly rm800 000 on traveling during caretaker period did he?

	 don’t jail doctors blog campaign
	 

haven't been blogging for very long time. following palmdoc's call, i've put up the 'don't jail doctors' banner on the side bar of this blog in support of 'don’t jail doctors blog campaign'.calling all doctor and student bloggers and anyone who can help. the government has begun to arrest and jail doctors on a technicality - not registering their clinic with the phfsa. this act treats doctors like common criminals. these are community doctors who have not committed a serious crime but instead face an incredibly harsh sentence for their technical lapse. dr basmullah yusof, a family practitioner, is the first victim of this legislation. he was sentenced despite not having legal counsel representing him, despite pleading for leniency (he had wanted to sell the clinic anyway and is in financial trouble) and as he could not pay the hefty rm 120,000 fine, he is now in kajang prison.  you can read more about it inthe 1st clinic doctor convicted under the phfsaandthe 1st clinic doctor convicted under the phfsa (ii) the ex-health minister had promised that the act would be used only against bogus doctors and bogus clinics. yet, we see that legitimate licensed apc holding medical practitioners are now being targeted.
