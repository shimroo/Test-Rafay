airsept introduces automatic dual recycle guard


automatically filters refrigerant and prevents unwelcome a/c machine downtime

            atlanta, ga
            the new automatic dual recycle guard™ (adrg) safely and effectively captures sealant, debris, dye, excess lubricant, and other contaminants to protect expensive a/c recovery equipment without adjustment or monitoring. when it comes to capturing and replacing a/c refrigerant, many leak and seal type sealants can plug tubing, restrict valve movement, damage solenoids, and alter the seal’s shape and performance. airsept’s automatic dual recycle guard filters out sealant and other contaminants from the refrigerant before it ever enters the refrigerant recovery machine. 



















new remarkable results 


recorded live at the tst big event 2023,

            online
            recorded live at the tst big event 2023, with aaron becker, president of airsept and peter coll, president and coo of the mobile air climate systems association (macs). they discuss the government’s involvement in the automotive industry, the importance of having a mentor, the development of new products, the challenges of complying with epa regulations, and the impact of covid-19 on the industry.

about airsept


                            in 1989 airsept created the first long-lasting solution to the problem of unwanted mold and mildew odor in automobile air conditioning systems.
                            the product became popular so quickly that by 1991, airsept incorporated and began partnering with global oems and suppliers to not only market our cooling coil coating, but to also develop other unique new products.
