top rank's hall of fame matchmaker bruce trampler publicly criticized heavyweight jaren anderson's lackluster performance on saturday night. anderson (pictured) easily defeated marios kollias but nonetheless tired down the stretch. trampler tweeter: "if jared aderson don’t want it, he ain’t gonna get it. today looked like all the people at top rank worked harder for him than he worked for himself. you can be world champ if you truly want it.  sad if you don’t realize your potential and give it your best effort.  but that’s up to you, champ.  we still love you and azim. the espn team called it the way they saw it, and so did i.  i’m one of jared’s biggest supporters as a person and a fighter, but he’s got to do his part.  don’t make excuses for his performance... [it] is so frustrating. jared’s a good kid and could do some really special things in the ring, but it takes work, not coming in at heaviest weight ever." [anderson, who is promoted by top rank, weighed 256.75 pounds].

                                    richard torrez to step up vs. guido vianello on apr. 5th 
                                











	heavyweights richard torrez jr. and guido “the gladiator” vianello will clash in a high-stakes 10-round main event on saturday, april 5th at palms casino resort in las vegas. torrez, a u.s. olympic silver medalist, takes a seismic step up in class against the battle-tested italian olympian. promoted by top rank, the entire torrez-vianello card will stream live and exclusively on espn+ in the u.s. ticket and undercard information will be announced soon. [vianello is ranked #16 in the world by boxingtalk (see below), while the up-and-coming torrez is perhaps undervalued at #34]. “this has all the makings of a heavyweight classic, two athletic big men with power and tremendous determination,” said top rank chairman bob arum. “top rank has promoted richard and guido from the start of their respective professional careers, and i look forward to seeing how the fight unfolds at the palms casino resort.”

	 

	torrez (12-0, 11 kos), who hails from the farming community of tulare, california, captured olympic silver in the super heavyweight division in tokyo. a southpaw volume puncher, he turned pro the following march with a second-round stoppage of allen melson. torrez, a high school valedictorian who builds model rockets in his spare time, has since rocketed from prospect to contender. last may, he dismantled fellow unbeaten brandon moore in five rounds. his knockout streak ended last september after joey dawejko was disqualified for repeatedly spitting out his mouthpiece. torrez got back on the knockout train in december with a third-round blitzing of mexico’s issac munoz.

	 

	“this is something i've been working toward for a long time,” torrez said. “i want to prove that i’m the best heavyweight out there and show what american heavyweights are made of. when they offered me guido, i didn’t hesitate. i’m ready to go.”

	 

	born and raised in rome, vianello (13-2-1, 11 kos) had four first-round knockouts in his seven fights before being held to a draw against kingsley ibeh. he reignited his career in 2024 with a first-round stoppage of moses johnson and a split decision defeat to top contender efe ajagba in a fight of the year-type scrap. last august, he traveled to quebec city, canada, and beat down local favorite arslanbek makhmudov en route to an eighth-round tko. he now hopes to upend another decorated home country hero.

	 

	vianello said, “i am excited for this fight. after fighting makhmudov, i showed i was ready for anyone. richard is a talented young fighter, but he has never faced anyone like me. i will show myself to be top rank’s best heavyweight and move on to challenge for world titles.”

                                    valenzuela: "russell doesn't belong in the ring with me"
                                











	wba junior welterweight champion jose “rayo” valenzuela intends to make a statement in his first title defense as he takes on gary antuanne russell on saturday, march 1st as part of a pbc pay-per-view event on prime video at barclays center in brooklyn, new york. “i don't believe that gary antuanne russell belongs here with me,” said valenzuela. “he’s a strong, solid, durable fighter. he’s good, but i think he’s a little stiff when i look at him more. i worked my ass off to get here, and this is a bit of a handout for him. i took two tough losses and came back from hell to get the ‘pitbull’ cruz fight and conquer that. russell has had everything given to him and i think it's gonna show on march 1.”
	 
	the 25 year-old valenzuela (14-2, 9 kos) earned his world title in his last fight, dethroning fellow mexican star isaac “pitbull” cruz via decision last summer. facing one of the sport’s premier action fighters, valenzuela believes he showed all the levels to his game by delivering a signature performance. “my mentality going into the ‘pitbull’ fight was that i was gonna show that i'm a more diverse fighter than i got credit for, not just a knockout puncher,” said valenzuela. “i have a full arsenal. i showed my poise in the ring and i showed my ring generalship. there were a lot of little things that i did that had a major effect in the fight.”
	 
	heading into that fight, valenzuela had come off of back-to-back training camps with famed trainer robert garcia and will look to continue the steady improvement that he’s shown since teaming up with one of the sport’s best.  
	“having robert garcia in my corner gives me a lot of confidence,” said valenzuela. “he's really fixed my fundamentals. everything comes together nicely when we're working together. this training camp is going great. i've been conquering every day with hard work. i'm taking it all in and learning each day. it's just about learning the techniques and working hard.”
	 
	while valenzuela was able to show off his versatility in out-boxing cruz on his way to a decision, he believes that the style matchup with russell will force him to go toe-to-toe on march 1, delivering fireworks for fans tuning in. “fans can expect an action-packed fight,” said valenzuela. “stylistically it's a great matchup with him being a lefty and coming with the high guard marching forward. gary is a lot taller than ‘pitbull’. i knew i could dance around ‘pitbull’, but with gary i think i'm gonna have to fight through him.”
	 
	russell was a 2016 u.s. olympian who comes from one of the sport’s preeminent boxing families, as he’s trained by his brother, former wbc featherweight champion gary russell jr. by voluntarily taking on a tough challenge in his first title defense, valenzuela intends to prove his standing in the stacked 140-pound division. “taking on gary antuanne for my first title defense says a lot about me,” said valenzuela. “people have to respect it. my name is on the radar because of the kind of opposition i'm going up against.
	 
	“i think i'm at the top of this division with guys like teofimo lopez and alberto puello,” said valenzuela. “i believe strongly that i can beat all of these guys. it's just a matter of taking it one fight at a time. gary antuanne russell is in the way of where i'm trying to get to. i've got my full attention on him and i give him his respect. but there's more that i want to do. my story is gonna continue after this.”

                                    a lightweight star is born: keyshawn davis kos denys berinchyk for wbo title
                                











keyshawn davis ko4 denys berinchyk... keyshawn “the businessman” davis, the 2021 olympic silver medalist from norfolk, virginia, captured the wbo lightweight championship on saturday at the theater at madison square garden with a fourth-round knockout against denys “the thunder” berinchyk. headlining top rank’s espn-televised valentine’s day event in new york city, davis’ speed and precision proved the difference. making his first title defense, the southpaw berinchyk, 134.6 pounds, of kyiv, ukraine, was largely ineffective, often clumsy and off balance. the champion muffled much of his offense while grappling with the stronger challenger and excessively initiating clinches. younger, taller, and with a two-inch reach advantage, davis expertly executed his game plan, landing sharp, stinging power shots to the head and body. a left hook upstairs found its way past a crouching berinchyk’s high guard to score the first knockdown in round three. davis, 134.2 lbs., bloodied berinchyk’s nose in the fourth then landed a devastating left hook to the body to send his foe to a knee for the full ten count. the knockout came at 1:45 of the frame. the new champion exited the ring with his new belt and a 13-0 (9 kos) record. though billed as undefeated coming into his title defense, berinchyk fought in five paid contests in the world series of boxing, making 22-3 the most accurate accounting of his pro career.

xander zayas ko9 slawa spomer... n a battle of unbeaten junior middleweight contenders, puerto rico's xander zayas emerged victorious, outworking a game-but-outgunned slawa spomer en route to a ninth-round stoppage victory. a fast start from zayas (153.2 pounds and fighting out of sunrise, florida) left spomer’s nose bloodied in round one. at 22 and the younger fighter by ten years, zayas dominated slawa (153.2) by using quick hands, combinations, and powerful hooks to the body. though slawa, who had hall-of-famer roy jones jr. in his corner, found holes in zayas’ defense, he lacked the power to quell his adversary’s offensive output.  in round nine, a left hook to the liver doubled over spomer in obvious pain and the ensuing barrage of power punches from zayas forced a referee stoppage at the 2:01 mark. zayas, rated #1 in the wbo, improved to 21-0 (13 kos). spomer, born in kyrgyzstan and based out of baden-wurttemberg, germany, exited his united states debut with his first defeat, dipping to 20-1 (11 kos).

                                    zepeda gives farmer a rematch
                                











	months after their last toe-to-toe battle, undefeated wbc interim lightweight champion william “el camarón” zepeda (31-0, 26 kos) of san mateo atenco, mexico and former ibf junior lightweight champion tevin farmer (33-7-1, 8 kos) of philadelphia will engage in a rematch of their november 2024 showdown. the twelve-round fight for zepeda’s wbc interim title is set for march 29th at the poliforum benito juarez in cancún, mexico, in association with cancún boxing and will be broadcast worldwide on dazn. “i’ve trained hard for years to earn this world title, and i’m proud to get back in the ring and defend it in this highly anticipated rematch against tevin farmer,” said william zepeda. “the fans asked for it, and i’m ready to give them an even better version of myself. i’ll leave no doubt in anyone’s mind that i’m the clear winner.”

	 

	“i was off for 3.5 years, and fighting him the first time was the first time i felt somewhat comfortable in the ring. ring rust is real, but now it’s all gone,” said tevin farmer. “last time, i let him live and let him do more than i should have. this time, there’s no mercy. he’s not on my level, and on march 29, i’m not just winning—i’m making a statement. i’m going to show the world that i’m still a top dog in this game. never doubt tevin farmer. y’all should know that by now—i’m like a fly you can’t get rid of. i just keep coming back. just tune in on march 29 on dazn and watch.”

	 

	promoter oscar de la hoya added, “the first time these two stars went to war, i advised everyone to not sleep on farmer; and he delivered a terrific performance,  knocking down zepeda and giving him the toughest fight of his career. this rematch promises to be an even better battle. will zepeda be able to adjust and get back to his electric, knockout ways, or will farmer do enough to win this time? this is must see tv for fans on march 29th.”

	 

	an undefeated knockout machine that has an endless supply of energy that entertains fans with nonstop action from the first bell, wbc interim world champion william zepeda has become a household name as one of the most must-watch electric fighters in the lightweight division. his breakout upset performance was against former world champion joseph “jojo” diaz in october 2022, where he broke three compubox records at lightweight for total punches thrown, jabs attempted in a round, and total attempted jabs. he steamrolled through former world champion maxi hughes, whose corner threw the towel at the conclusion of the fourth round in an ibf and wba world championship eliminator fight last march 2024 and stopped giovanni cabrera for the first time in his career july 2024. his last fight was featured on the riyadh season’s “latino night” card last november 2024, where he went the distance for the first time in two years in a tough, toe-to-toe match against tevin farmer and took home the wbc interim lightweight belt with a split decision win. 

	 

	no stranger to the limelight, former ibf 130-poundhampion farmer is comfortable fighting on a big stage. with a slick, defensive style and southpaw stance, farmer has accomplished  everything in the sport of boxing including winning his ibf title and then defending it four times. in 2024 he suffered a razor thin loss against raymond muratalla. he gave a brilliant performance against zepeda in november, giving him a tough fight. despite the valiant effort, he lost via split decision with scores of 94-95, 95-94, and 94-95. in their scheduled rematch, farmer is ready to prove that he’s here to stay, and promises that zepeda won’t make it past him.

	iba president umar kremlev dared olympic gold medal winner imane khelif  to sue his organization. although khelif's gender is a matter of  discussion, it must be mentioned that she is not transgender, as she has lived her entire life as a woman. kremlev's statement read, "international boxing association (iba) welcomes the statement of algerian boxer imane khelif on social media about considering legal steps against the organization, as a court would force our organization to reveal two gender tests based on which the boxer was banned from participating in any iba women’s events. ‘we received great news that the ioc will face the consequences of their decisions, as imane khelif is going to proceed with legal actions against the iba. ‘we are really glad, as we will be able to prove in court that khelif, based on eligibility criteria, was not allowed to compete in female boxing events in order to guarantee safety and fair chance to women competitors. we will insist on the forensic medical examination, which will prove our position, and we will communicate the outcome accordingly. thomas bach [of the ioc] will be personally accountable to the law for what he did. iba is committed to protecting the boxer’s safety and fairness of competitions."

	 


		khelif, representing algeria. beat yang liu of the people’s republic of china to win gold in women’s welterweight division at the paris olympic games of 2024. khelif was one of two women's champions embroiled in a controversy about her gender. she previously competed at tokyo 2021, where she became the first female boxer to represent algeria at the olympics. since then, the 25-year-old khelif has won gold medals at the 2022 mediterranean games and the 2023 arab games. she won the paris 2024 final in dominant fashion by a final tally of 5-0.

		 

		khelif had been disqualified from the iba's 2023 world amateur championships under suspicipus circumstances. after competing for years and even winning the opening round of the 2023 tournament, iba, the organization that runs the world amateur championship, abruptly disqualified khelif for failing a gender test. full details of the test were not revealed. while iba controls the world amateur championships, it has no authority to determine who is eleigible for the olympics becuase the international olympic committee threw iba out of the olympics over proven corruption in the 2016 olympics.

		 

		the facts are not presently known but there are concerns about khelif's chromosomes (females are xx, males are xy) or testosterone levels. the ioc stated, "we have seen in reports misleading information about two female athletes competing at the olympic games paris 2024. the two athletes have been competing in international boxing competitions for many years in the women’s category, including the olympic games tokyo 2020, international boxing association (iba) world championships and iba-sanctioned tournaments. these two athletes were the victims of a sudden and arbitrary decision by the iba. towards the end of the iba world championships in 2023, they were suddenly disqualified without any due process."

                                    shields denies rumors of ped / marijuana use
                                











	in a twitter post liked by women's heavyweight champion claressa shields, victor conte seemed to suggest that shields had tested positive for marijuana after her last fight, but that she was innocent of any wrongdoing. conte, an expert in athlete doping issues due to his past illegal activities, currently operates scientific nutrition for advanced conditioning (snac) and works with shields. he tweeted as follows: "important notice to boxing: claressa shields did not test positive for a ped [performance enhancing drug] after her recent fight in michigan [a win over danielle perkins on february 2nd in flint, michigan]. claressa had not smoked marijuana, [but] the commision did a mouth swab test after the fight. there seems to be a number of issues that exist with the michigan testing procedure. urine is the normal sample [method] used to test for marijuana. most credible anti-doping entities do not consider marijuana to be a ped. vada found no peds in claressa's blood and urine samples. the nevada commision, the ufc and other commissions do not consider marijuana a ped. the amount found in her mouth swab was 3.4 ng/ml or parts per billion. this is an ultra-trace amount that likely would have come from second-hand smoke in the arena. there were also other irregularities that occurred in the testing procedure. the world of boxing needs to clearly understand that claressa is a clean boxer and always has been. more information about this rather unusual case will become available soon."

	in approving conte's statement, shields lashed out at people who were calling her a cheater: "mice try haters. dont't ever try and put no bullsh*t on me. clean athletes win!" in responding to a twitter commenter, shields added that she had never even tried marjuana.

                                    stanionis training camp report
                                











	wba welterweight champion eimantas stanionis (15-0, 9 kos) is entering the final days of his lithuanian training camp in his hometown of kaunas before heading to the united states to complete preparations for his unification showdown against jaron “boots” ennis (33-0, 29 kos). the two elite welterweights will battle for the ibf and wba world welterweight titles on april 12th at jim whelan boardwalk hall in atlantic city, new jersey, live on dazn. before departing for the united states, stanionis, who fights under the tgb promotions banner, has been training as well as mentoring young teens at the local after school program for troubled teens, an experience that has fueled his motivation for this career-defining moment. "spending these last days training at home with my gym mates and mentoring the young kids at the local afterschool program means everything to me," said stanionis. "i remember growing up with friends that were struggling, so i feel it’s my duty to help these kids out as best i can. now, i’m here, and i want to show them that with hard work and dedication, anything is possible."

	as the first lithuanian-born world champion in boxing history, stanionis is proud to represent his country on one of the sport’s biggest stages and hopes to bring home another major victory for his homeland. "every time i step into the ring, i carry lithuania with me," stanionis continued. "this fight isn’t just about me—it’s about my country, my people, and the next generation of lithuanian fighters. i fight with pride, and on april 12th, i plan to make history once again."

	a win over ennis would establish stanionis as one of the premier forces in the welterweight division and catapult him into global superstardom. "this is the biggest fight of my career, and a victory over ennis will put my name alongside the best in the world," stanionis stated. "he’s a great fighter, but i’m coming to prove that i belong at the very top. this is my moment, and i won’t let it slip away."

	with his time in lithuania coming to an end, stanionis is looking forward to beginning the final phase of his camp in los angeles, where he will fine-tune his skills at the legendary wild card boxing gym with coach marvin somodio ahead of the biggest fight of his career. "training in los angeles at wild card, with coach marvin, will be the perfect way to sharpen everything up before the fight. the work i put in there, the elite sparring, will make sure i’m 100% ready to go on april 12," he concluded. "i’m excited, focused, and prepared to leave everything in the ring."

                                    santiago to battle fortuna in fajardo, puerto rico
                                











	salita promotions and fresh productions have announced the addition of several competitive undercard bouts to the march 1st show in fajardo, puerto rico headlined by ex-champ subriel matías (21-2, 21 kos) against mexico’s hard-hitting gabriel valenzuela (30-3, 17 kos). the main event will be an ibf junior welterweight eliminator. dazn will stream all the action. as for the newly announced supporting bouts, alfredo santiago (16-2, 7 kos) will battle javier fortuna (39-5, 28 kos) of the dominican republic. santiago was also born in the dominican republic but resides in fajardo. nestor bravo (23-0, 16 kos) is matched against south afdrican gatekeeper xolisani ndongeni (32-6, 19 kos). also announced for the show is the professional debut of puerto rico’s yandiel lozano and another fight for salita promotions heavyweight pryce taylor (6-0, 4 kos) from brooklyn, n.y.
	 
	returning to puerto rico for the second time in five months, salita promotions has continued to explore the rich boxing talent residing on the island, much like the company has done the past two years in the state of michigan. with a proven track record of discovering talent throughout the greater detroit and flint, mich., region, salita promotions president dmitriy salita continues to give up-and-coming and rising talent a global platform to perform. “we provided a path and platform for many fighters to earn recognition and achieve their dreams,” said dmitriy salita. “from solidified world champions like claressa shields to budding stars like ardreal holmes jr., salita promotions continues to mine for the next super stars of boxing throughout michigan and now we are doing the same in puerto rico. stars from the caribbean island such as miguel cotto, félix trinidad, and juan ‘john john’ molina have all paved the way for the prospects we will be showcasing on march 1.”
	 
	santiago, age 30, returns to the ring on the heels of a statement first-round tko victory over mexico’s pedro campa in november 2024. currently on the strength of three straight victories, santiago defeated angel fierro via unanimous decision in june. starting his pro career off with a record of 12-0, santiago lost a challenge to future world lightweight champion devin haney in november 2019. "this is a great opportunity to showcase the level i am at,” said santiago. “i have worked hard, i’m in my best shape, and on march 1 in fajardo, i’m going to give it my all in the ring. i respect javier fortuna, but he will find out that he's facing a true warrior. i'm ready for any version of him that shows up in front of my people in fajardo. i’m going to go to war and take the victory."
	 
	entering his second bout in just over two months, the 35-year-old fortuna will compete in puerto rico for the first time. like his opponent, fortuna is coming off a tko victory, defeating jonatan mariano in december 2024. boasting 28 knockouts to his resume, fortuna challenged former ibf super featherweight champion joseph "jojo" diaz in 2021 for a wbc interim lightweight title.
	 
	in addition, bravo and ndongeni will collide at junior welterweight. hailing from arecibo, p.r., bravo will return to action after nearly a year away from the ring. in his last outing, bravo scored a second-round knockout victory over carlos manuel portillo. following a decorated amateur career with numerous national and international tournament wins, bravo turned professional in 2015 when he defeated nestor ortiz via knockout.
	 
	ndongeni is looking to insert himself back into the win column against bravo. a tenured competitor, ndongeni has held some smaller titles and aims to give the rising bravo his first defeat.
	 
	kicking off the night live on dazn and in a quick turnaround, brooklyn, n.y.’s pryce taylor returns to action against arizona’s trevor kotara (4-3-1, 1 ko) following his second-round knockout victory over jerell nettles on february 2nd. taylor signed with salita promotions in november 2024, and has since gone 2-0 under the banner, both victories coming by way of knockout. standing at 6-foot-4, taylor is a former collegiate basketball player and has won two new york golden gloves title.
	 
	lastly, puerto rico’s own yandiel lozano will make his much-anticipated professional debut. the silver medalist at the world youth championships, a four-time champion of the bert sugar tournament, florida junior silver gloves champion, and two-time puerto rican national champion, lozano steps into the star-studded featherweight division after a solid amateur career.
	 
	“fajardo is filled with pride as it welcomes home two of its greatest warriors of the ring,” said josé aníbal meléndez, mayor autonomous municipality of fajardo. “subriel matías, born and raised in our town, returns to the ring to once again prove why he is one of the most outstanding figures in world boxing. alongside him, another great champion from fajardo, alfredo ‘ojo’ santiago, will be defending his title, proudly representing our city. for fajardo, this event is not just a sporting spectacle but a celebration of the determination, discipline, and talent that define our athletes.”

	“fajardo is filled with pride as it welcomes home two of its greatest warriors of the ring,” said josé aníbal meléndez, mayor autonomous municipality of fajardo. “subriel matías, born and raised in our town, returns to the ring to once again prove why he is one of the most outstanding figures in world boxing. alongside him, another great champion from fajardo, alfredo ‘ojo’ santiago, will be defending his title, proudly representing our city. for fajardo, this event is not just a sporting spectacle but a celebration of the determination, discipline, and talent that define our athletes.”

                                    ex-champ  commey looking for an opponent ten days out from fight
                                











	former ibf lightweight champion richard “rc” commey (30-5-1, 27 kos) returns to the ring after a two-year absence on sunday, february 23rd on a show presented by world kid promotions at kings theater in brooklyn, new york. the action will be streamed live on www.bxngtv.com. commey joins another former champion, brooklyn junior middleweight sadam “world kid” ali (27-3, 14 kos), who returns to the ring after a 5 ½ years absence from the ring in the eight-round main event against victoriano antonio santillan (13-7-2, 8 kos) of argentina. the former champions' friendship is critical in terms of commey’s return and they’re doing it together. “i have a great relationship with sadam,” commey explained. “i was training in his gym when i wasn’t world champ and i’m still training there. i stayed in camp with him when he became world champion. we are very good friends – like family – especially when we talk about boxing.”

	a ghana native, commey fights out of the bronx and faces an opponent to be finalized in an eight-round welterweight bout. the 37 year-old commey captured the vacant ibf crown on february 2, 2019, when he stopped isa chaniev (13-1) in the second round. three-and-one-half months later, commey successfully defended his title with an eighth-round stoppage of raymundo beltran (36-8-1). commey was idle for the last two years because of life and managerial issues that are now resolved. he’s returning to the ring, not for a one-and-done fight, but for a final career run.

	“i had to clear my mind,” commey talked about his situation that kept him out of the ring. “this is the first of many fights to follow, but i still have to look at my performance that will tell me about upcoming fights.”

	also on the show, youtube infuiencer junior welterweight adam saleh (1-0-1, 0 kos) of east meadow, new york, who is supported by his nearly 5-million subscribers, is booked for a four-round match against tba.

	other fighters on the undercard include brooklyn bantamweight khalid twaiti (14-0, 5 kos), runner-up in the 2015 usa national championships, is coming off his first ten-round fight last october, in which he won by way of a dominant unanimous decision (99-91, 99-91, 98-91) over emmanuel rodriguez (15-1) in newark, new jersey... brooklyn junior lightweight “speedy” chiara dituri (9-2, 3 kos) in a six-round match, as well as pro-debuting new york city junior middleweight jahanze riswan and pro-debuting light heavyweight mike boyle, who is a yonkers (ny) firefighter, in a pair of four-rounders.

	a former wbo junior middleweight champ and a 2008 u.s. olympian, ali’s company, world kid, is promoting this event, its first since 2012, which was also held in brooklyn.  ali captured his title in 2017, upsetting miguel cotto (41-5) at the famed madison square garden.

                                    olympic medal winner pat mccormack steps up vs. robbie davies
                                











	it’s an all-british welterweight showdown this saturday night at co-op live arena in manchester, where undefeated pat mccormack will put hius skills to the test against former european and british champion robbie davies jr. at 29 years old, mccormack has logged just thirty professional rounds, only a fraction of the experience davies jr. brings to the ring. but mccormack, a sunderland native who won a silver medal at the 2021 tokyo olympics, has made a seamless transition to the pro ranks since debuting in 2022. mccormack is coming off a decision win over argentina’s williams herrera in this very arena.

	in the opposite corner, davies jr. a battle-tested veteran with a deep résumé. the liverpool native is fresh off a unanimous decision victory over javier fortuna on november 1, 2024, bouncing back from a decision loss to ex-ibf champ sergey lipinets. with a career full of high-level opposition, davies poses the toughest test yet for the rising olympian.

	mccormack enters the ring with an unblemished 6-0 record, four of those wins coming by knockout. davies brings a 24-5 record with 15 knockouts to his name.

                                    racist incident mars berinchyk vs. davis fight week
                                











	tomorrow (friday), keyshawn davis (12-0, 8 kos) will challenge denys berinchyk (19-0, 9 kos) for the wbo lightweight title this friday, feb. 14th at the theater at madison square garden. the 25-year-old gets his first shot at world title glory against a fellow olympic silver medalist determined to hold onto his crown. but the fight took on a deeply personal turn during thursday’s press conference after davis (who is black) accused berinchyk (a white ukrainian) of delivering a box of bananas and a watermelon to his room, an act he deemed racist. [there is no hard evidence of his involvement and] berinchyk dismissed the claim as a manufactured controversy. this is what the principals had to say about the incident: 

	 

	statement issued by top rank

	 

	"top rank is appalled and disgusted by ther actions of the individual(s) that delivered the package to keyshawn davis [tuesday] night. these actions are contrary to the foundation of top rank. there is no place for this in sports or society. keyshawn has our full support.

	 

	denys berinchyk

	 

	“i don’t speak english, and i don’t write english.  i saw his message on social media. it’s weird even to mention this. some people with bad intentions looking for some hype made that.”

	 

	“the first thing you need to do is make weight. and afterward, on friday, we’re going to sort it out.”

	 

	“since winning my title, i’ve been training the entire time. and i was preparing for this defense. nothing changed too much in my life. we have a war in ukraine. so, unfortunately, my life didn’t change much.”

	 

	“i never imagined myself fighting here. but i’ve been working hard for 25 years to make my dream come true and accomplish this assignment.”

	 

	“i have 355 amateur fights. i have more than 500 victorious street fights. i have one bare-knuckle fight that was also victorious.” 

	 

	keyshawn davis

	 

	“i want to address the fact that this guy came to america to give me bananas and a watermelon with a note on it. it’s unprofessional, and i feel like it’s racist. and you just made this fight a little more personal. this man brought a box of bananas and a watermelon to america to bring to my room. i took it as racist. so, i got something for you.”

	 

	“ya’ll did it. it’s ok that ya’ll did it. i’m going to whoop your ass for it. just know what’s coming friday night.”

	 

	“it’s a real blessing. when he called my name out after he won his last fight, i had a feeling in my spirit that i was going to fight him for the world championship. i never thought it would be at madison square garden.”

	 

	“you’re not tougher than me. you can talk about all that bare-knuckle stuff. i come from what i come from. i’ve been doing this bare-knuckle s**t outside the ring. so, all that s**t you’re talking about, i don’t care. i’m going to f**k you up this friday. 

	 

	i don’t care about none of your experience or amateur experience. i don’t care about your silver medal. i don’t even care about your watch, your belt, or any of that. i’m going to f**k you up on friday.”

                                    iba to file legal complaints over gender-based olympic dispute
                                











	the [scandal-plagued] international boxing association (iba) [the amateur federation excluded from the olympic movement because of prior corruption allegations] released a statement that it is committed to "upholding the integrity of female sports." in the wake of an executive ordersigned by united states president donald trump banning transgenders from competing outside of the gender they were assigned at birth, the iba announced it is filing an official complaint with the attorney general of switzerland, stefan blätter. the complaint will be filed against the international olympic committee (ioc) for facilitating the participation of boxers imane khelif and lin yu-ting in the women's division. [it should be noted, neither of these boxers are transgender. it seems, although is not officially confirmed, that both were intersex and raised as women their entire life. both won olympic gold medals at the 2024 paris games].

	ihe iba argues that: "according to the swiss law, any action or inaction that poses a safety risk to competition participants warrants investigation and may serve as grounds for criminal prosecution. in addition, similar complaints are to be filed with the attorneys general of france and the usa."

	iba president umar kremlev added, "president trump’s order to ban transgender athletes from women’s sport validates iba’s efforts to protect the integrity of female sports. our actions aim to ensure gender equality in boxing. we urge other international federations to follow iba’s example, as we are uniquely positioned to address this issue and advocate for our athletes’ rights."

	kremlev further encouraged boxers who were impacted by the ioc’s decision to allow khelif and lin to compete in the paris 2024 qualification tournament or olympic boxing events to pursue legal action against ioc president thomas bach and sports director kit mcconnell. "iba will provide free-of-charge comprehensive legal support to our boxers in these lawsuits, as this is a clear violation of human rights, an outrage towards the female boxers, and simply a crime that should be punished accordingly. in my personal opinion, thomas bach should take the full responsibility for this, as he was in charge when it happened, and he needs to compensate the damages caused, if the court or any other instance rules this," said kremlev in a press release.

                                    a few words with miguel "el explosivo" madueño
                                











	camponovo sports' miguel "el explosivo" madueño (31-1, 28 kos), is set to take on golden boy promotions’ oscar duarte (28-2-1, 22 kos) in a high-stakes showdown on just ten days’ notice. the twelve-round main event will be broadcast live on dazn from the honda center in anaheim, california, this saturday february 15th. having just arrived in california, madueño shares his thoughts on his training camp, the challenge of facing duarte, stepping in on short notice, and more.

arriving in california:

	"i just arrived in california this past weekend, and from the moment i touched down, it’s been all about getting locked in. the adjustment has been quick, but as i mentioned before, i stay ready at all times. my team and i have been putting in the work, sharpening up the game plan, and making the most of every session. i feel strong and confident heading into fight night."


matchup with oscar duarte:

	"duarte is a tough, aggressive fighter who comes forward with power, but i’m prepared for that style. i also like to come forward, making this a fight the fans will want to see. i respect what he brings to the table, but i know my own strengths and what i’m capable of.  this is going to be a battle of two mexican warriors, and i’m ready to give the fans an exciting fight."

taking the fight on ten days’ notice:

	"this is the kind of opportunity i train for. some fighters hesitate when they get a call like this, but i don’t. i stay in shape, i stay ready, and i believe in myself. short notice or not, i’m stepping in with full confidence that i can get the job done."

what a win would means for his career:

	"a victory over oscar duarte will be huge for my career. it gets me back in the conversation in the super lightweight division and gives me a shot at even bigger fights. this is my chance to prove myself, and i’m ready to make a statement on fight night."

                                    mary spencer books first title defense for march 14th
                                











	canada's mary spencer will put her wba junior middleweight title on the line for the first time on friday, march 14th when she squares off against ogleidis suárez of venezuela. the bout will serve as the chief supporting bout on a card promoted by eye of the tiger management, taking place at espace st-denis in montreal. headlining the evening will be a clash between erik bazinyan (32-1-1) and steven butler (35-5-1). hailing from wiarton, ontario, spencer is gearing up for her first fight of the year after capturing the wba interim title last september with a unanimous decision victory over germany’s naomi mannes (7-3-1). shortly after, she was elevated to wba champion status.

	spencer (9-2, 6 kos), now 40 years old, boasts an impressive knockout ratio of over 60%. she kicked off 2024 with a first-round ko over american sonya dreiling (6-7) but had a setback in her lone fight of 2023, suffering a majority decision loss to belgium’s femke hermans (18-5). over her last five outings, spencer has picked up three wins (two by stoppage) and two defeats.

	on the other side of the ring, suárez (31-5-1, 15 kos) is looking to capitalize on momentum. the 37 year-old venezuelan enters this title fight fresh off a second-round ko victory over colombia’s neisi torres (13-17-1) earlier this year. a former 122-pound interim title holder who was briefly promoted to full champion in that lower weight class,  suárez has had mixed results in recent years. her last north american appearance came in 2022 when she suffered a fifth-round knockout loss to hard-hitting shadasia green (15-1) in the united states. before that, she secured a stoppage win in 2020 against fellow venezuelan maría pirona (1-7). suárez has gone 3-2 in her last five fights and will be aiming to reclaim championship gold on canadian soil.

	unified wbc and wbo 154-pound champion sebastian “the towering inferno” fundora (pictured) will make the first defense of his titles against chordale booker headlining pbc championship boxing on prime video action saturday, march 22nd at mandalay bay resort and casino in las vegas. in the co-feature, mexican junior middleweight jesus ramos jr. will battle all-action kevin salgado in a ten-round all-mexican showdown, plus rising middleweight elijah garcia duels veteran terrell gausha in the ten-round opening bout. the event will begin at 8 p.m. et/5 p.m. pt, with the action streaming exclusively on prime video for all prime members in the united states and select countries. join today or start a free 30-day trial to catch the championship card. known for delivering action every time he steps into the ring, fundora will compete as a champion for the first time as he takes on booker in this high-stakes clash with multiple titles on the line. tickets for the live event, which is promoted by tgb promotions, sampson boxing and mayweather promotions, will go on sale thursday, february 13 at 10 a.m. pt on axs.com. pre-sale tickets are available on wednesday, february 12th at 10 am pt until 10 pm pt on axs.com with the code: pbc

	 

	“sebastian fundora sits atop the stacked super welterweight division and will no doubt be looking to put on a show when he defends his world titles against the dangerous highly-rated contender chordale booker topping this great event on prime video on march 22nd,” said tom brown, president of tgb promotions. “this is a tremendous style matchup between the forward-charging attack of fundora and the slick counterpunching of booker and will make for great back-and-forth. combined with a surefire action fight between jesus ramos jr. and kevin salgado and a toss-up fight between elijah garcia and terrell gausha, everything is in place for another memorable fight night in las vegas.”

	 

	“sebastian ‘the towering inferno’ fundora will be better than ever in his first fight as a defending unified world champion,” said fundora's promoter sampson lewkowicz. “the whole fundora family works so hard to be where they are and they deserve their success. chordale booker is a good fighter with real skills, but he won’t be able to take sebastian’s power.”

	 

	standing nearly six-foot-six, fundora leapt into the championship ranks after earning a decision over tim tszyu last year. at 21-1-1 with 13 kos, he rocketed to the top of the 154-pound division with a fan-friendly style and bruising toughness in the ring that helped him emerge victorious from a grueling and bloody battle against tszyu last march. a native of coachella, california, fundora notably showed his mettle in april 2022, battling the hard-hitting erickson lubin in a 2022 fight of the year contender. despite both men hitting the canvas, fundora stood tall in the end, prompting lubin’s corner to stop the fight at the end of the ninth round. the 27-year old suffered his only defeat against brian mendoza in 2023. fundora represents one of boxing’s most accomplished families, as he is trained by his father freddy alongside his younger sister, undisputed flyweight world champion gabriela. the two fighting fundora’s are the first brother and sister to simultaneously hold world championships.

	 

	“i’m preparing really hard to defend my unified wbc and wbo world titles on march 22nd in las vegas,” said fundora. “everyone can expect to see me prepared and ready to leave it all in the ring like i always do. ‘the towering inferno’ is back, and i’m coming to take out everyone in my way.”

	 

	fighting out of his native stamford, connecticut, booker (23-1, 11 kos) enters this fight on a six-fight winning streak that includes four stoppage victories that have helped him rise up the rankings and earn his first world title opportunity. since a 2022 loss to austin williams, booker has dominated his competition, including a 2024 campaign that saw him defeat greg vendetti in february before stopping brian damian chaves in round three of their june clash. the 33-year old also owns triumphs over wale omotoso and veshawn owens. prior to turning pro in 2016, booker put together an amateur career that included gold medals at the u.s. national and golden gloves championships, in addition to a bronze medal at the u.s. olympic trials that earned him an alternate spot for the 2016 u.s. olympic team.

	 

	“i’ve done everything i could to get here, and it’s a testament to what my foundation represents – going the distance,” said booker. “i’ve gone the distance to make it to this fight. i’ve taken fights on short notice, fought for less and always kept pushing forward. now, 15 years into my boxing journey, i’m stepping into the biggest fight of my life. this moment means everything and it’s proof that hard work and perseverance pays off.”

                                    irish welters donovan and crocker to fight in an eliminator
                                











	in an excellent all-ireland contest, paddy “the real deal” donovan (14-0, 11 kos) is confident of defeating arch-rival lewis “the croc” crocker (20-0, 11 kos) in their march 1st showdown, streaming on dazn live from the sse arena (odyssey arena) in belfast, northern ireland. more than irish bragging rights will be on the line, because the two will be fighting at home in belfast in an ibf welterweight eliminator. the winner of crocker-donovan will be in line for an ibf title fight, against current ibf champion jaron “boots” ennis (33-0, 29 kos) or current wba champion eimantas stanionis (15-0, 9 kos), who are scheduled to fight for the unified ibf and wba crowns on april 12th in atlantic city. 

	 

	“i will best lewis crocker because he has never fought anyone as good as me,” donovan proclaimed. “i have all the tools to beat him. i’ll out-box and out-fight him. i do those things, he can’t, and i’ll show that on fight night. i have visualized the fight in my head many times. i believe that in real time, seeing me punch him to either the head or body.”

	 

	donovan, age 26, hasn’t fought since this past may 25th, crocker, age 28 since last june 22nd. both are promoted by matchroom boxing and jumaane camero is their only common pro-opponent with both winning six-round decisions.

	 

	“if you don't love this matchup, then you don't like boxing,” donovan’s co-manager keith sullivan commented. “given their power, aggressive styles, and toughness, it is going to be an explosive battle between two top fighters. no boxing fan should miss this. it is going to be an epic fight and has a fight-of-the-year potential.”

	 

	sullivan, a new york city attorney and former deputy commissioner for the new york state boxing commission, co-manages donovan with former middleweight champion andy lee, who is paddy’s head trainer as well. “i heard lewis say paddy was turning this into a north versus south rivalry,” sullivan continued. “that is not the case at all. this fight will unite, not divide, people from all over ireland, north and south, as they cheer on their chosen man of the night. i have relations in both the north and south, trust me, this fight is not about divisiveness, it transcends politics or sectarianism. irish fans are knowledgeable, and they know a great fight when they see one. this fight is about two warriors putting it all on the line for a shot at the title while their native cities cheer them on to victory.  

	 

	“obviously, i see paddy being victorious. i've heard all this talk about crocker's ‘experience’ and being a past five-time headliner. he was the main event on one card in a venue that seats a thousand. this is paddy's 15th professional fight, for crocker's 15th, 16th, and 17th fights he fought guys that had 61 combined losses. so come on, what’s all that chatter about. paddy has no fear of crocker’s experience. paddy got to the level earlier in his career than crocker did, so now a 20-0 versus a 14-0 is a great pairing for both at this stage of their careers. don't get me wrong, these are two talented and fierce boxers, but i believe paddy has the edge in skill and power and he will have his hand raised in victory come march 1st.”

	 

	donovan, a gifted southpaw, is dedicating this fight to pieta, using his boxing platform to promote the suicide prevention charity that provides mental health services throughout ireland. paddy has lost two relatives to suicide. the pietra crisis helpline, 1-800-247-247, offers crisis intervention support, 24 hours a day 365 days a year, to anyone experiencing suicidal thoughts or engaging in self-harm and also supports those bereaved through suicide.

                                    cherneka johnson vs. nina hughes ii booked for march 22nd
                                











	on saturday, march 22nd at sydney’s qudos bank arena, cherneka johnson (16-2, 6 kos) defends her wba bantamweight title in a rematch against nina hughes (6-1, 2 kos), after their first fight was marred in controversy last may. on the same card, wbc featherweight queen skye nicolson (12-0, 1 ko) will  be tasked with undefeated, mandatory american rival, tiara brown (18-0, 11 kos). the headlined that night will see ex-world lightweight champ george kambosos, jr. vs. indonesia's daud yordan. britain’s hughes will be hungry for retribution after she was initially declared as the winner before the ring announcer corrected himself by revealing johnson as the victor by majority decision to become a two-weight champion.

	“i’m looking forward to getting back in the ring on another awesome show here in australia,” said johnson. “i have no doubt in my mind that it’s going to be a career-best dominating performance.”

	hughes added: “first and foremost, i have a lot of respect for cherneka johnson as an athlete – she’s a tough competitor. but this time around, i’m not leaving anything to chance or in the judges’ hands. i’ve trained harder, i’m sharper, and i’m ready to leave no doubt when i step in that ring.”

	the other title fight on the card features nicolson, who made history last october when she was the first female fighter to retain her title in the kingdom of saudi arabia, during the riyadh season curtain-raiser, when the southpaw outclassed raven chapman to extend her flawless record. “this is my homecoming as world champion – a moment i have dreamed of and manifested: bringing big world title action down under,” said nicolson. “australian boxing is entering a golden era, and this is the time to get excited and be part of the journey. i’m taking on an undefeated and dangerous challenger with the support of the nation behind me. my opponent has had a lot to say and doesn’t believe i’m worthy of my status as world champion. on march 22nd, she is going to eat her words in sydney as i silence the doubters and critics all over again.

                                    formal announcement for kambosos vs. jordan
                                











	former world lightweight champion george kambosos jr. (pictured) gets his long-awaited australian homecoming on saturday, march 22nd against daud yordan of indonesia – live worldwide on dazn. kambosos will move up to the junior welterweight division on a huge card at sydney’s qudos bank arena which features two women’s title bouts with skye nicolson and cherneka ‘sugar’ johnson looking to successfully defend their respective crowns on home soil. ex-olympic heavyweight teremoana teremoana will bid for his seventh successive stoppage.

	kambosos jr (21-3, 10 kos) faces former two-weight ibo champion yordan (43-4, 31 kos) in the main event, looking to lay down a marker in one of the sport’s most exciting divisions. the 31-year old – who captured world honors by beating teofimo lopez in 2021 – has shared the ring with the likes of devin haney, maxi hughes and lee selby and returns to the ring for the first time since his loss last may with the legendary vasyl lomachenko.

	yordan promises another stern test for kambosos and is no stranger to fight fans, having previously held ibo titles at lightweight and featherweight and succumbing to a points defeat by anthony crolla in manchester back in 2018.

	matchroom sport chairman eddie hearn said: “this a brilliant card, headlined by the ferocious george kambosos jr in his hometown of sydney. he’s a dangerous man and he will be in the mix of world title conversations soon enough now he’s in the 140-pound division. there are two tremendous women’s world championship fights too, as skye nicolson defends her wbc featherweight crown against a tough, mandatory in tiara brown, plus cherneka johnson and nina hughes get the chance to go again for the wba bantamweight belt.

	“big, bruising heavyweight teremoana teremoana will be out to put on another knockout performance in front of his home fans, and much more, in what promises to be an unbelievable night of boxing down under.”

	kambosos jr said: “eight long years on the road, and finally i get to fight back in my hometown of sydney, australia.

	“moving up and having my 140-pound debut in front of my fans at a sold-out sydney arena is the return i have always wanted. this is not just a fight; it’s an opportunity to inspire and give back to my loyal fans and to the community that has stuck by me all these years, the wait is now over. i will be facing a veteran of the sport and a fierce competitor, former two-time ibo champion and wba title challenger duad yordan, ‘the boxing senator’, from indonesia. the qudos bank arena in sydney will set the stage for me to make a statement return in front of my vocal hometown fans. i see this is as a testament to resilience, a celebration of my homecoming, expect fireworks and see you all march 22nd.”

	lou dibella, kambosos' co-promoter added: “i am excited to team up with matchroom boxing and teg sport to bring ‘ferocious’ george kambosos jr. back to his hometown in sydney where he will face former world champion daud yordan on march 22nd at the qudos bank arena. this is a tremendous style matchup between two come-forward pressure fighters. yordan is no stranger down under with three wins on australian soil, but george is ready to unleash his warrior spirit once again to put on a sensational performance in his junior welterweight debut."

                                    fulghum vs. harris is saturday's co-feature in anaheim
                                











	super middleweight darius “dfg” fulghum (13-0, 11 kos) returns on february 15th against detroit veteran winfred “hotboy” harris, jr. (22-2-2, 10 kos). fulghum vs. harris is the ten-round, co-feature on a golden boy promotions card, headlined by oscar duarte vs. miguel madueno, to be streamed on dazn live from honda center in anaheim, california.  harris has only been stopped once in 26 pro fights. his last outing ended in an eight-round draw last november. “i’m excited about this great opportunity,” fulghum said. “i don’t know too much about my opponent and won’t until i get in the ring. he has a good record. i hear that he comes to fight.

	 

	 

	fulghum continued, “this is an opportunity for me to show what level i’m at in my division. i’m planning a splash performance. my job is to put on a show. there are expectations for me to perform at a high level because of my rating, but this is what i love to do. overall, i train hard to be the best version of myself.”

	 

	fulghum and harris have one common opponent, vaughen alexander, who fulghum defeated last june by way of a ten-round unanimous decision, while harris fought alexander in 2021 to an eight-round draw.

	 

	last month, fulghum gained additional experience as a sparring partner for light heavyweight david morrell, jr. for the latter’s recent fight against david benavidez. “i showed that i belong,” fulghum remarked about sparring with morell, “and that i’m one of the top guys at 168.”

	 

	fulghum, age 28, was a decorated amateur boxer who was ranked no. 1 in the usa as a heavyweight, but as a professional he’s fought strictly as a super middleweight. he captured top honors at the 2018 national golden gloves tournament and 2020 u.s. olympic team trials, both of these major amateur accomplishments achieved while he was earning a nursing degree from prairie view a & m university.

	 

	fulghum is working with 3 point management.

                                    spotlight on jonathan lopez vs. alex dilmaghani
                                











	trained by the renowned eddy reynoso (best known for his work with multi-division champion saul "canelo" alvarez),  21 year-old jonathan “la roca” lopez has shown skills he hopes will make him a future champion. on march 1st at braclays center in brooklyn, new york, he'll  look to take down another tough test in the experienced uk veteran  alex dilmaghani as they tussle in a ten-round junior lightweight clash. the bout will be free-streamed as part of a two-fight pbc on prime video show leading up to a pay-per-view event headlined by gervonta “tank” davis defending his wba lightweight championship against unbeaten wba junior lightweight champion lamont roach. 

	 

	residing in orlando, florida, lopez (17-0, 12 kos) turned pro in 2020 following a strong amateur career and will enter this fight having stopped 10 of his last 12 opponents. lopez most recently dominated richard medina last september on his way to earning a unanimous decision that he highlighted by scoring a final round knockdown. he earned a then career-best victory in june 2023 and went ten rounds for the first time as he bested former title challenger eduardo baez via a wide unanimous decision leading into his three-victory 2024 campaign.

	 

	“i’m super excited to be back in the ring,” said lopez. “and i’m very grateful to everyone who made this possible. this is a perfect opportunity for me to showcase my talent and skills on a fight of this magnitude. i have to show everyone that my time is now.”

	 

	a native of manchester, united kingdom, dilmaghani (20-3-1, 7 kos) will fight stateside for the second time as a pro on march 1st, after most recently dropping a june 2024 battle to rene tellez giron. the 33-year old has competed professionally since 2009, always taking on tough competition while fighting in mexico, canada, france and denmark, in addition to his native uk. he also owns a majority draw against former world title challenger francisco fonseca in november 2019 and has won two of his last three bouts.

	 

	“i can’t wait to step into the ring on march 1st and show everyone the best version of myself,” said dilmaghani. “if people are sleeping on me, they’re going to be surprised, because i’m training hard to make sure i steal the show when that bell rings. i’m definitely coming to make the most of this opportunity.”

                                    late results: two british titles contested on saturday
                                











jack rafferty tko7 reece macmillan... on the manchester, england undercard on saturday, jack rafferty retained his british and commonwealth junior welterweight weight titles against challenger reece macmillan. rafferty bossed the fight from the start and wore down his opponent with some textbook boxing. the macmillan corner threw in the towel and referee mark bates waved off the contest after 1.37 of the seventh round.

                                    queensberry / dazn partnership yields main events for cacace and taylor
                                











	queensberry promotions, the boxing promotion company founded by hall of fame promoter frank warren, has revealed three shows for its spring schedule with dazn. on may 10th at the motorpoint arena in nottingham, england, anthony cacace (23-1, 8kos) will defend his ibo 130-pound championship against local hero and former featherweight champion leigh wood (28-3, 17kos). cacace recently gave up his ibf championship. another nottingham favorite, light heavyweight champion ezra taylor (10-0, 7 kos), will be on the card.

	 

	then later in may in  glasgow, new queensberry signing and former undisputed world junior welterweight champion josh taylor (19-2, 13 kos) makes a move up to welterweight, as he takes on former british champion ekow essuman (21-1, 8kos). also on the card, edinburgh’s lee mcgregor (15-1-1, 11kos) will face fellow scot nathaniel collins (15-0). the queensberry/dazn partnership kicks off on april 5th with a heavyweight triple bill topped by joe joyce vs. dillian whyte.

	 

	this trio of boxing events will be broadcast exclusively on dazn, available to fans globally, as part of dazn’s multi-year media rights deal with queensberry. “we’ve assembled a bumper lineup of cracking fights to celebrate the start of our relationship with dazn,” said queensberry promotions founder and chairman, frank warren.

	 

	“we are starting as we mean to go on and, as you might expect, the heavyweights will play a big, big part in 2025 and beyond. then nottingham is the place to be the following month for a real banger of a fight between anto cacace and leigh wood. it is the sort of domestic blockbuster we will be seeing plenty of across the partnership between queensberry and dazn.

	 

	i am also so much looking forward to returning to scotland with the nation’s biggest star and our latest signing, josh taylor, headlining and rebooting his career at welterweight, where i believe he can again do big things, but he will be up against it with ekow essuman in the opposite corner.”l=

	 

	michael ridout, evp new business at dazn, said: “this schedule of fights will showcase the best of boxing talent across weight classes. as the global home of boxing, dazn is committed to bringing the most exciting and nail-biting fights like these to fans around the world who love the sport. this is only the start of dazn’s landmark partnership with queensberry, and we look for forward to delivering more high-calibre bouts, while providing an unparalleled viewing experience.”
