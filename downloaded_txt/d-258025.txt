our cows are extended family we are fully committed to family farming and keep our cow herd below 100 to ensure they get the tender loving care they deserve.  our cows have names, not numbers and get plenty of access to pasture to enjoy a diet of grass-fed goodness while they roam about, in addition to certified organic and non gmo haylage during inclement weather.  our usda certified organic dairy is certified and inspected by north american supply chain food safety (nsf) to ensure the highest quality, as well all our milk is ou kosher certified and inspected.  for these many good reasons we believe our organic grass-fed, unhomogenized, cream at the top milk is best served in a champagne glass:)

unhomogenized milk"the cream always rises to the top"  -so much more than a metaphor!  all of our milk products come from happy, grass fed cows, so why mess with their milk by homogenizing it?  we never do which is why our cream rises to the top.  and why are our cows happy?  they have names instead of numbers and are raised with love on a third generation amish family farm enjoying a mix of regenerative grasses and plenty of room to roam and be social.  while there is debate about the health effects of homogenization, you can rely on the fact that sky top milk is the closest you can get to raw.  our grass fed milk is never homogenized and only gently kettle pasteurized, as we believe this locks in more of the nutrients and great taste derived from the grass fed goodness.  don't be alarmed, just enjoy the cream first or shake it up -have it your way, but enjoy the creamy, rich taste.  currently, the following products are available, and stay tuned for exciting new ones coming soon! 















































































































































































super eggswe truly believe we are what we eat, so we make sure you and your family enjoy only the best tasting artisan organic eggs.  our hens are non-gmo and have never been fed animal fats or hormones and only enjoy 100% grains, most of which are milled right on the farm.  they are given a protected space to roam, roost and, nest, and raised with care in a natural and healthy environment.  our hens have a cage free way of living and are given access to outdoor air and sunlight, besides natural light in their barns whenever the weather forces them indoors.  we believe our happy hens make super eggs!

q.) why grass fed cows?a.) research shows the added health benefits of grass fed milk.  think about it -are people healthier eating grain all day or greens?  we believe our milk is healthiest when it comes from grass fed cows.q.) how do you treat your cows?a.) we like to say, happy cows make happy milk!  our cows have plenty of room to roam and are known by names not numbers.  we keep our heard well under 100 so there's plenty of fresh grass for them to enjoy and hay during inclement weather.  our family business includes our cows in the family and goes above and beyond even organic standards. q.) what does "unhomogenized" mean?a.) since we want to keep our product as close to raw as we can, we have opted out of the homogenization process, which changes the size of the fat molecules in milk and, some studies show, can be harmful to our health.   as such as they say, "the cream rises to the top" -as it should be enjoyed.q.) is your milk pasteurized?a.) under federal law, all milk must be pasteurized to be sold unless bought right at the farm in certain states.  unlike conventional organic milk products in the marketplace that uses ultra pasteurisation or htst at sky top farms we aim to maintain the integrity, health benefits and great flavour of our grass fed milk.  we do this by using kettle pasteurization which gently warms up the milk in a kettle just enough to reach the minimum required temperature thus keeping more of the enzymes and great flavour intact.  we feel its as close as it gets to  raw!q.) why is the shelf life of your milk shorter than other organic milks on the shelf?a.) many organic and conventional milk on the market have along shelf life (up to 90-180 days or longer!) because they are "ultra-pasteurized," which means they are heated at an extremely high temperature.  this allows milk companies to distribute across a wide market, but we feel this compromises the taste and nutritional value.  sky top farms aims to keep our milk fresh, local, unadulterated, grass fed and as healthful as possible.  as such we kettle pasteurize our milk just long and warm enough to knock out any harmful bacteria, and short enough to lock in the nutrients and flavor.  we produce in small batches and turn it around fast so what you enjoy just came off the farm in a matter of a few days, not weeks of months.q.) are your dairy products safe for people with wheat and gluten allergies?a.) absolutely.  our milk is 100% pure, no fillers or additives.
