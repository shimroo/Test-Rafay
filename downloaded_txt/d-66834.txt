welcome to

hello folks and welcome to our web site. we hope you enjoy your online stroll through our “neck of the woods” better known as “god’s country.”
our operation is twofold:  we are a boat and motor fishing lodge on lac la croix and we also offer canoe trips into minnesota’s bwcaw and ontario’s quetico provincial park.  if you don’t see a package that suits your needs, you can rest assured we will provide one for you.
