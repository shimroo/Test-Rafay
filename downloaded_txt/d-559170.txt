what makes the country school different?







why pre-k through 8?
researchers have found that students in pre-k to 8 schools achieved higher gpas and elevated scores on standardized tests, especially in math. they also found that pk through 8 students participate more in extracurricular activities, show greater leadership skills, and are less likely to be bullied.learn more about pk-8 advantages.













strong bodies, strong minds
our physical education program is skill based and designed to build confidence, cooperation, but most of all, to be fun! in the lower school we use games and exercises to build coordination, trust, sharing, and sportsmanship. upper school students may participate in our no-cut interscholastic sports program when they reach sixth grade. click to visit our athletics department.













helping others, helping ourselves
each student is a part of a year-long service learning project in our community starting in kindergarten. from visiting with elderly neighbors to cleaning up our local waterways, students learn how their individual contributions can make a difference and, often, form lasting relationships with local non-profit organizations.visit our community service initiatives.













values
our values are honesty, respect, responsibility, compassion, generosity, commitment, cooperation, fairness, and moral courage. these aren’t just words. they shape our interactions as a community on the playground, in the hallways, on the sports fields, and in the classroom. each month, our entire school focuses on a different value. see our values in action.
