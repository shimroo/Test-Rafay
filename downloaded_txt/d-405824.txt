if you are planning a vacation on tybee island my beach house vacation rentals and lauren would be the way to do it! we have vacationed on tybee several times however this was without a doubt the best vacation home we ever rented. from spectacular views, cleanliness, proximity to shopping and restaurants cannot be beat! special thank you to lauren for allowing us to stay at her beautiful condo.

it was one of the best times that i have had in a very long time. the house was clean just the right size for 5 ladies. close enough to the beach. i loved to go out to the patio and just pray and listen to the waves. i slept well, very enjoyable. about  the only issue i would say and maybe not an issue was dish soap for the dishes because we cooked. so again it was awesome thank you for your hospitality.

love, love, love the outdoor shower!



						april 11, 2024					



a beautiful, unique gem walking distance to a beautiful beach! we loved staying at this home. we walked to the beach every single day! it’s less populated than the stretch of beach adjacent to the pier. there’s a grocery store 7 minutes (walk) away, and restaurants are about a 12-15 minute walk away. my kids swam in the pool every afternoon/evening after the beach and it was such a nice luxury!! love love the outdoor shower (we fought over it) and the poolside bathroom with sauna! lauren texted proactively about weather and a water outage (didn’t impact our stay, but was very thoughtful). our beds were comfy and our showers were hot!









everything you imagine in a beach house



						april 2, 2024					



the cottage was everything you imagine about a coastal beach house. the eclectic charm, the amenities, and the location were a dream. we started our mornings on the screened in porch, walked to restaurants along the beach, and ended our evenings by the pool. the cottage had everything we needed for the most perfect family vacation.









10/10 will be staying again



						january 17, 2024					



this place was perfect. a great space, and lauren was incredibly helpful and prompt with responses for any questions we had. 10/10 will be staying again.









wonderful



						february 23, 2023					



lauren was wonderful. the view from the deck was lovely. we enjoyed walking the beach and spending time in the lovely home. lauren anticipated our every need the home was exceptional well stocked. we travel a lot and usually find an array of old used and useless pots and pans. we loved the quality cookware. thank you.

#1 healthiest beach in america
- health magazine








a barrier island about 18 miles east of savannah, low-key tybee boasts a 3-mile stretch of beach that our judges labeled “magnificent,” complete with gorgeous water. “the beaches here rarely have water-quality problems,” says panelist and water-quality expert nancy stoner, who is very picky about where she dips a toe in.
exercise is a way of life on tybee. there are sunrise yoga classes on north beach, and biking is the preferred mode of transportation. “you can leave your car parked and bike just about anywhere on the tiny island,” says judge elizabeth joy, md, a family-and-sports-medicine physician. and if you forget your gear, just rent a ride from one of the bike shops—trailer bikes for the kiddies and roller skates are available, too.
the island also has the least expensive lodgings, on average, of all the towns on our list. and its eateries serve up an abundance of good-for-you fare like fish tacos, salads, and veggie-filled sandwiches. “the restaurants serve simple, heart-healthy dishes,” says judge ruth frechman, rd, a spokeswoman for the american dietetic association.
tybee offers something for everyone—and thats why it tops our list of healthy summer escapes.

what’s up with social distancing on tybee














while the city of savannah recently issued an emergency order mandating that masks be worn in public, no such emergency order is in effect on tybee island.  the city does not require masks be worn, but individual businesses on tybee may require a mask to enter their buildings.
our beaches are open at this time. coolers, chairs and umbrellas are permitted. we encourage everyone to follow recommended guidelines for safety and social distancing while visiting our beaches, businesses and city facilities.
