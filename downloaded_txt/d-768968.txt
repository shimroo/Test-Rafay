what happens if you die right now? (sunday homily)





 lent begins in two and a half weeks. for the next three sundays, you and i will hear from saint paul’s first letter to the corinthians, from chapter 15, where he talks about resurrection.this is a great transition to lent.let’s recall what we believe as catholics.at the moment our life in this world comes to an end, you and i will immediately face christ as our judge.we call this the “particular judgment.”and in that moment, christ will weigh our faith: did we respond to his grace? did we obey his commands? did we repent of our sins and turn to him for mercy?and then, one of two things will happen.if you or i die without god’s friendship, having rejected his grace; refused to change, or, perhaps gave mere lip service, then what? remember what he said: “not everyone who cries, ‘lord, lord!’ will enter the kingdom.” and they will say, “but look what we did in your name!” and jesus will say, ‘depart from me! i never knew you!’”so, if that’s where any of us are in that moment before christ, then we will go to hell, precisely because we refused the grace and the conversion of our lives that would prepare us for heaven. on the other hand, if we “die in god’s grace and friendship,”as the catechism states it (paragraph 1030), then we enter into heaven. but at that point, you and i may need some further brushing-up, so that we are truly ready for heaven. this is what purgatory is.if you and i make this life a time of conversion, of breaking bad habits, of self-denial, we will not need much from purgatory.here’s a prayer that you may want to pray each day:“lord, send me here my purgatory.” the point saint paul wants to make is simple:do not make the mistake of thinking this life is all there is.you and i are meant to live forever.moreover, our bodies are not just something we throw away or leave behind. we will have our bodies back in the resurrection.so lent is coming, and we have a few weeks to gear up.since i mentioned purgatory, that’s a good way to understand lent: you and i are seeking our purgatory here and now.our sacrifices, penances and extra prayers are tools, in service of what lent truly is about:conversion. change of heart. change of life. getting ready for heaven.the origin of lent is that it was a time of intense preparation for those who were going to be baptized at easter – and that is why they fasted, and prayed intensely, and examined their lives so closely.and for those of us who have been baptized,lent is our time to re-embrace our baptism.so, notice: at easter you will be asked to renew those vows.it's not a mere ritual; it’s a very solemn moment.so, lent is near. it’s time to get ready.you should have seen by now we will have a eucharist-focused mission in two weeks, leading into lent. it will also be a lead-in to an opportunity for all of us to focus particularly on the holy eucharist during lent. there will be many opportunities for prayer and reflection.i want to issue everyone in the parish a challenge:let’s make this the best lent you’ve ever had.i’m asking that we all unite in that desire – and help each other make it happen.here’s some simple but serious homework:first: now is the time to think about your plan for lent.and, second, i ask everyone to begin praying that this lent will indeed be a powerful time of conversion for our parish family. pray for yourself, your family, and for each other. let’s pray for our st. john paul family to experience conversion.

five easy ways *everyone* can answer god's call (sunday homily)





 i bet this has happened to you.you put new lights – brighter lights – into your kitchen, and then, you look and grimace: hmm, that floor doesn’t look so good! or, it’s the bathroom, and you look in the mirror! hmm, not so good!that’s when you turn down the lights!something like that – yet far more transcendent – happened to isaiah in the first reading, to paul in the second reading, and to peter in the gospel. the intense reality of who god is illuminated for them the disturbing reality of their own lives.isaiah said: "woe is me, i am doomed!paul said, “i am not fit to be called an apostle,because i persecuted the church of god.”peter said, "depart from me, lord, for i am a sinful man."now, perhaps you can think of a moment when you experienced something like this. i recall being on an airplane and it suddenly went very bouncy-bouncy, and i intensely wished i’d gone to confession.my prayer was something like isaiah’s.but please notice, however disturbing this experience is, it is a mercy – it is a grace!would it have been better had isaiah not woken up?would paul have been better off not converting?notice also, in each case, this searing of their consciences preceded isaiah, paul or peter being sent with a mission.please remember this whenever someone asks you to pitch in or take on a project.you might want to answer, no, ask someone else.but what god really wanted to hear was isaiah’s, “send me!”there are a lot of individual tasks that make up our faith-family.we all rely on people to organize different things.by the way: sometimes people notice a change, and ask, why did that change? why did that go away? often the answer is, we need help to organize it.and there really is something for everyone to do.the overall mission is clear. you and i are witnesses of jesus.we are his messengers.being sinful and weak doesn’t disqualify isaiah, paul or peter.but they all needed conversion.and for everyone who wonders, when will someone revive things?don’t wait for someone else. answer like isaiah: “send me!”how do you do that? how is that accessible to absolutely everyone?i’m going to give you five things everyone can do.first: everyone listening to me can pray.if you and i reach the kingdom, we’re going to be stunned by how much tired, persevering prayer held this world together like spiritual duct tape.prayer doesn’t have to take hours of our day.start each day with the morning offering.if you drive to work, turn off the radio and pray the rosary or divine mercy chaplet.you’ll be a more patient driver, i prophesy!pause periodically – just for 10 seconds! – and remember god.second, everyone can say, “i believe in jesus!”our little children can say that. our oldest, tired-est parishioners can say that.you don’t have to be a theologian. but it is our lives that make our words credible.that leads to third: like peter, paul and isaiah: seek conversion.ask, and god will light up what needs to change.fourth and fifth:the early christians won their world by their love.they were generous and forgiving.everyone can give something. and everyone, sooner or later, faces the choice to forgive.that’s what it is: not a feeling but a choice:to let go of that wrong and give that to god.imagine how paul felt to be embraced by the christians he tried to kill!what if they had refused?so, there you have it: five ways everyone can answer the call.pray. and say. convert. give. and forgive.

the light of the world (presentation homily)





 today’s feast is celebrated every year, but it only falls on sunday every once in a while. the formal name is the “presentation of the lord”;another name is “candlemas,” because of the candles of course.but why candles?on one level it’s kind of obvious: jesus comes to the temple, and he is the light of the world.but let’s you and i drill down on that, shall we?when jesus was born, he looked like any other baby.when the apostles met him, they encountered a man like them.jesus ate and drank, he worked and got tired and had to rest.then, on one occasion, jesus took peter, james and john up a mountain, and he was, quote, “transfigured” before their eyes.the gospels say that he was brilliantly bright.the apostles fell to the ground; maybe the sight scorched their eyes?in other words, in that moment,they saw, as much as human eyes could see, what it really means to say jesus is “the light of the world.” you and i don’t dare stare at the sun – it sears our eyes.and yet jesus, our lord, is vastly more luminous,more full of power and fire!all the suns and stars and galaxies are but a little candle next to him!when we say, “a light for revelation” came into the temple…realize how intense and awesome that light truly was!if the sun in our sky could somehow enter this church,maybe that gives a sense of it.but consider what happened in the temple that day.god chose not to give that kind of sign.instead, it was the eyes of faith – mary and joseph, simeon and anna – that saw the infinite light of jesus.and that’s how it works for you and me.this is as good a time as any to remind you that it’s time to make our own commitments to the catholic ministries appeal.by now you should have gotten a mailing about it. you know the projects it pays for:caring for our retired priests;caring for the poor and needy;supporting a catholic presence in prisons, hospitals and colleges;supporting our seminary and our vocations programs, and more.there are cards and envelopes in the pews, if you need one.your pledge, like one candle, may not seem like much,but united to christ and all our candles, it is a bright light!there’s something else here, and it has to do with jesus’ priesthood.the first reading describes the lord coming to purify the temple, and to offer a pure, all-powerful sacrifice worthy of god.this is a foreshadowing of what would happen on good friday;and what is made present in every single mass.it is not too strong to say that right here, right now, we are there.every single mass, you and i are there, with jesus, offering himself as the lamb of god.so: are you and i like most people in that temple that day,ho-hum, nothing special?or, are do we see as simeon and anna, recognizing the lord is here?i know, you might be frustrated because you try, yet with kids and diaper bags and the cares of daily life,  it seems impossible to do more than to “get through” mass.if that’s you; if you’re harried and hassled, my word for you is this:just be here and trust him.his light is here, and he will shine on you, in you, and it’ll happen.not in a day; not on our timetable; but in his time.present yourself to the lord and let him accept that offering.but you’ll be a glorious saint one day. he’ll do it, not you.or, maybe you’re here, and you think, boring!i don’t like this music; this homily is no good!i don’t like the people sitting around me…my answer is: you’re right: everything is awful!twelve years ago, i made a trip to the holy land.and i was able to offer holy mass at calvary! at the empty tomb!as far as mass goes, on this side of heaven, that’s as good as it gets.still, you know what? people were coming and going, it was crowded and often rushed.before you know it, we had to move on to the next stop.i will never forget that trip to the holy land, and yet:right here, right now, it’s every bit as real and holy,because the light of the world, jesus our high priest,comes here at every single mass and fills this temple with his glory.and whether that light fills the temple of your life is up to you.

jesus' liberation (sunday homily)





 jesus chose this gospel passage to announce: he is the messiah.that’s what he did in that synagogue that day.people were waiting for something like this.it must have been an electric moment.notice what jesus identifies as the heart of the gospel:liberation. redemption. freedom.but what does that mean?he is not speaking primarily about political freedom.jesus never organized a demonstration or circulated a petition.political freedom and activism are very worthwhile – but they were not jesus’s starting point. jesus focused on changing lives.if you are poor, what counts as good news?maybe having that threat of no heat, no water, no home, go away?a week’s groceries is good news.even better news is that you aren’t treated as “less than”; that you are treated with dignity; you matter.would it shock you to hear that there are people who don’t come to saint henry or our lady of good hope or saint mary, because they aren’t sure they’ll be welcome?they don’t know if their clothes are nice enough.they aren’t sure they know anyone who is here. so if you want to bear “good tidings,” think about people who may not feel welcome in “our” circle – and change that.who are the “captives” to set free? lots of people.what about folks who need alcohol – too much?or people hooked on food? or sports, or work? how about addiction to the internet? either to the latest news or gossip or outrage on facebook and twitter;or to dark materials on websitesyou don’t want anyone else to know you look at.how do we get free from these addictions?only jesus christ can set us free.only he can give you and me the strong enough “want to,” to be willing to change what needs to be changed, to confess our sins without holding back,and be willing to ask another human being to help.alcoholics anonymous originated something called the twelve steps. and the first step goes like this:“we admitted to ourselves that we were powerless over alcohol – that our lives had become unmanageable.”people in aa recite that, and the rest of the twelve steps, to one another in regular meetings.a lot of people are captive precisely because they aren’t ready to take that first step. how does this work?the obvious starting place is the sacrament of confession.after that is looking for people we trust who we can talk to.jesus wants to set people free. he asks you and me to be the face of that liberation;to be the hands that help lift people out of the prisons of their shame.i am convinced that lots of people – here, listening to me right now –could experience that freedom, if only they are willing to open up to another human being and say,“i need help. i’m addicted to…” fill in the blank.“and i need a partner to hold me accountable and help me get free.”how does this work?well, we have about four hours of confessions each week.we priests are happy to meet you there.but after that, the task is for each and every one of us.are you ready for a friend or family member to come to you?ready to say, i’ll listen; i won’t judge or reject you?i’ll keep my ears wide open and mouth tight shut?twelve-step groups are all around for alcohol.for people dealing with drug and pornography addiction, there are meetings around dayton and cincinnati,along with online resources.these twelve step resources are one tool to help,along with prayer, confession and christian fellowship.there are things we can do to be set free – if you are ready.in the first reading, when ezra was reading god’s word to his people, they were crying! why did they cry?because they realized how far they were, in their lives, from what god had for them.but remember what nehemiah said: “do not be saddened: because rejoicing in the lord must be your strength.”jesus coming to be with us, to bring us complete forgiveness, and to give us the holy spirit to strengthen us – that is our joy. sadness? because we’ve missed out? because of what enslaves us and others? absolutely.but replace that sorrow for sin with rejoicing for mercy!christ forgives! christ liberates! christ is with us to set us free!

catholic ministry appeal (sunday homily)





 as you know, this time of year we revisit the catholic ministries appeal. and archbishop schnurr prepares a homily and sends it out, with the option of playing an audio.the archbishop leaves it up to the priests whether to play the audio or not. my preference is to take his message and present it in my own homily. all the good parts that follow are from the archbishop! if you don’t like anything that follows this introduction, that’s my fault!salvation history tells the story of god’s unfailing love for us. from the first moment of creation, with his loving, outstretched hand, god began to put order into the chaos of nothingness. after the heavens and earth came into being and were filled with the manifold wonders of creation, god paused. he looked at what he had made and saw that it was very good. man and woman, created in god’s own image and likeness, stand at the pinnacle of creation, and it is to man and woman that god entrusted the care of all he had made. even after the fall, when all hope for mankind and the world seemed lost, god did not abandon his creation. rather, he began, little by little, to guide it back to himself, to restore what had been lost by sin. god’s greatest desire is that we should all experience the same fullness of life and love which was his gift to mankind at the beginning of time. looking toward the coming of jesus as messiah, isaiah proclaims, as we hear today, “the lord delights in you.” he has made us for himself, and as the bridegroom gives everything for his bride, so does god give everything to us. he delights in us and wants us to have all that is necessary for our salvation. furthermore, god has made us stewards of all his creation, and he calls us to use everything at our disposal for the good of others – thereby sharing in his work of redemption. saint paul points out, each of us has something to contribute. the holy spirit, poured into our souls at baptism and strengthened and sealed by the grace of confirmation, nurtures the gifts and talents which god entrusted to us from the first moment of our conception. the holy spirit enables those talents to bear fruit. the gifts god gives us are meant to benefit one another. you and i need each other. this is the sign that is the church: jesus did not merely create an individual relationship with each of us; he created his body on earth, and calls us to be part of him.a temptation exists to think that my contribution may not be significant, that i don’t really have much of a role to play within the seemingly limitless expanse of god’s work of redemption. but you and i really know that isn’t true. it’s an excuse. as you see at wedding feast at cana, god gives abundantly. but notice: you and i have to be willing to cooperate. maybe jesus would have granted the gift of wine without mary coming to him – but that’s not how it happened. you and i have to be ready to cooperate. so the connection to the catholic ministries appeal is obvious. every donation to this annual archdiocesan collection supports various parts of god’s work of redemption which none of us can accomplish on our own. the ministries supported by the cma assist the most vulnerable, including the hungry, sick, imprisoned, the hospitalized and the marginalized members of society.the funds raised through the cma provide for the formation of seminarians, our future priests, who make god present to us through the sacraments. they also support our retired priests who continue to minister to the people of god in this archdiocese and beyond.archbishop schnurr thanks you for your support for the catholic ministry appeal, and so do i. our family of parishes has been very generous over the years,and with your help again, we can continue to combine our small, personal contributions together to make a big difference together.

jesus stands with you (baptism of the lord homily)





today we recall when jesus showed up on the banks of the jordan river and asked to be baptized.we might wonder, first: why did he do this, and second, why is this important to us? what does it mean?john was baptizing people as an act of repentance. they were confessing their sins along the way.so: they were, in a sense, going to confession.the shocker is to see the lord jesus get in that line.jesus puts himself squarely with us, in our situation. he does not hesitate at all.this is also about jesus showing himself as the new adam.the first adam rebelled and failed to keep god’s law, and that set the whole, sorry story of human history in motion. here, jesus does the exact opposite.this adam is obedient. he fully does his father’s will. and, most astounding, jesus accepts the punishment for sin that otherwise was due to adam and the rest of us.so, when jesus came to be baptized, he accepted his vocation as the faithful son, the new adam, the messiah.so, notice this: jesus never says, there’s no need to change.jesus never offers a path bypassing the cross.now: what does this have to do with you and me?when you and i were baptized, we became one with jesus.so, the question is, will you respond to god as jesus did?will you embrace the life you have been given?will you take up the cross? will you be a witness to jesus?maybe you never gave much thought to your baptism. think about it now. at a certain point, each of us must decide to make the commitment of baptism our own. so, in case it wasn’t clear, this is why i sprinkled you with holy water. and, in case you never realized it, when we recite the creed in a moment, you and i are confirming our baptism.something else happens when we are baptized.saint paul said we become “heirs of hope of eternal life.”when paul calls us “heirs,” that is no metaphor.children not only inherit all the stuff their parents owned, they inherit all that their parents are.when children are conceived and born, what do people say? “you have your mother’s eyes!”“you look just like your daddy!”and as we grow to adulthood, like it or not, we become a lot like them.so, to be “heirs” with jesus, means that when the father said, "you are my beloved son; with you i am well pleased,”he didn’t only say it to jesus. he said it to you and me, too!that’s what the father said – of you – when you were baptized.it is what he says every time you and i go to confession.each of us has moments of doubt.maybe you are single and wondering, what does god have for me?are you called to be a priest or in religious life?or you are marriedand you despair of ever being a good enough parent. every mistake is always on your mind.perhaps you are a young person, and you hate being asked, “what are you going to do with your life?” because you have no clue!in recent years, many people have been “coming out” and saying, “i’m gay,” or “i’m trans” and the like. so many of us don’t know how to react. there is a much broader problem: more and more people simply do not know who they are. many, many people don’t know what it means to be a child of god.and by that, i mean, a god who relates to us and acts in our lives and wants you and me to know him.a lot of the anger and alienation in our society is a product of this:that people who were created to be loved, are starved for love.sooner or later, each of us will meet a family member or friend who says he or she can’t relate comfortably with the opposite sex.some, who are say they don’t know if they are male or female.don’t dismiss them. don’t mock them! walk with them. and tell them:jesus got in line with you! he takes up your cross with you!the holy spirit wants to come down on you!you and i cannot resolve all the confusion of our times.but we can remind people: you are a child of god.
