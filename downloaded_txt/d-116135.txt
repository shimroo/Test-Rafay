discover new & pre-owned bikes in reading – shop in-store or online!

our vast range of bicycles includes but is not limited to:








electric bikes.
an electric bike (or ebike) allows you to pedal less and cycle further, providing you with the assistance you need to climb hills and ride through the wind. indeed, if you are searching for a method of transport for a commute to work, an electric hybrid bike is a fantastic choice. providing you with both exercise and providing you with electric assistance so you can get there quicker with less sweat. additionally, electric bikes are fantastic choices for those who are less able such as those suffering from injuries or the elderly; an electric bicycle could provide you with the boost you need to start cycling again.







mountain bikes.
you can browse through a wide range of mountain bikes for trail riding, cross country, downhill, and endure. we stock two main types of mountain bikes, full suspension (also known as full sus) and hardtail. the difference between the two different types of mountain bike is that a full sus bike has suspension at the rear of the bike, whereas hardtail only has suspension at the front of the bike. the disadvantage of full sus is that whilst it can take the hardest of courses in its stride, it can reduce the efficiency of pedalling as the force can get ‘lost’ in the rear suspension.







road bikes.
you can browse through a range of different road bikes including performance road bikes, comfort bikes for riding distance, triathlon bikes, and track bikes.
this style of bicycle features drop handle bars and can be used for a variety of different tasks from keeping fit to riding on a racing track or cyclo-cross.







children's bikes.
we stock every type of bike to guide a child through their development in cycling. we also stock specialist learner bikes to help a child develop their co-ordination.when your child feels ready to move onto a stabilised and standard bicycle for children, we have a range of wheel sizes ranging for 12” for small children to 24” as they get older. if you would like assistance with regards to what size bicycle is suitable for your child, get in touch with our friendly team using the information on our contact us page, visit us in-store at our reading bike store, or browse through our information on wheel sizes for a clear guide of the age suitability for each range of bicycle.







leisure and commuting bikes.
if you’re searching for a bike to use for a commute or for leisure, we recommend a hybrid bike. these bicycles combine different features of mountain and road bikes to provide a multi-purpose bicycle. as such, they can make riding on the road less exhausting, which is useful for commuting, however many hybrid bicycles are also suitable for riding on dirt roads or tow paths, which also makes them a great choice for those searching for a casual riding bike.







folding bikes.
another fantastic choice of bicycle for commuters, the folding bike provides quality and performance in a small bicycle, indeed some of which can be small enough to fit in a rucksack!







pre-loved bikes.
many of our customers choose to upgrade their bicycles and sell their old bike back to us. when this happens, we give the pre-owned bicycle a full service and check over the bike before making it available for purchase at a reduced price.
indeed, a well maintained bike will last a lifetime, so if you’re searching for a quality bike at a lower price, browse through our range of second-hand bikes.
