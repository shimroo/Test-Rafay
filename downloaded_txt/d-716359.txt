“wandered into this wonderful little french cafe, right in the heart of greenpoint, brooklyn, while awaiting my bike repair. really neat place, they even have whicker chairs! and also, a back yard area. great comfort food, great service, great atmosphere—i’ll be back for brunch. gotta try the french toast! and the owner personally bakes all the cookies!!!”— google reviewer, mark
