the village of bergen, just a short drive from rochester and batavia, has a strong connection with its past, a clear eye toward its future and a deep sense of place. with its many victorian homes, historic downtown, and sidewalks canopied by old-growth trees, people choose bergen because they want the kind of life and values that characterize america's small towns.
