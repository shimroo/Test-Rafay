    our story
 earl & mabel weaver founded weaver markets in 1962 to provide their local community a quality grocery experience and to provide jobs for their community. strengthening our community has always been our goal and we have been blessed to be able to do this by assisting many non-profit organizations. the initial grocery store located in reinholds, pennsylvania opened for business back on november 15, 1962. today we have expanded to a larger grocery store near adamstown to continue providing for our community.

    continuing to grow

currently, our customers can shop at the 96,000 square foot adamstown store. this store includes 23 aisles of groceries, a snack bar-restaurant, and a banquet facility, which can seat up to 350 people. it is also home to the wagon, which offers low-priced quick, and convenient meals to the community during spring, summer, and fall. to help support our local school district, the wagon also donates 25% of its revenue every wednesday to a different cocalico high school sport, department, club, or scholarship.

  i am back in pa for a week and i had to stop by weavers. i remember this place growing up and doing almost all of my shopping here. i would love the lunch specials. hot dogs, chips, and a drink or pulled pork bbq. also, they would have the chicken special. man crazy how much this place has not changed. it brings back so many memories and the prices are amazing. if you love pa dutch food then this is the place for you.
