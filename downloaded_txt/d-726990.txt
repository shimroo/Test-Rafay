no matter what the future holds, our students will be ready for it.




		tomorrow will be faster-paced, more connected, and more interdependent than ever before. our students will need to be ready to carry the world forward in ways we’ve never experienced and can’t even imagine.
at hammond, we help them prepare for what’s next by encouraging their curiosity, developing empathy and a global outlook, and building the confidence they need to lead us onward.
ready to move ahead?

ahead of the curve 
and the chord, the brushstroke, the high note, and the monologue. hammond’s extensive arts programs encompass band, choral music, dance, theatre, and visual arts. our upper school drama department has performed at the renowned edinburgh fringe festival and our select ensemble has sung at the vatican. 













ahead of the times
our students can’t be ready for what’s next without access to the very best of today. our early technology week introduces students to the problem solvers and innovators who propelled humankind forward. and our innovation center – equipped with a scidome, a 450-gallon saltwater tank, and a 3d printer – provides students with a space to create and innovate on their own.













ahead of the competition
skyhawks play for more than trophies. in our athletic program, students tackle adversity, learn the value of teamwork, and become noble competitors. our athlete-scholars (from 5th grade up) compete in interscholastic sports and then advance to statewide individual and team sports competing in the south carolina independent school association.













thinking ahead is about more than getting ahead
our students get that. the spirit of service and community building runs deep at hammond. every year students participate in school-wide service projects this year we held a miracle network dance marathon to raise money for our local children’s hospital.
