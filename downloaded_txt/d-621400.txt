						“if you aren’t familiar with tgs - the children’s theatre of new jersey, you should be. the growing stage is for children young and old.” 					





broadwayworld.com 






						“tgs,the state's best children's theater.”					





nj.com/the star-ledger 






						“i knew my children would have a great experience. watching my daughter dance in her chair and listening to my son ask questions throughout the show, reinforced my belief that this is a hidden gem in new jersey.”
					





mommyuniversitynj.com 






						“there aren't many opportunities where both adults and kids can build something remarkable and beautiful. bravo to tgs for teaching children of all ages how to grow."					





nj.com/the star-ledger 






						“tgs is a special theatre in many ways. however, the theatre's dedication to new play development is rare and unique—unparalleled anywhere else in the country.”
