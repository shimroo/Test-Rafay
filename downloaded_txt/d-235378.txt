under pressure from trump, uva ends gender-affirming care for patients under 19


andrew allard ’25 and kelly wu ’27
february 12, 2025





on friday, january 31, uva health announced that they would no longer offer gender-affirming care for patients under nineteen years of age. an faq on the uva health children’s website states that “uva health continues to offer screening, counseling, general medical, and behavioral and mental health care,” but they will no longer provide hormone therapy drugs or puberty blockers for transgender youth. along with the faq, uva provided the following explanation: “like many health systems across the country, the university of virginia and uva health are working to analyze and interpret the federal order and related state guidance . . . to ensure we are always delivering care in accordance with the law and without potentially jeopardizing federal funding that is critical to uva health’s daily clinical and research operations.”

uva health attributed the decision to a recent executive order from the trump administration and related guidance from the virginia attorney general, jason miyares. the order also prompted vcu medical center in richmond to suspend its provision of gender-affirming care for transgender youth.president trump’s order directs agencies to “take appropriate steps to ensure that institutions receiving federal research or education grants end” their provision of gender-affirming care. researchers seeking funding from the national institutes of health (nih) are currently facing increased scrutiny for mentions of transgender, genderfluid, nonbinary, or other gender minorities. mr. trump also ordered agencies to take action to rescind or amend federal policies on gender-affirming care. the trump administration has issued other orders targeting transgender americans in recent weeks, including one banning trans women from women’s sports and another barring people from updating their sex designation on their passports. two days after the trump administration issued its executive order, virginia attorney general jason miyares sent a memo to uva and vcu advising them to “end immediately” their provision of gender-affirming care. “any institution that continues,” miyares wrote, “unacceptably and unjustifiably endangers not only itself and the commonwealth, but also the vulnerable children of this commonwealth.”speaking at a panel hosted by the virginia law review online, uva law professor craig konnoth, who specializes in health and civil rights, harshly criticized the university’s decision to comply with the order, saying that it was “not only groundless but illegal to do so.”“there have been competing agency interpretations over the last few years as to whether federal law prohibits gender identity discrimination,” said konnoth. “but the fact is, after loper bright, we don’t care what the agency says. we care what the courts say,” said konnoth, referring to the supreme court’s overturning of chevron, which required courts to defer to agencies’ interpretations of ambiguous laws.professor konnoth noted that the fourth circuit has “said very clearly section 1557 of the affordable care act and title ix . . . by prohibiting discrimination based on sex also prohibit discrimination based on gender identity.” professor konnoth suggested that parents damaged by uva health’s refusal of gender-affirming care could thus sue under the aca and title ix.konnoth also pointed out that virginia state law prohibits discrimination based on gender identity, referring to the virginia human rights act. “these institutions will also be in violation of those statutes.” professor konnoth also suggested that terminating gender-affirming care to patients mid-treatment may violate medical malpractice laws and laws prohibiting patient abandonment.despite capturing the attention of media and legal commentators, trump’s executive order did not come as a total surprise. last november, speaking at a panel on united states v. skrmetti, a pending supreme court case on the constitutionality of tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors, uva law professor wyatt rolla ’13 predicted that the incoming trump administration might attempt to restrict the availability of gender-affirming care. “we have a presidential administration coming in that has announced its intent to attempt to prohibit medicaid funding” and other federal funds for gender-affirming care, said rolla.the impact of uva and vcu’s suspension of gender-affirming care services may be felt especially strongly in the south. as professor rolla noted in november, virginia is “the only state in the south to provide this care.”as reported by wvir, the decision by uva health prompted protestors to descend on the hospital just hours after the change was announced. in a joint statement, uva medical school organization trans outreach and qmd, a group of lgbtq+ medical students, also criticized the decision, writing that “gender-affirming care for transgender and gender-diverse youth consists of measures that lead to marked improvement in youth’s mental health.” a lawsuit, filed by the american association of physicians for human rights inc.,  lgbtq+ advocacy groups, and transgender youth against trump and the department of health and human services, is already underway over the january 28 executive order banning gender-affirming medical care to those under nineteen years old. in their initial complaint, the plaintiffs assert that the order was an unconstitutional use of executive power, explaining trump “does not have unilateral power to withhold federal funds that have been previously authorized by congress and signed into law.” additionally, plaintiffs are seeking relief for a violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment. the results of this lawsuit, along with others filed by the american civil liberties union, will address pivotal questions not only for uva health but for transgender individuals nationwide about the state of gender-affirming care.---tya2us@virginia.edu gcu2vn@virginia.edu

vlr and lambda host symposium on status of transgender medicine


virginia law weekly
february 12, 2025





emily becker '27, jason vanger '27 staff editors garrett coleman '25 executive editor beginning on thursday evening, february 6, and extending through the next day, virginia law review online and lambda law alliance co-sponsored a symposium entitled “justice in transition: the legal, cultural, and political frontiers of gender-affirmative care.” the event featured over a dozen speakers who weighed in on the history of transgender medical interventions and the increasingly popular bans on gender-affirming care. courtney douglas ’25, editor-in-chief of vlr, began the symposium by observing how topical it became. as the supreme court decides skrmetti, several states continue to ban gender-affirming care for minors, and president trump issues more executive orders on transgender issues, this year’s symposium felt particularly timely. professor noa ben-asher of st. john’s university school of law, framed the symposium around six questions: what is the legal doctrine? what is the role of the legal academy? what alternatives are there to resist? how do we respond to the medical discourse? how do we simultaneously address the moral condemnation? how do we collaborate? historian dr. jules gill-peterson was the keynote speaker for the symposium. she is an associate professor in the history department of johns hopkins university. her address was largely centered around providing a timeline for the legal status of gender-affirming care in the u.s., but with a clear thesis: contemporary bans on this type of medical intervention are novel. gender-affirming care seems to have originated in western europe in the 1920s, particularly in germany. it was slower to arrive in the u.s. because of more conservative clinicians who refused to offer it. but there was no legal concern over the interventions. gill-peterson alluded to a “mayhem theory” that may have dissuaded some doctors, but this never gained traction. the more significant force was hospital boards, many of which did not want to permit gender-affirming care through the 1960s. but at the same time, the ’60s and ’70s saw bureaucratic recognition of some treatments. for example, some welfare recipients had their surgeries covered under the theory that they were disabled, and gender-affirming care would help them secure gainful employment. state funding for these treatments was politicized in the ’70s, however, so access was restricted to those who could pay out of pocket. the next significant decade was the ’90s, during which congress enacted two pieces of impactful legislation. first, the americans with disabilities act excluded transgenderism. and second, anabolic steroids were classified as a class iii drug, limiting access to those who wanted hormone treatments. since then, though, the affordable care act encouraged many states to broaden access and coverage for gender-affirming care. what dr. gill-peterson really wanted to convey was that the legality of these treatments was not questioned until very recently. over lunch on friday, professor ben-asher took questions from representatives of vlr and lambda as well as audience members. they discussed how rhetoric around consent and regret links anti-trans and anti-abortion politics and also drew connections between contemporary anti-trans politics, nazi germany, and the jim crow south. professor ben-asher said that part of the job of a law professor is to “call bullshit” and certainly made good on that promise. following lunch, professors naomi cahn and deborah hellman moderated a panel addressing litigation against gender-affirming care bans. the panelists included harper sedlin, a senior staff attorney at the aclu; d dangaran, the director of gender justice at rights beyond bars; and chloe fife ’22, who recently authored a paper on potential congressional action against state gender-affirming care bans.the tenor of the panel was mostly one of clear-eyed optimism. the moderators invited the panelists to discuss how the current environment is impacting their work, to which mr. sedlin shared his efforts to “embrace an abundance, not scarcity, mindset.” he quipped, we now have enough trans, nonbinary, and intersex attorneys that “we can disagree with each other.” director dangaran added that there is a tendency to say that it has never been this bad—they countered that it almost always has been. this is an uphill battle, whose ever-present sense of urgency has been heightened by the current administration. dangaran pointed out that useful precedents have been built up in recent years, and that courts’ rapid responses in issuing injunctions give them some a sense of hope.in contrast, however, ms. fife, a trans woman, noted that she has relocated outside the country. ms. fife grew up in a conservative community in utah and promised herself that she would never live in that type of fear again. she remains an active participant in the battle for trans rights, but from afar. when asked about her experience as a litigator, she emphasized the need to read trans people back into the constitution. director dangaran proposed looking beyond the constitution for answers. they pointed out that what is happening now out in the world has been happening in prisons for a long time. but while there is a right in prisons to minimally adequate necessary care, no such analogue exists in the free world. director dangaran encouraged litigators to look to federal statutes like the americans with disabilities act as a vehicle to attain such rights. the dsm-5 added a new diagnosis recently: gender dysphoria. director dangaran sees this as an opportunity to make an ada accommodation argument based on gender dysphoria—an idea which they acknowledged as controversial but firmly believes could work.finally, the panelists were in consensus that litigation is not their only tool. director dangaran pointed out that as of now, adults still have access to gender-affirming care, meaning part of the solution could be creating more mutual aid funds. ms. fife stressed the value of acts of solidarity and community building. mr. sedlin noted that he has been pleasantly surprised by how many young people he has spoken with who have been recognized and supported by their communities as their genders. make no mistake, the legal frontier is grim in many ways—but as the panelists discussed, there is hope, both within and beyond litigation. the symposium concluded with a panel on prison and police abolition featuring professors ido katri and lihi yona and attorney a.d. sean lewis. the panelists suggested that abolition involves both a negative component—reducing harm caused by police and prisons—and a positive project constructing alternative ways to maintain safety. the panelists focused on the harms facing transgender women in prison, including isolation, abuse, and insufficient or cruel medical care. the panelists said that trans individuals can conflict with the carceral logic of prisons, which are based around separating men and women.as professors katri and yona are israeli, the panel also discussed the israeli prison system’s treatment of palestinians and the close interaction between israeli and american prison systems. a trans client in israel spoke over zoom to recount her experience in israeli prisons, describing the poor conditions and failures of reform. “the concept of prison belongs in the middle ages,” she said. later, professor katri observed that american students are “in the heart of the empire,” so they can have a big impact internationally, but the panelists also emphasized that students should be strategic given the risks facing them today.professor katri ended the symposium with closing remarks. echoing many of the speakers, he identified what he saw as the “complete failure of gender identity as a legal category” and joked that “this might be the last trans conference.” he described the current pushback against trans rights as part of a broader decline of the present legal order—but he also observed that legal actors can contribute to whatever comes next.---jxu6ad@virginia.edu ejb6zt@virginia.edu nnk2gn@virginia.edu



















professor bayefsky discusses new book: dignity and judicial authority


noah coco ’26
february 12, 2025





on wednesday, february 5, professor rachel bayefsky was joined in purcell reading room by a panel of peers to discuss her recently published book, dignity and judicial authority. this was bayefsky’s first book, marking an impressive milestone in her academic career.following a brief introduction by dean leslie kendrick ’06, bayefsky provided a comprehensive overview of the main themes and arguments of her book. central to her book is an exploration of dignity, an undoubtedly valued yet elusive topic to apply in practice. this is particularly true in the field of law. dignity is often invoked by courts, but these allusions have remained under-examined by scholars and practitioners. in response, bayefsky offered  her own theory of dignity that can be consistently applied across several contemporary legal settings and doctrines.bayefsky conceptualizes dignity as “relational,” emphasizing the actualization of human dignity through social relationships. three elements constitute her theory of relational dignity: respect for people’s status, nondomination, and control over self-presentation. through the notion of respect for people’s status, bayefsky’s theory of dignity embodies principles of nondiscrimination. nondomination broadly refers to autonomy from the arbitrary will of others—with slavery perhaps its most blunt form. control over self-presentation can be as simple as an individual’s control over what pictures are posted of them on the internet and therefore embodies principles of privacy, among other related subjects.bayefsky argued that judges should combat the perception that they should refrain from invoking nebulous conceptions of dignity and instead embrace and operationalize such reasoning. with a foundation for relational dignity theorized, bayefsky proceeded to outline several legal settings through which courts may employ this theory of dignity in practice.bayefsky first discussed incorporating dignity into constitutional standing doctrine. she argued that a robust conception of dignitary harms should satisfy article iii’s case or controversy requirement, one of the constitutional barriers to litigating in federal courts. damage from infringement of an individual’s inherent dignity is not as easily measured as other forms of physical or economic harm, but, bayefsky argued, this has not and should not prevent courts from recognizing dignitary harms as cognizable injuries sufficient for standing purposes. similar considerations animate the next legal setting bayefsky discussed: dignitary torts. conceptions of dignity are not completely foreign to tort law, much like they are not foreign to the law of constitutional standing. for example, offense touch and battery or defamation are existing torts that are, to some degree, founded upon a principle of inherent dignity. by institutionalizing a more comprehensive theory of dignity, bayefsky argued, courts will be better equipped to confront the challenges posed by claims of dignitary harms. moreover, tort law provides a potent mechanism to promulgate a coherent theory of dignity throughout the legal system, as bayefsky noted, because the “ideas about harms and causation [inherent to tort law] affect how we think about law more broadly.”bayefsky then discussed the role of courts in providing remedies to dignitary harms, focusing both on the law of remedies generally, and court-mandated apologies in particular, as legal mechanisms through which courts vindicate victims’ dignity. bayefsky emphasized the potential for the law of remedies to constitute “legitimate judicial activity to restore the status of dignity.” she specifically cited court-mandated apologies or even dicta as possible remedies available to courts to restore victim’s dignity.following bayefsky’s discussion of her book, a panel moderated by professor deborah hellman, director of the center for law & philosophy, provided careful and insightful commentary on bayefsky’s book. the panel was composed of james pfander ’82, professor at northwestern university pritzker school of law; rebecca wexler, professor of law and faculty co-director of the berkeley center for law & technology at the university of california, berkeley school of law; and diego zambrano, professor of law, associate dean for global programs, and faculty director of the neukom center for the rule of law at stanford law school. the panelists lauded bayefsky’s thorough and insightful scholarship. a common theme among the panelists was praise for bayefsky’s mastery of the diverse doctrines explored in her book—from constitutional law and the law of federal courts to tort law and the law of remedies. so, too, though, did each panelist offer a critique or provocation in response to bayefsky’s work.pfander drew attention to pleading and evidentiary concerns implicated by expanded theories of dignitary harm. he expressed concern over the possible innovation of contrived theories of dignitary harms supported by intangible and increasingly untenable evidence. this presents a challenge for courts, which must discern between legitimate cognizable dignitary harms and nonjusticiable ideological injuries for article iii standing purposes, for instance. and, as pfander noted, community standards—proposed by bayefsky as a possible source to inform cognizable dignitary harms—have not always accorded with theories of inherent human dignity. for a poignant historical example of this dilemma, pfander noted one need look no further than the jim crow south. for a contemporary example, he suggested current debates over gender-affirming care demonstrate the same phenomenon.wexler elaborated on a “fascinating flip” she noticed towards the end of bayefsky’s book. despite presenting an otherwise invariably “pro-dignity and pro-judicial authority” account through most of her book, bayefsky nonetheless acknowledged the potential for some judicial remedies for dignitary harms to themselves impose new forms of dignitary harms as punishments. wexler queried whether this was a positive or self-defeating feature of the otherwise dignity-enhancing legal regime bayefsky conceives. she proposed to bayefsky a “cynical sequel” to her recent publication, providing a platform to explore this underbelly of dignity-enhancing legal regimes.zambrano provocatively challenged the project of drawing dignity into the forefront of legal debates at the risk of politicizing the subject and undermining its normative value. as zambrano noted, recognition of dignity is not necessarily an innovation in law—courts already invoke dignity in many contexts. zambrano worried that “making dignity the explicit centerpiece” of legal discourse will weaken its conceptual force. he posed the question whether it is better that dignity go uncontested. moreover, he challenged whether this is the “moment for judicializing more than we already do,” particularly in the current era of a partisan judiciary.the nuance and sophistication of the panel’s remarks served as a testament to bayefsky’s provocative inquiry, a sentiment captured by hellman at the conclusion of the discussion. this article does not do full justice to either bayefsky’s or her panelists’ remarks. fortunately, the event was recorded on video and will eventually be posted online for viewing. curious readers may also engage with bayefsky’s scholarship directly by purchasing the book, available both online and in person at courts and commerce.---cmz4bx@virginia.edu 



















rice ’25 & singleton ’25 receive swanson award


virginia law weekly
february  5, 2025





ashanti jones '26 features editor on thursday, january 23, the law school held its annual martin luther king, jr. day celebration. the event was sponsored by the center for the study of race and law and uva law’s black law student association (blsa). this year, chief justice s. bernard goodwyn ’86 of the supreme court of virginia delivered the keynote address of the event, and for the first time in the award’s history two recipients—laura-louise rice ’25 and shelby singleton ’25—received the gregory h. swanson award.

professor kimberly robinson (col. ’92), the university’s white burkett miller professor of law and public affairs, the karsh bicentennial professor of law, and the director of the center for the study of race and law, opened the event by welcoming guests to the law school and sharing a few words on the mark dr. king has left behind. “he shined a light so bright on the dire plight of african americans and others throughout our nation…” robinson said. “our nation was forced to see and confront the evils of racism, violence, and abuse that african americans and others were enduring each day. he helped to not only catalyze a national movement for civil rights for all people, but he also ushered in law and policy reforms.”after the introduction, robinson welcomed dean leslie kendrick ’06 to present the eighth annual gregory h. swanson award. dean kendrick began by thanking professor robinson for her contributions to the event and chief justice goodwyn for delivering the keynote address. dean kendrick also shared the origins of the swanson award. “gregory swanson was the first black student at the law school, the first black student at the university of virginia, and the first student to study on an integrated basis at any formerly white university in the former confederacy,” dean kendrick said. “this year, 2025, marks the 75th anniversary of [swanson’s] admission and attendance at the law school.” the swanson award was conceptualized in 2018 to recognize gregory swanson’s achievements. swanson was first rejected from the law school’s ll.m. program in 1950 on account of his race. in conjunction with counsel from hill, martin, and robinson and the naacp legal defense and education fund, swanson sued for admission in federal court and won. following her recount of swanson’s history, dean kendrick introduced this year’s recipients of the swanson award, laura louise rice ’25 and shelby singleton ’25[1]. rice, a 2022 graduate of the university of south carolina’s honors college, was recognized for her contributions and service to the law school formerly as the president of the first year council and historian and president of uva’s blsa chapter, and currently as digital editor for the virginia journal of law and technology, student employee in the law school’s admissions office, member of the community fellows program, member of the raven society, and student bar association president. this year, rice was also named a 2024–25 ritter scholar, a designation intended to honor third-year law students that “best exemplify the qualities of honor, character, and integrity.” while presenting rice with her award, dean kendrick remarked on the overarching qualities nominators ascribed to rice that make her a remarkable recipient of the swanson award.“[rice] builds community from the ground up,” dean kendrick said. “she is as brilliant as she is compassionate and kind…she sees her classmates for who they are…she works hard every day to make sure our community is meeting the needs of all of its members, and…her enormous efforts have made her an essential part of our law school community.”in her acceptance speech, rice thanked the university and shared how the legacy she leaves behind at the law school is just a continuation of the legacy her family has placed in her and the legacy of other black students who have walked the halls of virginia law. “as i stand here today, i am an embodiment of the legacies and dreams of my grandparents,” rice said. “i stand here because they stood where they stood. i stand here because gregory swanson had the courage to stand here, because john f. merchant…the first black student to graduate from the law school, had the perseverance to stand here, because elaine jones…as the first black woman to attend uva…made the choice to stand here.”singleton, a 2022 graduate of george washington university, was recognized for her contributions and service to the law school as a senior editorial board member of the virginia journal of social policy and the law, member of the law school’s public service committee, vice president of inclusion for the law christian fellowship, fellow with the law and public service program, member of the community fellows program, volunteer with uva’s branch of the virginia innocence project, member of the law school’s state and local government policy legal clinic and international human rights legal clinic, and member of uva’s blsa chapter. additionally, during her time at the law school, singleton has worked as an intern at the united states department of justice civil rights division and at the naacp legal defense and educational fund.dean kendrick also reflected on statements made by singleton’s nominators that showcased her commitment to the community.“[singleton] demonstrates the kind of outstanding character and conduct that defined mr. swanson,” dean kendrick said. “she shares his deep commitment to justice and unwavering willingness to do the hard work to achieve it. shelby is guided personally and professionally by her sense of right and wrong, by her faith and belief in humanity…shelby is a kind and generous human being, someone others want to be around.” in her acceptance speech, singleton thanked the university and acknowledged the large role god plays in her life as the driving force behind who she is inside and outside of the law school.  “mr. gregory swanson displayed immense courage, perseverance, and integrity throughout his life…it is truly an honor and a humbling experience to be recognized for displaying those same qualities,” singleton said. “i must be honest, being recognized for character and perseverance feels a little awkward because i’m not deserving of this praise. i get my perseverance and strength from jesus…i am just an example of the grace and love of god.” following the presentation of the awards, professor robinson welcomed keynote speaker, chief justice s. bernard goodwyn ’86 of the supreme court of virginia to the podium to deliver his remarks. chief justice goodwyn is the second black chief justice to serve on the supreme court of virginia. chief justice goodwyn was appointed to the supreme court of virginia in 2007 by then-governor tim kaine and has since been re-elected by the general assembly for another term in 2020. previously, chief justice goodwyn was a litigation partner at willcox & savage located in norfolk, virginia, and served as an associate research professor at uva law in civil procedure and civil litigation practice. during his address, chief justice goodwyn discussed how in the present day, the general public tends to regard the civil rights movement as “ancient history,” but in reality, the distance between then and now is much closer. he himself lived through it.“while we now teach about segregation as history, we have to remember it’s history, but not ancient history,” chief justice goodwyn said. “it’s recent history. i remember the civil rights era, and i suspect there are other people in this room who remember it as well. i grew up in the segregated south in the ’60s. i remember driving by ku klux klan meetings. people were on the street in their robes with their weapons walking up and down the street.”chief justice goodwyn also acknowledged how transformative dr. king, jr. was in making the “then” of the civil rights movement into the “now” of the present day, especially in changing the legal underpinnings supporting segregation.“dr. king’s insistence on adhering to nonviolence and his belief in the principles of justice, even in the face of hatred and violence, showed us the power of courage and conviction,” chief justice goodwyn said. “dr. king’s genius lay in the ability to appeal to the law’s higher ideals while challenging its failures.” in closing, the chief justice encouraged everyone to continue the work of dr. king, because while legally enforced segregation is a thing of the past, there are still present threats to equality and equity arising every day. “as we honor the legacy of dr. king, let us recommit ourselves to his noble cause,” chief justice goodwyn said. “let us work tirelessly to build and maintain a nation where the color of one’s skin does not determine their opportunities, their worth, or their place in society. in doing so, not only do we honor the past, but we also secure a brighter future for all americans.”---alj3emz@virginia.edu



[1] as a personal aside, it has truly been an honor to get to know both of these incredible women. i want to thank them both for their incredible mentorship and welcoming presence at this law school. i believe i speak for many black students at uva law when saying ll and shelby have left a lasting impact on our hearts and minds, and as they graduate, we both celebrate all the places they will go and appreciate the contributions they leave behind.  



















midway toast: what’s the point?


virginia law weekly
february  5, 2025





noah coco '26 managing editor i am not one for needless pomp or ritual. it’s not that i am rigidly unsentimental, i just find most ceremonies to be a nuisance. commencements? i’d do away with them. awards ceremonies? get rid of them. verbose introductions to guest speakers? unnecessary. if you have something to celebrate, certainly go out and do so. but celebrate with close friends and family, the ones who will actually enrich your experience and create fond memories. anyway, i digress.with my predisposition against ceremony and ritual in back of mind, though, it may come as no surprise that i only reluctantly and skeptically attended the law school’s annual tradition of the midway toast to the class of 2026 on wednesday, january 29, in caplin pavilion.[1] hosted at the beginning of each 2l class’s spring semester, the midway toast commemorates the halfway point of students’ time at the law school. three semesters completed, three more to go. one summer done, one more remaining. $116,550 of tuition paid, $116,550 left to go.the class of 2026 was served delicious but underwhelming charcuterie boxes complemented, in contrast, with an impressive supply of prosecco served in glass champagne flutes. after several minutes of maneuvering in an attempt to open my box of meats and cheeses without spilling or dropping my drink—i ultimately employed the flute-in-elbow-against-chest technique—several “clinks” pierced the din of small talk and focused everyone’s attention to the front of the room. dean kendrick ’06 proceeded to offer her first midway toast as dean with refreshingly concise and poignant remarks about the significance of what has been accomplished thus far and an enthusiastic charge for what remains. she invoked rich imagery in her remarks, analogizing the midway toast, for instance, to the peak of a scenic hike—the most difficult climb is behind us, but there is plenty more trail remaining. i did not entirely begrudge this moment of the event. in fact, hearing dean kendrick’s remarks—her first to the class of 2026—was my main motivation for attending.[2]wednesday’s midway toast also introduced a new tradition to the annual ceremony: signing the uva law matriculation book. a handbound book constructed with virginia-native materials by a local artisan, yolanda merrill, the matriculation book will preserve the signatures of each member of the class of 2026 and all succeeding classes to memorialize their time spent on grounds and their membership in the law school community. although the ritualistic collective signing of the matriculation book chafed against my general disdain which  i hope is now quite apparent, i was actually intrigued by the sentimental value of the book. all of our time at the law school can be reduced to mere digital records. the matriculation book provides an analog counterpart through which to make a tangible and indelible mark upon this community.despite these silver linings, though, i still do not buy into the utility of hosting an event and inviting law students to spend even more time at the law school to celebrate an unnecessary ceremony. it seems to me to be no more than the half-birthday of the law school experience.[3]but halfway points, much like new years, nonetheless prompt reflection, regardless of whether we celebrate them with ceremony.[4] it is a time to take stock of the successes and failures of the first three semesters, and to recalibrate while there is still time to adjust. there is still much more work to do: completing three more semesters of classes, impressing during summer associate or internship placements, completing required courses and the major writing requirement, applying for clerkships, not to mention passing the bar to cap that all off. but there is also plenty more joy to look forward to, as our remaining time in charlottesville becomes ever more precious as it becomes ever more fleeting. there are restaurants and wineries yet to be explored; there are hiking trails yet to be traversed; in short, there are moments yet to be experienced and memories yet to be forged.for most, law school may be the last opportunity to enjoy such luxuries as winter and spring break or flexible weekly schedules with only a class or two per day. we may never again have such an opportunity to learn from renowned experts and scholars in such a casual and enriching environment. it is not time for us 2ls to despair—leave that to the 3ls—but it is also not time for us to lose focus on the goals still outstanding. just as dean kendrick alluded, there is plenty more trail left to hike. so let’s make the most of it.---cmz4bx@virginia.edu 



[1] and in writing this editorial, i ironically resumed the law weekly’s own tradition of covering this event in our pages, dutifully conforming to the naming convention established by my predecessors. see, e.g., stanley birch ’22 & phil tonseth ’22, midway toast: it’s like drinking together, alone, https://www.lawweekly.org/front-page/2021/2/3/midway-toast-its-like-drinking-together-alone; anna bninski ’23 & mason pazhwak ’23, the midway toast: two writers give hot takes, https://www.lawweekly.org/col/2022/4/20/the-midway-toast-two-writers-give-hot-takes; darius adel ’24 & nikolai morse ’24, the midway toast: two 2ls get sentimental over champagne, https://www.lawweekly.org/col/2023/2/8/the-midway-toast-two-2ls-get-sentimental-over-champagne. class of 2025 wya?[2] also because i could not think of another story to write for this week’s paper.[3] if you are one of those people who love half-birthdays, all the more power to you. just celebrate where celebrations ought to happen: at the bar.[4] yes, i am also suggesting that watching the ball drop on new year’s eve is a waste of my time.

alicia kaufmann '27 staff editor feeling discouraged by firm receptions? were you stuck in a circle last night nodding and awkwardly waiting to word-vomit your narrative? well, you’re in luck. last wednesday, january 29, the public service center hosted a panel just for you: options outside of big law. the panel featured some of our very own uva law students (kyndall walker ’26, cosette vincent ’25, elizabeth gaccione ’26) and was moderated by dawn davison, a director of public service. while this has come at a contentious time for some public service jobs, there was real insight to be gained, and i will now share it with you. you’re welcome. fortunately, all three of the panelist’s summer/post-grad positions are safe from the freeze. kendall will be working with the second look project, cosette at the government accountability office (gao), and elizabeth at earthjustice. when asked about their journeys choosing public service over big law, a common theme emerged–crippling fear of opp emails. we’ve all been there. the red bold text, action items, and deadlines could give anyone a run for (or from) their money. all jokes aside, the panelists echoed that before coming to uva, they knew they wanted to go the public service route. kendall and elizabeth even had specific issues they were passionate about and have now pursued in law school: post-conviction criminal justice reform and environmental advocacy, respectively. kendall and elizabeth explained the process of using equal justice works to secure their public service summer positions. for those like me who had never heard of the program, it is a large career conference, sort of like a national ogi (now, fully virtual), that places law students in public service roles. like big law ogi, you rank organizations and are then chosen for interviews.but finding a niche is hard. and it can be intimidating competing for public service jobs with students that have developed a strong passion for a particular practice area. you may be thinking, “i know i want to do public service and help people through my legal work, but where do i start?”cosette’s journey reminds us that summer positions are a great way to figure out what you like, what you don’t, and what you are interested in. she spent her 1l summer at the social security administration (ssa) litigating on behalf of the federal government and against people trying to receive funds. she realized that litigation was not her thing; she gravitated more towards policy-adjacent work. she used this experience to narrow down her search for 2l summer and was able to find the gao, an agency more tailored to her interests and strengths. so, don’t get discouraged if you don’t know exactly what type of public service work you want to do. take opportunities as they come and follow that gut feeling when you have it.  finances were also a large topic of conversation. kendall recalled her big law friends “comforting” her when she accepted a public service job for her 2l summer, saying things like “we’ll take care of you after our big law summer, don’t worry.” her response to them: “i don’t need you.” there was also some concern from the attendees about the future of public service loan forgiveness (pslf). cosette reassured the audience that it should take more than an executive order to do away with the program. and dawn davison quickly jumped in, explaining that the program helps all public service workers that the “current administration may not want to affect.” for most of us, this is one of the biggest internal dilemmas of law school. at times, it may seem irrational to give up big law salaries and the promise of paying loans off so quickly. but elizabeth calls to mind the benefit of that sacrifice: “it's going to suck working so hard for something that you don’t care much about.” (except for you fedsoc boy #23. don’t worry, i’m sure your passion for merger agreements and sweetgreen wednesdays will sufficiently motivate you.)---hcr9bm@virginia.edu 



















trump inaugurated as 47th president of the united states


virginia law weekly
january 29, 2025





bradley berklich '27 staff editor on monday, january 20, donald j. trump was inaugurated into his second term as president of the united states from inside the capitol rotunda in washington, d.c. brutal windchill forced the ceremony to move inside following projections of a twenty-three degree high temperature during the event. the move shrunk the population of possible attendees from hundreds of thousands to just 2,000, the capacity of the rotunda. attendance was limited to politicians, government officials, family, and donors, with overflow space in emancipation hall. thousands more trump supporters watched a livestream of the ceremony from d.c.’s capital one arena, less than a mile away.










source: associated press 





the ceremony was opened with a speech by chairwoman of the joint congressional committee on inaugural ceremonies, democratic senator amy klobuchar of minnesota. she called for the citizens of america to “view others with a generosity of spirit despite our differences,” and the leaders of america to “stand our ground when we must and find common ground when we can.” vice president j.d. vance and president donald trump were then sworn in by justice kavanaugh and chief justice roberts, respectively. trump appeared not to place his hand on the bibles, a family bible and the lincoln bible held by his wife melania, during the swearing in. trump’s speech painted a shining picture of his new administration and the country, saying “the golden age of america begins right now,” a far more aggressive image of his “america first” policy than his 2017 inauguration speech, which was regarded as depressing. trump made many wide-reaching promises, starting with outlining his intent to sign executive orders “today” to curb illegal immigration by reinstating the “remain in mexico” policy and ending “catch and release” policies, as well as designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. that designation would allow the u.s. to impose economic and financial sanctions, and may have destabilizing effects on mexico, to the extent that the u.s. pursues legal action against them for providing the cartels material support. featured as well were promises to “drill, baby, drill” and export american oil abroad, to end the green new deal and the electric vehicle mandate, to make it official policy that there are “only two genders,” to tax and tariff foreign countries by establishing the “external revenue service,” and to create the department of government efficiency or “doge” to be headed by the world’s richest man, elon musk. vivek ramaswamy, who was slated to helmdoge, has since bowed out.most striking among trump's statements was his intention to retake the panama canal. “we have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made and panama’s promise to us has been broken . . . china is operating the panama canal and we didn’t give it to china, we gave it to panama and we’re taking it back.” trump also briefly mentioned “plant[ing] the stars and stripes on the planet mars,” though  he glossed over it quickly. musk reacted with a double thumbs up. the recent ceasefire deal between israel and hamas initiating the slow release of the hostages, a deal which trump took credit for (despite occurring during the prior administration), received the only universal mid-speech standing ovation, with democrats rising as well.gone unmentioned was trump’s idea of purchasing greenland from denmark, which has circulated recently in the news. nor was the hot-button issue of legal immigration reform through h1-b visas mentioned – a change pushed for by tech moguls, many of whom were in attendance. also unmentioned in the inaugural speech, but touched on later in an address to trump’s supporters in the emancipation hall overflow room, were the events of january 6, 2021. in that later address, trump tacitly stated his intention to pardon the rioters. “i was going to talk about the j6 hostages,” said trump. “but you’ll be happy because, you know, it’s action not words that count. you’re gonna see a lot of action.” trump also indicated that he wanted to talk about president joe biden’s pardons of his son hunter biden,  and thirty-seven death row inmates whose sentences biden commuted, but restrained himself.one of trump’s executive orders signed was that for this inauguration day, and all future inauguration days, that flags should be flown at full mast, a decision seemingly spurred by the death of president jimmy carter on december 29, which, as for the death of any president, requires that flags be flown at half-mast for the following thirty days. even before the order was signed, the flag over the capitol was at full mast. now, states who choose to fly their flags at half-mast for any reason during an inauguration must raise them. it’s unclear at this time how much of trump’s agenda will be realized during his second term, how the mandate granted to him by the results of the 2024 election will affect his priorities and his efficacy, or how much resistance he will face from a shaken and leaderless democratic party. at his farewell address, president biden said, “we’re leaving office. but we’re not leaving the fight.” biden and vice president harris returned to wilmington and los angeles, respectively. trump returned to the white house.---jqr9gh@virginia.edu

trad wives and free speech activists unite: protesting the porn bans


virginia law weekly
january 29, 2025





malia takei '25 guest writer change has swept across the nation this last month, as porn bans have ultimately come into effect throughout the southern united states. the entire south, including the illustrious state of virginia, is now facing black screens instead of our typical pornhub watch lists.this move has resparked fierce debates over the legality of pornography, its impact on children, and even its impact on relationships.in a shocking turn of events, wives across the nation have joined free speech advocates and lgbtq+ rights activists in protesting the government’s recent decisions. their support stems from the far-reaching impacts of this legislation. beyond merely barring access to explicit material, the legislation ultimately has left them with no choice but to associate with their husbands.while sipping a glass of wine, a newly-wed shared her thoughts with this reporter: “i didn’t sign up for this! my husband has . . . needs. and this ban upsets the careful balance of alone time i require for this relationship to succeed!”similar sentiments have been uttered by other wives and girlfriends across the united states. as one anonymous wife commented: “this is an attack on marital harmony. without an option for my husband to engage in *self-care*, he is constantly bothering me.”the ban on pornography has, it seems, freed up a significant amount of time for men across the country. without an outlet for their desires and needs, their attention has been turning to their partners. “now that he’s not watching porn, he’s staring at me like i’m a four-course meal, and i just don’t have the energy for that,” said another wife who preferred to remain anonymous for the sake of her marriage.experts predict that this pornography ban will have the consequence of husbands increasing their attention and participation in the lives of their wives and families. reports are already incoming about the spike in requests for dinner dates, random cuddling, and—heaven forbid—talking. “before the ban, my husband spent all his time holed away in his office with his laptop. now? he’s asking me to provide instructions on helping out in the kitchen or how to clean the house,” one frustrated wife lamented.a premier relationship expert in the uva law community recently published an article on the importance of distance in heterosexual marriages. “ultimately, given the societal pressure to get married and have children, pornography and much needed alone time are really what has kept our divorce rates from skyrocketing,” the expert argued.protests are expected to continue over the next couple of days, as more americans are radicalized. news of the pornography bans has finally reached gen z and the “smut” readers, who have been facing barriers to news after the enactment of the tiktok ban. hashtags like #smutisliterature and #pornwithplot are already trending on x and other social media sites.as one 3l put it, “what’s next—banning acotar or preventing netflix from airing bridgerton for being too smutty?”---mfm4de@virginia.edu 



















clinic to argue straight client's "reverse discrimination" claim before supreme court


virginia law weekly
november 22, 2024





andrew allard '25 editor-in-chief students and faculty at the supreme court litigation clinic are representing a straight client in a title vii “reverse discrimination” claim. the law school announced in early october that the supreme court had agreed to hear the case, ames v. ohio department of youth services.[1] but the clinic’s filings in ames date back to february, suggesting that clinic members have been working on the case for almost nine months. according to uva today, the case involves “a state employee’s sexual orientation discrimination claim.”[2]










source: phil roeder 





the supreme court accepted ames for argument this term alongside another clinic case, cunningham v. cornell university, which involves the employee retirement income security act. securing two cert grants is a milestone for the clinic under its new director, professor xiao wang, who joined the law school last year. the clinic is also collaborating on a third supreme court case, perrtu v. richards, which is being defended by the law school’s appellate litigation clinic.the supreme court litigation clinic had only brought three cases before the high court in the five years before wang became director, most recently arguing jones v. hendrix in 2022. speaking to the law weekly’s hot bench in september 2023, professor wang said that he hoped to change the clinic’s appellate strategy.[3] “i will be trying some creative ways to find more cases for students to work on,” said wang, citing a downturn in the federal government’s appeals and law firm partners who are part of the supreme court bar as possible inroads.but not all students are celebrating the clinic’s newfound success. members of the lambda law alliance at uva (lambda) have questioned the clinic’s decision to take on ms. ames’s reverse discrimination claim. in a statement published to instagram on october 31, lambda criticized the clinic’s decision to pursue a case that could use uva resources to “undermine lgbt+ individuals’ interests and opportunities.” lambda also criticized the clinic’s perceived lack of transparency in its case selection and assignment process, calling for the disclosure of the rubric and “ethos” guiding the clinic’s decisions.responding to an email inquiry on ames and the clinic’s case selection policies, professor sarah shalf ’01, the law school’s director of clinical programs, said that how the clinic selects cases is a “question of academic freedom” and that “case selection is a matter for the faculty member to decide.” professor shalf noted that the supreme court litigation clinic is guided by “several factors” in selecting cases, including the strength of legal arguments and pedagogical benefits.shalf also highlighted the educational benefits of clinics. “uva law’s supreme court litigation clinic is designed to give students the incredible experience of working as appellate lawyers at the highest level of practice,” said shalf, noting that the clinic “represents a variety of clients on a wide swath of issues, covering the breadth of the political spectrum, as well as those with no political valence at all.”shalf emphasized that representing a variety of clients is both an educational benefit and an ethical duty of attorneys. “[t]he supreme court clinic can and should teach students to engage with and advocate for a position or client that may be personally challenging because this is what lawyers do in practice,” she said. professor shalf encouraged students with specific questions about case assignment practices to speak to individual clinic directors for more information.last week, lambda’s president, marissa varnado ’26 met with professor shalf to discuss lambda’s concerns about ames and the clinic’s case selection policies. citing her conversation with shalf, varnado told the law weekly that clinics do not generally consider the impact on students when selecting cases. while shalf reportedly reassured varnado that clinics would consider student impact in “extreme” cases, she did not explain what would count as an extreme case.reflecting on the meeting, varnado reiterated the need for transparency. “our concern is that this will continue to be an issue: the clinic in the dark takes a case that may constrain minority rights, the community finds out about it in a press release, and people continue to question whether they have a place in this community, at this university, or in this field.”for her part, professor shalf expressed openness to continued dialogue about clinic practices. “i appreciate [lambda’s] willingness to share their views about how to improve the clinical experience at the law school. i look forward to ongoing conversations with lambda, and i welcome conversations about clinical programs from any student or group.” still, shalf was careful not to suggest that clinics would be able to respond to all student criticisms, noting that “professional ethics rules prohibit us from having a community-wide discussion of the specific reasoning behind taking [ames] or any other individual case.”professor wang declined to comment, citing ethical and professional obligations. clinic students assigned to the case likewise declined to comment, citing a general direction from clinic instructors to refrain from speaking publicly about ongoing cases. a disclaimer on the clinic’s webpage states: “the positions that the clinic takes on behalf of its clients are independent of the views of the university of virginia or the school of law.” speaking to uva today in october, professor wang said of the case “we think that whatever the test is for discrimination, it should apply equally across groups and across individuals.”[4]the supreme court litigation clinic is no stranger to controversial cases. its recent appeal in jones v. hendrix also prompted criticism. jones addressed the availability of post-conviction relief for criminal defendants whose conduct was later determined to fall outside the scope of the criminal law under which they were convicted. critics noted that recent supreme court opinions had narrowed post-conviction relief, making it likely that the clinic’s appeal would resolve a defendant-friendly 8-4 circuit split unfavorably. the court ultimately ruled against jones, the prisoner.despite the fervor around ames, professor joy milligan, who teaches civil rights and anti-discrimination law at the law school, said that a win for ms. ames in the supreme court may not change the outcome of her case. “i don’t think the structure of the prima facie case is driving outcomes in these cases, whether they involve reverse discrimination claims or traditional discrimination ones,” said professor milligan, referring to the legal issue before the supreme court. “much more important is simply whether the court thinks the plaintiff has made enough of a showing on their ultimate burden of persuasion to reach a jury.” in this case, milligan said ms. ames likely didn’t meet that burden. “[m]y read of the [lower court’s] opinion suggests that both the appellate and trial courts would equally have found that she failed to provide enough evidence to allow a jury to find in her favor, even without the finding on the prima facie case or the extra hurdle that their doctrine theoretically imposes at that stage.”the deadline for briefing in ames is set for february 2025, with oral argument likely to occur shortly thereafter. cunningham, the clinic’s other pending case, is scheduled for argument on january 22. wang is counsel of record in the filings for ames and cunningham, making him the most likely candidate for oral argument. they would be his first-ever oral arguments before the supreme court.---tya2us@virginia.edu

flansburg and takei win 96th annual lile moot court competition


virginia law weekly
november 22, 2024





noah coco '26 managing editor on thursday, november 14, in caplin pavilion, jake flansburg ’25 and malia takei ’25 won the 96th william minor lile moot court tournament. they bested benjamin baldwin ’25 and nathaniel glass ’25, who was awarded the stephen pierre traynor award for best oralist. the two teams competed before a panel of three judges: michael y. scudder, judge for the u.s. court of appeals for the seventh circuit; kevin a. ohlson ’85, chief judge of the u.s. court of appeals for the armed forces; and trevor s. cox, former acting solicitor general of virginia and current litigation partner at hunton andrews kurth in richmond.













the problem argued by the teams concerned the retaliatory treatment of a federal inmate for the exercise of his first amendment rights. while still in prison, the litigant filed a section 1983 claim against the prison warden. when he was subsequently released from prison, he filed a supplemental complaint to reflect his new custodial status. the specific issues addressed in the finals were (1) whether the litigant’s suit was subject to the prison litigation reform act (plra) even though he was no longer incarcerated, and (2) assuming the plra governed the suit, whether the statute’s physical injury requirement applied in a case alleging deprivation of a constitutional right.each competitor had fifteen minutes to present their oral arguments before the judges. takei was the first to present her argument for the appellant on the first issue, followed by baldwin for the appellee. flansburg then presented his argument on the second issue for the appellant, followed by glass for the appellee. the competitors all displayed adept mastery of the issues and exemplary appellate advocacy. “any of [them] would be welcome in the seventh circuit,” remarked judge scudder. takei and flansburg will be honored with a plaque to be hung in slaughter hall, joining the esteemed list of past winners.---cmz4bx@virginia.edu 



















professor konnoth predicts loss for gender-affirming care in skrmetti


virginia law weekly
november 22, 2024





andrew allard '25 editor-in-chief in just two weeks, the supreme court will hear arguments in united states v. skrmetti, a case that could reshape the legal landscape for trans youth across the country. at issue is the constitutionality of tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors. uva law professor craig konnoth, who wrote an amicus brief for a group of experts on gender-affirming care,  says tennessee is likely to win.speaking at a panel hosted by the lambda law alliance at uva last thursday, konnoth predicted that the supreme court would uphold tennessee’s gender-affirming care ban. konnoth said the court would likely hold six-to-three that strict scrutiny doesn’t apply, allowing them to uphold the law under rational basis review. “i think we’re gonna lose,” konnoth said, echoing the sentiment of lgbt lawyers in d.c. whom he informally surveyed. “there were a few people who were optimistic, but a majority of people are pessimistic.” still, konnoth did not expect a sweeping ruling that would settle the constitutionality of discrimination based on gender identity. “i do think that biological differences will be invoked to help narrow the scope of the ruling,” said konnoth. that would prevent the court from reaching the more controversial issue of the fourteenth amendment’s prohibition on sex discrimination. in 2020, the court held in bostock v. clayton county that title vii’s protections against sex discrimination extended to gender identity. since bostock, whether the same logic extends to the fourteenth amendment has been a hotly contested question.wyatt rolla ’13, the aclu of virginia's senior transgender rights attorney and a lecturer at the law school, emphasized that any loss in skrmetti would be “catastrophic.” rolla added that gender-affirming care providers are already under pressure. “providers in virginia are completely overwhelmed. . . . people are traveling from florida, they’re traveling from arkansas. we’re the only state in the south to provide this care.”despite professor konnoth’s grim outlook, both he and rolla highlighted weaknesses in tennessee’s legal arguments. “there’s some pretty damning evidence of what the legislature intended in passing that law,” said rolla, arguing that the law could even fail under the highly deferential rational basis review because it appeared to be motivated by animus. and professor konnoth highlighted the united states’ argument that the tennessee law is overt sex discrimination. “you say sex right there in the statute. there’s no two ways about it. you’ve discriminated based on sex.”as uva hospital pediatrician dr. julia taylor noted, tennessee’s law does not prohibit gender-affirming care for patients whose gender identity comports with their sex assigned at birth. gender-affirming care for cisgender individuals is widely practiced, dr. taylor explained. “gynecomastia in young men, the reduction of breast tissue, is a surgical operation that is offered to cisgender individuals almost without question. hormonal therapy is used often, usually in cisgender females . . . with a menstrual-related problem that doesn’t match with their peers,” said dr. taylor. professor konnoth added that gender-affirming care for cisgender individuals numerically outnumbers similar treatment for transgender individuals.regardless of the court’s decision in skrmetti, trump’s recent electoral victory may have already handed tennessee a win. rolla noted that the supreme court granted certiorari at the request of the united states, not the transgender plaintiff. “there’s no uncertainty about what the position of the department of justice will be after trump takes office,” said rolla. with trump’s inauguration scheduled in late january, the department of justice may be positioned to seek a withdrawal from the case before the court has issued its opinion. that could lead to a “wonky procedural legal question,” rolla explained.the incoming trump administration may also adopt new regulations or sign laws that restrict the availability of gender-affirming care nationally. rolla said that president trump could enact a national restriction modeled on the hyde amendment that would restrict the use of federal funds for gender-affirming care. an even more draconian option, pulling federal funding for private healthcare providers that offer gender-affirming care, has also been proposed.“we already saw the budget riders in 2024 that tried to do that. so this is not a hypothetical fringe strategy. it is a real policy proposal,” said rolla. dr. taylor added that restrictions on federal funding could cause a national collapse in gender-affirming care for trans youth and adults. “if you pull medicare funding, large hospitals may fold,” said dr. taylor.while the effect on trans youth will be most immediately felt, a win for tennessee in skrmetti could reach beyond gender-affirming care. “it’s not just trans people,” said rolla. “it is the ability to make medical decisions about your body, about your family structure. the kinds of scaffolding they are building will impact people far beyond trans youth.”---tya2us@virginia.edu 



















revisiting iqbal: racial discrimination, plausibility standards, and the lost humanity


virginia law weekly
november 22, 2024





kelly wu '27 staff editor on november 15, the national lawyers guild hosted a discussion on the landmark case ashcroft v. iqbal. the discussion focused on its implications in the legal field and the distanced way it is spoken about in 1l civil procedure. the event explored the complexities of the case, its aftermath, and the broader consequences for legal practice.participants reflected on how iqbal is taught in law school, with many recalling frustration over the lack of focus on the case’s factual details. instead, the case is often presented through a procedural lens, leaving out the real-world injustice of racial profiling and abuse following the 9/11 attacks. some professors do cover the facts more thoroughly, but the case’s emphasis on legal theory creates a disconnect for many students.speakers referenced the lost story of iqbal by shirin sinnar to highlight how the case overlooked critical facts of racial discrimination. despite some factual concessions, the court denied discovery, raising concerns about the racial and ethnic dimensions of the case. while some participants were not shocked by the racial profiling involved, they were surprised by the court’s failure to address these issues. the iqbal decision’s impact is felt throughout any form of litigation, particularly the “plausibility” standard it announced that makes it harder for plaintiffs to even reach the discovery phase in litigation. this new threshold disproportionately harms marginalized communities by setting a high bar for proving claims, particularly in racial and ethnic discrimination cases. attendees spoke of the disconnect the case had and the confusion caused by the “plausibility” standard. the group also compared iqbal to other cases, such as walmart v. dukes and deshaney v. winnebago, noting a trend in the courts that limits access to justice for those challenging systemic discrimination. the event concluded with a call for rethinking how the legal system addresses iqbal and the significant barriers to justice it created. the event particularly noted the need for a more human, factual lens for procedural cases in law school.---guj9fn@virginia.edu 



















panel speaks on reproductive justice in wake of trump win


virginia law weekly
november 13, 2024





alicia kaufmann '27 staff editor on thursday, november 7, two days after the election, if/when/how and the american constitution society (“acs”) hosted a panel on “reproductive justice and the 2024 election.” the panel featured professor anne coughlin, professor naomi cahn, and federal policy counsel sanchi khare from the center for reproductive rights. 






























from left: professor naomi cahn, sanchi khare, professor anne coughlin source: uva, linkedin khare kicked off the panel with a quick introduction to her work. the center for reproductive rights is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that “uses the power of law to advance reproductive rights as fundamental human rights around the world.”[1] as federal policy counsel, khare describes her work as “heavy legal thinking” dedicated to ensuring reproductive rights “legislation [will] withstand judicial review.” before working for the center, khare clerked for the senate judiciary committee and now-supreme court justice ketanji brown jackson when she was at the u.s. district court for the district of columbia. professor coughlin then gave an overview of her experience working on reproductive justice issues. along with teaching the feminist jurisprudence course (available in spring 2025), she is also the co-director of uva’s sound justice lab, which highlights “the lives of people that law tends to exclude or marginalize.” she and professor cahn are also jointly teaching reproductive rights and justice during the j-term from january 13 to 16. professor cahn also expounded on her background in reproductive justice, which began straight out of college when she got a job at the national abortion rights action league checking for bombs in the mailroom. both professors have devoted their academic careers to researching the intersection of reproductive and feminist issues and the law. after introductions, the conversation shifted to how these reproductive issues will be “addressed” in the new administration. during the election, seven out of the ten states that had abortion initiatives on the ballot passed them, enshrining abortion rights in their state constitutions. however, it is still unclear which party will win a majority in the house of representatives. with gains in the senate and trump’s presidential victory, republicans could potentially control all three branches of government. even if the gop does not gain control of the house, however, the panelists explained the myriad ways the federal government would be able to restrict access to abortion and reproductive health care. addressing a national abortion ban, khare said that she is not as worried about this as other measures. “the filibuster would prevent a national ban,” khare reassured. the filibuster is a senate procedure that allows members to prolong debate on a bill. sixty members have to vote in favor of “cloture” to end a filibuster. senate republicans have not been outspoken about getting rid of the filibuster, and there are two pro-choice republicans, susan collins (r-me) and lisa murkowski (r-ak), so senate democrats should be able to impede a national ban. khare, however, is concerned about republicans using the budget reconciliation process to circumvent the filibuster. reconciliation bills aim to align spending, revenue, and debt with budget targets and get expedited consideration in the senate—there is no ability to delay using the filibuster. senate republicans may use this strategy to redirect funds away from facilities or jurisdictions that provide abortion care. the panelists argued that an executive administrative ban is more likely than larger legislative measures. for example, agencies may revive a restrictive interpretation of the comstock act to criminalize mailing abortion medication across state lines. states can get around this by manufacturing the pills entirely within the state, but this would require extensive funding. another tactic may be limiting title x, or government-funded family planning through the department of health & human services. khare says it is extremely likely for trump to institute a “global gag rule” as soon as he assumes office, or conditioning receipt of title x funds for foreign ngos on not counseling or advising on abortion access. professor cahn added that a “domestic gag rule” is also possible. similarly, executive agencies can divert funds to crisis pregnancy centers (cpcs) or limit medicaid funding so providers cannot advise on abortion.a question from the audience then prompted a discussion on how to have conversations on this topic with people who have opposing viewpoints. khare expressed that sharing personal stories is important for showing people the negative effects of limiting abortion access. the center recently released a documentary film, zurawski v. texas, which follows litigation between women denied abortions during life-threatening emergencies and the state of texas. professor coughlin noted that the stories highlighted in the film are informative for those who may not recognize the consequences of current abortion bans. it is important to continue creating spaces like this panel that allow for conversation about reproductive justice and how to combat restrictions over the next four years. while it may seem hopeless, khare’s, professor coughlin’s, and professor cahn’s careers underscore how many people are working tirelessly to address these issues.---hcr9bm@virginia.edu

forget trump. read your state's election code.


virginia law weekly
november 13, 2024





emily becker '27 staff editor the election is over. now what? the race of a century may have reached a resounding conclusion, but as we saw post-2016 and 2020, the presidential election will undoubtedly spur a burst of local political involvement in the many off-year elections that remain. in 2023, twenty-nine major cities held mayoral elections.[1] we have town council, state judiciary, sheriff, and state attorney general battles to focus on. in my hometown, for example, the school board elections are more hotly contested and socially divisive than the mayoral race. headline cases tend to revolve around the presidential election: president-elect trump’s sixty-two lawsuits in the wake of his 2020 loss, rfk jr.’s battle to remove himself from michigan ballots, the doj voter purge case in virginia. but election procedures impact all elections, and all elections have the potential to generate litigation. in fact, local elections stand to generate a particularly interesting set of cases, seeing as they may not always be subject to federal election rules. the virginia doj voter purge case, for instance, arose out of national voter registration act (nvra) claims. the nvra only applies to federal elections, though.[2] states have a great deal of discretion in defining election rules and enforcement. with a supreme court that places a great premium on states’ rights, upcoming local election litigation may face some serious obstacles in proving any unconstitutionality, thus potentially constraining such litigation to sub-constitutional questions governed by local statutes.a recent case out of texas can teach us a little about what we may expect in the upcoming election “off” years. in november 2022, loving county, texas held its election for county and district clerk, justice of the peace, and county commissioner. the justice of the peace candidates tied with thirty-nine votes each, and the clerk and commissioner victors received forty-six and twelve votes, respectively. for all intents and purposes, this was a strong turnout: 72.48 percent of registered voters.[3] so, yes, loving county is incredibly small (the smallest county in texas),[4] and it is perhaps a dramatic example. but because the margins in question were so thin, the lawsuit[5] that arose out of the election led to a strikingly thorough consideration of granular evidence by the court, since a ruling on a dozen voters’ eligibility could (and in fact did) cause the court to order a new election. in august 2024, the losing candidates from the 2022 election filed a lawsuit against the victors alleging both voting by ineligible voters and disenfranchisement of eligible voters. the trial court ruled that ten votes had been cast illegally and subtracted them from the totals. only one of the candidates, the district and county clerk, had won by more than ten votes, resulting in the court’s ordering a new election for justice of the peace and county commissioner. both the unsuccessful candidates and the victors appealed, with the plaintiffs reiterating claims of illegal voting and disenfranchisement, and the defendants alleging unconstitutionality of the texas election code’s residency requirements. the appellate court affirmed the trial court’s finding of ten illegal votes, predicated upon the texas election code’s residency requirements. the court declined to consider the defendant’s constitutional challenges, choosing instead to resolve the dispute under other unchallenged provisions of the election code—a decision vehemently protested by the dissent. the court did, however, deviate from the trial court in finding merit in the plaintiffs’ disenfranchisement claim. two voters had moved to loving county in the months preceding the election. they had each registered according to standard texas procedure, though they ultimately realized they were left off the local voter roll when they tried to vote. one of the individuals attempted to vote early. instead of being given a normal ballot, he was given what texas refers to as a limited ballot, which allowed him to vote only in those elections for which he would have been eligible had he retained his residence in the county where he lived prior. as a result, he was not allowed to vote in the three contested loving county elections. the second individual attempted to vote on election day and was given a provisional ballot with the three local elections struck through, amounting to a makeshift limited ballot. the appellate court ruled that these properly registered voters had been improperly barred from voting. since the county clerk candidate had only won by twelve votes, the court ordered a new election. limited ballots appear to be a texas idiosyncrasy, according to my research. they are designed to allow people to vote in the statewide elections in their prior county of residence if they will not be registered in their new county in time.[6] what happened in this case, however, was that limited ballots were improperly used for registered voters whose names simply had not been added to voter rolls. limited ballots are not even supposed to be used on election day. it took almost two years for this error to come to light, and for a blatant violation of the election code to be adjudicated. there is certainly a debate to be had over the merits of the limited ballot rule. on the one hand, it could incentivize those people who might not want to vote because they moved near in time to the election, to vote. on the other hand, it could discourage people from getting involved in local politics, since they would neither vote in the local elections in their prior county nor in their new county. what is clear from this case, though, is that idiosyncratic rules like this one have the potential to do substantial or even irreparable harm to election results. of course, this case was extreme because of the incredibly low population. but is it so hard to imagine a couple of larger precincts using a similar methodology? is it so difficult to think that other states may have equally esoteric election codes that lead to comparable errors? virginia’s smallest county has a population of 2,339.[7] is it so far-fetched to think that something akin to the loving county case could play out there? i think not.---ejb6zt@virginia.edu

intruder koi relocated

bradley berlich '27 staff editor a big koi fish found swimming around the fountain in spies garden has been relocated. “learned fin,” as some students have called him, was moved to dell pond at main grounds in october, according to gregory streit, the law school’s assistant dean for building services. “[it was] the most humane action for the animal” and “standard protocol” for foreign fish, streit told this reporter over email. “the law school's fountains are exactly that... fountains. they are not aquariums.”streit says he hopes this will be the last time that someone deposits an alien fish into the fountain, but “[he] doubt[s] it will be, unfortunately.” north grounds maintenance officials suspect that the fish was placed there sometime after april when the fountain received a cleaning. according to law librarian benjamin doherty’s 2020 post on the law library blog, fish have previously been kept in the pond, but this ceased as it became too difficult to relocate them for the winter.[1]regardless, learned fin’s presence was short and sweet. he will be remembered in the hearts of all he touched.---jqr9gh@virginia.edu

christmas comes early for youngkin with surprise scotus win


virginia law weekly
november 11, 2024





emily becker '27 staff editor 










source: kjetil ree 2007 





in the sleepy days of early august, virginia governor glenn youngkin set in motion what would become a seminal pair of lawsuits, ultimately leading to a striking, if opaque, supreme court decision. governor youngkin issued executive order no. 35 on august 7, 2024, exactly 90 days before the november election. the five-page order laid out the state’s election integrity initiatives—including ballot machine testing, 24/7 drop box monitoring, and retention periods for paper ballots—and boasted of virginia’s recent data-sharing agreements with seven other states.skimming the order, it could read as fairly innocuous until page four, which instructs the state to remove ineligible voters on a daily basis, including those who no longer qualify for state residence, deceased voters, individuals with felony records, those who have been deemed mentally incapacitated, and most notably, those individuals whose citizenship is unverified in dmv records. individuals who fell into this last category were to be notified of their removal and given fourteen days to prove their citizenship in order to be reinstated. the governor further instructed registrars to share the names of these individuals with state prosecutors. according to the order, 6,303 individuals had already been removed from voter rolls between january 2022 and july 2024 under this procedure. virginia attorney general jason miyares publicly lauded the removals the same day the order was issued, posting on x that he was “proud of my office’s work to help ensure election integrity.”[1]states have significant autonomy in determining their election procedures but still must comply with federal law. section 8(c)(2) of the national voter registration act (“nvra”) designates the 90 days preceding an election as a quiet period during which states are prohibited from executing any programs whose purpose is to systematically remove ineligible voters from registration lists.[2] executive order no. 35, which was issued on the first day of the quiet period, potentially violated the nvra in its instruction that the state continue to remove registered voters whose citizenship was in question. court records confirm that the removal program did in fact continue well into the quiet period, as stated by virginia department of elections commissioner susan beals in a september 19, 2024 letter to governor youngkin.[3]on october 7, two months after the executive order was issued, the virginia coalition for immigrant rights, which is a coalition of over forty community organizations, joined with two other nonprofits to sue commissioner beals, attorney general miyares, and other election officials, alleging that the removal of possible noncitizens from voter rolls violated multiple provisions of the nvra.[4] in addition to alleging violation of section 8(c)(2) of the nvra, plaintiffs claimed that the state had violated the nvra’s uniformity and nondiscrimination in registration requirements, contending that the removal program disproportionately targeted naturalized citizens and thus by proxy targeted voters based on their national origin. plaintiffs further alleged that commissioner beals’ refusal to provide plaintiffs with a list of voters who had been identified as noncitizens within a reasonable amount of time violated the nvra’s public disclosure requirements.[5]  the department of justice rapidly followed suit, filing a complaint against the commonwealth of virginia, the virginia state board of elections, and commissioner beals on october 11, though it was more narrowly tailored, alleging only violations of section 8(c)(2) of the nvra. the two cases were consolidated, with the nonprofits’ case becoming the lead and all plaintiffs filing for preliminary injunctions stopping what had been dubbed the purge program. the eastern district of virginia held a hearing, during which the defendant stated on the record that 1,600 registrants had been removed under the purge program within the quiet period as of october 2.[6] thus, the defendants did not dispute the removal of registrants under the purge program, nor did they strongly dispute the program’s systematic nature. instead, they argued that the nvra’s quiet period provision did not apply to registrants who were ineligible to vote at the time of their registration. the court soundly rejected this argument. to this writer, even if the court had accepted the defense’s argument, it would still not account for those registrants whose latest dmv paperwork indicated that they were not citizens but had since naturalized and subsequently registered to vote, meaning that they would have still been protected from removal under the defendant’s interpretation. the defendants conceded on the record that the removal process involved no individualized inquiry beyond database searches, meaning that should there be a discrepancy between a registrant’s dmv records and their actual citizenship status, the state would not know this, and thus be unable to know whether it was removing someone who, under its own argument, was protected by the nvra.  the court issued a preliminary injunction, to be in effect through the general election, ordering the state to reinstate all registrants who had been removed under the purge program within the quiet period,[7] submit a report of every removed voter to the court under seal, and undertake outreach and education measures related to the reinstatement. the fourth circuit affirmed the order on appeal, except for one of the lower court’s education and outreach requirements. here is where the great twist arose: the supreme court, without explanation, agreed to hear the state’s emergency appeal, reversed the fourth circuit’s decision, and struck the preliminary injunction. all those voters who were purged would either have to (1) remain purged, (2) prove their citizenship to become reinstated, if they were within the 14-day grace period, or (3) register and submit a provisional ballot[8] on election day.[9] it remains unknown as to whether those purged voters successfully re-registered and voted. this writer would not think it unreasonable to be concerned about the possible precarity of provisional ballots, in light of the current climate of litigiousness when it comes to election procedures. mail-in ballots and early voting are already the source of significant litigation across the country. it does not seem to be a stretch to expect provisional ballots to be vulnerable to erosion by litigation, in particular after the supreme court’s surprising ruling.to conclude with a brief word on the broader implications of this case, it is worth noting that eight amicus briefs were submitted to the supreme court within two days. only one of these briefs advocated for a denial of the stay: that of the former members of congress. the brief was signed by seventeen former republican members of congress, two of whom were from virginia and a number of whom had voted for the nvra. what of the other seven amici? they all vociferously urged the court to grant the stay, which begs the question, where were the rest of the plaintiffs’ supporters? perhaps the bedrock liberal institutions expected this to be an easy win. even so, where were the scrappy nonprofits, the law students looking to make a name for themselves, the academics? the state of kansas marshaled the signatures of twenty-five other attorneys general in support of its brief advocating a stay of the injunction. among the signatories was the alabama attorney general, whose state’s voter purge policy was blocked by a preliminary injunction and was not appealed to the supreme court.[10] the attorney general of florida was another signatory—a similar case arose in florida in 2014[11] and was cited in the fourth circuit’s opinion.[12] in the wake of this decision, there will likely be a spotlight on nvra cases like this one. activists, attorneys, scholars, and students will jump in and get involved—as they should. but what about the next curveball? who is reading the circuit dockets, looking for the next case like this one, the proverbial “upset” in the all-too-serious game of election litigation? next time, who will the amici be?---ejb6zt@virginia.edu

andrew allard '25 & noah coco '26 editor-in-chief managing editor last week, the public interest law association held its annual live and silent auctions. a favorite event in the law school community, the pila auction gives students who are on the brink of a mental breakdown a brief respite from finals season doom. students are invited to support their fellow public interest classmates, dress up, drink up, bid on auction items, and dance. sadly, many questionable rumors have been spreading about this year’s auction, so the law weekly has put its finest reporters to the work of separating pila fact from pila fiction. claim: proceeds from the pila auction go directly to supporting public interest law students so they can afford summer expenses and pursue fulfilling careers.false. proceeds from the pila auction ensure that public interest law students can eat something besides their casebooks. in prior years, the pila auction has raised as much as $20,000, which is a little more than what a summer associate makes for one month of lunching and day drinking. claim: the law weekly’s donation—a highly-coveted viewing of the infamous retracted edition—was the highest-selling item at the silent auction on friday night.partially true. the viewing of the retracted edition sold for a modest $10 million, making it the highest-selling item at both the silent auction and the live auction. claim: competitive law students enjoy the thrill of out-bidding their classmates.partially true. the day after the auction, winners generally experience buyer’s remorse when they wake up with a headache and an email saying that they owe $100 for a kroger coupon booklet. claim: pila is grateful to all law school organizations for their generous contributions which make the auction a success.false. pila is deeply disappointed, but not surprised, that the best contribution your organization could muster was a $20 gift card to chipotle.  claim: last year, after uva law exceeded its $400 million fundraising goal, the law school foundation promptly reduced summer grants for public interest law students.false. no wait, shit. this one is true. claim: the federalist society at uva was asked to donate to this year’s pila auction but declined.false. fedsoc donated an auction item for the first time in over ten years. fedsoc had been banned from participating in the pila auction ever since its 2012 donation, a clerkship for justice clarence thomas, caused a stampede at the silent auction, resulting in severe injuries and multiple lawsuits. claim: big-ticket items at the live auction included a hunting trip with meg bryce, a copy of professor frampton’s new folk lp, a cooking class with professors frost & clarens, and a “get-out-of-the-bar-exam” pass.false. only the last one is real. claim: the pila auction is made possible with the generous support of the darden school of business, which allows pila to rent out the forum hotel’s event space for the evening at cost.false. the forum hotel charged pila at 200% of the market rate. claim: the american constitution society, the law school’s champion for progressive legal advocacy, generously donated a big-ticket item.false. acs did not donate to the auction because its membership venn diagram with pila is nearly a circle. claim: the forum hotel generously raised drink prices to provide an additional source of revenue for pila.false. the forum hotel raised drink prices and pocketed the extra sales revenue. claim: pila asked lambda to host halloqueen on thursday, breaking with prior years’ practice, to avoid forcing students to choose between two of the fall semester’s most memorable evenings.false. pila merely wishes to establish its dominance over the christmas holiday and welcome in the season with the first of many mariah carey sing-alongs. claim: the law firms that sponsored the pila auction will think less of you if you worked a public interest job for your 1l summer.partially true. the sponsoring law firms will think much less of you if you worked a public interest job for your 1l summer. claim: executive editor garrett coleman ’25 spilled white wine all over the bathroom floor at the forum.partially true. it was red, actually. claim: more students would have attended the silent auction if there had been an open bar.false. more students would have attended the silent auction if they were not all hungover from halloqueen. claim: professor xiao wang generously donated a chance to beat him in a tennis match.false. the winner of this auction item does not have a chance in hell. claim: this is one of the worst articles written about the pila auction since 1948.[redacted]---tya2us@virginia.edu, cmz4bx@virginia.edu



















weekly slaughter tribute poems


virginia law weekly
november 11, 2024





last week, we announced the winning poems submitted to the slaughter stairs tribute contest. but many honorable mentions remain! we publish them here in honor of the slaughter stairs—slaughtered, but not forgotten. from a 1l who never knew slaughter stairs thomas murphy ’27 how to know a stair n'er stepped? you dream it in your hours slept you feel its hole when squeezing through its stand-in's doors and stairs askew  i once was told 'bout hallways wide with light to bring the sky inside but now i step into the dark where long lost wahoos once did lark.  perhaps one day again we'll find a staircase open as law's mind til then i climb to slaughter numb and cry - sunt lacrimae rerum!   untitled brad lewinski ’26   consider the spies garden bee. as it flits and buzzes through falling leaves and blooming flowers, it does not consider for a moment its place as an integral cog in a machine it did not design. it knows nothing of the pain of an alex johnson cold call, it fails to understand why the creatures inhabiting oaken furniture instinctually dart away whenever it flies just a little too close.  still, the bee at least understands its purpose. it builds hives because it cannot pollinate every flower alone and serves a queen that will one day meets its end just like the flowers the bee fertilizes and the grass-bound ants it flies above. and still, it will wake and do the same again. one could say it belongs.  consider the human. we wake to a sunrise we cannot control and lay our heads down to sleep in a cruel acceptance that we've failed, once more, to slow the march of time. in our acrimony we set our sights on stairs assisting students just trying to find the very thing that comes so naturally to the bee; our purpose, and decide that if we cannot control the sun, the moon, the tides, or the leaves, at least we can do something about the damn stairs.  would the bee, so engrossed in its tasks, ever decide to destroy the hive? were it to know currency and markets and resource scarcity would it really spend to destroy a thing it won't know it'll miss until it's gone?  but we've got something on the bee. indeed, what the bee will never do is cherish what time has left in its wake. it will never reminisce over a rough exam or offer smarties to those who just might need them. so perhaps, while we accidentally bump shoulders with those on the same (now cramped) staircase as us, we should take these serendipitous collisions as signs to remember the rivers we cannot step into again, the radiant flowers in bloom, and the people we treasure who will soon walk different halls in different offices in different cities.  perhaps, if we do this well, we can stand among the bees and know that we too, belong.    vybz kartel (from the perspective of the slaughter stairs) amelia isaacs ’26  xo xo my love is very special if you want it you can have it but don't take me for granted so much, so much so much things i did not say   untitled anonymous  we cry out in mourning for our beloved stairs taken without warning by student affairs   untitled zoe kiely ’25  where are the stairs now?  this is a fire escape.  r-i-p slaughter.    a ghazal for the slaughter stairs miles cooper ’26  on slaughter stairs we stand no more,  our footsteps fade upon the floor.   we yearn for steps that are no more,  but time has changed what we adore.   the halls we knew we now explore,  without the path we walked before.   they took away what we implore,  to bring back what we had before.   in memories, we will restore,  the slaughter stairs we tread no more.   a lewd limerick miles cooper ’26  at virginia law stood the slaughter stairs, where 1ls would sneak their secret affairs but renovations came through, now there is nowhere to screw, {creativity ran out here}   untitled paige harris ’27  as a 1l, i am in hell not because of readings or section drama but because of the stairs that fell  although i never walked them i can only imagine the hush of my friends and i gossiping on the stairwell as we see my law school crush  maybe it’s good they are no more because if steps could talk of reputation, 2 and 3ls would be poor  without the stairs, i feel i’ve been robbed a key part of campus… us news won’t even give us a nod  you can slaughter the stairs and slaughter my grades but one thing you will never take are the memories of better walkways   thank you to all who submitted and a special thanks to malia takei '25, elizabeth patten '25, and micah stewart '25 for organizing this contest. may the slaughter stairs rest in peace. 



















professor barzun holds info session on j.d.-m.a. in legal history


virginia law weekly
november 11, 2024





jason vanger '27 staff editor professor charles barzun ’05 held an information session on wednesday, october 30, to discuss the joint j.d.-m.a. program in legal history. in the program, students earn a j.d. at the law school together with an m.a. from the history department in the graduate school of arts and sciences. professor barzun is the director of the program as well as a graduate.the program is unique among joint degree programs at virginia law and elsewhere in that it imposes no additional time or financial burden on law students. students earn both degrees in the same three years that it would take to earn a j.d., and students pay the same amount in tuition that they would pay for law school alone. the program accomplishes this by counting a number of classes toward both degrees, including required 1l courses like torts or constitutional law, which have substantial historical content in the form of case law. on top of the regular course load for law students, participants will generally take one additional course in the history department for each semester of their 2l and 3l years.outside of coursework, students are assigned two faculty mentors, one at the law school and one in the history department. they are also required to take part in a research course with history graduate students and write a thesis. professor barzun noted that students in the program have been disproportionately recognized for legal writing among all law students. in the past, the program also required an oral examination, but this is no longer the case. one wrinkle about the program is that because arts and sciences courses are not graded on the same curve as law school courses, they do not count towards a student’s gpa for purposes of the j.d.the j.d.-m.a. program was founded decades ago as a reflection of the law school’s focus on legal history. over time, some of the school’s legal historians have moved elsewhere, but the history department has developed a strength in the field and an interest in maintaining the program. for students today, the joint degree involves a lot of travel between the law school and main grounds.professor barzun said that, nowadays, the program has two main purposes. first, it provides support for students who are interested in legal academia. the m.a. degree itself—unlike a ph.d.—does not necessarily add a significant credential for hiring committees, he said. however, the program supports students in exploring their scholarly interests and preparing a substantial written work, which is beneficial for students applying to academic jobs. second, and more commonly, the program provides an opportunity for students who are interested in history to explore this interest before they leave school for good. the joint degree can allow a broader academic study of law than a typical pre-professional j.d., even for students who go on to work in firms or public service.professor barzun responded to some questions and concerns during the session. some students asked about the extent to which the program conflicts with other responsibilities. professor barzun suggested that the program could be seen as comparable to other activities like a clinic or journal—a significant commitment, but not necessarily prohibitive. because of its added coursework, the program can be seen as a kind of “curricular extracurricular,” he said. however, it could prevent students from studying additional interests outside of core law classes and legal history, simply because there are only so many credits that can fit into three years. one student also asked how the program might be seen by employers outside of academia. while it probably wouldn’t be a significant benefit for most employers, professor barzun said that he didn’t think it would be a problem, either, and it might be an interesting way for students to set themselves apart. at most, students might want to clarify that it wouldn’t affect their timeline for beginning a job.first-year students who plan to enter the program will need to apply in the spring semester. the application is fairly easy, requiring a short statement of interest and recommendation letters, which can be from the same individuals who wrote letters for law school. it no longer requires standardized tests. in the meantime, students might think about their potential interests and look at relevant faculty listed on the uva website. students can unenroll from the program once admitted. however, resource constraints mean that in recent years, more students have applied for the program than have been accepted. students should be sure that they intend to complete the joint degree when they enroll, since beginning the program could mean taking a spot from someone else.---nnk2gn@virginia.edu
