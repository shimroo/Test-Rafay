the ministry of unknown science -- or mous, as it is acronymically known -- is widely believed to be an underground comedy cadre located in los angeles, california who mix live performances with digital video sketches, and in the process blow their audiences' freaking heads wide open with fun.
in actuality, mous is a top-secret consortium of scientific geniuses backed with all the funding, nuclear technology, bad ideas and pure will necessary to control the entire world.
for the last four years, the organization has performed experiments at venues around los angeles to sold-out audiences, based largely on word-of-mouth, and occasionally word-of-nose. it is truly underground comedy. 




 
















the 
                people have spoken!

thanks 
                  to the glory of the internet, we have recieved word from some 
                  very happy junior scientists out there who appreciate all that 
                  we're doing for scientific progress. 
one 
                  writes:

"hey 
                    guys, just had a quick question for you, why are you so awesome????????? 
                    well, just wondering. anyway, i love your show, and your podcast. 
                    i share the wicked sweetness with my friends, and they love 
                    you too. too bad i live in crappy rhode island. i can probably 
                    never see von cobuli in person. hey, big ass, i can still 
                    see you guys on my ipod. keep making life here in coventry 
                    rhode island not so bad. since i'm only thirteen, ive got 
                    lots of time on my hands. . so i drew this crappy 
                    picture inspired by your amazing videos."

and 
                  here's another:

wow. 
                    just when i thought i would despair for ever, rotting away 
                    in (shudder) new england, i chanced across the ministry of 
                    unknown science. finally, hope for humanity. all y’alls 
                    incredible dancing finger style and sun-invading clone armys 
                    have given me back the spring in my step and the twinkle in 
                    my eye. yes, with a little help from mr. cobuli and the amazing 
                    ball saxbury, i am a new man. i tip my hat to you, and salute 
                    you in your noble quest in the name of science.
                    cheers,

who 
                  can argue with that? no one!
clearly, 
                  the ministry of unknown science holds some serious sway over 
                  the region of new england.
 
got 
                  your own question for the ministers? 
good! 
                  email them and they'll 
                  answer your questions here, in our forum, the ministry of unknown 
                  science!
