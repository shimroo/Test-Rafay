5 quick ways to turn cold calls into warm sales







does the thought of making cold calls send chills up your spine? if you're not making cold calls, you could be missing out on reaching a huge customer base that doesn't even know about your company or the products that you're selling. if you aren't willing to call people and follow up on leads, your sales numbers could suffer. here are some strategies for changing the way you think about cold calls and the way you speak to your potential customers over the phone so you can start looking forward to this proven sales technique.



1. think of it as a business deal 

cold calls are just that - business deals. it's a way of doing business with other people who do business. unfortunately, many sales agents view cold calls as a bother to their potential clients rather than simply doing business. this is especially true if you are following up on leads that you were given. if it makes you feel better when doing cold calls, do them during business hours instead of at the time when your potential clients are sitting down for dinner. that way you won't feel like you're "bothering" people with your call.



2. be quick and succinct 

you may have a tendency to tell your potential clients all about your product over the phone. but this isn't an appealing technique for the person you're calling. instead, sum up the product that you are offering in a couple short and succinct sentences. if it helps, write down a few notes before you start making your cold calls. be prepared for objections when you are presenting the benefits of your product and don't be discouraged when a potential client questions you because that means they are at least listening. when you are prepared for this, though, you have a better chance of turning that person into a customer instead of a prospective buyer.



3. smile



even though you are on the phone, a potential client can detect your attitude in your voice and the way you speak. if you are discouraged or feeling less confident than you should, the person on the other end of the line will know it. make an effort to smile even when you are talking on the phone. this will make you feel better and you'll project a positive attitude that the other person can detect. also, don't get discouraged. even if you've been rejected by 10 straight potential leads, keep going. do some jumping jacks or take a walk around your building to clear your head and increase your energy so you can focus better on your next string of 10 calls.



4. be realistic



even if you're the best sales agent in the universe, you're not going to make a sale to everybody. there will be times when people simply aren't receptive to the products that you're offering. it's important to be realistic when making your cold calls. have small goals of making only a few sales a day. if you have unattainable goals, you're only going to discourage and frustrate yourself which is going to keep your sales figures down anyways.



5. get the name



when working from a cold call list, it is better when you have or can purchase the contact name of the business owner. asking for the business owner by first name when making a cold call often gets you past the secretary or "gatekeeper" because they assume you know the owner personally.



keeping these five techniques in mind when making your cold calls is a great way to have a more positive perspective and improve your phone communication skills.

3 strategies selling agents can learn from hollywood







have you been looking for ways to increase your sales and client base? if things have been stagnate concerning your sales figures, there are many strategies that you can try out to see what works for you. have you ever thought about studying the tricks and strategies that hollywood uses to attract customers and viewers? they are the experts with multi-million dollar blockbusters every year and classics that people can watch over and over again. here are a few strategies that the showbiz industry uses that you can implement into your list of resources as well.



1. develop a hook 

a "hook" is something that grabs someone's attention. it's used a lot in the music industry as many songs have a hook, which is typically the most memorable part of the song. but people working in hollywood are also masters of the hook. did you know that "gone with the wind" was originally supposed to be entitled "tomorrow is another day"? do you think it would have had the same popularity had the producers decided to go with the original title? probably not because it's just not catchy.



when you are making cold calls or leaving messages, always lead with a hook that will grab their attention. instead of leading with your phone number and your name, tell them what you do and how you can help them. if you are running a promotion or offering a discount, start with that. you'll be more likely to keep their attention and then you can end with leaving your phone number and other less interesting information.



2. tailor your message to your audience



this is one of the more important strategies that you can learn from hollywood, but it's also a basic strategy that can help increase your sales. if you were pitching movies, you wouldn't pitch a children's movie the same way you'd pitch the summer's biggest action thriller, would you? it's the same with selling insurance. you should know your customers and their needs so you can create a pitch that will compel them to purchase the products and services that you are offering to them. you might have to decide between presenting your message with a more emotional appeal or a more logical approach. you can decide between being informal or formal. the important thing is to know your customers so you can create a presentation that is going to appeal to them instead having a "one size fits all" cookie cutter approach that won't appeal to anybody.



3. be a good storyteller



everybody loves to hear a good story. that's why people pay $10 for a movie ticket and $25 for a tub of popcorn - so they can go hear a good story and enjoy some snacks at the same time. while pie charts and numbers have their place, they can't replace the persuasiveness of a great story. practice your storytelling skills. your stories should involve a few basic components, such as a setting (time and place), an obstacle and how your product helped overcome the obstacle. if you can add humor, that's even better!



regardless of your industry, we can all learn a little something from hollywood if we look closely enough at their strategies. if you correctly employ these suggestions when pitching your products to customers, you'll undoubtedly see your sales figures increase.

life settlement - retirement peace of mind







on january 1st, 2011, and every day since, 10,000 baby boomers have turned 65. this trend is expected to continue for the next 18 years. according to the urban institute, these baby boomers have lost up to 10% of their retirement savings since the crisis of 2008. despite the financial crisis affecting the majority of people with investments in the stock market, many seniors have been unsure how to adapt their financial plan in response to recent market changes and losses. with over 30% of u.s. investors maintaining more than 80% of their 401k investments in equities, there could be devastating impacts for seniors if another crash occurred. with over 70% of baby boomers invested in the stock market prior to 2008, even if their savings weren't substantially affected, most boomers are at least thinking about their retirement more carefully. the critical opportunity here involves education, such as an in-depth analysis of how finances have been affected and how they can be repositioned to meet client financial needs.



now more than ever, members of the public are concerned about their retirement security. in a 2011 survey by lake research partners, 88% of voters expressed concern about maintaining a comfortable standard of living in retirement, and 52% of those responders were very concerned. in october of 2009, approximately one year after the beginning of the financial crisis, 58% of affluent americans were concerned about the economy's impact on their ability to save. since 2009, this number has shrunk to only 49%, despite recent claims about economic improvements and stock market stabilization. the number one fear of today's baby boomer generation is their loss of independence. more and more retirees are realizing this potential threat to their retirement. many of these people purchased life insurance at some point in their working years. most financial decisions occurred at targeted points in a person's life: marriage, home purchase, birth of a child, retirement. as more people transition into the retirement ages, it's time for another financial conversation about whether their products still meet those needs.



life expectancies are rising alongside healthcare costs. of recently surveyed seniors, 62% identified health care as their top concern and felt unsure about how to incorporate that into their retirement plans. additionally, 61% of seniors are uncertain about the ability of their assets to match their income needs in retirement, leading to increased concern about whether they will be able to pursue the retirement lifestyle they had hoped for. in the early years of their retirement, more seniors are aware of the impact that rising healthcare costs have on them. many are interested in obtaining cash to pay for that healthcare now.



some seniors are working longer, too. many feel unprepared to enter retirement based on their savings and now continue to work past age 65. when faced with the opportunity to reduce that retirement age through the sale of an unneeded life insurance policy, a life insurance settlement can provide peace of mind and a more comfortable retirement. that supplemental cash could significantly boost a nest egg. for example, a 71 years old planning to continue working another two years would likely welcome the opportunity to stop working now and use the life settlement proceeds to serve as retirement income.



many seniors and retirees are considering cashing in their life insurance policies to provide increased financial security. in the golden years, there is less of a need for a beneficiary payout, since many people purchase and maintain coverage during their working years to protect spouses and children. it's likely that children have finished their education and left the nest, so there is less immediate concern about providing support. seniors are now more likely to be concerned about their own well-being entering retirement given the recent turbulence in the stock market.



older policies are seeing significant increases in the cost of insurance, making premium payments less affordable. more seniors are weighing the benefits of paying these higher premiums to maintain coverage they may no longer need. some seniors simply choose to let the coverage lapse, eliminating premium payments, but losing the value of the policy. open the conversation by meeting your client where they are at. discuss how they are affected so far and what options they have for becoming more financially secure in the short and long-term. this is your opportunity to help clients understand the benefits of a life settlement.



life settlements present a unique opportunity to dispose of unwanted policies and address current needs. if you are an adviser, position yourself to help assuage the concerns over lost independence. with an average offer from a life insurance settlement at 24.41% of the face amount, settlements are a highly viable option when compared with an average cash surrender value of 4.09%. using this information to leverage your client's concerns about financial security, retirement, and increasing health care costs is an excellent opportunity to reevaluate their financial needs.

do you have the best system for making insurance calls?







insurance sales agents who succeed long term have developed a system for scheduling insurance calls. insurance sales careers are attractive because of generous commission structures and residual commissions. many agents pay a premium for insurance leads from online lead generation websites. with experience comes the knowledge of exactly how many insurance sales calls will result in sales.



the first things a new insurance agent needs is:



1. product knowledge and 

2. the mechanics of how to conduct a successful sales call.



the sales process can be broken down into steps. understand your client's needs first and foremost. ask a lot of questions about their goals, concerns, and needs. next, address those needs specifically, and close. address objections and close again.



identify each step of the sales process so you can correct errors if a sale does not close. if you know what parts of the sales call give you trouble you can prepare differently for the next sales call and steadily improve your closing ratio.



agents who are new to a career in sales and insurance sales specifically are frequently alarmed to discover they have a fear of making cold calls. not making systematic cold calls can destroy any sales career. initially, to save money it makes sense to complete your own sales calls. there's relief available to erase call reluctance completely.



smart sales managers provide training in emotional freedom techniques (eft) to dissolve discomfort associated with making insurance calls. the use of (eft) is central to your success if you find you have a love/hate relationship with cold calling new prospects. eft is emotional acupuncture. it's an energy therapy that combines thoughtful focus with a series of tapping sequences on multiple body points. the eft process miraculously dissolves feelings we wish to change.



with eft one does not need to identify the origin of their trauma or discomfort, however they do need to identify a feeling or idea upsetting their performance. eft is emotional self-care. we grow up making conclusions that may not be true. some people fear failure, some fear success. if you have feelings that conflict with tasks your job demands those feelings can dissolve. you've got the power to place supportive feelings and ideas where negatives once held you back.



eft is easy to learn and produces instant results in many cases. it's been used by healing practices for twenty years. millions of people have benefited and now it's time to use eft to address everyday challenges.



insurance calls are a task. much like walking the dog or emptying the dishwasher. insurance calling can be boring so schedule the time to make your calls and get comfortable completing those calls. the secret to cold calling once unwanted anxiety is dissolved is to make those calls quickly. don't take all day. don't allow more than five seconds to elapse between calls. keep it mindless. i read a sales training book years ago that talked about a top producing insurance agent. he would sit down to make 100 or more calls until he had his week fully booked with in-person meetings.



his system seemed horrid to me as a novice sales person. every time someone answered the phone he would say, "you don't want to buy insurance, do you?" no introduction, no small talk. his only goal was to schedule appointments and he did this consistently all the way to the bank. invariably people would say, "hey wait a minute, i do want to buy insurance!" customers were surprised by his direct approach. the result? going into each appointment, this agent knew his prospect was open to buy insurance! this man made millions.



if insurance calling is part of the routine that will make your dreams come true then figure out how many cold calls create the number of face-to-face appointments you need each week. next, use eft daily until you've erased all feelings of discomfort associated with sales calls. if new fears or thoughts emerge that create self-doubt or threaten to derail your success, tap them away! if rejection feels personal, eft can change your response. if you're a shy person, eft will help. eft can erase any feeling or idea that sabotages your success.



develop a script that reflects your style. use eft to make insurance calling easy, and fun! insurance sales is a great career. if you feel like you've got to motivate yourself to go our and do battle with the world something's wrong. insurance calls are key to an agent's success. learn the sales process, know your products, use eft, and watch your confidence and sales numbers skyrocket!
