on august 20, 2005, deputy murphy was injured while responding to a call involving a car that had gone off a cliff.  he ended up falling 35 ft, and landed on his back.  he fractured t-7 and t-8.
while this site is about deputy murphy's ordeal and recovery, we do not forget two young people lost their lives on this night. our prayers are with those who perished and those who survived.

	 let's get ready to rumble
	 
    


the badonkadonkwhile i realize the term has another meaning altogether i don’t care. it also describes the next four hours in the er/tcu.the fun at er has ended and now it is time to traverse nearly every ward in an aimless attempt to gather all the digital images of my internals. the first stop is somewhere in the bowels of vmc at mri. i am greeted with a grunt by a small squishy faced troll (we'll call her zurg) in maroon scrubs. she is obviously disenfranchised, and more importantly, disinterested in me in any way. she gets her marching orders and we are off to the beat of a leather skinned drum.i’m not sure if we hit every immovable object on our way to mri of if she managed to save some for the return trip. each time we bump into something i can feel it through my whole body. i wince with pain and my hands spasm into fists. lest you think i am exaggerating i started counting after the fourth or fifth jolt and managed eight more. to get you up to speed – come over to my house and i’ll hit you in the back with a hammer thirteen times. i’ll be kind. i’ll use a rubber mallet instead of the claw hammer.zurg doesn’t walk at the front of the gurney she walks at the back and pushes. i imagine at least one of the wheels shimmies and that’s why the gurney is off line so often. i’d hate to think she really didn’t care that much. we hit the doors first – without slowing down. big, heavy, double doors……big……heavy……double…..you get the idea. we are not nearly finished, though.she hits the walls three or four times, three more sets of doors, the elevator door, the back of the elevator, and the elevator door on the way out again. we make it to mri and i am relieved to see the troll is not one of the orderlies who will position me for the machine.i am directed to breathe and not breathe at intervals while the machine hums. the tech has a lovely voice and the narcotics are starting to be fun. the angel voice speaks and i reply with hums and giggles. the machine hums some more and i hum along……hey, this is my favorite song!!!“gahr.” the troll returns.and we’re off. next stop cat scan. we bang all of the requisite doors and add a couple of tray carts and vending machines for good measure. my forearms are getting pumpy from all of the reflexive spasms. zurg has her walkman in now so she is blissfully unaware. wouldn’t want to trouble her with my pain or anything so i just grip the gurney. we get into cat and it goes well. more breathe and no breathe exercises. this one is a man’s voice. i like angel voice more so i call on the powers of diloted and make it so. ah, much better.now we are off for static x-rays. this hallway is more scary because most of the lights are off. the troll stops me in the hallway and retreats wordlessly into the darkness. i’m sure she’s afraid of the light anyway.but…….now i am alone. not kind of alone but really alone. it’s five in the morning or so. there isn’t a creature stirring, not even a mouse. an hour passes. i’ve seen one nurse and one patient pass by but no one has taken any notice of me. i can feel the meds wearing off and the pain slowly creeps back into my body. the backboard is starting to irritate my shoulder blades too. a nurse walks down the hall. as i prepare to flag her down she takes a left.  zoot.......gone.a few minutes later another one approaches….goodness, it’s like a traffic jam in here!“excuse me.”“yes.” i can’t tell if her smile is pleasant or ‘damn why’d i walk down this hallway?’“i’ve been here for about an hour and no one has seen me.”“what are you here for?”“x-ray’s”“oh, well you’re in radiology.” she turns to go.“could you see if someone in there could talk to me?” she smiles again. this time i’m sure it’s ‘why’d i walk down this hallway?’ but at least she goes through the door into x-ray.the x-ray tech comes out. he’s awesome. he talks to me, apologizes (no one told him i was here…..thanks, troll), and gets someone to bring me more meds. i’m in and out in a flash. he calls for someone to take me back.“gahr!” you guessed it.i’m wheeled to my transitional room. i wonder what music zurg’s listening to? we stop by my new bed. annie and the lt arrive at the same time i do and stand in the door. they are about to witness murf wrestle with half a spine.four more orderlies show up.“we need that (back) board down in the er.”i can see two more blue boards propped in the corner.“yeah, sure.”“we need our blankets.” someone else unceremoniously removes the top blanket – zip. “the bottom one too.” she pulls on the one between me and the back board without success.“ok, one, two, three.”the bottom of the back board remains stationary as the top is tilted off of the gurney towards the bed. simultaneously blanket moron gives an extra hard tug on the blanket underneath me. i groan. the board becomes disturbingly unstable and wavers in mid-air before falling half onto the bed and half on the gurney. the gurney is several inches taller than the bed and i am resting on the edges of both at a forty five degree angle. i hear annie gasp.my groan center is so surprised it forgets to sign the authorization to exit my body.back board troll (we'll call this one grishnak) has attempted to take the er board out from under me as blanket moron does the same and the two at my head have attempted to place the very same board on the bed. i roll to my right, cross my left arm over my body, and grab the board. it is excruciating. i am fully convinced the gurney will shift and i will drop two and a half feet to the floor. all four of the orderlies are arguing now about the board and paying no attention to my predicament. none of them are even touching the board anymore. i hook my right ankle over the board and grip the blanket and gurney with my right hand. i am pissed and terrified all at the same time. blanket moron tugs again and i jerk the blanket out of her hand with a growl.one of the orderlies leans over me, “so, what’d you do break some ribs or something?”both of my hands are occupied so i can’t take a swing at his sweet little face. it’s a prime target mind you. only about ten inches from mine. “no, i broke my friggin’ back!”he shrugs and returns to the argument. did i mention i’m still clinging to the board with fingers and toes?“hey,” the lie comes loudly out of my mouth without any conscious effort of my own “my doctor told me i’m to stay on this board, no matter what, until they determine how bad my injury is. no one is taking this board or this blanket.”way to go mouth!the trolls grunt and sigh. i’m finally lifted and placed on the bed. annie asks why they can’t switch boards and more grunting ensues. grishnak takes a spare board. she turns in the doorway.“well, i’ll take this one for now" she says, "but i want my board back………..gahr!"i fall asleep for the first time. angel voice says, "get some rest." just before i drift off i see it’s annie hovering over me.then fade to black.

	 indian wrestling in the er
	 
    


for the record – most of the indian wrestling actually occurs after i leave the er. my care was skilled and top notch while in the trauma center. i am forever grateful to all who looked after me at the vmc er. (most of the vmc ranting will actually occur later.)“well, here we are.” the amr rig slowed and i can see the bright entry way to the er through the back windows. i’m looking down over my prodigious nose because the c-collar won’t allow me to move my head. did i mention there is a small rock at the base of my skull – inside the collar? it fell in there just as fire-guy was applying my sadomasochistic posture collar down on the shelf. it will be there for the next forty hours or so.“great, now the fun begins.” i comment.“hey, you’re the one who jumped. you ready for this?”the doors open, “don’t really have much of a choice do i?”“nope, not really. here we go.” the door opens and i feel the gurney’s legs drop as i’m pulled out of the rig. even as gentle as they are trying to be with me it feels like a sledge hammer is being driven down on the top of my spine with each little jolt.i see most of this scene in the third person now. i’m more comfortable standing back, unobtrusively, in the corner. rather than watching the poor schlep lying there on the blue backboard. i don’t really remember how much it hurt for the most part. don’t get me wrong, i remember almost every moan, groan, and scream. but time, and a generous smorgasbord of narcotic pain killers and opiate cocktails has dulled the memory of the actual pain. it has, howver, also dulled some of the actual memories. i have my stud of a wife to fill in many of the details for me. for that i am both grateful and cursed. she corrects my verbal accounts beginning with the first shot of diloted (good stuff!) and after the first three rounds of morphine (scrambled my eggs pretty good but did nothing for my pain - synapses are funny like that). unfortunately it also means i cannot exaggerate too much – at least until she’s out of the room and i can delete her edits.i’m a good irishman, like me father, and by the time i’m fifty there will be dragons, unicorns, and me sharing a beer with johnny cash (here’s lookin at ya da!) if this story were to remain a purely oral history. i think that’s why annie wanted me to blog. once it’s on paper she won’t have to snort at me the way my mom does with my father every time he recounts a story. she’ll just tell me i’m full of beans (here’s lookin at ya ma!) and wave a piece of paper under my nose. but i digress……the doors open and i’m wheeled into the er. there’s no crashing or jumping around like on tv. it’s quick paced but well orchestrated. the amr guy gives his report to the doctor and nurse and four or five people boost me out of the gurney and onto the table. i see matt and annie (my wives) near one of the curtains. both look really worried. i must be even more f*©ked up than i feel – and i feel pretty shitty. someone begins unlacing my boots while i see like eight pairs (ok two) of scissors flashing amid flying scraps of my uniform. boot guy tugs on my left foot three times in rapid succession. each tug feels like someone is beating on my skull with that sledgehammer. why can’t the dude figure out it’s not coming off?i bark an expletive, “f*©king unlace them, damnit!” i yell. or maybe i yell and then bark. not sure, as i’m on my second hit of morphine already.“hey, hugh. you watch your mouth in here!”wow, that was some tough broad. i realize i am at a disadvantage, “uh, sorry.” i kinda know the voice, though, and how does she know my name? even if the round of morphine wasn’t in i don’t think i could identify the voice. the nurse leans over my face and pulls down her mask. i’m sure she can see the gears whirring inside my head but no, there will be no recognition here. i am slowly morphing into "meat with eyes" as i like to say about the druggies i've scooped up on the east side.“it’s me, diane. and be nice to the help. we’re here for you, ok?”“ok.”wait for it, wait for it…..diane? holy schnikes, it’s diane! i’ve coached her in adult hockey classes for at least three years now. i’m really harsh, foulmouthed, and unyielding in those classes. i grind em out, embarrass them on occasion, and usually work them hard. i occasionally throw my stick for good measure. i hope she’s not about to exact some sort of revenge here. the other nurse, mike, leans in too. “remember me?” aw, hell, i’m done for! he’s in the classes with her!one of the doctor’s (d1) does the differential squeeze thing with my hand strength for the thirtieth (ok, tenth) time and also makes sure i still have feeling/strength in my legs. andy walks in just as boot moron cuts my pants away.“nice drawers.” andy says, “how ya’ feeling?”“yeah, they are nice.” diane winks at me.“colorful too.” mike adds.“well my mommy always said i should have clean undies if i’m ever in an accident.” i give it right back.“well, you picked an appropriate time. are those flowers?”“daisies i think.”i hear annie giggle nervously and it is refreshing. she loves it when i banter and i’m not going down here without a fight and a laugh or two.i look at andy, “i feel like shit.”“i know. i couldn’t think of anything else to say.”“ok" says d1 "i have one more thing i need to do. we’re going to roll you over so i can see your spine and i also have to insert a finger into you anus.”“uh……uh, why.”“i need to see if you still have muscle control, it’s important. i don’t just do it for fun.”“ok?" i’m sure diane put him up to this.boot moron undoes my belt and starts tugging. my hips move and ….the hip bones connected to the spine bone.“hey, stop, stop, stop!” i manage to say without a cuss word.“i think it’s attached underneath.”“it is.”d1 “we need to cut your belt away.”“no you don’t.” pissed off, i lift my hips despite the discomfort and toss d1 the keepers which attach my duty belt to my pants belt. i can’t see him but i’m sure boot moron is sorely disappointed at not being able to trash more of my uniform.“well we need to cut away your vest.”i love my vest. i just paid to have the outer shell modified to carry a backup gun and knick knacks. did i mention i love my vest?  i got it the same day i got my badge and gun.  i wear all three of those every day.  like hell your gonna cut my vest.“no. no you don’t. it’s all velcro and it comes apart.” and, and, don’t make me get up off this table and kick some ass!!!!!d1 does a count down and they roll me. my cry comes from somewhere deep in my soul. it is primeval and unlike anything i have ever uttered. different from when i rolled on the shelf, separated my shoulder, or trashed a knee. i’m sure somewhere a stone has cracked or clouds have rolled in and lightning flashed. i want to pass out but it is not to be.d1 lets his fingers do the walking up my spine.without warning i am violated. it goes greasily in and out in a flash. i groan again with a decidedly different and somewhat confused tone. they roll me back down and i am facing andy. his confused and abhorrent look mirrors mine. he looks like he has swallowed skunky beer but doesn’t want the host to know.“murf,” he says deadpanning “if i never see another man shove his thumb up your ass i will die a happy man.”amen brother.next weektug of war in tcu

	 but you said
	 
    


but you said you’d start blogging again.  yes, yes, i know but the fact is i’ve been sick for about 10 days now.  i’ve tried to fake it.  i even did two days of yard work when the sun was out.  to be exact i did ten minutes of work and rested for twenty. for about fourteen hours over two days - but i did get a fair amount accomplished.  i’m not embarrassed to have people see my yard now.did i mention my dog is an idiot.  happy, lovable, and stupid.  he hates my yard.  besides the typical lawn burning, he chews on shrubbery, tramples only my favorite foliage and flowers, and has acquired a voracious appetite for sprinklers.  ai me, why does he hate the sprinklers so?  it’s like steve martin in the jerk.."stay away from the cans!  he hates the cans!”  he chewed down a mature rose bush last week.  you may read of his obituary soon.so, back to the topic.  i have been spending an inordinate amount of time in bed with snot i could re-tar the roof with and sinuses that click when i breathe.  hey, you wanted to know why i broke our covenant a second time - so here it is.  my honey-do list has shrunk from laundry, shopping, and house cleaning to; “honey could you spend the day picking up the kleenex, toilet paper, hankies, napkins, paper towels, shop rags, and whatever that pile is there in the corner.”  it’s an all day affair mind you. my ears occasionally make that high pitched depressurization sound that only i and my idiot dog can hear – like a silent whistle.  at least he comes when called now.  did i mention he’s an idiot.  like father like son i suppose.i greet every hour, awake or asleep, with a wheezing cough and attempt to breath like an asthmatic without an inhaler. too bad about the wife, though.  she was cute until i made her a zombie from sleep deprivation.  she's young.  she'll recover.as long as she does the math she knows what time it is.  “that’s seven wheezing episodes since we went to bed.  the sun is up. that would make it six o’clock.  damn, i’m ‘gonna be late for work!”  i’m the local town crier now.  “three a.m. and all is well…cough, cough, wheeeeeeeezzzeee, cough.  s’cuze me lad could you pick up me lung.  yes, that’s the one.  fraid it dropped there in the snow.”and how is it that my sinuses know when to switch?  when one jams closed the other opens like locks on a canal.  well usually.  i am something of a mouth breather now.  i could be accused of that on occasion but now it’s literal.   more importantly, how do the sinuses manage to defy gravity so?  the uphill sinus is usually jammed while the down hill one opens.  amazing!i’ve decided to stop drinking my fifth of nyquil and try zyrtec.  the nyquil hasn’t been making me comatose anyway.  so, what’s the point in drinking something so vile if it doesn't puch you between the eyes?  it’s never actually cured anyone’s cold.  it’s just a great masker of symptoms.  like tequila.  if you’re an idiot try convincing her to drink some tequila.  it’ll mask your symptoms.my (current) problem may be allergies.  though, they have never struck in november before – usually for two weeks in february and two in august.  the zyrtec experiment commences today at 2 p.m. so, i’ll keep you posted.in the mean time “dank you berry vuch for weading da blug.”

why did you stop writing? what happened to the blog? i think you have a boogie hanging.huh? i didn’t know anyone was reading until i stopped writing.then the emotional separation, the accusations that i was writing somewhere else, the staying late at naps. no one left any replies or told me they were reading. you can suggest topics or ask q’s as well.sorry d, annie will delete any porn requests. i'm too skinny now anyway. *blush*so, give a holla'.  (man, i am soooo street) cuz, therapy is a two way street honey. uh huh. now breathe - we can do this.i’m glad to know someone is reading though. i thought i was writing just for posterity. i think the next topic is supposed to be indian wrestling in the er. i may do some stuff on how i’m doing first. along with some observations on recovery.  sorry i was slacking.  it's good to be loved. so this little blurb is to get me/us started again. and thanks for reading……..ya’ bunch-a-whiners.

	 rescue
	 
    


i find that if i put my knuckles down, gorilla-like and straight arm it, i can extend my spine and it feels a little better. kinda' hard on the knuckles but i don’t really notice it in comparison to the truck that has been driven through my back. also, that thirty eight year old six pack i’ve been so proud of is now cramping because i’ve been flexing for an hour or so. keeping my mid-section tight makes my back feel much better.i find my right hand hurts now as does my head. must have smacked ‘em pretty good. oh, wait, i still have my flashlight in a death grip. i should put it down but i’m reluctant. i’m not sure which is my good luck charm yet. no, not the charm that let me fall off a cliff. the one that let me only feel like i fell off a cliff - but not quite get killed. nope, bloody knuckles or not, i’m not letting the sucker go.i’m starting to think maybe i broke some ribs and punctured a lung. i’m still having a hell of a time breathing. it’s short and almost spastic. and it’s getting worse as my ribs and abs continue to tighten. i hearken back to hockey again. if i had punctured a lung, or so the trainer tells me as i spit blood and gasp for breath on the bench after a particularly vicious check, i would have foam coming out of my mouth. well hell, there’s no blood or foam. right on little flashlight!i hear some shouting above and look up. it’s still black as an oubliette down here but the trees up above are well lighted. i find looking up is also a bad plan because now my neck spasms as well. there’s more shouting and a little bit of shit falls on my head. more falls around me and then a rock the size of a soft ball hits the ground next to me with a dull thud. great, c’mon flashlight do your thing!it’s now raining debris from above and there is a tinkle of rappelling gear. another bit of irony here. i just told one of the big doug’s at work i would show him how to rappel safely and all kinds of rope, knot, and climbing tricks. he’s put together a rescue bag for work in the wilds of cupertino and los altos - including climbing gear. i’m guessing that’s right out, now! my climbing credibility has suffered almost as much as my body i suspect.the debris shower continues and i can see a tan silhouette dangling above me. he’s being lowered in jerks and stops. “slowly!” he bellows into a packset and they drop him three more feet. “damn it,” he yells up the hill, "slowly!" it’s the first laugh i’ve had in a couple of hours and it hurts like hell. the packset crackles and he begins the now famous slow, loud, over enunciation drill into his nearly non-functioning packset. they drop him again and i laugh as he swears softly a second time. he finally makes it to the shelf and asks how i’m doing. before i can answer they give him more slack from above and he slips towards the abyss. i instinctively reach out to slow his slide and instantly regret it.“nice place you have here, how ya’ doin?”“i think i may have broken my back. i definitely at least broke some ribs.”“ok. i’ll take a look in a sec. are you comfortable?”i now say the stupidest thing i will say until i’m seeing narcotic induced cartoon characters in my hospital room. “i’m ok. you should go down to the car.”what? please nice man, don’t leave me.“they’re probably hurt more than me anyway.”what? please nice man, don’t leave me and…..shut up mouth!“no, i’m here. my job is to look out for you now. there are other guys going down to the car.”“ok, as long as the others are headed down.”thank god.“man,” he says as he slides in behind me and illuminates the shelf with his light “you’re lucky you missed those.”i look to my right and see a partially buried boulder about a foot away. it's about three feet across and domed like a golf ball. to the left is a jagged rock about four feet away. just past that is some sort of a vertical pipe about two feet in diameter in a cutout that would have swallowed my body. i’m told later that the pipe/cutout continues another forty vertical feet down and goes into a hole in the ground. i would have ended up like an oversized baby jessica from back in the 80’s. with decidedly less happy results.“what can i do for you? can you sit back?”“no, i tried that earlier. hey, can you get your knee in behind me? i might be able to lean back then.” he does and it works. he covers me in a space blanket and i realize that i am shivering. he examines my spine and elicits groans in the area of my injury.“well, you’ve got a pretty nasty bump on your head and i’m going to put a c-collar on your neck. you’re pretty cut up. lots of blood but nothing life threatening. we’re going to have to strap you to a board to get you outta here.”“i think we should hurry. i’m getting a little shockey now.”i can feel pins and needles creeping up my legs and into my mid-section, my breathing continues to get restricted, and i’m shivering uncontrollably now. i’ve gone into shock two times before and frankly it scared me more than anything else that happened on this night. firefighter guy tells them my situation and they say they are already on the way. i make the last conscious decision to save my life. i pull my knees back and begin to force myself to take slow deep breaths in an effort to keep my blood as oxygenated as possible. the pins and needles don't stop but they don't continue advancing up into my chest. if they do i fear i will pass out. that's what happened the last two times and i woke up with iv tubes sticking out of me in a hospital room.there is a futher shower of debris as three of firefighter guy's partners slide down to the shelf with a metal litter. we all argue about the best course of action to get me out. i start to direct the rescue and they finally tell me to shut up. good for them. i’m an idiot.they get me onto the litter, strapped, and taped. two or three of them remain attached to the litter and we all get hauled out together. i won’t see the pictures for five weeks but they didn’t use a winch to get us out. all of my beat partners, command staff, chp, cdf, fire, amr, and probably a hobbit or two pulled us out by hand…..by hand. nice job guys.i get to the top and loaded up on a gurney. sgt. dutra greets me as the amr guys hustle me to the ambulance. “murf, don’t worry about a thing. trace(y) and your wife will meet you at the hospital. we’ll secure your stuff and i’ll be right behind you. you’re going to be ok.” he’s right, they do, and i am. thanks guys….thanks for saving me.but i lost my flashlight.it’s ok, though, the amr rig is well lit and i relax for the first time in two hours. good luck little flashlight where ever you are.next weekindian wrestling in the erside note:i’m horrible with names and i’m sorry for forgetting your’s fire guy. i’m up and able now. so, i’m getting ready to track all of you down, regardless of agency, and i’m going to say thanks soon.

	 so, what were you thinking?
	 
    


ah, the infamous question. the polite way of saying, "are you a f@cking idiot?"  i’ve been asked this several times in jest. i’ve also been asked as a third party, “joe, asked me to ask you – what the hell were you thinking?”these are the things i was thinking. some are analytical and some are almost mathematical.firstly, i was thinking that there were people at the bottom of this hill who were dead or dying. without immediate help, evaluation, or at least comfort more could perish.next, a bloody, injured person had climbed out of the valley in the dark. i am a trail runner and rock climber. i’ve done twelve hour orienteering and three day recon work in the military. all at night and often in bad weather. i’m in pretty good shape and neither dazed nor injured. i’m more than confident that ‘if he climbed out, i can damn sure climb down.’ hell, i’ve got a flashlight for goodness sakes.but murf, isn’t that the firefighters job?i’ve always maintained, a person who says, “that ain’t my job” doesn’t belong in this profession. police work is for do-ers. we are first responders with an expectation to take positive action. it’s a 50/50 chance that fire will get to an accident before us. i wouldn’t roll up on a cpr type incident and wait for fire because ‘it’s not my job.’ i will arrest those that need arresting and no one is going to die on my watch if i can help it.so, the second way to look at it is thus;there is a 50% chance that i’m going to attempt to get to the victims just by being on scene.the car plunged over a hill. 60% chance.i know where he climbed out. 75% chance.i have the physical attributes and experience to make the attempt. 90% chance.i have a flashlight. 95% chance.i hear a victim scream from the accident site. 100% chancei think, based on the available information, that going down to the victims is an excellent idea. actually, i think most of the cops at the top were expecting one or more of us to make our way to the bottom. we were all just formulating plans on how to go about it. some wanted to rope in, some wanted to make our way down, and some wanted to descend with fire.now let’s look at how the math played out with the actual information at hand.there is a 100% chance i’m going to attempt to get to the victims.i know where he climbed out. false – subtract 25%i can see the lay of the land below me. false – subtract 10%the guy who climbed out is lucid. false – subtract 10%the place i am going to climb down is a steep hill. false – it is a cliff. subtract 50%i have a flashlight. who cares – subtract 5%there is now a 0% chance that i will get to the victims. but i am not armed with any of this information before i begin my descent. if i had known any of this information was incorrect i would never have taken the first step toward the brink. but hindsight is also mathematical.it’s 20/20.***next week***rescue (really this time)

i realize i’m sucking like a guppy.my diaphragm is pulling in short spasms but not much air is going in or out. i try a cough to make my muscles work in conjunction but it doesn’t work. i’ve heard that’s how high altitude parachutists force the lungs to process oxygen when their breathing apparatus fails. what the hell it was worth a try.the first real wave of pain starts to wash over me. damn, i think i’ve broken some ribs. what if i broke my back? i wiggle my fingers – cool. i wiggle my feet – cool……but. dirt falls on my face. that’s not right.oh, shit. i’m upside down. to further demonstrate gravity my right knee flops down onto my chest. a full wave of pain charges through my back.and i’m still sucking like a guppy.i’ve had the wind knocked out of me before. i know what it feels like but i also realize that it has been at least two or three minutes down here in the dark. i should be getting my breath back under normal circumstances. the first moment of panic. i’m suffocating. my diaphragm is spasming and my organs, especially now that my leg has fallen down, are compressing against my lungs.oh shit. i’m going to die!worse – i’m going to die and people are either going to think i was stupid or trying to be a hero.in the words of my good friend matt, “daaammmnnnnitttttt!” (must be said with a heavy dose of sarcasm and eye rolling)***i took a chp officer safety class about two years ago. one lecture goes something like this; officers who take four or five rounds and decide to survive usually do. (at least the ones who survive and can talk about it.) other officers who take one round that would typically be (medically) non-fatal often go into shock and die because they convince themselves that they will. the class motto was “i’m not going to quit, i’m not going to die, i’m going to fight.”i make the second conscious decision to save my life. i have to turn my self over if i am going to surviveok, one…..i’m not going to quit.two…..i’m not going to die.three…..i’m going to - oh my god!!! f#ckin, son of a, holy mother that hurt!i’ve never hurt so bad in my life. i turn to the right and my legs tumble down. i push myself upright into a slumped seated position with my legs pointing straight out in a narrow v. i look like a raggedy andy doll tossed on a shelf (double entendre intended). my head slumps down onto my chest. if i had any air in my lungs this would have been one of those excruciating exhales. so i guess it’s ok that i can’t breathe yet.“murf!” i hear one of the boys yell, almost scream, from above. “murf!”“yeah!” it wheezes out barely louder than a whisper. i can’t move my head yet.“where the f@ck did he go?” another voice asks.“i ‘dunno. he slid down right here. murf!”“i’m ok.” i wheeze again. they’re only like 70 feet away but it might as well be 70 miles.i can hear radio chatter now but can’t focus enough to make out what is being said. i squeeze the mic, “94c3, i’m ok.” the radio continues on without me. i try two more times and my voice becomes a little stronger. i’m breathing again but it doesn’t matter because no one can hear me. i’ll figure out in a week or two that my radio probably flipped from ‘b’ to ‘a’. ‘a’ is a packset to packset frequency but no one in the field is monitoring it and i don’t have enough power to reach county comm from the shelf. i can hear the incoming traffic but can’t put anything out.“murphy!”hey, that’s nate’s voice and he’s below me. that’s weird. i’m getting a little punchy now.ah, what the hell, “nate!” a child could have yelled louder and my voice is all raspy like i’ve had too much brandy and cigars.“murphy?”apparently it was loud enough “yeah, up here.”“flash your light at me.”i do.  i've kept a deathgrip on the flashlight through the entire ordeal.  “nate, i’m ok.”“you’re ok? can you climb up?”“no, i think i broke some ribs.”“ok, stay there.”the packset crackles in my ear, “control, 81c6. i’ve found 94c3. he says he’s hurt and can’t move from his position”county comm, “10-9? (repeat)” he does, and describes where he is (accident scene at the bottom), and the victim’s condition. they each try two or three more times. the radios are all having a tough time getting out of the valley and the stress is in everybody's voices. at both ends they start to speak slowly and over enunciate each word.boy, this is a fun game, yea!nate finally gets through and everyone knows my general location and condition. at least as far as i’ve been able to self diagnose. my pain is steadily increasing. the matrix i will see at the hospital is a scale of 1-10. 10 is approaching unbearable/unconscious. i’m at a 7/8. not bad except ten minutes ago i was a 4/5 before for that cool flip. which was a straight 9 on both pain and form.probably not enough to unseat louganis but i might take home the silver.note: i know there are radio transcripts and my quotes might not be actual quotes. this is from my impact induced memory to the best of my ability.***next week***rescue
