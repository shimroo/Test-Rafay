i miss blogging





i really miss blogging.  the world is just not the same.  

life is moving along fast it seems.  many of our furry friends have passed away.  we have lost contact with many.  it makes me sad.  so.....here i am living with eight pugs.  when the heck did i become that lady?  lol

look world it's me!





we have been missing for so long!  sadly with the blogger app no longer working for iphones, blogging has become complicated!  taking photos from your phone and posting was so simple, now to take a photo, save to laptop and then post...just seems too much????  

anyhow, many of you who know us on f*book or inst*gram know we are still a busy family of pugs!

this past summer, petey, buster, sophie and i went to pugcamp...







p, sophie, stewie, petey, buster and i went to green mountain pug social and then i traveled solo to have my booth at the pug rescue of new england event.   i'm still sewing up a storm and enjoying life! we still miss our chloe and marty a lot, even with 3 newbies in the pack.

the heavenly 18







this guy....what a treasure.  his nickname goodboy marty.  he was a good boy.  rescued at 7 and more than 10 wonderful years with us.  yet, 10 was not enough.  we think of him and all those birthdays.  first wishing he could make 10, then maybe 11, wow you think he'll live to 13?  he survived and lived and taught us about love and gratitude and he made sweet 16 and then 17....but the big guy upstairs decided there would be no earthly 18th.  so we think of him and i close my eyes and hear him...happy heavenly birthday goodboy.....
