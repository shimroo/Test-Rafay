naming schemes[edit | edit source]
what do you use?[edit | edit source]
a good naming scheme is scalable, unique, and easy to remember.  the purpose of these naming schemes is to name networked servers, wireless access points or client computers, but it can also be used to name projects, products, variables, streets, pets, kids, or any other project where unique names and rememberable names are required.

a good naming scheme should be scalable, but there could be times when a fixed number of machines are only ever going to be used. these are dedicated to those machines.
