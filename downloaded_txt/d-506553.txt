how has aa changed your life? 






i got a life! i didn’t know this life was available for someone like me, i’m no one special nor do i have any special skills, and yet for as awesome as it is – i still believe the best is yet to come.”
~ anonymous






“initially, i was indecisive about attending aa meetings: i was used to managing life challenges on my own and couldn’t imagine that sobriety was at all possible. but i have been astonished at all that has changed. when i joined aa, i felt a pervasive sense of stuckness, suffering, isolation, regret, self-pity, and self-sabotage. over time, i have come to experience a greater sense of peace, physical and mental health, resilience, community, and authenticity in my relationships with others. aa has completely transformed my life for the better, and i am grateful whenever i have the opportunity to give new members the support that was given to me.”         
~ kevin g.
