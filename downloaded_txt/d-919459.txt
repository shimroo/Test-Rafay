kids & teens
studying bjj gives kids and teens the knowledge that they can leverage their body’s strength to accomplish things they never thought possible. over time, it increases self-confidence and pride – and that carries over to work, home, and every area of their lives.











adults
by teaching students to take the fight to the ground where they can use chokeholds and other effective techniques to defend themselves, bjj helps leverage even a small body into a huge problem for an attacker.













our mission statement


alliance jiu jitsu has a mission of transforming lives, promoting health, knowing how to win and lose, finding comfort in discomfort, stimulating courage and discipline, and finding respect in yourself and towards others. we strive to create a supportive and empowering environment where practitioners of all levels can develop not only their jiu-jitsu skills, but also life skills that extend beyond the mats.

testimonials














 
i like the structure of learning process with gradually growing intensity and difficulty, continuous repetition of material, and help from instructors and more experienced students


lenny boston,
                                  
                    google

i've been fortunate enough to train all over the world and alliance is hands down my favorite place. tough training partners and multiple time world champion instructors that create a fun learning environment!


clinton gouveia,
                                  
                    student                  














 
i've been training for a few months now at alliance, & as someone who has never trained in martial arts before, the experience has been amazing - the methodology of alliance really works when it comes to training up students who are completely new. the instructors & leadership here are both highly skilled & good at teaching.


andrew todd,
                                  
                    student                  














 
for my personal interest, i'm searching to learn the art of jiujitsu, not just the sport side of it. i have visited quite a few schools  before deciding to switch academies, i found alliance to be the best place for me because their style of training fits my belief "self-defense is first" and the vast amount of knowledge professor jacare has to offer is just amazing.



edward floyd williams,
                                  
                    student                  














 
the most elite jiu-jitsu team in the world. grandmaster, romero jacare cavalcanti, has trained countless world champions, and he is 1 of only 6 people to have obtained a black belt from the legendary rolls gracie. the style of training appeals to competitors all around the world, and that is why they come to this gym to train.

although the training is intense, the alliance founders and all instructors create an atmosphere of respect for all of our students. they offer classes for children as well as adults beginners, intermediate and advanced. this gym has changed many peoples lives including mine. providing confidence and discipline to the adults and all little warriors.

                    instructor                  














 
i appreciate the honesty of the instructors who informed us of how to stay safe, and the importance of persistence and taking preventative measures. it was very beneficial to be able to practice the moves on the instructors. most woman may feel intimidated to flip a grown man but the instructors are personable and encouraging.


hannah stewart,
                                  
                    second time women's self defense seminar attendee                  














 
trained with the alliance team for years at joslin's mma and dragan's in canada, and even got to train with master jacare down in atlanta back in 2003. it's still the best martial arts training i ever got in my life. talented, tough, intelligent and with big hearts that make you feel like family. the way jiu-jitsu was always meant to be trained. alliance all the way.

the best place to learn about jiu jitsu and respect.


nayara morais cunha,
                                  
                    student                  














 
i've been here for almost a year now so i think it's appropriate for me to write a review. aside from all of the accolades that the various trainers, athletes, and even hobbyist here possess, it is just an enjoyable place to train. i am big on cleanliness for any type of close quarters contact sport and this is easily the cleanest martial arts facility i have ever seen. another thing that i really like about alliance is the structure. personally, as someone unfamiliar with grappling having a structured curriculum provides me with a means of processing everything effectively. finally, i find that almost everyone is very helpful and willing to assist new students. i highly recommend alliance atlanta.
