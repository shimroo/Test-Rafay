welcome to our website. 
we are sellers of fine brass scale train models with special emphasis towards 
the ho modeler. while plastic models are important and have earned their place 
in the model railroading hobby, brass models are valued by collectors as they 
offer scale models that are most prototypically accurate to the true engine.  
many times the model is not available in plastic, as it has never been 
produced.  therefore, in these cases the model is only available in brass form.  
the selection available in brass is enormous.  what must be a myriad of 
prototypes of steam, diesel, electric, turbines, trolleys and all sorts of 
rolling stocks for most major roads have been made in the nearly 50 years of 
brass model manufacturing.  you may find that elusive model that you are looking 
for here.
