this is your chance to build a home and change lives forever.
we’ve served and loved the poor in baja, mexico, for over 30 years.  from building homes, building churches, ministering in prisons, providing food to families during this difficult time, and building a discipling network of over 100,000, we’ve experienced the transforming power of jesus christ and we want you to join us!
