culinary experience
sensory experiences and refinement

dinner time. we get ready, we cross the majestic rooms to reach a view that has no equal in the world. a “bellini” on the terrace while the sun sets on the lake. and after a dream, another dream, the exclusive hospitality of the veranda restaurant. almost a theatrical scene: a ballet of maîtres and sommeliers attentive to your every wish.
