					it â¢ cloud â¢ voip â¢ management services






â  voip business phone


							local, long distance , intercom, voice mail, text and sharing, on site voip pbx phone systems or fully managed pbx connectâ¢ cloud enabled phone systems.
						





											voice over internet
										



											there are many benefits of using voip.  it’s up to 70% cheaper than normal telephone company phone lines.  so, voip can save you money.you need to determine whether the cost savings might be worth the possibility that, since voip runs on the internet, that your calls could drop, or your voip service may not be available at times.  also, 911 calls may not go through on voip.  many businesses who adopt voip, keep at least one 911 capable cellular or standard phone line, as a back up for emergency service calls.conference calls, call forwarding and following, texts and most popular calling features including long distance, can be included with voip packages.

â  voip residential phone


							replace that land line with a low cost voip phone complete with local and long distance, and with a new ip phone all the calling features you want for cheap.
						





											is voip for you?
										



											saving up to 70% on phone is the big benefit of voip, however, if you worry about and can’t tolerate occasional poor call quality, uptime and call drops, or those occuring during 911 calls, then you may want to keep traditional phone service, or have cell service  as a back up.voip works best on modern ip phones, which can provide all the great calling features that can come with voip.  old pots phones can be used with an analog to ip adapter, but you run the risk that call features may not work and call quality and reliability could suffer.
