the incomparable florida keys -- from key largo, islamorada and marathon on to key west -- provide unsurpassed adventure opportunities to work up appetites. as a culinary outpost most distant from the mainland and just 90 miles from cuba, key west cuisine extends far beyond "cheeseburger in paradise" fare or key lime pie. caribbean and cuban influences are evident all over the town including main drag duval street where chefs get creative with fresh seafood, citrus and produce grown in greater miami's redlands area. actress kelly mcgillis' kelly's caribbean bar, grill & brewery serves beer made on premises and sloppy joe's keeps up traditions dating from hemingway's days as a regular. islamorada eateries like squid row and ziggie's conch restaurant pack in crowds as do places like the stuffed pig on marathon. with rare exceptions, "casual" is the byword throughout the so-called conch republic, no matter what the cuisine, from seafood and steak to italian, latin, cuban, or spanish.
