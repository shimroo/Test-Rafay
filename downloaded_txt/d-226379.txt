  enjoy the taste sensation of grilled mackerel

season’s grilled mackerel in olive oil provides a subtle smoky flavor to your favorite canned mackerel fillets. the wild-caught mackerel are sustainably harvested in the atlantic ocean just off the moroccan coast. the mild, meaty fillets are brimming to the gills with nutrients, including omega-3 fatty acids.
buying premium canned mackerel is a smart way to fill your food cupboard. the lightly grilled mackerel is the perfect way to add flavor to a pasta dish or stew and is subtle enough to toss with your lunchtime salad or eat straight from the jar. the versatility of mackerel makes it an ideal snacking choice. when tinned, it’s easy to carry in your gym bag, luggage or handbag for a nutritious meal on the go. check out our canned mackerel for sale to buy your delicious, nutritious, certified wild-caught grilled mackerel today!
