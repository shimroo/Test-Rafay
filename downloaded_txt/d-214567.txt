prairie du chien documentary






life along the mississippi river defines this area - from historical significance to the way it shapes the people that call it home.
so what transcends time in a river town like prairie du chien? despite all of the changes that modern life brings, are there still ways that people can connect with the past? and how does an area that offers so much opportunity for self-sustainability also connect as a community?
dan moris explores these questions and more with prairie du chien residents, sharing their experience and perspective on what has made life in this river town so special.  >> view this documentary
