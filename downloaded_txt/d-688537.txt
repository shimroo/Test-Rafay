hour of the heartirvin d. yalom and benjamin yalom facing memory loss as he approached 90, irvin yalom was forced to vastly reconsider his sessions with patients. rather than throw in the towel, he revolutionized his prac­tice, focusing on what might be achieved in a one-hour, one-time-only meeting between patient and practitioner.in hour of the heart, yalom recounts some of these intense, life-changing consultations, as well as changes to his memory and sense of self. these stories show how a therapist’s willingness to be open helps patients let down their own guards, leading to deeper and more immediate connection. life is precious and our time together short. written in collaboration with his son, hour of the heart shows us how to relate better in the moment, with more honesty and vulnerability.
