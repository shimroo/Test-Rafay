road trip with rover





is a trip to the vet your dog’s idea of a car ride?  broaden your friend's horizons, and lessen his neurosis, with mini-road trips.if your dog only travels in the car to go to the vet or other angst ridden locations, start slowly, beginning with short trips to the dog park or to a friend’s house. once your dog begins to associate the car with pleasant outings, increase the length of the ride.try not to feed your dog a few hours before you travel. a full stomach may intensify upset if your pet is prone to motion sickness. if your dog does exhibit signs of motion sickness, such as excessive drooling, park the car and go for a brief stroll.never leave your dog in your car unattended. this is especially true during the hot months when temperatures rise rapidly in a closed car. even opening the window slightly does not allow sufficient air to circulate. dogs left in hot cars can suffer heat stroke or even death.keep a few treats with you for the ride and give your pet a reward. stopping for lunch at the drive through? enjoy your meal while your pet enjoys her treat.for warm days and longer trips, take along water for your dog to drink and a spray bottle filled with water for a quick pooch pick-me-up. remember to pull over every few hours for a bathroom break and leg stretch.if your dog insists on sticking his head out the window for the aux natural feel, make certain he is wearing goggles or secure eye protection.put your dog on his leash before exiting the car to help avoid quick uncontrolled escapes.buckle up. invest in a dog harness, seat belt restraint, car seat or crate for your dog.the doggie car booster seat from www.dogclothes-apparel.com is the perfect solution to safely satisfy your pet's natural urge to look out the window. the seat easily attaches to your car's passenger seat and includes an adjustable safety harness for for added protection.

insuring your dog





all told, only 5% of american pet owners have pet insurance, with the average life time cost totaling between $2,000 to $7,000 for the life of your pet. here are a few points to consider before purchasing pet insurance.consider your finances before jumping in. take a moment to consider your approach to dog care costs. if you would drop everything and spend your last penny to save your dog, health insurance is a good consideration. if on the other hand, you have the money on hand to take care of costly pet health issues, you may consider paying on an as needed basis versus a monthly insurance payment.before purchasing pet insurance, talk to you vet. ask if he/she accepts insurance and which companies seem to be the most reputable.premiums vary by company, type of dog and lifestyle (outdoor dogs vs. indoor dogs). premiums are generally less expensive for puppies and younger, healthier adult dogs than for those with pre-existing conditions or dogs advanced in age. some companies will not cover animals older than 8 years unless they were covered prior to that age.many companies offer a variety of policies. check and compare what each policy covers and the associated costs such as premiums, co-pays and deductibles before enrolling. also, look for any fine print which may exclude your pet for any previous illness or condition.investigate if the insurance has a list of pre-approved veterinarians/hospitals to which you may take your dog or are you free to visit any licensed practitioner you choose?what is the payment policy? does the insurance require the bill be paid in full first and then provide reimbursement? if so, what methods are available to file a claim and how long after filing should you receive a check ?make certain the pet insurance company is registered with your state department.inquire if the insurance company has a cap on the amount paid on an annual or per incident basis. some insurance companies will also place a limit on the amount paid over the course of your pet’s life. do they offer discounts for multiple pets?decide if you want a full service plan which covers routine care or a plan which covers emergencies and major procedures.if you can’t afford pet insurance, consider contacting a humane organization for financial aid for some of your larger dog related bills or look for a program which offers discounts on pet care. consult your vet or pet vendor for programs which may offer additional cost savings.these revolutionary all natural dental chews contain no plastics and are completely edible. each chew is specially designed to address a different aspect of your dog’s dental hygiene. the nutri dent “toothbrush” cleans teeth by removing plaque and tarter. the ridges of the chew ‘n floss massage gums while flossing between teeth. the chew ‘n fresh contains essential oils to maintain breath fresh. each chew contains chlorophyll and macro-nutrients in a veterinarian recommended formula. available at http://www.dogclothes-apparel.com/

your dog’s house





whether indoors or out, your dog will enjoy having his own space. here are points to consider as you go in search of a dog house.make certain the doghouse has nontoxic paint, especially if your dog likes to chew.if the dog house is located outdoors, consider purchasing a house with a hinged roof or side to allow for easy access and cleaning.  for indoor houses, a removable, washable floor pad .if you choose to line the floor, avoid products which may become moldy or items such as newsprint which can run, discolor your pet’s fur, or cause an allergic reaction. remember to clean the dog house regularly.consider ventilation. look for windows and doors which allow good air flow.measure the dog house to make certain it is large enough for you pet to fit comfortably. dogs depend on their body heat to warm confined spaces. if the house is too large, your dog will be unable to heat the space and may become cold. for a proper fit, your dog should be able to stand and turn around without touching the sides.point the front opening away from oncoming winds. for additional protection, attach strips of overlapping plastic over the front door to keep out the elements and unwanted insects.purchase a dog house with a slanted or pitched roof so rain and snow slide off.during flea and tick season, lightly spray the inside of the house with weekly with repellant. make certain to let fumes clear before your dog enters.perfect for the indoor small dog, the paw prints collapsible dog house from www.dogclothes-apparel.com provides a stylish and comfortable place for your loved one. fully cushioned on all sides for firm support. strong when assembled, heavy duty velcro fasteners allow it to disassemble in seconds for easy mobility. this little house is great for protecting your pet from drafts and giving them the security they love.
