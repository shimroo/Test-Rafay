there are a number of rare livestock breeds currently found in  new zealand.  these range from breeds for which numbers are so low that their survival is endangered, to minority breeds which need to be kept under surveillance.  the rare breeds conservation society of new zealand was formed to conserve, record and promote these breeds with the particular aim of maintaining genetic diversity within our livestock species.
