sw florida buyer advantage program





the ellis team at re/max realty group in fort myers has come up with a sw florida buyer advantage program you might want to know about.

the program offers many benefits to buyers.  the first is the open house pass.  this pass allows buyers to attend open houses without registering.  when buyers attend multiple open houses they have multiple agents calling and following-up with them.  this pass eliminates all that and puts other agents on notice that you're working with an ellis team professional.






the ellis team lists and sells a lot of property in southwest florida.  the buyer advantage program allows buyers to login and see listings we're working on before they're listed.  this is especially useful in a low inventory market like we have now.  it gives you a chance to get your ducks in a row so that when the property hits the market you're ready.  this kind of insider knowledge is great.



you can also search the mls on our website.  our website includes all the listings in mls and is updated daily.  some of the national websites are not and include outdated data.



if you'd like to speak with us over the pohne we can be reached at 239-489-4042

pending home sales nationwide fall slightly in august 2014





nationally pending home sales were down slightly,.  the sw florida real estate market stayed even despite lower inventory levels.



fort myers and cape coral pending sales fell to 1,228 which was down 2.5% from last year.  this is good news as pending sales would be up if we had more inventory to sell, so this isn't a demand issues as much as it is a supply issue.

the complete national pending home sales fall slightly article can be found here.

median days on market are down.
