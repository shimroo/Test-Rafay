this coverage viewer provides a high-level approximation of wireless voice and data coverage. there are gaps in coverage that are not shown by this high-level approximation. actual coverage may differ from map graphics and may be affected by terrain, weather, foliage, buildings and other construction, signal strength, high-usage periods, customer equipment, and other factors. cricket does not guarantee coverage. our coverage maps are not intended to show actual customer performance on the network, nor are they intended to show future network needs or build requirements inside or outside of existing cricket coverage areas. coverage maps also may include areas served by unaffiliated carriers and may depict licensed areas rather than an approximation of coverage.
