							i purchased your book on ohio dissolution of marriage a while back. i had no knowledge of legal anything! i read it carefully and did exactly what you said to do. when i went for my hearing on friday, the magistrate took my papers and asked me where i had gotten the forms. i told her it was from elawpak and she said that they were the best forms for ohio that she had seen. then, after the hearing was over, she commended me on the way i had filled out the forms and had done everything correctly, and that it was one of the best sets of forms she had ever had in her court from a person who was not a lawyer. this made a tough time, easier for me and saved me a lot of money! thanks a lot for all the help!

							your site is full of great products (name change, living will) that worked perfectly here in sunny florida. also, the "downloading" option is the best - you can type it like a paralegal - ha, ha.
