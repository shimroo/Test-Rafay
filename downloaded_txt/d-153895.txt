southern wesleyan university
southern wesleyan university was originally established in 1906 as the wesleyan methodist bible institute whose mission was to develop christian character in its students while giving thorough intellectual training. now, a private, four year christian university, southern wesleyan university is committed to providing liberal arts and professional education. in addition, we are proud to be an institution of the wesleyan church, a worldwide body of evangelical protestant believers. though our name has changed over the years, our mission—to be a christian community of learners that recognizes god as the source of all truth and wisdom—has remained.
