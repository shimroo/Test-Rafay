what our
customers say






~i asked diane to lighten my hair and the color she chose to do my highlights is beautiful. she also colored my roots so that the highlights would be the focus of the hair. everything she did matches my skin tone perfectly. thank you, diane! i can‚Äôt wait to tell you how many compliments i receive!








~jackie and assistant were excellent! gave me very good advice on styling options and did an excellent job executing trim. color was excellent as well. both jackie and assistant were extremely pleasant. this was my first visit and definitely plan to return!
