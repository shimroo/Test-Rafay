what people are saying





robin's 35 years of experience truly shows. we could not have chose a better realtor. she was on the ball 24/7, day or night. any property requested she made happen, sometimes getting us an appointment the very next day. this was key given most homes in the current market were selling within a day or two. in the end she helped us score a beautiful first home at a time when the market was immensely competitive. given her extensive experience, chances are she has worked with any seller's agent you may run into. if you are looking for a realtor that makes buying a home a breeze choose robin mckeon!

ï»¿dear robin and richard, 

thank you for your professional, friendly and patient assistance in helping us find our new home in haverhill, ma. the market today has its challenges and your team met all of them with experience, wisdom and guidance that helped us make decisions that will affect our lives for years to come. our home is beautiful and the âdealâ we were able to make a win win for both parties making it an even more pleasant experience. from our first meeting to the closing and even after with your follow up gifts and calls it was smooth sailing.

we look forward to working with you again and to recommending you to our friends, family and business associates.

sincerely,

catherine and young soo chang

robin is easy to work with, she was fully prepared for our initial meeting prior to listing our home. she provided valuable information to ensure a smooth process and kept us informed along the way. our home was listed and under agreement quickly. i highly recommend using her office.

we dealt with robin, and debbie (part of the office staff), and were very impressed. she helped us very much throughout the process (it's been decades since we sold a house, and things have changed).

robin sold my condo and assisted with purchase of new condo. she was there with me every step of the way. always available, understanding and kind. i enjoyed working with her and felt comfortable "knowing" professional guidance.

i recently sold my home and bought another with the assistance of mckeon-corcoran real estate (my sisters firm). the last time i sold&bought a home was in 2006 and many things have changed since then. they were very professional and provided step-by-step assistance through the whole selling and  buying process. from providing invaluable guidance on staging the house for a successful marketing campaign and then conducting a successful open house â it made the selling process very easy. their office staff were very helpful in providing recurring feedback and support â i would highly recommend mckeon-corcoran real estate

robin was recommended to me buy a relative that i knew had a good amount of experience with real estate people. there was no second choice. she just said robin was the best one out there. it takes a lot to impress me. my first impression was like meeting general george patton. i knew that i could  walk away and come back for the closing. i've never met anyone so right for the job that they do. except me maybe? i am and will be forever grateful.

robin has years of experience and knowledge and it was great to feel that she would take care of the sale of my home. she is friendly and personable and answered any questions that came up along the way in a very timely manner.
          nicole m sammartino 








robin was the realtor who sold my home for me in less than a week. she also represented me with the purchase of my new home. robin is highly skilled and totally professional. she handled both sales with ease for me. she was in top of everything that needed to be done every step of the way. i  would highly recommend robin mckeon to anyone looking to sell or buy.
