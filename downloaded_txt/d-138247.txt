adam-12″ debuted in the fall of 1968, bringing a vision of humanity and friendliness to the lapd’s authoritative blue uniform. the show was created by bob cinader and driven by the creator of television’s “dragnet”, jack webb. kent mccord, who portrayed officer jim reed states that his fan base often echoes this simple yet profound sentiment: “i became a police officer because of you.













the onion field is a 1973 nonfiction book by joseph wambaugh, a sergeant for the los angeles police department, chronicling the kidnapping of two plainclothes lapd officers by a pair of criminals during a traffic stop and the subsequent murder of one of the officers.













the north hollywood shootout was a confrontation between two heavily armed and armored bank robbers, larry phillips jr. and emil mătăsăreanu, and members of the los angeles police department (lapd) in the north hollywood district of los angeles, california, on february 28, 1997. 

















































the board of police commissioners and the police department were established by the los angeles city charter effective july 1, 1925. as head of the department, the board of police commissioners sets policies, oversees department operations and works in conjunction with the chief of police, who acts as the chief executive officer and reports to the board.
