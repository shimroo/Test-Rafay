please don't be

discouraged 


by some of our 




daily links.
		

we make them 


available mainly 


as a reminder 


to seek peace 


and security, 


not in worldly

governments, 

but in 

jesus christ. 


when all seems 


well, it's easy to
		

rely on human 


strength and 


wisdom. 

but when we 


face the realities
		

of our changing 


world and fragile

freedoms, 


we are reminded 


to seek more

lasting security.

 to stand firm

in our faith and 


confident in his 


truth, we need 


to understand

 our times and 


trust god. 


jesus said, 


"in the world 


you will have

tribulation,

but be of 


good cheer;

 i have 


overcome 


the world."

 john 16:33 




		his victory 









 jesus said,


"these things 
			i have spoken to you that in me you may have peace. in the world you 
			will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, i have overcome the 
			world." 
john 16:33








welcome, dear friends!

long ago, one of god's faithful servants saw 
		the crossroad ahead and showed us the only safe pathway through an 
		immoral world. joshua encouraged god's people to follow truth, avoid 
		compromise, and shun their neighbors' earth-centered spirituality. his 
		words clash with today's demand for unity, consensus and global values. 
		but they fit our times. 



"... choose for 
			yourselves this day whom you will serve. but as for me and my house, 
			we will serve the lord." joshua 24:15



the crossroad -- the way of the cross -- may 
		be rocky and narrow, and it will never merge with the crowded 
		superhighway nudging the masses toward a global village. but no other 
		way leads to genuine love, peace, and lasting security. the destination 
		is well worth the struggle:



"eye has not seen, 
			nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man, the things 
			which god has prepared for those who love him ." 1 corinthians 2:9 




we hope to provide vital facts and biblical 
		encouragement that will help you prepare for a global union that shows 
		little tolerance for christian faith. you will find resources that 
		demonstrate and document -- 



 the cultural shift from a christian to 
			a global paradigm. 


 the classroom shift from fact and 
			logic to feeling and imagination. 


 the growing acceptance of a code of 
			ethics that bans biblical truth.


 how movies, television and classrooms 
			promote a global spirituality. 


 why the "consensus process" turn young 
			and old against absolute truth. 


 why many christians are conforming to 
			this transformational process. 





today's transformation calls for many such 
		on his promises. when we trust and follow him, he will lead us in his 
		triumph -- no matter what challenges we face. (2 corinthians 2:14) 
		remember what god told joshua: 



"be strong and of 
			good courage; do not be afraid, nor be dismayed, for the lord your 
			god is with you wherever you go." joshua 1:9

notes: 

1. since we use microsoft's 
		old frontpage program, some of our formatting is incompatible with 
		google chrome and other programs. for example, the above column of 
		pictures is evenly spaced on frontpage but may be distorted by chrome. 
		please be patient with us as we try to find a solution. 

2.all but two of the books 
		pictured above are written by friends who allow me to quote from their 
		books and share their insights. those books are sold by their 
		publishers, not by us.

3. please feel free to copy, 
		post and share any of our articles that might encourage you and your 
		friends. we don't copyright our material, since it's only by god's 
		wonderful grace that we can provide them. we just want him to use what 
		he gives us to equip others for the changes and challenges that lie 
		ahead. (that offer does not apply to our many guest authors whose 
		articles are copyrighted.) 

4.thank you for your letters! 
		i try to read all the message i receive. but though i answer as many as 
		i can each day, there never seems to be enough time to finish. i am so 
		sorry! yet, i know that our wonderful lord reigns in the midst of my 
		limitations. may he richly bless all of you with his comfort, wisdom, 
		strength and loving presence.
