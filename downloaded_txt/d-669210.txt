growth in disability studies programs





a movement towards disability studies  has begun to build momentum.  over the past decade, graduate study  programs at universities across  the nation have started to develop specific courses of study to better  understand mental and physical impairments. from georgetown university  to the california baptist university, these courses are being defined as  a holistic study  of the phenomenon of disability through a  multidisciplinary approach (i).topics addressed include the  social, cultural, and political role disability has played in society.  students learn the role people with disabilities have played in the  development and implementation of several disciplines, from literature  to social policy. such programs aim to arm students with a knowledge  base that will increase disability awareness and, ultimately, promote  social change. the emergence of disability studies programs is important  for at least two reasons.first, disability awareness will only  grow as these professionals enter society after completing their courses  of study. georgetown university explains that a critical component of  their master of professional studies in disability studies program is to  provide students with the tools to educate and increase awareness  across various audiences (ii). graduates will attain the skill of  communicating disability awareness and tolerance to a variety of  audiences upon graduation, an invaluable skill necessary in spreading  the message for any subject. in this way, graduates will have the  ability to communicate awareness and tolerance to demographically or  otherwise starkly differing groups of people. this promotes the  proliferation of disability education by increasing the effectiveness  with which it is taught. more effective disability education, in short,  paves the way for awareness and understanding.more importantly,  however, it is a sign that large scale social change is on the way. the  near future will see a growing population of working professionals with a  deep understanding of different disabilities, across a range of  different societal and historical contexts. these professionals will be  instrumental in helping to assimilate those with disabilities into the  workforce, in counseling persons with disabilities and their families,  and in furthering the field of disability education and research.  moreover, the growing number of disability studies courses and the  bodies that fill their lecture halls illustrate a growing interest and  empathy for persons with disabilities, a critical component to spreading  awareness.the trend in disability studies programs is indicative  of a growing number of working professionals with substantial  disability training and education. this translates to narrowing the gap  between those with a disability, and those without. graduates will have  the resources and experience to collaborate with individuals with  disabilities, helping them to become active community members. business  owners must take note of the growing number of disability studies  programs and their resulting societal implications. these graduate  schools, for example, represent prime recruiting outlets for human  resource departments, managers, and other professional positions.  disability study program graduates serve exemplary consultants, as well,  for businesses looking to implement inclusion training to solidify  their company culture.
