student highlights















“soundview has helped me to become a positive citizen and leader by giving me tasks  relating to the real work in which i’d have to apply both my knowledge and personal understanding. i was introduced to open mindedness, key values, a supportive community, and access to amazing resources and people to talk to. never in my life have i been to a school that’s encouraged the things that soundview has, and i’m extremely grateful for the values and ideals i have been taught along the way. i have learned about the importance of reflection, how i can reflect on things and move forward with that knowledge to apply to the next problem (building of wisdom), the importance of being a team player (building of collaboration skills and teamwork), and so much more.”
— angelina - soundview graduate 2023 (current 10th grader at university prep)
