our commitment
abc driving school has a fantastic safety record.
our instructors and trainers have the required skills and knowledge to correctly assess the skills level of each learner driver and to individualise the training in various road traffic environments that match, challenge and build on the level of skill.
our light rigid training program has moved to westmead. here we can cater for nsw ambulance paramedics, school or community bus drivers and those who want to begin their next adventure in a motorhome.
our truck driver trainers and assessors have years of industry experience, but they won’t bore you with stories of crossing the nullarbor – your day will be filled with useful tips that will help to make you job ready. your first contact with the booking office will probably include a ‘needs analysis’. just a few questions to help us to understand what you want the licence for and which of our assessors will have the most relevant experience.

faq



what is the difference between a 'condition b' and an 'open' licence?

this refers to the mr, hr and hc licence classes. a ‘condition b’ is placed on your licence when the course is completed in a truck with either an automatic or synchromesh transmission. the licence holder is not licenced to drive a vehicle with a constantmesh (or roadranger) gearbox.





what is the highest licence i can upgrade to from my car licence?

from the car (class c) it is possible to go to lr, mr or hr. you should consider your needs as you may find the higher the licence class, the more difficult you will find the training and your costs may increase.





i am joining nsw ambulance - can i do the course in an automatic vehicle.

yes, in nsw the lr licence does not note what transmission was used for the licence upgrade.





can i get an unrestricted licence with abc driving school?

yes you can – we have an 18-speed nissan ud ready to take you once you have passed the knowledge test at the rms





how do i get my hc licence?

as long as you have held your mr or hr licence for a minimum of 12 months – you can apply to complete the hc knowledge test and then undertake training and assessment.





can i upgrade my licence while i am on p plates?

red p’s – no
green p’s – yesâ  (first year lr or mr) (second year hr)
