											what information is available on eye diseases in the aging population?
									 	

macular degeneration
macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in those over 55. this degenerative condition is related to the macula, the center of the retina. it is responsible for acute vision, focusing, reading, driving and fine work. there are two types of macular degeneration, wet and dry. most are afflicted with the dry or atrophic type. between 70-90 per cent of those with the condition have the dry. in this type, the macula atrophies or thins out and vision is lost. most times one eye is affected but both eyes eventually are affected.the wet type causes 90 percent of its sufferers to lose their vision. abnormal blood vessels within and beneath the retina begin to bleed and leak fluid. these become opaque and ultimately scar tissue forms.

											what information is available on eye diseases in the aging population?
									 	

aging eyes
many age related eye problems are treatable if detected early enough. it is so important that regular visits to the eye doctor are a part of every senior citizen's schedule. the doctor can check for the most common conditions such as cataracts, macular degeneration, glaucoma or other conditions associated with high blood pressure, diabetes and the like. the eye exam allows the doctor to get a benchmark for your eyes which will allow him to keep track of any changes that occur.

											what about seniors who are incontinent?
									 	

bedwetting
incontinence is an all too common function on old age. bedwetting can occur due to illness, medication, stress or other conditions. there are matress covers available and disposable pads to cover the sheets. in addition, adult diapers are available at drug stores. be certain to change wet diapers or pads as moisture will encourage rashes or wounds.
