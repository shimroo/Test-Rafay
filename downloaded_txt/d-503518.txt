2022 -2023 - i have been working on my writing so there hasn't 
			been much going on to update this website. free polymer clay 
			tutorials can be found at these links: 


tutes - new from 
			2003


biz-archive - 1999-2003 (basics) 
			nothing to do with business, just the older website attached to the 
			newer one. the older the tutorials the more rough my skill set. 
			
 




november 1, 2024: i thought i had updated my homepage when i 
			finished nanowrimo in 2023. evidently i didn't. so, i'm putting this 
			picture of my 2023 certificate on my homepage right now and then i'm 
			going to go start my project for this year. i know there's a 
			lot of debate on whether to use nanowrimo because of some issues in 
			the forums for minors and a statement from nanowrimo with condoning 
			the use of ai (artificial intelligence) with regards to word count.
after giving it some thought i decided neither of these issues 
			pertain to me. i've been using nanowrimo since 2017 and it has been 
			the best thing that's happened to me in my writing life since i got 
			my ba in english literature at san francisco state university. i am 
			going to continue to use the nanowrimo website. i haven't seen any 
			replacements for the nanowrimo website that i find satisfactory. 
			everyone needs to make up their own mind about using the nanowrimo 
			website. i've made my decision to continue.

nanowrimo
  prep: 





penpals are sculptures made around a bic pen. this is one of 
			my favorites because it is also a review of flowers and leaves. 
			links to relevant tutorials with the pictures.

  the conservative route with flesh colored clay, curing between body sculpting
  and adding tls clothing. lots of curing, sanding and filing. 





future rambles about nanowrimo 
			will be indexed on this
			nanowrimo section 
	  of the bonsai trailer court.
			 



april 2023 campnanowrimo 50k+ 
			words: this campnanowrimo effort was spent experimenting on weird 
			short stories inspired by h.p. lovecraft and other speculative 
			fiction writers. it was the first departure from the k-rave universe 
			that i've been wandering about in since 2017. i'm still editing the 
			short stories but when i am done i will add a few in the
			 bonsai trailer court.
			




april 2023 update: the thumbdrive 
			used to store this content was corrupted. i lost all of the new 
			content. i learned not to store new content on only one location.
			11-29-2022: nanowrimo 50k words.
			k-rave: the saga continues. the new content focused on the occult 
			community. what is the difference between root doctors, hoo doo, voo 
			doo, or witch craft? what is the difference between the occult and a 
			cult? 







4-29-2022: camp nanowrimo 50k words. this nanowrimo 
			effort was a resurrection of the 
rambles, 
			from 1999 to 2013. or there abouts. mostly the rambles about the 
			philosophy of being an artist. pep talks on how to over come the 
			fear.
