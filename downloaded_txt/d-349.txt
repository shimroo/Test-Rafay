a message from the executive director
north penn legal services is proud of the important work that all our staff and volunteers do every day with clients in urgent need. we help them solve the most urgent and time-sensitive civil legal problems, and assist the self-represented as they seek access to justice.
almost 400,000 people live at or below 125% of poverty in northeast pennsylvania. at least 50% will deal with two or three civil legal challenges each year. the most serious problems affect their health, safety, housing, food security, and financial ability to care for themselves and their families.
we welcome you to our website, and encourage you to consider applying for legal services online or by telephone, donating to assist us with this work, volunteering as a pro bono partner, or reading information about the many areas of civil law.
