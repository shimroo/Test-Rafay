kleen blade management system
complimenting the existing range of safety products the kleen blade management system allows for effortless safe attachment and removal of surgical blades from a standard handle. the system which incorporates a quality swann-morton surgical blade is designed to operate with most no.3 and no.4 standard surgical handles already in circulation within the hospital system thus minimising disruption and cost during the conversion process. the blade is supplied sterile inside a protective sliding sheath which covers the blade completely thus assisting with accident free handling. the sheath fully exposes the surgical blade when in use with an intuitive lock which prevents any forward movement of the sheath during the procedure. easy to detach the bms encapsulates the contaminated sharp which is still visible for the final count and to help ensure safe and responsible disposal. u.s.patent no. 8,931,181.

surgical blade remover






the swann-morton blade remover allows for safe and easy removal of all sizes of scalpel blade from both no.3 and no.4 handles. supplied sterile it allows the device to be included on the instrument tray within the or and to be used at the site of the invasive procedure. the transparent nature of the material allows for 100% accountability of the blades used during the surgical procedure, each one safely encapsulated within an individual remover which may then be disposed of in an appropriate sharps bin or container. if accidentally dropped on the theatre floor the blade remover can be safely picked up with a gloved hand unlike if you dropped the unprotected dirty blade itself where sticky tape or a magnet may have to be used to retrieve it.
