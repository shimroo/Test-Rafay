custom mosaics fabrication 



we work in a variety of methods of mosaic fabrication, we work with the old world style using smalti glass or smalto glass to create the design in a gamma of colors to match the design or concept. we work with smalto glass that can be cut or used to create a pixel like design that allows for very interesting and economical designs. we also work with marble and river rock which can be very laborious and has a smaller palette of colors.  







 











art direction 



we begin by creating a concept and color schema for your project once the design for the custom mosaics is decided on and we talk about colors and style for your project. this is can be the most exciting and challenging portion of the process of artistry in mosaics 







 







installation 



working with skilled master installers to bring the final touch to custom mosaics, specializing in pool applications is a large portion of our work but we also install kitchens, bathrooms, flooring using our mosaic applications. decorative pool mosaics, custom mosaic tile, custom mosaic tile sheets, custom mosaic backsplash
