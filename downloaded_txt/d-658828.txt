association for safe alternatives in childbirthhelping families have better births



image by vannessa brown photography














the association for safe alternatives in childbirth envisions a world in which every person gives birth with dignity, and experiences an empowered transition into parenthood, allowing their children to have the best start possible to their lives. we are part of a growing network of parents and health professionals who believe that childbirth is a normal and healthy part of life, of special significance to the pregnant parent and their family.asac was created to encourage alternatives to the technological approach. we believe parents have the right and the responsibility to make informed choices about childbirth and that a full range of options should be available to them – in the hospital, at home, in a birthing centre, and with professional caregivers of their choice.  we are particularly oriented toward midwifery, and we are based in edmonton, alberta, canada.
