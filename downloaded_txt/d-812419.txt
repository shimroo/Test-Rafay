how we do it























the mission of the leatherback trust is to protect leatherback turtles, other endangered sea turtles, freshwater turtles and their ecosystems through conservation, research, management and education.eastern pacific leatherback turtles are critically endangered. this population of sea turtles has declined by more than 98% since 1990. we are working to reverse this trend by tackling the 5 most deadly threats to leatherbacks and other sea turtles around the world. our scientists conduct research at nesting beaches and at sea, collecting critical data to support conservation interventions. we partner with communities to protect nesting beaches and work with governments to inform sustainable development and fisheries management priorities.
