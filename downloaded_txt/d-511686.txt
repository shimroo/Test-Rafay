   we use the best balloons but we can not give any guarantee on any balloons used  outside 
‟balloons are, by nature, temporary items: although we here at dino's use only the finest quality balloons, some balloons will occasionally deflate sooner than expected and will also be adversely affected by the wind, rain, rough handling,   sunlight, and other uncontrollable factors.” 
 please keep in mind that extreme heat speeds up the balloon osmosis process.   so, in high temperatures, helium will escape much faster than normal,   drastically reducing float time. if you can find a way to provide shade for the   balloons, it can slow the process. use light-colored balloons and avoid using   dark colors. for instance white balloons deflect the sun and fade less.
