hello, gardening friends and native 
		plant lovers:

i am knee deep in an 
				exciting new project: i'm converting this website into a book
--a very large book--
that 
		will be available in print or ebook.
this is a massive 
				undertaking; it will consume months. i will spend my 75th year 
				taking wally's knowledge into a new dimension. i hope to find 
				completion before i turn 76 next february. 
until the book is done, this website will be here 
		for you. i will post information as it arises.
although i'm no longer creating our emag, the 
				northwest native plant journal, all the previous issues are still here. read online, download, print a copy for your 
		bookshelf or to share with your neighbor.
				click 
		here to go.good 
				luck, good gardening!









 






for everything, 
				there is a season . . . 




 








native plant 
		picture library






did you know there 
				are over 26,000 photos of northwest native plants in our 
				graphics library that you may use at no charge?
how do we do that? 
				simple, thanks to a non-profit organization, creative commons, 
				there are now licenses that a human can read and understand 
				allowing anyone with photos of a number of topics that may be 
				used by anyone for any purpose for free as long you give credit 
				to the photographer. also, if you "remix, transform or build 
				upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under 
				the same license as the original." below is one of the licenses, 
				this is the one we use. all the details can be seen at
				
				https://creativecommons.org/
our website,
				www.nwplants.com, and the 
				online magazine are both created by me. photos you see on these 
				two publications are either from our in-house photo library or 
				are used with permission of the owner. i do not identify 
				photographers from our library, but do give credit to the owners 
				of outside pictures.
so--if you see a 
				picture you'd like to use, take a copy. on the species pages, 
				i've shown thumbnails for our library photos so you can download 
				higher resolutions.
i like to enter 
				whatever description is needed and then add the creditation. 
				when you use any of our pictures, add: "photo credit: the wild 
				garden, www.nwplants.com"

good stuff to
                know (our most often- asked questions)




no,
                we are not a nursery originally
                our website was all about a native plant nursery, wallace w
                hansen northwest native plants. but in 2011, all that changed
                when the nursery closed its doors for good. we felt it was imperative
                to preserve the vast amount of native
                plant information, so the website morphed from a commercial
                entity into what you see today: an ever-expanding non-profit
                repository of information about plants native to the pacific
                northwest. we dont have plants, we dont sell anything, we
                do share everything we know about native plants.
if
                you have questions about native plants, if theres a plant you
                want help identifying, if you have thoughts or photos youd
                like to share, heres how to contact us:

about wally



                            (how i met the garden's master)







							once upon an autumn weekend (i think it was around 
							1995), a fellow gardener and i planned to visit a 
							nursery close to salem, oregon. i'd found a small ad 
							in the local newspaper's classifieds offering native 
							plants for sale. the idea of including natives in 
							our gardens was novel and intriguing. i was sparsely
