wallace
d. wattles

(1860-1911)

pioneer
success writer  










wallace delois wattles wrote a
number of books including health through new thought and
fasting,
the science of getting rich, the science of being great, the
science of being well, and a novel, hellfire harrison,
but it is for his prosperity classic, the science of getting
rich that he is best known. 
little is known about wattles'
life. he was born in the usa shortly after the civil war, and
experienced
much failure in his earlier years. later in his life he took to
studying
the various religious beliefs and philosophies of the world including
those
of descartes, spinoza, leibnitz, schopenhauer, hegel, swedenborg,
emerson, and
others.
it was through his tireless study and experimentation that he
discovered
the truth of new thought principles and put them into practice in his
own
life. he began to write books outlining these principles. he practiced
the technique of creative visualisation and as his daughter florence
relates,
"he wrote almost constantly. it was then that he formed his mental
picture. he saw himself as a successful writer, a personality of power,
an advancing man, and he began to work toward the realization of this
vision.
he lived every page ... his life was truly the powerful life."

elizabeth towne, in her
magazine
nautilus, published
the
articles of wallace d. wattles in almost every issue in the early
1900's and until
his untimely death in 1911. here are excerpts from a letter written to
mrs.towne by his daughter, florence, shortly after his death.
she writes: 


 

 

my
dear mrs. towne,

your letter of the 14th received . . . perhaps a little later i can
write
the romantic story of my father's life and make it really worthwhile.
you
knew, didn't you, that he lost a good position in the methodist church
because of his "heresy"?


he met george d. herron at a convention of reformers in chicago in 1896
and caught herron's social vision. i shall never forget the morning he
came home. it was christmas. mother had put her last dollar into a cuff
box and we had placed it

beneath an evergreen branch which served for our christmas tree and
which
we had illuminated with tallow candles and strung with popcorn. finally
father came. with that beautiful smile he praised the tree, said the
cuff
box was just what he had been wanting - and took us all in his arms to
tell us of the wonderful social message of jesus, the message which he
later embodied in "a new christ."


from that day until his death he worked unceasingly to realize the
glorious
vision of human brotherhood.
for years his life was cursed by poverty and the fear of poverty. he
was
always scheming and planning to get for his family those things which
make
the abundant life possible.


in the first chapter of "how to be a genius" he says: "man's
greatest happiness is found in the bestowal of benefits on those he
loves."
the supreme faith of the man never left him; never for a moment did he
lose confidence in the power of the master intelligence to right every
wrong and to give to every man and woman his or her share of the good
things
of life.


when we came to elwood (indiana) three years ago, father began a sunday
night lectureship inn indianapolis. this was our only source of income.
later he began to write for nautilus and to word out his own
philosophy.
he wrote almost constantly. then it was that he formed his mental
picture.
he saw himself as a successful writer, a personality of power, an
advancing
man, and he began to work toward the realization of this vision . . . .
he lived every page of "how to be a genius." in the last three
years he made lots of money, and had good health, except for his
extreme
frailty.


i have written this hurriedly, but i think it will give you an idea of
the life struggle of a great man - his failure and success. his life
was
truly the powerful life, and surely we can say, at least in elwood,
"the
name of him who loved his fellow men led all the rest."


with all good wishes, i am,

very sincerely,

florence a. wattles





wattles' best known book, the
science of getting rich
is a down-to-earth, clear-cut and practical guide. a mental and
spiritual
approach on how to become rich. no bones about it, when you follow the
thoughts presented in this book, you too will become rich, without the
feelings of guilt. as a matter of fact, the author writes that the
poverty-stricken
(and even the middle class) should be the ones to feel guilty by not
living
up to their true potential as thinking beings. 
wattles says his book is
"intended
for the men and women whose most pressing need is for money; who wish
to
get rich first, and philosophise afterward. it is pragmatical, not
philosophical;
a practical manual, not a lot of theory. it is for those who have, so
far,
found neither the time, the means, nor the opportunity to go deeply
into
the study of metaphysics, but who want prosperous results and who are
willing
to take the conclusions of science as a basis for action. 
"whatever may be said in
praise of poverty, the fact remains that it is not possible to live a
really
complete or successful life unless one is rich. you cannot rise to your
greatest possible height in talent or soul development unless you have
plenty of money. for to unfold your soul and to develop talent you must
have many things to use, and you cannot have these things unless you
have
money with which to buy them." 
wattles died not long after
the
1910 publication of the science of getting rich, but his books,
along with those of another well-known prosperity writer of that time,
orison swett marden,
have had a remarkable effect on people, and much of the success and
self-development
literature of the past 100 years by the likes of napolean hill, robert
schuller, anthony robbins, etc., owes a great debt to these two
writers.

dr. judith powell, a
recognized
wallace wattles expert, has updated wattles' works including: the
science
of becoming excellent and the science of well being. together with
the science of getting rich, this trilogy covers health, wealth
and happiness.
