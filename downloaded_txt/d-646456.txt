artistic
              murals by: tamara gerkin



"painting murals since 1994"




"where
the spirit does not work with the hand there is no art."   leonardo da vinci  

 










faux painted dome & side wall: 
				old world style  

   
				
  
				
 
				
   
				
   

 
in progress:  faux painted green 
				onyx from pakistan -trompe l'oeil columns (unfinished)

  
				
   
				
  
				
  
				

green onyx from pakistan is not commonly 
				found 
in homes. creating the look of green onyx from pakistan 
				with paint and brushes is even more uncommon. these columns will 
				be the only ones 
of their kind in america, perhaps even beyond 
				our boarders. what you see is the result of many layers of paint 
				combined with a traditional background in materials and 
				techniques of the old masters, and countless hours of work.  
				as soon as possible, i will be creating a web page for the 
				columns and dome that will show the different stages of each 
				project. so please come back soon...

 welcome

artistic mural 
					website!
 



 


painting and sculpting is my passion! i 
					strive not for perfection but rather for excellence in 
					creating artwork that is not only esthetically pleasing, but 
					also fires up the imagination and captures the eye. my work 
					is colorful, sometimes playful, but always with a serious 
					edge that serves to balance what is... and what is not...

thank you for visiting,
