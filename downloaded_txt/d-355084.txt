      today. she reads stories without books!" camper at rabbit stick

      the bluffs of the mississippi to the wind-swept prairie, comes taleypo the 
      storyteller. her stories will be sure to make you laugh, or cry, or think 
      or, maybe...see yourself. since 1981, marilyn kinsella has been telling 
      stories "from nursery schools to nursing homes." her stories are as varied 
      as her audiences. come sit by her fire. who knows...perhaps, coyote or 
      anansi will come for a visit.           updated :
