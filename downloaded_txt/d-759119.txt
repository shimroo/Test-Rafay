we are the sons of the beach (sobs) of south padre island, texas and we have acquired a small amount of fame in our tiny fishpond - mostly by creating eye-catching sand sculpture.	
we really know how to have fun on the beach and in a sand box. in fact, we can have fun any place there's sand. and the good news is that you can find sand just about anywhere.
not content to keep all the fun to ourselves, we are constantly searching for new ways to spread it around, either by displaying our skills or passing them on to others.we've written a book on how to build a better sand castle, designed and manufactured a set of sand carving tools to go with it and taught literally thousands of beach lovers how to build a better sand castle. our team of world-class master sculptors has built demo sculptures all over the planet. we specialize in sand advertising --  (beach billboards), beach wedding sand sculpture and we also offer a fun service to meeting planners - corporate team building exercises - on south padre island beaches.
we do some other things too - all of them fun.
