leave only footprints,
take only memories 



martha grew up in liberty and graduated from liberty high school. she married omar thompson, who owned and operated a greenhouse and nursery. in 1954 the thompsons purchased 53 acres of land, which is now the west section of the nature sanctuary.they enlisted the aid of audubon members to begin restoration of the property and martha worked with local attorney, conn withers, to establish her vision of the nature sanctuary.
