my attorney was/is dominic zambelli and from the very start, my experience with him was amazing. he explained what i needed to do for the case, the timeline, and put my mind at ease immediately. fast forward six months, my case is settled and i am very happy with the result. if you are ever, and i mean ever, looking for an honest, transparent, and diligent lawyer, call dgm&s and ask for dominic. you will not be disappointed.

 advocating for your rights
we are dedicated to providing exceptional legal representation and support to individuals who have been injured due to the negligence or wrongdoing of others. our experienced team of skilled attorneys is committed to fighting for your rights and ensuring you receive the compensation you deserve.
we are ready to fight for you
you’ve been injured and it wasn’t your fault, but now you’re racking up expensive medical treatments. health care is costly and those expenses can quickly overwhelm your resources.
fortunately, the law recognizes that you shouldn’t have to bear the consequences of another person’s negligence. you have to deal with the physical and emotional toll of an injury, but you don’t have to bear the financial cost. if you’re injured by the negligence of another party, you may be entitled to compensation for your medical expenses and other costs.
dyer, garofalo, mann & schultz have been fighting for the rights of injured parties for decades. we’ll fight to make sure you get the compensation you deserve. we can’t undo the injury, but we’ll work to ensure the party at fault foots the bill.
why hire an attorney?
of course, when you’re hurt or sick and struggling to make ends meet, the last thing you want to think about is hiring an attorney. they’re expensive, right? you don’t want to have to pay a huge legal bill on top of all your other expenses. who can afford to hire an attorney?
the answer is that anyone can afford a kentucky, indiana, or ohio personal injury lawyer. for personal injury and certain other types of cases, attorneys work on a contingent fee basis. that means you can afford experienced help on your side.
attorneys started to use contingent fee payments because they recognized that most people don’t have the resources to hire an attorney upfront, especially if they’re hurt and out of work. however, ordinary people who are hurt and out of work need the help of attorneys the most. a contingent fee lets you get the excellent representation you need to get the compensation you deserve, without putting a huge hole in your wallet.
