2024 msta member survey 
the missouri state teachers association surveyed its members on the state of the profession in january and february 2024. more than 2,300 members responded, including noncertified members, teachers, administrators and retired members. questions in the survey were designed to evaluate job satisfaction among missouri educators, identify pain points, learn about what is working well, and collect suggestions about how to improve public education from those who are working in missouri classrooms each day.
