new product development
fines separator for aggregates, sand & minerals
in construction industries stone metal (crushed stone) is main ingredient for cement concrete. in crushing process fine dust below 75 micron is generated . fine dust is having more surface area hence requires more water. it increases water cement ratio.  increase in water cement ratio reduces strength of concrete, hence dust must be separated to attend higher strength . conventional method for separating dust is only to be washed by water. akashganga invented a novel process for separating dust . it is a dry process & requires no water. this process is much economical  and more efficient. in water washing fine particles of sand are swept away, makes the sand inferior quality.

the dust separating machine invented by akashganga is also very useful in mineral industries. iron ore, aluminium ore, quartz & feldspar etc.contains some impurity and mica. to increase the concentration of ore, it is crushed. fine dust and mica are lighter than the ore. with the machine invented by akashganga, these impurity is separated and concentration of the ore increase. this reduces the costly process of water washing and is more economical.
