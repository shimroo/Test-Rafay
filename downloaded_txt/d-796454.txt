euxton dot com ™ 
    (home page):

the village of euxton is located at (approximately)
latitude: 53° 38' 60n,  longitude 2° 40' 0w,  



but for some folks, 
euxton village is at the centre of the universe!


euxton
        pronounced 'exton', used to be best known 
(in more recent times and to the outside world) for its munitions factory. 
        euxton has at its peak, employed up to 35,000 people from all walks of life, and from many
        countries, 
working round the clock.

in its further industrial past, euxton has had a bobbin mill, weaving mill,
        spinning mill and corn mill.  it is  reputed to have had one of the first paper
        mills in 1610.  king james (god bless him) probably needed all that extra paper for
        the 1611
        version of the holy bible.



    its 'probable' existence, even
    at the taking of the domesday book (circa 1086) is due to the a49.  this strategic
    communication road, was a main north-south pack-horse route during the middle ages and
    also probably the main north-south roman highway.

    now apart from sporting an italian restaurant "papa luigi's" (whatever happened
    to fish and chips!), it is now home to many and varied industries especially of an
    "high tech" nature.

however, for folks who know the "real rural beauty" 
of euxton village, it is best known as being,
an ancient village in the finest county of all england!





early
        physiography of lancashire (circa 1086) was coastal marsh to the west, replaced eastward
        by forest to foothills of the penines.
euxton then had much forest 
covering its gentle flowing hills, which are delightfully intersected by three
        major westerly flowing streams, the largest of these being the 
river yarrow. 



    the flying scotsman has passed by on many a run via the euxton rail line, recognition of
    euxton’s placing in this strategic north - south communication corridor.  with
    due recognition of this strategic location, the railway station now has rail service
    provided by both lcc and first north western.

    euxton has had a grand past, has a wonderful today, and
can only have a remarkable future.
