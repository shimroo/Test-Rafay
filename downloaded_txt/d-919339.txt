mother breastfeeds staffordshire bull terrier
[nov. 17th, 2004|09:20 pm]
steve_baker




i'm all for the rights of breastfeeding mothers but there are boundries which i think this woman has crossed.kura "kat" tumanako said she started breastfeeding the pup after her own baby stopped taking her milk. her nipples were too big for the baby and she had to pour her milk away.ok, fine. but surely it must hurt?"he drinks more than the baby. it doesn't hurt, but it's a little bit ticklish," she said.hmm. i thought the spca might have something to say about this, and sure enough:the national president for the spca, peter mason, said there was nothing in the animal welfare act that applied specifically to a case like this, but he had some concerns that the dog could develop long-term behavioural issues.so, its not against the law. but that doesn't change the fact that its completely fricken gross.

qcad
[nov. 5th, 2004|09:39 pm]

we're knocking out a wall to make our kitchen bigger, which unfortunately requires a building permit. even more unfortunate is that the city council now require a full set of plans for the entire house/section for any permit. our unfortune continued, as the council don't keep the plans for state houses built in the 40's - they are stored at housing nz. unfortunately after chasing them up for 2 months housing nz finally admitted that they couldn't find the plans to our house so i was faced with redrawing them from scratch.this gave me an excuse to finally learn qcad and i've been having a grand old time ever since. i've become a little obsessed measuring every nook&cranny and plugging numbers into qcad. i now have a passable floor plan and a set of elevations. i can draw you anything that has straight lines and arcs ;)my only complaint with qcad is that it has an awful window-manager-within-window interface that is common in windows apps like photoshop. this is pretty limiting on a linux desktop. i've emailed the maintainers to see if i could talk some sense into them and am still waiting for a reply.so if you need to whip up some 2d engineering/architecture drawings i can thoroughly recommend it.

  and the river stone cameth, originally uploaded by steve baker. 	and he spaketh unto god "weeds doth grow aside our plants. we need some godly substance to seperate our paths from our gardens"and thus a great scoop descended from the skies and filled his cart with stones from the river.and he said "thank you god. i shall call these 'river-stones' and they shall be placed over that which is called 'weed-mat'"and so it was.

while working at the ministry of health it has become apparent that they have a fairly enlightened policy about employing otherly-abled people.however i've noticed that all the disabled people i see around here are female.  i really can't imagine why this would be. are alternatively-abled men not applying for the jobs? are the interviewers subconsciously finding reasons not to employ them? are disabled men not considered a sufficiently oppressed minority to have equal opportunities applied to them?this isn't meant to be a pc-bashing rant - i really am curious.

there are countless electronic projects that i never get round to making. when i do at least i'll know where to go to for all the exotic components and fabrication i'll need. sometimes dick smith or jaycar just don't cut it.

sharp aroma

  sharp aroma?!, originally uploaded by steve baker. 	what is that sharp aroma? why it is our new fridge. and what a fine name.in theory the one thing this fridge should never have is a sharp aroma since its plastic is doped with bacteria killing somethingorother.

there are some slides from a presentation about the technology behind livejournal. there is certainly some impressive useful stuff here. there are many times when i could have used something like memcached. perlbal would also be worth looking at for load balancing.

bulwer-lytton fiction contest 2004 results
[sep. 21st, 2004|03:45 pm]
steve_baker




the bad fiction results are in.here is one of my favourites:she sipped her latte gracefully, unaware of the milk foam droplets building on her mustache, which was not the peachy-fine baby fuzz that nordic girls might have, but a really dense, dark, hirsute lip-lining row of fur common to southern mediterranean ladies nearing menopause, and winked at the obviously charmed spaniard at the next table.
