prosciutto-wrapped asparagus
in italian, prosciutto simply translates to “ham.” there is prosciutto crudo, a raw, cured ham, and prosciutto cotto, or cooked ham. ... the origins of prosciutto crudo date back to pre-roman times. in italy, villagers originally began to dry-age pork legs to extend their meat supply during the long winters.

flan la puerto negra
mexico
of all the peoples introduced to this dessert, the spanish were particularly taken with it (and were the first to top it with a sweet caramel sauce). like the romans before them, the spaniards brought flan to new lands, when in 1518, the famous conquistador hernán cortés landed in the yucatan peninsula of mexico.

fournier pére & fils, sauvignon blanc (2019)
the fourniers have been making wine since the 1800s. after many years of hard work domaine fournier is now one of the most important estates in sancerre.

together with claude's brother, jacques, who manages the vineyards, the family has worked tirelessly to produce top quality wines; combining family winemaking traditions with advanced facilities including custom made tanks and a modern winery design that incorporates hand sorting of the grapes and the use of gravity to ensure delicate treatment of the must (juice).

over the last 50 years they have grown the fournier estate from their father's 13 acres to 222 acres in sancerre, pouilly fume and menetou salon. claude's son, thibaut and his wife stephanie have now joined the team, helping with both winemaking and sales. claude's daughter, aude and her husband guillaume pinson also joined the family estate.

the sancerre vineyards include top sites in the villages of verdigny, sancerre, bue and maimbray, which enables them to produce wines of sophistication and complexity. they are able to control every detail of the process from planting the vines all the way through to bottling; and use only the very best selections for their wines.











poggio anima, salento primitivo lilith (2018)
opaque ruby. smoked meat, dried cherry, cracked pepper, and cassis on the deeply scented nose. mediumto full-bodied with berry cobbler flavors showing a liqueur-like intensity with an anise note coming up with air. the smoke and cassis notes carry through on the finish, which features dusty tannins.

calling its creations “weeknight wines” belies the pedigree, power and panache behind poggio anima. poggio anima is a collection of seven wines representing four regions typifying the cultural heartbeat of each area. poggio anima, translated as 'hill of soul,' personifies the individual vineyards cultivated for each bottle. many wines have vitality and a soul though few exemplify this trait, especially priced for weekday consumption.

poggio anima is a joint venture between one of tuscany's rising stars, riccardo campinoti of le ragnaie in montalcino and his u.s.a. importer ronnie sanders of vine street imports. the idea is straightforward: to source great vineyards from existing relationships and produce a real wine that conveys a place and a grape. these wines are not bulk wines, nor leftover juice from a winery, but long term contracts that have signed with reputable growers.

why the ancient pagan labels?

there is an everyday dichotomy between good and bad in the world. looking for balance in all things (including wine) is a vital quest for many. the eastern ideology of yin yang is the core of this ‘balance’ in the poggio anima concept. fusing this eastern belief with western philosophy is apparent when you look at the contradiction of red and white (wines), good vs evil (demons vs angels) and modern ideas with old world winemaking practices (catchy, fun packaging with classic old world wine).

the white wines are named after religious archangels while the reds are named after fallen angels. each wine was specifically named for the persona of the grape, region or style of the wine. each wine hails from one variety, a single- vineyard and representing its indigenous place of origin.

this is real wine, from a real place, made by real people. this is poggio anima.
