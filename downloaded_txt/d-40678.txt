website content information
we are currently transforming our web pages and digital content. you are on this page because the location for some of our old web pages has changed.
content previously located with the url prefix 'http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk' now has the prefix 'https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/library/files/special/'.
for example:
http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/teach/decarts/index.html
is now located at:
https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/library/files/special/teach/decarts/index.html
most links across the website will redirect you automatically to the new location.
searching our manuscripts and scottish theatre archive data has also changed.
for more information or help with finding content, contact library-asc@glasgow.ac.uk.
