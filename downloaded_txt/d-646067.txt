	what happened to mary lee grobe?
	
  
this site was set up as yet another attempt to find mary lee grobe and to seek justice for her. mary disappeared from her home near poplar bluff, mo on 9/27/03 and we have yet to get the answers we deserve.

	 thank you butler county
    


thank you butler county, missouri and all the caring people who located mary lee grobe and made sure she was at least granted her final wish to be buried beside her husband. thank you for the prayers, the comforting words, the hard labor, the brain work and determination that went into finding her in april 2009. extensive dna comparison with four of her children was done and confirms her identity.
 
thank you to all levels of law enforcement once heaton left office;  sherriff dobbs, investigator/coroner jim akers, the missouri state highway patrol, the fbi, the fire marshall’s office, the division of senior services and i’m sure  many more.  this case tugged at many hearts in missouri and the nation and finally brought out the best investigators once they were allowed on the case. the trouble was it took so long to get investigated plus they had to contend with local family dynamics involving their own theories and motives.
 
thank you to the daily american republic newspaper, channel 12 kfvs, fox2news channel 2 for the news coverage that helped let the residents know she was missing and needed our help. this was a sad case; one that cried out for the public’s help.  nothing made sense, nothing added up. someone was up to no good. she was a loyal upstanding citizen who did nothing wrong. she was just trying to live her life peacefully. 

at the time she vanished she was a 74 year old, legally declared incompetent child-like elderly widow from poplar bluff, mo who lived alone. she vanished from her home on 9/27/2003. amy bridgewater was the last person to admit seeing her. mary didn’t drive, couldn’t walk very far and didn’t leave home unless a family member drove her. the door was locked from the outside but her purse, medicines, and all her belongings were inside. she didn’t tell anyone she was leaving as she would normally do. her dog also vanished with her, but returned 2 days later washed and bathed obviously to conceal evidence.

congratulations, butler county, missouri for finding mary and granting her final wish but your help is still needed in solving the case. why was an incompetent child-like sweet lady living alone? who was watching her? where were sharron payne, mary’s public administrator, and the family members who promised the butler county court they would watch her so they could prevent her from going to a safer environment? why were she and her dog, bb, taken from her home? who would have wanted her gone—she wasn’t bothering anyone? who had access to her property and a key to her house? who benefited financially by getting rid of her? 

please continue to speak up and tell what you know about this case. call butler county sherriff’s department. there have been many rumors tossed out to mislead and confuse but the truth is still out there.  we still need answers and justice for mary. please help!

dar


butler county, mo (kfvs) - investigators make a huge break in a butler county cold case.

authorities arrested four people thursday in connection with the 1999 murder of carla ann austin. 

investigators say probable cause exist that the four suspects conspired to kill carla ann austin.

arrested are austin's step-daughters, another member of her late husband's family and a family friend. 

melissa baggett, john austin and henry 'marlin' rice all of qulin, along with tracy rea, of neosho all face second degree murder charges. 

john austin bonded out of jail early thursday afternoon. 

tracy austin waived arraignment and pleaded not guilty on friday. she is due back in court on may 10.

melissa baggett waived arraignment, pleaded not guilty on friday. she is due back in court on april 26.

for austin's biological daughters, this is a day they thought would never come. 

"i just can't believe it," said mindy crafford.  "justice can be served.  you won't get away with this." 

heartland news went along thursday morning as butler county sheriff mark dobbs, deputies, members of the highway patrol and qulin police department made arrests in qulin. 

first, they took john austin into custody, and then followed a few blocks later to arrest henry 'marlin' rice at his apartment.

earlier in the day tracy rea was arrested in neosho and just before 3 p.m., her sister melissa baggett of butler county turned herself in. 

"this is definitely a complicated case because of the family dynamic," said sheriff dobbs. 

the arrests come nearly 13 years after austin's murder.  according to the sheriff statement, carla ann austin was reported missing by her aunt on august 8, 1999. hunters found her body a few months later in november. 

according to the probable cause, carla ann austin's body was found around 30 yards from the tree line inside a patch of woods to the west of a field road.  authorities say she was positively identified through dental records.


"i've just always wanted to know the truth," said crafford.  she was eight years old when her mother disappeared.  "we always felt like the family was involved."

	 sad anniversary today!
    


9-27-11 marked the 8 year anniversary of the disappearance of mary lee grobe from her home in poplar bluff, mo. it marked the eight year anniversary of undeserved freedom for the one responsible for her disappearance. it marked eight years of lies for all those who helped conceal it. it also marks another year of undeserved public trust and office of sharron payne, mary's public administrator who had the power in her hands to help mary but chose to turn her back on her client and let be victimized. mary lee grobe was ripped from the people who loved her 8 years ago today. we have yet to see justice—we have yet to have resolution.we hope the guilty one(s) stop for a moment today and reflect on what they have done. god already knows who was responsible on 9-27-03 but the rest of us need resolution. all need to come clean for any forgiveness. soap won’t clean what you have done. mary lee grobe’s blood cries out and you can’t wash it off until you tell the truth.our questions to you the one responsible include: what did she do to deserve this in your eyes? who else deserved this in your eyes? was it worth it? how can your family stand you? how can they protect you? why would they want to? how can they restfully sleep at night? doesn’t it occur to them that if you think you can make money off it; their life is at risk also? how can you stand yourself?why didn’t she (in your evil eyes) deserve a proper burial? for all those duped . . . has your reasoning ability kicked in yet? have you finally looked at the evidence around you? hate people if you must for whatever trumped up reason that makes you feel good but use your brain—look at who benefited from her disappearance. look who had opportunity. if it has dawned on you that you were duped; you are probably embarrassed right now but the embarrassment isn’t going to go away just because you continue to ignore it. the embarrassment will go away and forgiveness given once you speak up and bravely step forward. there’s no more reward money, you missed that, but doing the right thing is priceless. doing the right thing is what mary lee grobe deserves! do the right thing if not for yourself, your family, for mary.

	 jacque waller's husband talks to reporters
    


cape girardeau, mo (ksdk) - the husband of a missing mother of triplets says he's been the target of vandalism and even received threats from local police. in an article published in the southeast missourian, clay waller says the jackson police department should stop focusing its attention on him and look for his wife, jacque waller, who has been missing since june 1. the couple was in the midst of a divorce when jacque disappeared. she was last seen near clay waller's home in jackson. meanwhile, jackson police department chief james humphreys called waller's allegations "ludicrous." the jackson police department says waller is a person of interest in the case, but has not declared him a suspect. clay waller's attorney, scott reynolds, released a statement wednesday reiterating his client's innocence: "clay misses jackie [sic]; he is saddened and shocked by her disappearance. he hopes and prays for her safe return and his heart goes out to the rawson family despite their repeated accusations against him. clay is not responsible for his wife's disappearance and we have substantial evidence to support that claim. we will not comment on the evidence at this point as there is an ongoing police investigation. it is sufficient to state that the police do not consider clay a 'suspect' in jackie's [sic] disappearance and they have repeatedly said there is no evidence that a crime was even committed here." waller also told the newspaper his truck has been vandalized and he was recently shot in the leg with a pellet gun. information from the associated press was used in this report. ksdk

	 unidentified woman found in warren county mo in 2004
    


who's mom is she? why hasn't someone spoken up? how could a human treat another human that way? please call the warren county sheriff's department with information. from ksdkwright city, missouri (ksdk)--  the mystery of a woman's demise continues to keep law enforcement officials busy in warren county.state maintenance workers pulling weeds and clearing brush near an interstate rest area on june 28th 2004 discovered something they would not soon forget.  a headless torso of a woman found in the roadside park, not far off i-70 near wright city.dozens of detectives from around the metropolitan st. louis area lent assistance and support to warren county lawmen in trying to identify the victim.their efforts until now have gone unrewarded.  police can't even be certain of how the woman was killed, let alone a motive behind the horrible crime.investigators say the woman was found nude.  she had a light complexion and a slight build.  they believe she was in her twenties with c-section and appendectomy scars.along the way, authorities were given assistance from the fbi as well as the national center for missing adults in phoenix arizona.  but after seven years they still have more questions unanswered than answered.warren county coroner roger mauzy has spent hundreds if not thousands of hours working to identify the victim and return her to her family.but a sad reminder to mauzy is the reality that may never happen. "this could be a disowned child who ran away for whatever reason and unfortunately, nobody has ever come forward."mauzy tells news channel 5 he usually receives a number of calls from people on the day the discovery is remembered and he follows up on every single possibility."several people will call but nothing ever seems to turn.  we remain at a dead end in our search for a name and an explanation of why?"an undisclosed gravesite in warren county serves as the victims final resting spot but mauzy says he's ready and willing to exhume the woman and return her to her family.anyone with information on the discovery is urged to contact crime stoppers at 1-866-371-tips or the warren county sheriffs department at 1-636-456-7088.

	 please help teresa butler's family
    


it is so sad, that likely people know what happened to teresa and while they could bring comfort and closure to this loving family have remainded silent thus far.risco, mo (kfvs) - rumors or clues? to this day, tips continue to pour in regarding the disappearance of teresa butler.five years after she vanished, authorities say they continue to get calls claiming they know what happened to her. but police say they're still waiting on that one call or email that will bring her family closure."we've heard from about the most horrible thing you can imagine," said butler's sister, brenda wilson. "we have other people tell us she's still out there."jan. 25 marked the five year anniversary. her husband dale came home from working the night shift to find their two sons home alone. teresa was gone. now teresa's sister, brenda wilson says she believes people close to risco know more than they let on."i think there's a lot of people that know what happened," said wilson. "they just don't want to get involved.from the home, electronics were missing, and there was a random call from teresa's cell phone to a home in southeast missouri with no connection to teresa. wilson says callers phone her from across the country."a lot of them have family that are connected to this area and they will hear something," said wilson.she says it's hard to tell fact from fiction. stories range from where she could be buried, to where she could be living. wilson say there's been so many rumors the stories can be overwhelming."there's just been so much it's hard to tell what's true. we've probably heard the truth. i honestly think we have," said wilson."in one sense i'm thankful that five years later people are still talking about it," said new madrid county sheriff terry stevens. .more of holly brantley's report on kfvs

	 seven years ago in butler county missouri . . . . .
    


9-27-10 marked the 7 year anniversary of the disappearance of mary lee grobe from her home in poplar bluff, mo. it marked the seven year anniversary of undeserved freedom for the one responsible for her disappearance. it marked seven years of lies for all those who helped conceal it. it also marks another year of undeserved public trust and office of sharron payne, mary's public administrator who had the power in her hands to help mary but chose to turn her back on her client and let be victimized. mary lee grobe was ripped from the people who loved her 7 years ago today. we have yet to see justice—we have yet to have resolution.we hope the guilty one(s) stop for a moment today and reflect on what they have done. god already knows who was responsible on 9-27-03 but the rest of us need resolution. all need to come clean for any forgiveness. soap won’t clean what you have done. mary lee grobe’s blood cries out and you can’t wash it off until you tell the truth.our questions to you the one responsible include: what did she do to deserve this in your eyes? who else deserved this in your eyes? was it worth it? how can your family stand you? how can they protect you? why would they want to? how can they restfully sleep at night? doesn’t it occur to them that if you think you can make money off it; their life is at risk also? how can you stand yourself?why didn’t she (in your evil eyes) deserve a proper burial? for all those duped . . . has your reasoning ability kicked in yet? have you finally looked at the evidence around you? hate people if you must for whatever trumped up reason that makes you feel good but use your brain—look at who benefited from her disappearance. look who had opportunity. if it has dawned on you that you were duped; you are probably embarrassed right now but the embarrassment isn’t going to go away just because you continue to ignore it. the embarrassment will go away and forgiveness given once you speak up and bravely step forward. there’s no more reward money, you missed that, but doing the right thing is priceless. doing the right thing is what mary lee grobe deserves! do the right thing if not for yourself, your family, for mary.

neb.-based project jason, a nonprofit that assists families of missing adults and children. she became a volunteer for the cause of missing persons after her son, jason, disappeared in 2001. because jason’s age placed him as an adult, she found it difficult to identify a source for advice or comfort. she determined no family should experience this loss without assistance, and founded project jason, a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization. ernie allen, president and ceo of the national center for missing & exploited children, said: “we congratulate kelly jolkowski, volunteer for families of the missing, for being among the honorees in this year’s national crime victims’ service awards. we thank the u.s. department of justice and the office for victims of crime for recognizing such a worthy member of our community in such a significant and prominent manner. furthermore, we applaud kelly jolkowski, whose outstanding work on behalf of the missing and their families resulted in this

been witness to kelly's work for a number of years, and we have seen her powerful commitment in action as she guides the families of the missing through their darkest hours,” said colleen nick, ceo of the morgan nick foundation, which provides a support network to parents and families of missing children. ”she provides hope and strength for these families and awareness for their missing loved ones. we are delighted that she has been singled out for this distinguished honor.”“i’m honored to accept this award on behalf of all missing persons, the families who miss them, and in my son’s name,” said jolkowski upon receiving the award. “the secondary victims, the families, deserve a voice, and to be treated with fairness, dignity, and respect as they go through what is undoubtedly the most difficult time in their lives. this is what i do, and for this work to be honored can be a catalyst for the change of the mindset of the public as it pertains to the aid given to these suffering families.”  about the u.s. department of justice office for victims of crime (ovc)the office for victims of crime (ovc) was established by the 1984 victims of crime act (voca) to oversee diverse

	 former southeast missouri public administrator charged with stealing from those in her care
    


former southeast missouri public administrator charged with stealing from those in her carefriday, october 2, 2009 ~ updated 11:44 amstandard democratnew madrid - a former new madrid county official is charged with three counts of stealing from those under her care. nancy c. pardon, who served as the new madrid county public administrator until resigning in august 2008, is accused of a class b felony of stealing for the theft of at least $25,000 in cash and checks from one of those under her care. also she is charged with two class c felonies of stealing for the theft of at least $500 from two others who she was responsible for as the public administrator. special prosecuting attorney douglas s. pribble with the missouri attorney general's office filed the charges in new madrid county on sept. 25. following her appearance sept. 28 before judge w. keith currie, pardon was released on her own recognizance and scheduled to return to court on oct. 7. currie is an associate circuit judge from pemiscot county who was appointed after judge charles spitler recused himself from the case because he handles the probate docket in new madrid county. in the probable cause statement, missouri highway patrol sgt. dennis a. overbey stated pardon was appointed guardian of the estate of evelyn barnes, who had two bank accounts. the probate court was not advised of the existence of an account containing $35,725.99, overbey stated. according to overbey, within six months the account was drained of all but $81.38, at which time the final amount was withdrawn by pardon and the account closed. "in six months nancy pardon spent $35,725.99 of ms. barnes' money on herself. ms. barnes did not receive any money from this account once pardon took control," he stated. the investigative officer noted several other incidents of pardon allegedly writing checks to a range of businesses including trees and trends, j.c. penney, cracker barrel and sam's for clothing, jewelry, a 32-inch lcd television and other items. in his investigation, he stated, the nursing home's personnel were not aware of ms. barnes receiving any of the items. overbey found from january 2005 through april 2006, $7,050 in checks were allegedly written to billie sue whitley and signed by nancy pardon for cash. after whitley was moved into a nursing home, pardon allegedly continued to write checks to billie sue whitley and sign them for cash in the amount of $2,384.64, however the nursing home's records do not show ms. whitley receiving any of the money from the checks. "it was also discovered that during 2006, after ms. whitley had been placed in a nursing home, her social security check continued to go into her bank account, but the money was never sent to the nursing home," overbey stated. while this money totaled $2,013.20, eventually pardon would provide the nursing home with $1,892, leaving $121.20 for which the investigator could not account. in another incident overbey noted margie weaver received a monthly pension of $301.20 from caterpillar that went into a bank account, which pardon did not report to the probate court. when the court brought the pension to pardon's attention, he stated, she denied any knowledge of it but that same day closed the account. "several years of the pension (2005 through 2006 totaling $8,566.80) went unreported and cannot be accounted for," overbey stated. nor could overbey account for all the $5,000 pardon received from the sale of ms. weaver's house. "the only legitimate expenditure appears to be a preneed burial policy for $2,000..." he stated, adding ms. weaver stated she had not received any money from pardon nor do the nursing home records show any more than $70 deposited in her account. the attorney general's office is handling the case on the request of the new madrid county prosecuting attorney's office. the counts filed are charges. a person's innocence or guilt is determined by a court of law. © copyright 2009, semissourian.comstory url: http://www.semissourian.com/story/1575581.htmlhttp://www.semissourian.com/story/print/1575581.html********************does sharron payne, butler county public administrator, know what really happen to mary lee grobe ?

	 national missing persons organizations merge to offer state-of-the-art safety education for all ages, and critical resources to families with missing
    


bentonville, ar. – let’s bring them home (lbth), a bentonville, arkansas non-profit offering safety education to children and families, as well as resources to families with missing loved ones, today announced a merger with the national center for missing adults (ncma), a nonprofit organization that acts as the national clearinghouse for missing adults, as well as provides services and coordination between various government agencies, law enforcement, media and most importantly, families of missing adults.lbth, established in 2005, specializes in safety education, while ncma, a sixteen-year-old nonprofit, has been the primary service provider to law enforcement and the families of missing adults throughout the country and maintains a repository of information regarding disappearances of individuals who have been determined by law enforcement to be “at risk” due to diminished mental capacity, such as alzheimer’s disease, those with physical disabilities, individuals whose disappearance is suspicious, and/or when foul play is suspected.in addition, ncma provides specialized training to law enforcement throughout the united states and has been acknowledged by the united states department of justice for resolving 99.8% of all missing adult reports during hurricane katrina.according to ncma founder, kym pasqualini, who headed up ncma, the merger will provide families across the nation with quality safety education and services to families for missing adults.“at a time when nonprofits throughout the country are struggling in a weakened economy it is important for nonprofit organizations to explore how to better diversify resources. lbth and ncma are a perfect match with services that complement each other,” explains pasqualini."this merger will enable us to continue to fulfill our mission and broaden services."the merger, effective immediately, will allow ncma financial stability for the first time since 2006 when the organization experienced significant funding cuts from the government.  corporate headquarters as well as a safety education center for the newly merged organization will open in northwest arkansas, while the office of case management will remain in phoenix, arizona.  employees at both former organizations will be retained.amy smith, executive director of let's bring them home, believes this merger will make a huge impact on safety education and on services for missing adults.  "the merge of our organizations was a natural fit - like two pieces of a puzzle that fit together perfectly - all for the benefit of children and families throughout the united states."as the newly merged organization now entitled let’s bring them home & the national center for missing adults transitions, the families of missing adults can expect services to re-launch in full force beginning october 10, 2009.  over the coming months, let’s bring them home & the national center for missing adults will launch expanded programming, training, and services to families across the united states."this organizational merger," explains smith, "will enable us to fulfill the simple but important motto that we strive to live out daily:  our passion is prevention, but our heart is with the missing."for more information on the newly merged organization, contact amy smith at 479-871-1059 or via email atletsbringthemhome@gmail.com or kym pasqualini at 602-769-4597 or via email at k.pasqualini@missingadults.org.for more information on the lbth/ncma merger visit: http://www.lbth.org or http://www.theyaremissed.org

	 son finds comfort in charges for 1992 killing of his mother in pike county
    


(p-d)by joel currierst. louis post-dispatch05/31/2009sixteen years after his mother's mysterious disappearance, matt higginbotham decided it was finally time to burn some of the things she left behind.higginbotham's roaring backyard bonfire last june swallowed up his mother's old radio and several meticulously detailed day planners he had stored for years, hoping she would come home."i remember saying, 'mom, i'm sorry,'" said higginbotham, 41, of dardenne prairie. "we were never going to find anything."four months later, his mother's skeleton, her heart-shaped pendant and her .38-caliber revolver were found in an abandoned septic tank on a farm in pike county. betty ann howery of st. charles was 44 when she vanished on feb. 20, 1992. that night, police say, she had accompanied her husband to their farm about six miles north of elsberry, near the mississippi river.higginbotham reported her missing, telling police she never would have left without an explanation."it just didn't make sense," higginbotham said. "none of it added up."higginbotham's suspicion rang true earlier this month when howery's ex-husband, douglas j. howery sr., 57, of springfield, mo., was charged with her murder. the rest of the st. louis post articles:http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/stcharles/story/eb548866da9e0f78862575c5008089d4?opendocument************our comments: so glad this man finally got answers to his mother's disappearance. what was wrong with the new step mom? why would she blindly accept that the old wife disappeared and not ask any questions?

saturday, may 30, 2009eod reports : exploitation is daily fare for elders estateofdenial.com hears on an almost daily basis of new involuntary redistribution of assets (ira) cases in which probate venues and/or probate instruments (wills, trusts, guardianships and powers of attorney) are used to loot assets of the dead and disabled/incapacitated. that is significant for a small, relatively obscure web site like eod.we recently added a new entry called new jersey corruption to the eod links and sources page. this horrific story is detailed by a member of the blasco family who says “my father, a vietnam vet with a purple heart, is having his estate stolen by new jersey’s government courts.”these accounts, albeit familiar, are individually tragic and heartbreaking when taking into account the numerous lives harmed in each action. we posted another similar case out of ohio earlier this week. many other inquiries and pleas we receive are not published due to their sensitive nature or pending legal action.what is most sad is while cries for help are desperately increasing, many people don’t understand the ira issue, even more don’t bother listening and only a few care. ira targets - those alive or with any ability to speak - regularly lament how they never dreamed such acts of looting could so overtake their lives. and routinely, these are people who completed their “proper estate planning” yet through opportunistic maneuvering by wannabe heirs and/or dishonest legal professionals, their wishes are ignored or subverted.another common thread is that targets or other parties at the forefront of dealing with these actions will tell of contacting all seemingly logical authorities, going through the appropriate processes and channels, doing everything that appears as a reasonable course to avoid an ugly dispute or prolonged, extensive legal battle. despite these efforts, dead ends or directions to civil court are all that are found.source=>>at 5/30/2009 11:22:00 pm    labels: guardianship/conservatorship issues, scams, wills

publication:daily american republic;  date:apr 17, 2009;  section:front page;  page number:1a officials believe remains are grobe’s by michelle friedrich associate editor     clothing and personal items found with the human remains in an area east of poplar bluff have led authorities to believe with “great certainty” they belong to an elderly woman who has been missing for more than five years.     “at approximately 2:30 (p.m.) wednesday, we were alerted by a citizen who had been riding an (all-terrain vehicle) that he had found possible human remains in a heavily wooded, brushy area in the 1700 block of b highway,” butler county sheriff mark dobbs explained.     on thursday, local and federal authorities excavated the site and found “certain personal items, as well as clothing, to indicate to us, with great certainty, this was mary (lee) grobe’s remains ” dobbs said. ,     butler county coroner jim akers agreed. female clothing found with the remains, as well as personal items belonging to grobe, make it “highly likely this is her, but we will not make a positive identification until the dna” testing is completed.     akers said the remains are being sent to the fbi’s “state-of-the art, premier” laboratory at quantico, va., for dna analysis.     “the family has already submitted dna for comparison,” akers said. “in speaking with the forensic anthropologist, we were advised bone could be used to get midacondria dna.”     midacondria dna reportedly is dna that is not easily found as compared to dna that can be easily found skin cells tissue and blood     akers , said it will . take several months to get dna results back from the fbi’s lab.     “at this time, it is still undetermined (what) the manner and cause” of death are, akers said. “we’re waiting on the results of this to move forward.”     dobbs said officers hope fbi officials will be able to determine a cause of death and whether there was any trauma to the body, “anything an autopsy would tell us.”     the vast majority of the remains were recovered, dobbs said.     with the condition of the remains and items located, it is “consistent with multiple years of degradation,” akers said.     grobe, 74, was last seen at about 6 p.m. sept. 27, 2003, at her residence at 1557 highway b by her granddaughter, amy bridgewater.     two days later, concerned family members entered grobe’s residence and found her and her dog, “bb,” missing. her purse and medication were still inside; however, an overnight bag and some winter clothing also were missing.       since her disappearance, grobe’s dog returned home in good condition a few days later and authorities have conducted extensive searches and followed up on numerous leads with no success.     the remains, dobbs said, were found on another individual’s property, where the atv operator was “apparently blazing new trails.”     the terrain, according to dobbs, wasn’t even fit for walking.     “our office was contacted shortly after (the remains were found),” dobbs said. “myself and investigator charles phelps went to the location where (the citizen) had thought he found the remains.”     dobbs said he and phelps did a “quick grid search of the immediate area.     “that search resulted in the finding of just a few bones under the leaves and vegetation,” dobbs said. “there was nothing readily apparent.     “i feel confident if we wouldn’t have been taken to that area and had it pinpointed to us, it would have been highly unlikely for us to find.”     at that point, dobbs said, the scene was secured and assistance was requested from the missouri state highway patrol and its local division of drug and crime control and the poplar bluff police department     “upon their arrival, we did another small grid search and flagged several items we believed to be human remains,” dobbs said.     the scene again was secured and assistance was requested from the fbi and it’s evidence response team, dobbs said.     “(the site) was secured overnight, and we began excavation of the scene on thursday morning,” dobbs said.     agents from the fbi’s cape girardeau office and its eight-man response team from st. louis joined local and state investigators in the search thursday      “the first task was to get all the vegetation pulled back and out of the way,” dobbs said. a lot of limbs had fallen in the area “where we needed to be,” he said. “i don’t know how long the brush had been there,” but he suspected a lot of it had fallen during the ice storm.     after slowly and carefully removing the brush, officers flagged all relevant artifacts and remains before beginning the excavation, said dobbs, who described the change to the area as going from looking like a jungle to farmland      the site was “about a circumference of 25 yards,” dobbs said. “most of the remains were contained in one, smaller area of about 8 feet in radius.”     dobbs said there were obvious signs that animals had been scavenging in the area where the remains were found and had been digging in numerous places.     dobbs said it is possible this discovery would not have been made had animals not been forging and moving the remains.     officers, dobbs said, conducted a grid search a “few inches at a time. it was plotted to where it can be recreated with computer-aided software.”     dobbs said the site was about “50 yards to the east of the (out-of-use sewage) lagoon that was drained” in may 2005.     “relative walking distance is approximately 400 feet from (grobe’s) house” to the scene, dobbs said.     while authorities completed excavating the property thursday, dobbs said, he and akers are not done completely with the scene.     “we’re done with the search for remains out there, (but) there are some questions we want to get answered at the scene,” dobbs said.     at this point, “our work as far as determining what happened and how it happened has just began,” dobbs explained. “there are still a lot of questions we have to get answered.”     the remains, according to dobbs, were at least “partially submerged in the soil; however it is a very low-lying area that is prone to flooding. one of the things we need to get answered is what impact last year’s record flooding had on the scene.”     dobbs believes the area where the remains were found may have been searched before.     “i do not know if (officers) walked over the specific area, but (they have) been in that general area,” dobbs said.     dobbs said he can’t necessarily account for what reason or circumstances kept the body from previously being found .     the remains, dobbs said, weren’t found on grobe’s property, but on the second property, east of her home, “which might account for why (officers) didn’t find her.”     “it was one of the investigations i inherited when i took over as sheriff, and i did not take part in the grid search when she initially was reported missing,” dobbs said. “therefore, i can’t and don’t feel comfortable speculating on why or why not she wasn’t found at that time.     “i can only say that the investigation from its onset was not done the way we would do things under our present administration.” pictures and complete dar news article

	 elder abuse
    


what is elder abuse? elder abuse of individuals in the community takes many forms, and in most cases victims are subjected to more than one type of mistreatment. in missouri, over 50% of elder abuse reports allege physical neglect (to include self neglect); 10% allege financial exploitation; 8% allege physical abuse; and over 9% allege emotional abuse. abuse – the infliction of physical, sexual, or emotional injury or harm including financial exploitation by any person, firm, or corporation. neglect – the failure to provide services to an eligible adult by any person, firm or corporation with a legal or contractual duty to do so, when such failure presents either an imminent danger to the health, safety, or welfare of the client or a substantial probability that death or serious physical harm would result. eligible adult – a person sixty years of age or old who is unable to protect his or her own interests or adequately perform or obtain services which are necessary to meet his or her essential human needs or an adult with a disability, as defined in section 660.053, between the ages of eighteen or fifty-nine who is unable to protect his or her own interests or adequately perform or obtain services which are necessary to meet his or her essential human needs. disability – a mental or physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, whether the impairment is congenital or acquired by accident, injury or disease, where such impairment is verified by medical findings. financial exploitation - a person commits the crime of financial exploitation of an elderly or disabled person if such person knowingly and by deception, intimidation, or force obtains control over the elderly or disabled person's property with the intent to permanently deprive the elderly or disabled person of the use, benefit or possession of his or her property thereby benefiting such person or detrimentally affecting the elderly or disabled person. the neglectis most often attributable to the circumstances or environment of the victim – often circumstances beyond their control; often includes significant limitations in major life activities such as walking, bathing, cleaning, preparing meals, or shopping. the abuseris most often a family member – adult child, spouse, grandchild, and other relative; (25% of reports with someone named as a possible perpetrator) may be experiencing difficulties or problems due to the stress associated with caregiving; and may be frustrated or isolated. interventions must take into account, wherever possible, most seniors’ desire not to sever family ties. the victimis most often a female (64%) white (79%) living alone (43%) with spouse or relative (42%) may suffer from some form of dementia or physical impairment, often suffering from multiple limitations which make him/her dependent on others for care; tends to be isolated; may suffer from more than one type of abuse or neglect; may be reluctant to admit his/her loved one is an abuser; and may be fearful of reporting abuse, thinking it could lead to further harm, nursing home placement or total abandonment. these characteristics make intervening more complicated and cases more difficult.elder abuse and neglect hotlinedivision of senior and disability services missouri department of health and senior servicespo box 570jefferson city, mo 65102-0570 telephone: 573-751-4842 elder abuse and neglect hotline 800-392-0210tdd 800-669-8819 or through relay missouri 800-676-3777 email: info@dhss.mo.gov

missing persons voices have been silenced and sadly forgotten in the u.s. help us speak up for them and change the way the cases are handled. please vote so we can get more national attention for the missing. go to change.org (or click on link in the title of this post)and vote on establishing a protocol for missing persons cases which utilized current technology. http://www.change.org/ideas/view/establish_national_protocol_in_missing_and_unidentified_person_cases you may think it will never affect you but every 30 seconds another person in the u.s. disappears! make changes now so their case will be investigated and your loved one will have a chance to survive and/or you will have a chance to find answers. keep in mind also, solving more cases may prevent additional cases or at least slow this horrible increase.

	 five years of undeserved freedom has ended!
    


bitter sweet news for the family of angie yarnell. our thoughts and prayers are with them at this time. husband charged in wife's 2003 death.............saturday, december 6, 2008 | 6:12 p.m. cstby the associated pressversailles — a morgan county man has been charged with killing his wife, who has been missing since 2003.michael shane yarnell, 39, was charged thursday with second-degree murder, two counts of voluntary manslaughter and one count of involuntary manslaughter in the death of michelle "angie" yarnell, who was 28 when she disappeared around oct. 26, 2003.police, who had been looking for michael yarnell since 2005, arrested him nov. 5 in biloxi, miss.morgan county sheriff james petty said yarnell told police his wife died after the couple fought and he pushed her off a 10-foot-high deck at their ivy bend home. he then dumped her body on an island, petty said friday.sheriff's officers told angie yarnell's mother, marianne asher-chapman, about the charges thursday night, petty said.asher-chapman, who had pushed investigators to continue looking for her daughter for five years, told the sedalia democrat she didn't know how to react to the news."i don't know yet," she said. "i'm just kind of numb."yarnell told police he took his wife's body by boat to an uninhabited island off the osage river near ivy bend, where he left her remains, petty said. yarnell led investigators to the island about four miles from the yarnells' former home and a search was under way for the remains.morgan county prosecutor marvin opie said yarnell faces four different charges to allow an eventual jury to find him guilty on a lesser charge if sufficient evidence isn't available to convict him on the murder charge. if convicted of murder, yarnell could face life in prison.he also faces charges for forgery and tampering with evidence , which were filed in november when asher-chapman reported that she had received a post card that purported to be sent from her daughter on nov. 7, 2003.michael yarnell told police he sent asher-chapman the post card, petty said, in the hope that it would stop the investigation and lead investigators to think angie yarnell was alive and headed to texas.investigators found items that angie yarnell would have taken with her while searching the home of michael yarnell's former stepfather, petty said.that made it clear to investigators that michael yarnell's previous story about his wife's disappearance "didn't match up," petty said. when michael yarnell was confronted with the new evidence, he confessed to killing his wife, the sheriff said.the columbia missourian......................more news articles

answers to questions from readers (based on our heart-felt belief): why are you trying to put all the blame on the sheriff at the time and on sharon payne? why is the family trying to put it all on our system and those who work in the system? the sheriff at the time mary disappeared along with his buddies, jerry armes and sharron payne contributed to the blundering of this case. if sharron had done her job to protect mary lee grobe there wouldn’t have been a case to begin with. if bill heaton and jerry armes had investigated they may have figured out what happened. why did they allow sharron payne to act like an investigator? she is as dumb as dirt and a control freak. she had her own agenda which she used to convince heaton and armes of their next act. if bill heaton, jerry armes, and sharron payne hadn’t leaked information back to the criminals there may have been resolution. if bill heaton and jerry armes had allowed more intelligent, professional investigators in on the case it would have helped but instead they tried to solve it themselves.so why do we blame the sheriff (bill heaton) and sharron payne . . . because they are to blame. why isn't the family taking responsibility for mary's disappearance? they didn’t have to because sharron covered for them; the sheriff (at the time) fell for it and looked the other way. sharron blocked attempts to look for mary lee grobe. she hasn’t taken a polygraph and she refuses to allow searches. she tried to block other efforts. why doesn’t sharron want her client found? she doesn’t want to be exposed for the hypocrite that she is and she doesn’t want her buddies to get in trouble. yet she says she “loves” her clients. this is another one of her lies. she loves to control and ruin lives.i just think it is a shame you talk down about sharon payne when the family should have been more responsible and been looking after mary, with surviving family she should not have had to been made a ward of the court.keep in mind, mary lee grobe, had seven children, four step children, many grandchildren and even great grandchildren. mary had many family members that loved her and wanted to take care of her but sharron wasn’t friends with them. sharron was friends with the ones that wanted to do mary lee grobe harm. sharron was on a power trip and sided with the criminals. sharron along with the criminals blocked phone calls and visits from the ones that loved mary lee grobe. she ignored concerns regarding mary lee’s safety. the very reason mary had a guardian was to protect her and her assets but sharron either willingly because of her own evil intentions or by deceit was a puppet to the criminals. sharron failed to act in mary lee grobe’s best interest.we have heard many similar stories of sharron’s power trips that caused her clients to suffer. we can’t speak for her other clients but mary lee grobe would be here today if sharron had done her job. figuratively, mary lee grobe’s blood is on sharron’s hands and god will judge her along with the low life’s that are responsible for the crimes against mary lee grobe’s. ******************* you scratch my back . . . . . why are the poplar bluff and texas grobes suddenly sounding off? they have done nothing for years to find mary lee grobe but now they have been reawakened, why?  why is there such mutual support between sharron k. payne and the poplar bluff, mo and texas grobes? what is their objective? so far they have worked together to keep the mary lee grobe case from being solved. obviously, they feel threatened if their buddy (sharron k. payne) loses her position of power (mary lee grobe’s public administrator). the position that created the environment that allowed mary lee grobe to be victimized and the position that hindered the investigation. so far the system has failed the victims but has worked for the criminals. if the poplar bluff, mo and texas grobes can keep sharron in office, they can keep this vile but reciprocal arrangement. each benefit greatly. we on the other hand, want the case solved. we would of course love to have mary lee grobe returned to us safely but based on the evidence we want to be realalistic. at the very, very least mary lee grobe deserved to be granted her final wish to be laid to rest beside her husband. where is mary lee grobe?

about me

name:  help find mary grobe 
location:  poplar bluff, missouri, united states 
thank you butler county, missouri and all the caring people who located mary lee grobe and made sure she was at least granted her final wish to be buried beside her husband. thank you for the prayers, the comforting words, the hard labor, the brain work and determination that went into finding her in april 2009. thanks to all levels of law enforcement, and newspaper and tv reporters. extensive dna comparison with four of her children was done and confirms her identity. 
at the time she vanished on 9/27/03 she was a 74 year old, legally declared incompetent child-like elderly widow from poplar bluff, mo who lived alone. amy bridgewater was the last person to admit seeing her. the door was locked from the outside but her purse, medicines, and all her belongings were inside. her dog also vanished with her, but returned 2 days later washed and bathed obviously to conceal evidence.
please continue to speak up and tell what you know about this case. call butler county sherriff’s department. the truth is still out there.  we still need answers and justice for mary. please help!
