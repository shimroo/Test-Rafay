welcome to & laughing water trailer park
golden sunsets spread across the sky, reflecting on still waters as loons make their plaintive cry and beavers chew nonchalantly on the sweet bark of fallen branches. waves lightly tickle sand beaches as eagles soar overhead and fish leap into the air. this is the incomparable lake of the woods in the aptly named sunset country of northwestern ontario, a lake with 14,000 islands, 65,000 miles of shoreline and one million acres of surface water. it is an amazing body of fresh water with great fishing and unspeakably gorgeous scenery.
laughing water trailer park is located in a quiet bay behind a point that leads directly to long bay. this is a prime location for easy access to fishing waters. here at laughing water trailer park, we have created a relaxed atmosphere with spacious sites offering a spectacular view of the lake.
