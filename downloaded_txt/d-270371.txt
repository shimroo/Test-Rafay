mod_perl brings together the full power of the perl programming language and the apache http server.  you can use
perl to manage apache, respond to requests for web
pages and much more.

mod_perlÂ  is more than cgi scripting
on steroids.  it is a whole new way to create dynamic content by
utilizing the full power of the apache web server to create stateful
sessions, customized user authentication systems, smart proxies and
much more.  yet, magically, your old cgi scripts will continue to work
and work very fast indeed.  with mod_perl you give up nothing and gain
so much!
    -- lincoln stein



mod_perl gives you a persistent perl interpreter embedded in your web
server.  this lets you avoid the overhead of starting an external
interpreter and avoids the penalty of perl start-up time, giving you
super-fast dynamic content.


as you'd expect from the perl community, there are hundreds of
modules written for mod_perl, everything from persistent
database connections, to templating systems, to complete
xml content delivery systems.  web sites like
slashdot and
wired magazine use mod_perl.

mod_perl is an apache software
foundation project. it is licensed under the apache software license.

reporting bugs
before a bug can be solved, developers need to be able to reproduce
it. users need to provide all the relevant information that may assist
in reproducing the bug. however it's hard to know what information
needs to be supplied in the bug report. in order to speed up the
information retrieval process, we wrote the guidelines explaining
exactly what information is expected. usually, the better the bug
report is the sooner it's going to be reproduced and therefore fixed.
