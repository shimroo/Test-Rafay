welcome to rental management company

we are a full-service rental property management company, serving the fresno and madera county community for over 35 years. we have a large inventory of properties for renters to choose from, located in a variety of settings from quiet country neighborhoods to vibrant communities bustling with families. our company is built on the principles of family and community, from property owners to service personnel, and those in our management office. we value long-term relationships and many of our vendors have passed down their trades and skills to the next generation. this is the same way the founder of our company passed it on to us.
we would love the opportunity to create the same kind of relationships with others seeking to have their properties managed in the same considerate and attentive way, and hope that you’ll choose to join us on the journey.
welcome to our community of family, friends and colleagues!
