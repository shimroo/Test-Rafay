welcome








welcome to lcacbsour chapter has members from across the northeast with the lake champlain watershed in vermont and northern new york having the greatest representation. our members share a common interest in the use and preservation of vintage boats of all types - launches, runabouts, utilities, sailboats, canoes, outboards, guide boats, cruisers, etc. – and all materials be they wood, fiberglass, metal...we even had a cement craft one year.



we accomplish this in three ways:  hold workshops during the off season to learn about and share technical preservation tipsattend rendezvous on the water and annual dinners to encourage and sustain our social interestshold an annual boat show at the burlington community boathouse, an event attended by thousandsthe highlight of each year is our annual boat show which will be held this year on july 27, 2024 at the burlington community boat house (please check our calendar of events for other events).  the combination of a spectacular waterfront, adirondack views and the fascination with antique boats brings thousands of curious and admiring visitors.  in addition to the workshops, rendezvous and dinners throughout the year we conduct a fall cruise that takes us to other bodies of water such as the saranac lakes, montreal or new hampshire lakes region.the lake champlain chapter is known for honoring the traditions of the use and preservation of water craft built in the first half of the 20th century, a distinction that we won't let go of.  with that in mind one of our goals is to learn more about the preservation and maintenance of all boats built before 1991.  and above all we wish to share our love of boats that span all generations.

our storyan organization’s beginnings start with a desire...a need...from within a group of people who share a set of values and hold a determination to go through the process of establishing their existence. this group needs a person to spearhead an agreement and a path to follow in obtaining the necessary certifications for the organization. twenty-five years ago, we were most fortunate to have had gary wilson, and a group of boating friends, who had the foresight and desire to do just so by establishing the lake champlain chapter of the antique and classic boat society.     it all started with an initiative of gary wilson’s in sending out invitations to fellow boaters entitled “wooden boat renaissance”. this invitation invited them to a dinner/meeting at the indian bay marina in willsboro, new york for sept. 7, 1985. the topics he proposed to discuss were to plan for the future of their boating adventures and to see if there was interest in becoming a recognized chapter of the national acbs. gary was already a member of the national acbs organization, through his membership with the ny adirondack chapter, but saw a need for a separate chapter, which would include members from both sides of lake champlain.today the chapter has 120 members.  as a 501.c.7 one of our key objectives is to share not only our enthusiasm for antique and classic boats but transfer useful and fascinating information about boating history and the care and preservation of all types of boats
