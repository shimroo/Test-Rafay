who we are

the center for international security and cooperation (cisac) is stanford university’s hub for researchers tackling some of the world's most pressing security and international cooperation issues.founded 40 years ago, cisac today is building on its historic strengths to seek solutions to the many longstanding and emerging challenges associated with an increasingly complex world. we are guided by our longstanding belief that a commitment to rigorous scholarship, openness to new ideas, and lively intellectual exchange can spur the creation and spread of knowledge to help build a safer world.
