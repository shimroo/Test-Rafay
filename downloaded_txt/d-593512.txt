 |  ritesh raj sarrafof the many things we care for in our garden, having some carnivorous plants was also one to have.
plants are tricky. a lot of information they pass. and depending on where you are and what plants you are with, the results can vary. the nepenthes family isn’t native to where i live but i still wanted to have them. while not impossible, though a difficult task to bring up such species.

 |  4 minutes
 |  831 words
 |  ritesh raj sarraffinally, til, what can all be the reason for systemd services to hang indefinitely. the internet is flooded with numerous reports on this topic but no clear answers. so no more uselessly marked workarounds like: systemctl daemon-reload and systemctl-daemon-reexec for this scenario.
the scene would be something along the lines of:
rrs 6467 0.0 0.0 23088 15852 pts/1 ss 12:53 0:00 | | \_ /bin/bash rrs 11512 0.0 0.0 14876 4608 pts/1 s+ 13:18 0:00 | | | \_ systemctl restart snapper-timeline.

 |  ritesh raj sarrafthere surely is need for better tooling on the btrfs file system side.
while migrating my setup from one machine to another, this is one issue i came to be aware of, only today, when my backup tool (btrbk) complained about it. following the pointers, i see the below snippet in btrfs-subvolume manual page.
a snapshot that was created by send/receive will be read-only, with different last change generation, read-only and with set received_uuid which identifies the subvolume on the filesystem that produced the stream.

 |  ritesh raj sarrafin my past, i’ve had experiences that have had me thinking. my experiences have been mostly in the south asian indian sub-continent, so may not be fair to generalize it.
help with finding a job: i’ve learnt many times, that when people reach out asking for help, say, for helping them with finding a job; it isn’t about you making a recommendation/referral for them. it, instead, implies that you are indirectly being asked to find and arrange them a job.

 |  ritesh raj sarrafwhy is it so hard to have a proper download manager in today’s day ? we had it in the previous decade. or do tech giants self-proclaim that the world lives only in their cloud.
at one point, there used to be great download managers for all major web browsers, either in-built, or external. then came the latest trend with chrome and firefox, where they make it difficult to have an external download manager work proper.
