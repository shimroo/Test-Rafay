	 the obscene spelling bee
	 
    


if you are a big fan of watching little kids compete in spelling bees, then doubtless, you are a sick individual who is really only waiting for them to fail and break down in tears. well, if so, you're in luck. no tears, but plenty to cry about. watch the judges stick it to these smug, little bastards.click here to watch the clip.

	 jan terri - get down goblin
	 
    


ok, this is two posts in a row. i am officially obsessed with jan terri.this is actually a much less enjoyable video than "i don't want to lose you tonight", which i will still stand by as "worst video ever", but it's still worth watching, if only for the scene where this almost-midget with no musical talent pretends to play the bass guitar. not to be mean (and by "not to be mean" i actually mean "to be very mean"), but if you looked like that, wouldn't you try and avoid songs about goblins? ooh, i'm terrible!if you make it to the end, you might notice the 30 seconds-plus credit sequence, just in case you were dying to know who choreographed this piece of shit. if you read the wikipedia article, it might take some of the fun out of this to know that she played marilyn manson's birthday party, but on the other hand, the fact that she does play birthday parties has definitely got my attention. *cough cough* september 17 *cough cough*click here to watch the clip.

	 worst music video ever
	 
    


i don't know if that title's appropriate. personally, i think this is the best video ever.she looks like your lunchlady. she sounds like a 12 year old girl and her lyrics may have been written by those 100 monkeys the government has been trying to get to write shakespeare. seriously, awesome. watch it.click here to watch the clip.

	 walker told me...
	 
    


ok, i know i've said this before, but this is the greatest thing ever.i don't want to give anything away, but conan o'brien had a bit on his show where they would show clips from walker: texas ranger, almost always to uproarious laughter. i know what you're thinking, "oh that whole chuck norris thing is totally played out" and you're right. but this clips hilarity outweighs any hipster ennui you may be experiencing. conan sets up the clip and then it goes into the walker episode, you'll notice a young haley joel osment from the sixth sense. it's all fun and kidding around, then he grows solemn, the music comes up and he utters the six words that will change your life. conan's reaction is priceless, as is the laughter from the audience.click here to watch the clip.

	 the oozinator
	 
    


i'm not sure how, exactly, a high-ranking member of n.a.m.b.l.a. infiltrated the advertising world just so he could subversively distribute this child pornography, but he did. prepare to laugh your ass off and then feel gross about it. little boys vigorously jerking the shaft of a "gun" so that it squirts green goo all over their friends. sometimes they get shot in the chest, sometimes in the face...well, this might be the last viral video review i write for a while, i'm going to go jam my eyes with a rusty screwdriver now.(thanks cindy for the heads up about this)click here to watch the clip.
