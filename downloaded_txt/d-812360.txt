welcome home



in most nursing homes, and in many assisted living services, a very important element has been forgotten: home. without it, our elders experience a loss of joy and meaning in their lives.we know you believe that they deserve better. so do we.













action pact can see you through every step of transforming an institution into true home, and restoring the pleasures of daily life to our elders.




















who we are

  
action pact is a unique culture change company.

recognized for developing and promoting the household model, action pact provides full services that enable residential senior environments including institutional nursing homes, assisted living communities and memory support environments to transform into warm and pleasant households.
we work directly with organizations committed to this profound change, often beginning work with them at the visioning stage and aiding them throughout the difficult work of environmental and organizational design, change of culture, operational changes of systems processes, and development of new skills – including technical, self-led team, people and process skills.

culture change is a process and movement of transforming traditional, institutional long-term care facilities, into true homes. it involves a change of environment, systems and attitude. it’s not just a change you can see, it’s a change you feel; a change elders feel as they direct their own lives and staff feel as they are empowered to help them do so.

nursing homes are changing into personal communities households and neighborhoods, staffed by familiar caregivers who are there to assist residents as they live lives of meaning, value and joy. they have private spaces and family places and a chance to continue to live life with some measure of independence and responsibility. led by human compassion and economic foresight, facilities are applying historically successful, common sense approaches to living and caring for elders.  the result: long-term care communities where elders choose to live their lives with staff who enjoy assisting them.

these communities provide the best personal, health and medical services any community member, however frail, will need. some have gone as far as giving each their own homey kitchen, dining room and living room, where staff and elders prepare and eat meals together. each day is informal, like a day in our own homes, and results in a truly rewarding and satisfying daily life for elders and staff alike. it’s not home-like, it’s home.learn more

why would we ask anyone to give up home, just when they need it the most?
in the household model, long-term care homes adopt a person-centered approach that shapes the physical environment, organizational structure, and interpersonal relationships in ways that create an atmosphere of genuine home, while providing elders with clear opportunities to direct their own lives.learn more
