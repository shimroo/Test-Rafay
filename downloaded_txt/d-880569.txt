trisport events has been producing triathlons and duathlons for over 25 years. we have had many terrific events over the years. we do our best to spread our events throughout ontario in order to reach as much of the athletic population as we can. while many people think the big cities are the place to race we do our best to avoid them. we much prefer the rural setting where the roads are quieter and the air and water is cleaner.
