background
the nebraska commission on public advocacy ("commission") was created in 1995 to provide
                  property tax relief to counties that are required to provide legal representation to indigent
                  defendants charged with first degree murder and serious violent or drug related felonies. the
                  commission also provides legal assistance to public defenders and court-appointed attorneys.
                  the commission provides property tax relief because counties pay nothing for such legal
                services and associated costs.
                  the commission consists of nine members appointed by the governor from a list of attorneys
                  submitted by the executive council of the nebraska state bar association after consultation with
                  the board of directors of the nebraska criminal defense attorneys association. a member is
                  appointed from each of the six state supreme court districts, and three members are appointed at
                  large. members must have substantial experience in criminal defense work and civil legal
                  matters. they may not be prosecutors, law enforcement officials, or judges during their terms in
                  office. members serve six-year terms. the governor designates the chairperson of the
                commission. members are reimbursed for expenses.
                  the commission appoints a chief counsel to supervise the divisions of the commission. these
                  divisions are: the capital litigation division; the violent crime and drug defense division; the
                  appellate division; the dna testing division; and the major case resource center, which helps
                  public defenders, contracting attorneys or court-appointed attorneys with the defense of felony
                  offenses. the chief counsel also administers the legal aid and services fund and the civil
                legal services fund.
mission statement
the mission of the agency is to assist nebraska counties in providing indigent criminal defense
                  services, which are mandated by the state and federal constitutions and state laws. this agency
                  also represents qualifying indigent prisoners under the dna testing act and administers the
                  legal aid and services fund and the civil legal services fund, which assist indigent citizens
                who are in need of civil legal services and cannot afford to hire an attorney.
