three generations, one legacy

    about us
  

























since 1980, life extension has been informing consumers on the latest in health and wellness news in our monthly life extension magazine®. it’s critical to our business that our magazine is printed and mailed on time every single month. for over two decades, schumann printers has been our continuous partner in ensuring that a high-quality publication is delivered to our readers without fail every month.– rey searles, vice president of marketing // life extension









our very demanding readership expects the finest quality printing and paper so picking a printer had to do as much with quality as it did with costs. we found schumann met both of those vital needs so we could continue delivering the highest quality magazine in a very competitive market set. schumann always bends over backwards to accommodate our needs, and the product schumann produces is absolutely stellar. my biggest regret is that we did not find and switch to schumann earlier for our printing needs. - kevin carmody, partner-group publisher // v1 media, llc









schumann is the best to work with, they’re not just a vendor, they are a partner. they’ve helped us grow and deal with both the good times and the bad. the staff are fabulous at what they do, and they regularly go beyond what is required from a vendor. they understand how important our clients are to us.- laura marlowe, vp, print production // manifest









besides being impressed with schumann’s quality printing and responsive customer service, i’m most appreciative of their proactive approach to anticipating and solving printing issues before we go on press.- patrick coyne, editor/designer // communication arts









we have been working with schumann printers for more than 20 years. they are, without a doubt, one of the most valuable resources we have. our customer service representative often anticipates questions or concerns we have before we can even ask. they have invested in state-of-the-art equipment and are always willing to help us look for new and innovative ways to create new products. we value our longstanding partnership with schumann because of their reliability, flexibility, high-end production capability and excellent customer service.- erin jorgensen, director, publishing/managing editor // american rental association
