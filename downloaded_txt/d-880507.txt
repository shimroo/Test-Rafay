this_is_gennabut if you have a gaia account, please vote:bigfoot: myth or reality?it's for my english essay, we have to do some research of our own. and...this is how i am doing it. either way, if you don't have a gaia, comment on this entry.do you believe in bigfoot?is the question. feel free to give reasons why/why not and/or why you think people would/would want to believe in bigfoot if you feel so inclined. again, this is for my english project, i don't care either way. this is essentially my field research.
