our readers here at the the monarchist have certainly noticed the severely reduced activity here.

there is a reason for it. we all see now how the establishment of the american two-party system is coming apart.

there is good reason for optimism; optimism for a true democracy, where the people truly can be free. the trump phenomenon is helping to bring this about.

finally, we see the need for monarchy and aristocracy truly fading. the people can be free at last.

that is why there has been very little activity here at the monarchist lately.

april fools' day,

her majesty's ships,
the queen's money





in less than half a year from now, her britannic majesty is due to surpass her great-great-grandmother queen victoria as the longest reigning british monarch. the british monarchist society will mark this with a weekend event in edinburgh, including a function aboard the royal yacht britannia. it might have been just in time to get the opportunity.

the royal yacht britannia had her last foreign mission taking governor chris patten of hong kong home with the prince of wales after the handover of the crown colony. the yacht was decommissioned at the end of the same year. a replacement has yet to be commissioned.

not many days ago the monarchist was in close contact with sources in the royal navy who could reveal that plans are soon to be announced for the recommissioning of the royal yacht britannia from her retirement in the port of edinburgh. new technology allows for cost-efficient and satisfactory refurbishment of the yacht. moreover, the bank of england will participate in the project by issuing a very cheap loan. sources close to the governor of the bank of england say the project is a small part of boosting the economy through newly created-out-of-thin-air money.

the monarchist has used highly sophisticated encryption software when contacting these sources. we take protecting our sources seriously. no sources will be revealed.

we here at the monarchist find this very interesting and exciting news. more details will be announced shortly.

happy easter!

the global petition sponsored by the commonwealth freedom of movement organisation based out of vancouver, british columbia, which is advocating free movement of the citizens of canada, australia, new zealand and the uk in each others' countries -- has garnered an astonishing 60,000 signatures plus in just a few days. perhaps we shouldn't be surprised by this. this is not about symbolism after all, but about freedom, which people can easily get their heads around. do you support unfettered access to four countries that have so much in common, shared struggles, cousinage, the same language, similar political institutions and a shared head of state? yes, please! where do i sign up? more than 90% in an online poll of 70,000 people said they would jump at the chance. who in their right mind would be against such a thing?

in some ways this is not a new free mobility scheme but the restoration of an old one, as canadians, australians, new zealanders and the citizens of the uk used to enjoy unrestricted freedom of movement when they were all british subjects under the crown. when imperialism fell out of fashion and the crown fragmented along national lines, these rights were gradually rescinded as the commonwealth realms diverged politically, culturally and economically in the 1960s. consequently, the monarchy entered a long period of uncertainty, and was almost fatally undermined by the subsequent closed system of assertive post-imperial nationalism. 

much no wonder the monarchy has suffered these past fifty years. i mean, if australians who shared the same head of state with britons could not even enter the uk with appropriate decorum, nor canada for that matter, but were told to cue in the foreigner's line, then what good was a shared monarchy anyways? what tangible benefits did it bring? in such circumstances, it was difficult to dispel (still is difficult to dispel) the notion that we were/are headed by a foreign monarch. that is because we do not have a national monarchy, but a supranational one, which is true for canadians and australians, as it is for the english and scots. how could a fundamentally supranational monarchy adequately reflect national aspirations in an age of assertive nationalism? the answer is, it couldn't then and it still can't now.

a shared monarchy can only thrive if the nations that share it feel they are part of something bigger, some shared undertaking, who enjoy at least a few perks of membership, and not just something symbolic. in a relentlessly utilitarian age, it must have real meaning and bring real benefits to people. i must say the contemporary revival and reconvergence of the english-speaking realms is one of the most interesting trend lines taking place in the 21st century. the modern networks of human communication have already given rise to a single online english-speaking civilization that transcends distance, geography and the exclusivity of the nation-state. at the end of the day, culture is more important than geography. for nations that share the same culture and the same level of socio-economic development, i believe the free mobility of citizens only makes eminent sense, and that it's only a matter of time before this initative succeeds.

over the years i've gotten questions that make me think:the most often asked question i get is "why have a queen?",  "what does she actually do?"others say "yes, but if she makes an oath at her coronation to govern her people, yet hands over the power to an elected parliament (most of whom do not take their oath to her seriously), in what way does she "defend our laws"?others state "she can only act on the advice of her ministers, and must do, then what is her function?"  one person did ask me "could not a goldfish do that!?"the queen can only come to realms like australia if invited, so how is she a sovereign lord?i don't know if you have read hilaire belloc?  very hard to sum up his vast knowledge and views in a short email, however he does seem to have predicted the rise of over-might subjects and ever more protestent parliament, and a growing legal class.  seeing the last true monarchs of britian as being the stuart's.  it's been some time since i've read his book charles i but i seem to remember something about the aristocracy being the enemy of true monarchy.great monarchs like the bible's king david or france's louis xiv were rulers, not someone there to give a respectable face to a parliamentary dictatorship.i suppose some would argue the pope to be the last of the true king rulers and will be very safe from overthrow.

monarchy can easily be debunked, but watch the faces, mark well the debunkers. these are the men whose taproot in eden has been cut: whom no rumour of the polyphony, the dance, can reach - men to whom pebbles laid in a row are more beautiful than an arch. yet even if they desire mere equality they cannot reach it. where men are forbidden to honour a king they honour millionaires, athletes or film stars instead: even famous prostitutes or gangsters. for spiritual nature, like bodily nature, will be served; deny it food and it will gobble poison - c.s. lewis

- defender of the faith -





the character of kings is sacred; their persons are inviolable; they are the anointed of the lord, if not with sacred oil, at least by virtue of their office. their power is broad - based upon the will of god, and not on the shifting sands of the people's will. they will be spoken of with becoming reverence, instead of being in public estimation fitting butts for all foul tongues. it becomes a sacrilege to violate their persons, and every indignity offered to them in word or act, becomes an indignity offered to god himself. - archbishop john healy
