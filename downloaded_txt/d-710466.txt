to our patients
thank you!

dear patients,
it has been my pleasure caring for you, your families, and the community over the years. i have had the privilege of developing many patient relationships that i will forever cherish. however, the time has come, and it is with some difficulty i am writing to notify you that i have made the decision to retire and pass along my patients to other physicians within florida woman care.
thank you all for the wonderful memories and for sharing some of the most intimate moments like the births of your babies. i appreciate the honor you have given me to be part of your lives and the loyalty throughout the years.
sincerely,
dr. patricia st. john
