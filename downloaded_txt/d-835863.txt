effective jan 1, 2024, nueco will no longer provide parts or support for holan, teco, mti, telsta, reachall, liftall, aerial lift of ct or pittman. if you still have any of these products in your fleet, we encourage you to identify other parts sources.

repairs are inevitable. machinery, including bucket trucks, has components that will eventually wear out and need to be replaced. the good news is that we can save you money and help cut your repair bill in half. we carry a wide variety of used bucket truck parts, used digger derrick parts, used crane parts and other items to help your business. we also have hard to find parts and discontinued parts.

our large manufacturing facility allows us to manufacture and sell new parts for each brand name unit, helping keep owners’ equipment working. our service department is educated and certified to perform inspections, tests and repairs to these units. altec nueco‘s knowledgeable staff offers tech support for these brands.
