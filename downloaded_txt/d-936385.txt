2025 requirements
the 2025 northwest science expo will be a hybrid with judges reviewing project materials in advance of the fair and in person interviews at portland state university. the state fair will be friday april 11, 2025.
for high school, we will continue to require the research plan and other project forms be uploaded using a google folder. for hybrid fairs, a slide deck  will be required. virtual fairs require both slide deck and video.
the regional fairs are also requiring isef forms and research plans be uploaded instead of mailed. check the fair page for specific deadlines.
middle school will use a slide deck to share both forms and project information.
