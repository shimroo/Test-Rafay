a distinctive feature of phang nga bay is the sheer limestone cliffs that                     jut vertically out of the emerald green water.
                              
                              james bond island and koh pannyi are just two of the more famous                 spots in this bay. by far the best means of enjoying the spectacular                 scenery, with only brief encounters with the tourist crowds as james                 bond and koh pannyi, is to take one of the boat trips from the northern                 end of phuket.
                               a leisurely day trip cruising through the dramatic                 limestone islands, occasionally stopping to enjoy quiet beaches,                 is far more rewarding than the standard bus-boat tour.

the richness of the tropical forest flora, the abundance                     of fresh water, and the shelter of the mountains all provide                     excellent habitats for many wildlife species. khao sok national                     park makes up part of the largest continuous forest area remaining                     in the thai peninsula. this provides the only viable habitat                     in southern thailand for large mammals needing extensive areas                     of undisturbed forest for their survival.
