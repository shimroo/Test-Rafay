focus on generic drugs
a generic is a medicine that is sold under a non-proprietary international name or brand name that differs from the original drug, as a rule, these are names derived from an active substance or consonant with the original product.
an important difference between the original drug and the generic is the price. the latter product is several times cheaper due to the fact that the manufacturer of the original drug had to invest millions of dollars in the development of a chemical formula, spent huge amounts for clinical trials, promotion of goods on the market and other expenses. but the manufacturer of generics needs to wait until the patent for the drug expires in order to start cheaper reproduction of the active substance. this process is not only legal but also approved by the world health organization (who) and the fda. besides, many countries support an affordable medicine program and encourage pharmacies to sell generics.
therefore, the generics resented on our website are drugs that have the same therapeutic effect as expensive brands.
our assortment
the assortment of my canadian pharmacy includes both brand-name and generic medications for children and adults.
