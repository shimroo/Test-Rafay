a letter from the owners of magnum tours
like many of you, magnum tours has tried to adapt to the current travel restrictions across the globe due to coronavirus. our company has been tested before, and our spirit – dampened during these difficult time.  although the experiences of our past have been radically different from those of today, one consistent lesson threads through them all: we must care for and have faith in one another.  
starting immediately, magnum tours has decided to suspend all new belize vacation requests.  we regret the dire choices we have had to make, including the interruption of vacations and the postponement of plans that mean so much to so many. 
please keep our employees, their families and our belize partners in your thoughts as you go about your day, as we will keep you in ours.    we would like to thank all our clients and travel agency partners for your understanding.
warm regards, the magnum tours team
