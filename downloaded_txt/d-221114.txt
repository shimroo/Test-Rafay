faces 2 by brian anderson





congrats to brian anderson on his amazing book with iconic uk gangster photos!ba xandersonfaces 2: the underworld through my lens – a dark tale of crime, power, and fear. in 2010, i published faces, a photo book that became infamous for its raw, unflinching look at the uk’s criminal underworld. as a tabloid photographer at the news of the world, i had access to some of the most notorious faces in crime. faces went on to become the most widely recognized crime photo book in history. but that was just the beginning. last year, i released the story of faces, my own reimagining of the original work, peeling back the layers to show the men behind the headlines. now, we’re gearing up for the story of faces 2. this isn’t about glamorizing criminals. faces 2 is about diving deep into the real world of gangsters, hitmen, and mobsters, exposing the terrifying reality of the uk's darkest figures and beyond. it's a hard-hitting, no-holds-barred picture essay—these aren't your typical hollywood bad boys. we’ve got the likes of terry ellis, the mastermind behind a £100 million heist, still out there somewhere, his crime as legendary as his face is infamous. then there’s kevin lane, a convicted hitman who’s spent years in the prison system, now fighting to clear his name after a miscarriage of justice. the man’s a walking contradiction, feared by all yet fighting for redemption. kenny collins, one of the infamous hatton garden robbers, is also here—he helped pull off a £14 million heist, showing just how far greed can push a person. the mafia figures are also in full force—take michael franzese, who earned more money for his columbo family than al capone ever did, or billy “buffalo” claire, the irish enforcer with ties to the irish paramilitary group cira, feared and respected in equal measure. this isn't just another “true crime” story—it’s a picture of the darkest corners of the criminal world, a snapshot of those who walk the line between fear and respect, power and peril. it's gritty. it's raw. it's as dark as the shadows they live in. and, sure, i can’t help but add a bit of humor—the kind that comes only when you’ve seen the worst of humanity up close. after all, in a world where mobsters and gangsters rule, you’ve got to laugh to stop yourself from crying. welcome to faces 2. you’ve been warned.
