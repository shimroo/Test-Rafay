  open letter    dear colleagues, contributors, supporters and friends,

 greetings to you all...
                we've aimed to re-structure and re-design the light millennium's (lm) main website in 2018. the organization's related software programs and its old computer are completely out-dated and not working. thus, we couldn't make any progress since january 2017 neither was able to hire a professional one for this purpose as a volunteer-based organization.  nevertheless, we wereâandâare able to post the organization's minutes of the 'regular' board meetings and lmtv related media releases as ".pdf" files. 
               besides that, in 2017, we produced, and presented several  the light millennium television | lmtv series through qptv.org and mnn.org channels, and made those available through this website along with 11 photo albums (available in the gallery ii).further, we've been continuously e-publishing both in english and turkish on the  turkish library & museum website, in particular, since january 2017, which is also under the umbrella of the organization. therefore, until this website is fully upgraded, www.turkishlibrary.us is/will be acting on behalf of the lm site. 
             with that in mind, we've been determined to upgrade this website in terms of restructuring and redesigning in 2018.
             thank you very much for your understanding, patient and ongoing support.  
 with peace and love, â bircan ãnver, march 12, 2018.
