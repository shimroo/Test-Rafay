extension programs










researchers at penn state, other land grant universities, and the agricultural research service generate information that can be used to solve important problems related to food, health and the environment.
the goal of our extension program is to critically evaluate and translate this information into a form that can be used by pennsylvanians to improve their businesses and their lives.
















animals and livestock




penn state extension delivers animal education and programs in five primary areas: dairy, equine, poultry, canine welfare, and livestock (including sheep, swine, beef cattle, and goats).










dairy production medicine (dpm) certificate program




a two-and-a-half year course enabling veterinarians to gain skills and knowledge to help them increase the health and productivity of their clients' herds, as well as increase the value of their consulting services.
