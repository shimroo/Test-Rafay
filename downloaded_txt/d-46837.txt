 the santa monica bike patrol covers one of the most beautiful beach areas in southern california.  these full-fledged police officers fight all sorts of crime, but without the protection of a 4000 pound police car.  patrolling on bikes allows our officers to sneak up on suspects and chase them through the streets and boardwalks in the santa monica and venice area.  our cops on bikes provide action-packed stunts like you've never seen before on television.  this hit series, originally the highest rated series on usa network has become a world-wide hit.  starring jim davidson, paula trickey, darlene vogel, marcos ferraez, david l. lander, and rick rossovich as lt. palermo, as well as mario lopez, shanna moakler, jeff stearns, amy hunter-cornelius
