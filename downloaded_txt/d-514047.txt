assessment management
 
not happy when one of your assessments or tax bills is higher than expected?  neither are we and we’ll prove it by fighting it back to the level you expected – and maybe even further. same goes for your real estate values. advantax approaches each year with a fresh look to see exactly what’s happening in your market.  don’t be lulled to sleep by an assessor keeping a value flat from last year – just because your value didn’t increase does not make it right. we never settle for the status quo.
things to consider:

do all members of your team have a clear understanding of the concept of market value and how it’s calculated?
do you actively track and compare jurisdictions’ values and assessment notices with anticipated values?
has your department identified critical valuation thresholds?
do they engage in appeals when assessed values exceed those thresholds?

contact us now to see how we can help with your assessment management.
