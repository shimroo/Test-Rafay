    how it works

   1

  submit your service request

it is very important to us that customers meet the owner, give the history of their pool, so that any kinks can be worked out before we start regular service. pool service cannot be quoted properly over the phone.

 2

  we connect you with a certified service technician

in some cases the pool will not be ready for weekly pool service. if this is the case customers will be informed of repairs or if a clean-up is needed before service can begin. work will only be completed with customer approval.



   3

  back to enjoying your backyard

assigned service tech will start regular service.

problem solved!we were battling a white water mold problem after an equipment failure. we put 8 lbs of shock in for 5 days with no change. i went into anchor and liz was so helpful (she always is). she was at a loss at what else we could do so she called bioguard and had me sit with her and explain everything. she helped me answer some of the pool chemistry questions as we walked through everything that had happened. the bioguard rep gave me a very specific direction to try. low and behold, after doing the treatment suggested by bioguard, my pool was 100 percent clear with no white mold the next day. completely gone. thank you, liz, for always being helpful and so knowledgeable!

anchor pools is the place!anchor pools installed a new liner in my pool this year and i could not be more pleased with the workmanship and end result of this job. dave, with 30+ years experience in this field is definitely a valuable asset to anchor pools. the courtesy and promptness of the service department, brad kelly and the entire crew is simply unmatched. anchor pools has become my "go-to" place for many years now and i would not change a thing about that. let's not forget the staff in retail, they are always a pleasure to interact with, very courteous, friendly and helpful. thank you everyone for a great job. my pool is absolutely beautiful and gets a lot of comments from people, even my lawn service crew the other day. to all out there undecided: anchor pools is the place to turn to for all of your pool or spa needs. happy summer, everyone!

i cannot recommend them more!the previous owners of our house used anchor pool and we just continued the service. we never owned a pool before and ryan, the pool man, has been great. he keeps it clean and has shown me how to maintain the water between his visits. i cannot recommend them more!
