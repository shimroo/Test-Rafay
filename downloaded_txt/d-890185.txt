 living in the ever-changing “information age,” it is impossible to disregard the substantial effect social media has had on the exchange of thoughts, ideas, and data in the modern world. but not all information is reliable. social media platforms like tiktok, instagram, and x afford their users unparalleled freedom of speech, but in doing so allow for and often encourage the spread of misinformation. in 2024, pew research center found that just over half (54%) of americans use social media for news coverage. as social media increasingly shapes how we access information on critical issues and current events, it’s essential to reflect on our relationship with these platforms and critically evaluate the reliability of the information they present.what can we do to ensure the information we receive from social media is reliable? how should freedom of speech function in these digital spaces? who is accountable to answer these questions, and what is the responsibility of social media companies, the government and the public? we invite students, faculty, and staff to join us in a small table facilitated dialogue where these questions and more will be explored as we seek to find “truth” in our complex and increasingly digital world.dinner will be providedthis dialogue is organized by the democracy & dialogues initiative student fellows

 about this event  this event is hosted by the gladstein family human rights institute and co-sponsored by uconn asian and asian american studies. the human rights lunchtime colloquium hosts guest speakers who present and discuss their research exploring emerging ideas, theories, and practices on the frontiers of human rights.  we welcome you to join us over lunch in conference room 162 of the dodd center for human rights. simply register below.   abstract  studies about port cities in the global south extensively discuss their development and planning during the colonial, postcolonial and neo-liberal periods. some of them focus on the development and uniformity of infrastructure in urban spaces across the world. however, the many contentions and protests that shape postcolonial urban spaces in relation to race, caste, gender and environmental issues find little space in urban studies scholarship. filling this gap, my research on the indian subcontinent’s port city of kochi takes into account of people’s struggles and belonging with the water-world as crucial to shaping and sustaining postcolonial port cities. i demonstrate these struggles as efforts to democratize the otherwise deeply segregated and hierarchical urban space on the basis of caste and gender, as well as championing the need to preserve the seashores and marine life for our collective eco-futures. specifically, i illustrate an island community’s struggles to preserve their marine ecology in the port city of kochi. their protests, actively led by women from the caste-oppressed shore communities, demonstrate embodied and decolonial ways of being in the saline and fresh water worlds that surround them. the women protestors reinstate the peripherized islands’ geographical prominence along with the need to protect the seashores, not only for their life on the delicate coastal land but also for the wider land systems that thrive in rhythm with the water-world.   about the speakercarmel christy k j is a cultural studies scholar interested in the politics and affective manifestations of gender, environment, caste and urban space in south asia. she is an assistant professor of journalism at kamala nehru college, university of delhi. currently, she is a postdoctoral research associate at the gladstein family human rights institute, university of connecticut. she has published on the intersectionality of caste, gender and environmental justice in south asia, the interrelationship between land, caste and gender; caste bias in indian higher educational institutions as well as on displacement, religion and urban space-making in india. her first book sexuality and public space in india: reading the visible (routledge, 2017) discusses the new-found hyper-visibility of women’s sexuality in indian media, after the 1990s-globalization, through the lens of caste. carmel is working on her next monograph fading shores, forging life: caste, gender and ecology in a south asian port city about urban space-making in coastal india which examines the question of gender, caste, spatial and environmental justice.

   what does it mean to be politically engaged? how do political action and freedom of speech shape our society? in 1860, amidst deep political divisions and fears of civil war, five young men from hartford, connecticut, formed a campaign organization that grew into a nationwide movement, ultimately helping to elect abraham lincoln. the bold and creative activism of the “wide awakes”—many of whom were too young to vote—raises questions that remain strikingly relevant today.  a new exhibit at the connecticut museum brings the story of the wide awakes to life through rare artifacts and documents from the museum’s collection. attendees will have the opportunity to delve deeper into this history through facilitated conversations and a q&a session with guest scholars and activists. the artifacts serve as a lens to explore how americans in the past grappled with free speech, democracy, and political conflict, sparking connections to contemporary civic engagement.  the program will begin at 6:00 pm. doors open at 5:30 pm, so please come early to browse the museum galleries and share a light meal before the program begins!  this event is hosted by the democracy & dialogues initiative and connecticut museum of culture and history   click here to register.

   this dialogue will explore the trajectory of black freedom celebrations from jubilee to juneteenth and reflect on the meaning of those commemorations in the imaginations of the african diaspora.  inspired by the lecture and annette gordon-reed’s reflections in her book on juneteenth, we will examine the complexities of memory and commemoration, and how these rituals connect personal and collective histories, shaping our understanding of freedom, identity, and justice in america. together, we’ll discuss the significance of juneteenth as both a celebration of liberation and a call to action for continued work toward racial equity.  participants will engage in facilitated small-group discussions, sharing perspectives on the evolving meaning of freedom, historical memory, and how these commemorations continue to inspire the african diaspora. whether you are deeply familiar with juneteenth or just beginning to learn about its significance, this dialogue welcomes all voices to reflect, connect, and build community together.

   join us for a book talk and fireside chat, where scott presents images and stories from his new book, based on seven years of frontline reporting from the warzones of central america in the 1980s. he will join a panel of experts to discuss the current relevance of those events on immigration and our treatment of immigrants, the critical role of the press as a counterweight to disinformation, and the treatment of civilians in wartime.   about the bookcentral america in the crosshairs of war: on the road from vietnam to iraq is an unforgettable account of how misguided and illegal u.s. policies in central america during the 1980s resulted in tens of thousands of deaths, created many of today’s problems along america’s southern border, and helped perpetuate a legacy of hawkish militarism at the expense of democracy and diplomacy.  during the 1980s, the united states financed and directed wars against popular movements in central america. vowing to block “soviet expansion” in the hemisphere, the u.s. waged a vietnam-style counterinsurgency in el salvador while orchestrating a covert and illegal war to overthrow the sandinista government in nicaragua. some 75,000 died in el salvador, the vast majority at the hands of the u.s.-supported military and security forces. more than 35,000 were killed during the so-called contra war in nicaragua. meanwhile, with tacit u.s. support, the guatemalan military razed hundreds of indigenous communities and killed more than 200,000 people during a civil war that claimed the lives of 100,000 mayan villagers.  scott wallace covered these conflicts throughout the decade for some of the world’s most prestigious media, including cbs news, newsweek, and the guardian. traveling along the frontlines of war, wallace evolved a distinctive reporting style that included photojournalistic portraits of startling intimacy, page-turning tales of high adventure, and incisive analysis of the events he witnessed. the result is this unforgettable account in words and images of a reporter coming of age on the battlefield as he seeks the truth amid a landscape rife with death and deception.   about the authorscott wallace is an award-winning writer, television producer, and photojournalist who has covered armed conflict, the environment, vanishing cultures around the world for the past four decades. he joined the journalism department at the university of connecticut as an associate professor in 2017. he is an affiliate faculty member of el instituto: uconn’s institute of latino/a, caribbean and latin american studies.  in addition to his work in central america, he has reported on war, organized crime, and the environment from africa, south america, the arctic, the himalaya, southeast asia, china, the former soviet union, and the middle east.  as a frequent contributor to national geographic, he has reported extensively from the deep recesses of the amazon rainforest on environmental conflict and indigenous cultures. he is the author of the new york times bestselling book, the unconquered: in search of the amazon’s last uncontacted tribes, a firsthand account of his trek through the land of a mysterious tribe living in extreme isolation deep in the amazon rainforest.   about the event  following a presentation by scott wallace, there will be a fireside chat with refreshments. copies of central america in the crosshairs of war will be on sale at this event.  this event is hosted by the gladstein family human rights institute, in collaboration with the university of connecticut’s el instituto, department of journalism, humanities institute, global affairs, and the research program on arts & human rights.
