“quality, integrity, honesty. i wish i had a dozen business partners like fisher industries!”

— dick mcconnell, national accounts/oem manager of flexco




“we at eessco consider the air separator produced by fisher industries to be the best in the field. my opinion is that anyone that has a crushing plant that sells material to the asphalt producer or for themselves should own one.  fisher gets five stars for sure.”

— dick vining, general manager of eessco




“for over a decade, southwest asphalt has been an essential component to the success of our company. from the initial call for a quote and pricing through the day of paving, the southwest asphalt team goes above and beyond to get the job done. they stand by their pricing, their service and their quality, making the job we do much easier.”
