our variacâ® transformers with ratings from 120v to 1000+ vac have been proudly manufactured in the usa for over 70 years.

single phase and three phase variable transformer versions with load ratings from fractional to 1000+ amps are available. variac® transformers are variable ac power supplies that provide adjustable ac voltage. their distortion free output is ideal for sensitive electronic applications, testing devices for agency approval, and numerous other applications where a variable ac voltage is required. our variac transformers are available that boost the output voltage in excess of twice the input voltage. input frequencies 50hz, 60hz and other fequencies up to 2000 hz can be accommodated on some standard and custom models.
