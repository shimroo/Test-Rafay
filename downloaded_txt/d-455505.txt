the beginning
do what you love and never work a day
arch started playing the piano at age 4 in amarillo, tx where he was born.â  while in high school, arch learned to play guitar, bass and drums.â  he was also excelling with piano where all his musical mentors considered him a virtuoso.â  when he was 19, arch made his professional debut at fritzâs on a 10 ft. grand piano signed by liberace, who arch admired his style of playing.
the journey
honing skills for a personal musical style
later, he received his bachelor of fine arts degree from texas tech university in lubbock, texas.â  during that period, arch mastered the ability to create original music, develop and arrange existing music to create a new style, as well as, provide captivating and memorable performances.â  arch has continued to professionally developed his craft from his music and stage training.
arch has performed for well over 5 million people worldwide!â  for over 30 years, he has traveled extensively as a professional performer throughout the us, canada and abroad.â  this included residencies in dallas, austin, cincinnati, boston, colorado springs, auckland (new zealand) and amsterdam (netherlands).
the craft
an incredible ability to communicateâ with individuals in the audience
arch is a versatile musician with the unique ability to appreciate the performance and style of a wide range of music genres and styles. â every performance is unique, it is not a predetermined set list.â  this sets the tone of musical spontaneity and arch can draw upon over 900 performers from his personal memory catalog, to design the experience dynamically.
arch takes every audience on a musical journey that he can create in the moment to fit the audience and occasion as well as create a mood and emotion fitting the occasion.â  this can be a blend of original music, familiar and beloved music and newâ  hits re-arranged and personalized to capture the spirit of the moment.â  fans often remark that every time the experience arch perform, they feel and learn something new.â  that has garnered arch a loyal following wherever he performs.
the audience demographics range in age, background and music styles; however, archâs unique ability to capture audiences instantly with his personality and personalized performance has built lifelong connections with those who sometimes just happen upon his performances.
the brand
an insatiable love for music
arch has the ability to learn existing music from hearing it once and incorporating it into his performances, from classics and new music, his performances are unique and personalized. in learning new music and studying his musical idols, arch has an uncanny way of paying homage to the original musician but with his own arch hooks brand of musicality that keeps his audiences engaged from start to finish and coming back for more.

december 24, 2022 arch hooks âbat sleigh ride!â


i had written a birthday song for my mother and gave it to her on her 90th birthday.  she has passed on, but to mark her 100th birthday, i have re-recorded âmomâs songââ©.   please, feel free to play it for your mom too!
arch hooks music has something for everyone.â  country, tango, blues, we could go on & on but suffice it to say there is a rockân roll element to it that makes your head start bouncing.â  if you truly love music then arch would like to take you on a ride, show you some of what is in himâ¦
all of archâs music can be found on â spotify â itunes â amazon ââ cdbabyâ¦ well there are about 250 places online that can sell any and all of archâs musicâ¦ we encourage you to go to archâs youtube channel, so you can follow along the musical journey path with arch.
here or should i say hear, are some reviews ofâ¦
piano talk
back seat oracle
chemistry
and most recentlyâ¦ time for the wingman, a music film with a companion soundtrack.




funny story about âshut the fu<k up!â â itâs nickname is #12 â not hashtag 12 â number 12!â  it got the name from the owner of a bar, who overheard some scream, âshut the fu<k up!â to arch.â  standing up saying loudly âwho told arch toâ âshut the fu<k up!â â archâs manager said, âno, no the guy was just requesting archâs new songâ âshut the fu<k up!ââ¦â  â âoh, you mean #12 on his cd in the jukebox?ââ  from that moment onâ âshut the fu<k up!â has been known as #12!â  there are a few choice â#12â stories from the us copyright office, and cd babyâ¦â  but, weâll tell later if youâre good!


















did you know that each and every song arch has written is for a reason ââ  â â 
âthe undertakerââ fromâ piano talkâ is about driving a âloadedâ hearse to monroe, la with a friend or âlittle leopardââ off of theâ back seat oracleâ cd, arch has seen that a leopard truly never changes its spotsâ or âbitchzillaââ off ofâ chemistry cdâ¦â                                                           well, you can probably guess where this came from!





bitchzilla! and the 40,000lb. piano â the lyrics are super simple!









time for the wingmanâsâ working title was âbat man for a dayââ¦â  itâs about being a hero in your own neighborhood.â  dealing with the complexities of what it takes to be that hero.â  not everyone can recognizes heroic deeds, or see past the facade of someone, to truly understand what makes them tick.â  theâ time for the wingmanâsâ is the first of its kind.â  a music film.â  sixâ vignetteâs woven together through music and narrative, to tell a collective story.
makingâ time for the wingmanâ took arch 2 years. 


time for the wingman: arch hooks is psychotic
