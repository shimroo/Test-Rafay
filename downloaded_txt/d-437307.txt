dear friends of colin:it has been 6 months since colin passed away and i am not sure how many of you still have colin in your friends list.  however, i hope a few of you remain connected since i want to tell you how much you all meant to colin and me during the brief time he kept his blog.   you were his link to the larger world outside of his room.  your on-going discussions provided the mental stimulation that he craved and when you asked him for advice, it made him happy that he could be helpful.  i would love to be able to thank each and every one of you individually but i was never able to keep track of how many people were on his friends list.  so please know that i truly appreciate all of your kindness and support, even after he passed away.i know several of you sent donations to the als association -- thank you so very much!    and now i hope to continue some of colin's efforts to work for a cure for this horrendous disease.  on sun sept 9th, the oregon chapter of the als association is holding its annual walk to d'feet fundraiser.  like colin did  the past two years, i am leading a team of walkers.  there is a new location for the walk this year.  it will at the east side esplanade and from some of the early info that i have received, it sounds like it is going to be even better than ever.  i will pass on the details as i get them but in the meantime, i hope you will "save the date" and if you are in the portland area, join us for a fun event.thank you again, dear friends.   laurielink leave a comment | 7 commentstue, feb. 20th, 2007, 05:27 pm a memorial service to remember
