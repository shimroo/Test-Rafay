join us sunday!



we're one church meeting in many locations across the beautiful mountains of western north carolina. a great place to start is by joining us for a sunday service. our worship services are full of dynamic worship and practical, biblical teaching. whether you’re brand new to faith, have questions, or have been a christ-follower for years, our services are a safe place to learn more about what it means to follow jesus.
