samsung says its foldable shipments increased four-fold in 2021
january 3rd, 2022, 15:07 posted by: wraggsterin a recent blog post, samsung said it sold four times more foldable devices in 2021 than 2020. the verge reports:it attributes this success to the arrival of the galaxy z fold 3 and z flip 3 [...]. samsung says sales for these two devices in their first month alone exceeded "total accumulative sales of samsung foldable devices in 2020." these are promising metrics for the slow ascension of foldable phones, though you should bear in mind that samsung isn&#39;t sharing hard sales data. instead, it pointed to the fact that its increases were greater than predictions made by third-party analysts, who suggested that total shipments from all manufacturers for foldable devices would hit 9 million in 2021.

	if samsung thinks this figure is useful enough to cite -- and with the company thought to account for around 88 percent of the total foldable markets -- we can guess that its sales were in the high single-digit millions or pushing into the low tens of millions. these numbers are expected to increase tenfold by 2023 [...]. samsung also says that its decision to push forward early with foldable devices has paid off in terms of converting customers. it says that "compared to the galaxy note 20, samsung has seen a 150 percent increase in consumers who switched smartphone brands for the galaxy z flip 3." if you want to attract new money, it helps to offer something unique.

india antitrust watchdog orders investigation into apple's business practices
january 3rd, 2022, 15:04 posted by: wraggsterindian antitrust watchdog on friday ordered an investigation into apple&#39;s business practices -- in particular, the company mandating iphone app developers to use a proprietary payments system -- in india, where the american firm commands less than 2% of the smartphone market. from a report:the competition commission of india, which ordered the director general to conduct the probe within 60 days, said it is of the prima facie view that the mandatory use of apple&#39;s in-app payments system for paid apps and in-app purchases "restrict[s] the choice available to the app developers to select a payment processing system of their choice especially considering when it charges a commission of up to 30% for app purchases and in-app purchases."

canada's public health agency criticized for tracking 33m mobile devices
january 3rd, 2022, 14:47 posted by: wraggsterthe public health agency of canada (or phac) "accessed location data from 33 million mobile devices to monitor people&#39;s movement during lockdown," reports canada&#39;s national post newspaper:"due to the urgency of the pandemic, phac collected and used mobility data, such as cell-tower location data, throughout the covid-19 response," a spokesperson told national post... phac used the location data to evaluate the effectiveness of public lockdown measures and allow the agency to "understand possible links between movement of populations within canada and spread of covid-19," the spokesperson said.

	in march, the agency awarded a contract to the telus data for good program to provide "de-identified and aggregated data" of movement trends in canada. the contract expired in october, and phac no longer has access to the location data, the spokesperson said. the agency is planning to track population movement for roughly the next five years, including to address other public health issues, such as "other infectious diseases, chronic disease prevention and mental health," the spokesperson added.

	privacy advocates raised concerns to the national post about the long-term implications of the program. "i think that the canadian public will find out about many other such unauthorized surveillance initiatives before the pandemic is over &mdash; and afterwards," david lyon, author of pandemic surveillance and former director of the surveillance studies centre at queen&#39;s university, said in an email.... increased use of surveillance technology during the covid-19 pandemic has created a new normal in the name of security, lyon said. "the pandemic has created opportunities for a massive surveillance surge on many levels &mdash; not only for public health, but also for monitoring those working, shopping and learning from home."

	"evidence is coming in from many sources, from countries around the world, that what was seen as a huge surveillance surge &mdash; post 9/11 &mdash; is now completely upstaged by pandemic surveillance," he added.

ea extends uefa exclusivity, working on multiple fifa mobile games
february 17th, 2021, 00:01 posted by: wraggsterelectronic arts has secured a licence extension with uefa, and unveiled a number of projects designed to further solidify fifa's position as market leader in football games.
the publisher has signed a multi-year agreement with the european football association which gives it the exclusive rights to the champions league, as well as the europa league and super cup.
ea took this opportunity to also announce that fifa will make its debut on google's stadia streaming service this year, with fifa 21 launching on march 17.
stadia is in need of some positive news after google announced yesterday that it had closed the internal studios responsible for developing exclusive titles, instead focusing on third-party titles and outsourcing its tech to publishers.
ea also announced a number of other expansions for the fifa franchise, including the addition of 15 markets -- including russia, poland and turkey -- to free-to-play pc offering fifa online 4.

star wars has made $3bn for ea
february 16th, 2021, 23:58 posted by: wraggsterelectronic arts' exclusive partnership with disney over star wars has generated $3 billion in revenue so far.
that's according to ceo andrew wilson, who also told investors during last night's earnings call that the publisher has sold 52 million units across its various star wars games, including battlefront and its sequel, jedi: fallen order and squadrons.
free-to-play mobile offering star wars: galaxy of heroes accounts for $1 billion on its own, according to the seeking alpha transcript.
ea secured a ten-year deal for exclusive rights to make star wars games for console and pc after disney acquired lucasfilm in 2012. the first title to emerge from this was 2015's battlefront, but the publisher was already running bioware-developed mmo star wars: the old republic.
that exclusivity ended recently when lucasfilm games -- re-established as a separate division by disney -- signed a deal with ubisoft to make an open-world star wars game.
benchmark company analyst mike hickey asked if the lack of exclusivity meant ea would be producing fewer star wars games, to which wilson responded:

apple reportedly planning vr headset for next year
january 24th, 2021, 22:48 posted by: wraggsterapple is planning to launch a stand-alone virtual reality headset next year, according to a bloomberg report.
citing "people with knowledge of the matter," bloomberg said the headset is intended "to be a pricey, niche precursor to a more ambitious augmented reality product" that would have greater aspirations as a mainstream product.
in addition to being more expensive than existing vr headsets, the apple vr headset is expected to feature higher resolution visuals as well.
apple is also reportedly making the device lighter by giving it a fabric exterior and smaller by eliminating space headsets usually leave open to accommodate users wearing glasses.
instead, the company is working through the logistics of a system where custom prescription lenses can be inserted into the headset.

mobile gaming saw surge of new players in 2020
january 21st, 2021, 22:34 posted by: wraggsterthe full extent of mobile gaming growth in 2020 following surges of engagement during covid-19 lockdowns is finally becoming apparent, with the npd group releasing its deconstructing mobile & tablet gaming report in collaboration with sensor tower.
per the report, of the 303.7 million mobile users across the us and canada in 2020, 238.7 million are active mobile gamers.
this is up 12% over 2019's 214 million, a considerable growth increase from previous years, as the number of mobile games rose only 5% from 2017 to 2018, and only 2% from 2018 to 2019.
additionally, the average number of hours per week spent playing games on a smartphone or tablet rose to eight hours in 2020 from six in 2019, with npd again attributing this increase to the pandemic -- in fact, 35% of the mobile gamers in the us and canada that the npd surveyed said that covid-19 lockdowns had led them to engage with mobile games more frequently.
mobile gaming rose across all age groups, with the number of gamers ages 45 and older rising 17% year-over-year, the 25 to 44 age group rising 13%, the two to 12 age group rising 9%, and the 13 to 24 age group rising 3%.

core gamers generated 66% of mobile revenues in 2020
january 18th, 2021, 23:06 posted by: wraggstera new report shows that core gamers generated two thirds of all mobile games revenues last year, despite the games themselves only accounting for a fifth of all downloads.
that's according to app annie's state of mobile 2021 report, which shows that 66% of consumer spend on games across ios and android were spent on core games like pubg mobile and honor of kings.
by comparison, casual titles -- with examples given including roblox, my talking tom friends and among us -- only accounted for 23% of all gaming revenues, and casino apps for 11%.
app annie also reports that events were the biggest driver of in-game spending in 2020, accounting for $53 billion -- a big increase over the $1.99 billion spent on in-game events the year before.
looking at android only, 55% of time spent playing on mobile was dedicated to core games, with 43% for casual and 2% for casino.
however, casual still dominates in terms of downloads, accounting for 78% of all installs across ios and android last year. core games only accounted for 20%, while casino was at 2%.
according to app annie's data, pubg mobile was the global leader in terms of monthly active users, outranking candy crush saga, ludo king, among us and garena free fire, which filled out the rest of the top five.
garena free fire was the most downloaded game in the world, followed by among us, subway surfers, pubg mobile and gardenscapes.

epic games takes legal action against apple and google in uk
january 18th, 2021, 22:47 posted by: wraggsterapple has also released a statement to gamesindustry.biz, in which the company said:
âfor twelve years, the app store has helped developers turn their brightest ideas into apps that change the world. our priorities have always been to provide customers with a safe and trusted place to download software and to apply the rules equally to all developers. epic has been one of the most successful developers on the app store, growing into a multibillion dollar business that reaches millions of ios customers around the world, including the united kingdom.
"in ways a judge has described as deceptive and clandestine, epic enabled a feature in its app which was not reviewed or approved by apple, and they did so with the express intent of violating the app store guidelines that apply equally to every developer and protect customers. their reckless behavior made pawns of customers, and we look forward to making this clear to courts in the uk.â

the triumph of mobile core games heralds a demographic shift
january 18th, 2021, 22:41 posted by: wraggsterthe start of a new year often brings with it a number of interesting info-dumps, as various companies and organisations that track the industry's vital statistics show us how their corner of the world measured up in the previous year. this year is no exception, and january has already bestowed upon us a host of stats that give us a sense of how 2020 measured up for the industry -- and especially for the industry's sales and revenues.
perhaps the most striking nugget of data from what's been released thus far is a stat from mobile app tracking service app annie, which reported that around two-thirds of the revenues from mobile games last year were from what it classified as "core games" -- titles like pubg mobile and honour of kings, which are competitively oriented, and focused largely on the teen and young adult male demographic that was the industry's traditional bread and butter, and which generally wouldn't look out of place on a pc or console. combine that statistic with another, which pegged the percentage of overall mobile revenues coming from game software at around 72%, and you've got roughly half of the money pouring through apple's app store and google's play store being spent on these core games.

wasmer 1.0 can run webassembly 'universal binaries' on linux, macos, windows, android
january 11th, 2021, 22:28 posted by: wraggsterthe webassembly portable binary format will now have wider support from wasmer, the server-side runtime which "allows universal binaries compiled from c++, rust, go, python, and other languages to run on different operating systems and in web browsers without modification," reports infoworld:wasmer can run lightweight containers based on webassembly on a variety of platforms â linux, macos, windows, android, ios â from the desktop to the cloud to iot and mobile devices, while also allowing these containers to be embedded in any programming language. the wasmer runtime also is able to run the nginx web server and other webassembly modules...

wasmer was introduced in december 2018, with the stated goal of doing for webassembly what javascript did for node.js: establish it server-side. by leveraging wasmer for containerization, developers can create universal binaries that work anywhere without modification, including on linux, macos, and windows as well as web browsers. webassembly automatically sandboxes applications by default for secure execution, shielding the host environment from malicious code, bugs, and vulnerabilities in the software being run.
wasmer 1.0 reached "general availability status" with its release on january 5, and its developers are now claiming "out of this world" runtime and compiler performance.

"we believe that webassembly will be a crucial component for the future of software execution and containerization (not only inside the browser but also outside)."

ftc wary of apple and google "squeezing developers"
january 8th, 2021, 13:13 posted by: wraggsterthe federal trade commission has warned against the power of apple and google hold over mobile developers, suggesting this is partly responsible for the rise of harmful monetisation practices.

in a statement regarding the recent order for mobile ad platform tapjoy to better police fraudulent campaigns, ftc commissioner rohit chopra commented on the market in general, noting that tapjoy was "not the only platform squeezing developers" and dubbing it a "minnow" next to apple and google.

"by controlling the dominant app stores, these firms enjoy vast power to impose taxes and regulations on the mobile gaming industry," he wrote.

"we should all be concerned that gatekeepers can harm developers and squelch innovation."

chopra said the clearest example is the "rent extraction" seen in apple and google's 30% commission fee on all sales and in-game purchases, as well as their power to ban developers for "trying to avoid this tax through offering alternative payment systems."

apple removes 39,000 games from china store in biggest single-day takedown
january 4th, 2021, 18:18 posted by: wraggsterapple removed 39,000 mobile games from the chinese ios app store on new year's eve as it completed its crackdown on unlicensed titles.
reuters reports it is the biggest removal ever to occur in a single day, and was carried out alongside the removal of 46,000 non-games apps.
the publication cites research firm qimai, which claims only 74 of the top 1,500 paid games on ios avoided removal.
among the games affected were assassin's creed identity and nba 2k20, the firm claims.
apple has been clamping down on all titles that did not have a valid publishing number -- or isbn (international standard book number) -- from china's national press and publication administration, the government body that handles approval for game releases.

apple reportedly warns devs of more app takedowns in chinese app store
december 24th, 2020, 23:47 posted by: wraggsterapple has warned developers of the imminent removal of thousands of mobile games and apps from the chinese app store -- the second wave of removals this year.
the wall street journal obtained an official apple memo that was sent earlier this month, warning developers that they needed to submit proof of a chinese government license on or before december 31, 2020.
this is the reemergence of an issue from july, when at least 15,000 games were removed from the mainland chinese app store in a single month.
to avoid removal, developers and publishers needed an isbn (international standard book number) from china's national press and publication administration -- a relatively slow process, which all but guarantees the failure of many companies to comply.
in a statement issued to the wall street journal, apple acknowledged that it receives requests for the removal of apps in various regions.
