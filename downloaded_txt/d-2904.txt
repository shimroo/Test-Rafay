a message
from one of our moms
‚Äúpostpartum support charleston has helped me to feel less alone. i just got paired with a wonderful mom mentor and i‚Äôve ‚Äòmet‚Äô a few new friends and i‚Äôm hopeful i‚Äôll meet more. i‚Äôm so grateful this is an available resource, i would not have had it available where we moved from. just knowing i‚Äôm not alone in my thoughts is great but having others to talk to is amazing. even just the posts on facebook of the little reminders that we matter are a big help. thank you so much.‚Äù
