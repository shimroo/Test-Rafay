our organization is a club for yachting enthusiasts. most of us own a defever, but others are welcome. we often cruise with fellow members and gather for fun on scenic beaches, or rendezvous  for seminars, open boats and spirited fellowship.
our vessels are sometimes called trawlers. traditional in their lines, they’re designed for efficient, extended travel, in comfort and safety, on the open sea or the inland waterways of the world.
our people – we love our boats and we love to cruise. we are mature but never old, adventurous but not foolhardy, self-sufficient but not reclusive, and prosperous but not rich in the common sense. we are "real people."
our passion for cruising - we would rather be anchored in a scenic cove than tied up in a marina. we would rather explore a deserted beach than swim in a country club pool. and we would rather share a libation on deck with fellow cruisers and enjoy a golden sunset than watch tv ashore.   more about us
