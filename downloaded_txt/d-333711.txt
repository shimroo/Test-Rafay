ilumine













ilumine is a collection of pendants, sconces, and chandeliers by vanessa deleon for kalco lighting. vanessa’s inspiration is rooted in her cultural composition.  her award-winning work combines modern, stylized designs with classic décor. inspired by her cuban roots, deleon’s innovative sensibility combined with a keen eye for detail resulted in her signature design style, “glamilistic”, where she combines streamlining with minimalism resulting in a rich, glamorous style.
