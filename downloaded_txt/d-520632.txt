when design meets development


combining the aspects of clean design and simple functionality, victor makes sites that are not only appealing to the eye but are streamlined for user experience. have a look below for specific projects in one of his three main skill sets.

at present

at present, i work at moxie developing front end sites and landing pages that utilize javascript frameworks to execute smooth designs that are easily approachable by other designers. by doing this i am making pages that are scalable, therefore adaptable to more content.









web development
design
audio





html5
jquery
css3
php
actionscript

my strengths lie within the range of most commonly used front-end development languages. meaning that my  sites tend to utilize languages such as html5, css3, and jquery.




logo design
cd covers
site design
business cards

my design work for web focuses on simplicity and effective layout, but my design ethics for each project is highly adaptable. i can design for sites the require a more corprate look, or even sites that are more flamboyant.




sound design
post-production audio
midi production
mastering

although my main line of work is front end development, i also produce music under the moniker lumera. i have variety of skills from the audio world that i put to use in my own music, which is a special blend of progressive house and trance.
