blue origin lays off 10% of its employees
posted: sun, feb 16 10:41 am et (1541 gmt)

blue origin is laying off 10% of its workforce, or more than 1,000 employees, to restructure the company and reduce bureaucracy. dave limp, blue origin's ceo, told employees thursday that the company is making the layoffs because recent growth resulted in "more bureaucracy and less focus than we needed." the cuts would include staff in engineering, r&d and management. a day earlier, limp said at the commercial space conference that since taking over as ceo in late 2023, he had seen progress in making the company more decisive, but suggested then there was more to do to improve operations and manufacturing.
