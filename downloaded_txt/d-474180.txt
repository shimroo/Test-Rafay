welcome to the attorney discipline board
the michigan attorney discipline board is the adjudicative arm of the michigan supreme court for discharge of its exclusive constitutional responsibility to supervise and discipline michigan attorneys.

the adb appoints hearing panels composed of three volunteer attorneys to conduct the trial-level proceedings under subchapter 9.100 of the michigan court rules, including cases in which the attorney grievance commission has filed a formal complaint alleging that a member of the state bar of michigan has committed professional misconduct or should be transferred to inactive status. the adb also hears petitions for review of decisions by a hearing panel and performs other duties. a decision of the adb may be appealed to the michigan supreme court. additional questions about the discipline system are answered in our faqs.
