april tour dates canceled
for the majority of my life i have been blessed enough to have a career doing the thing that i love the most. this privilege has never been lost on me. the fact that the music reaches other people and means so much to them is something that i never take for granted, and for which i am truly grateful, all of the time, every time we perform. at this moment in time though i need to step away from performing live in order to preserve my mental and spiritual well being, and instead focus on myself and loved ones. i know this will come as a disappointment and with great inconvenience to many people who bought tickets and made travel plans, and for this i sincerely apologize. i look forward to returning to the stage with the enthusiasm, joy, and renewed sense of inspiration that our fans deserve, and that i require of myself when we play live. thank you and god bless.-deanerween‚Äôs april tour dates have been canceled. ticket holders will automatically receive a refund from the original point of purchase. the previously announced august and september shows will proceed as scheduled.¬†
