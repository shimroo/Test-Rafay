    in the beginning
 the idea of exhaust systems intrigued jere stahl as early as 1955 when he built his first "hot rod." this led to jere creating stahl headers, known as stahl engineering in 1963.for the next 50 years jere stahl became a driving force in the development, enhancement, and innovative approach to products for the racing industry. his influence reached far beyond exhaust headers to cam shafts, chassisdevelopment and a generous willingness to share his experience and knowledge with those who showed a desire to learn and were willing to show due diligence in wanting to expand their knowledge base.
jere had a private phone number that would only be answered when he was at the shop, that number was in the phone books of a great many of the who's who in the racing world. they have all learned to respect jere's straight forward no nonsense approach to problem solving and all who listened benefited.


 



    fast forward 50 years
 in 2012 jere told me that he was considering closing the business and selling the assets. i was sad to hear this but i certainly understood...50 years is a long time!i told him that i would be interested in purchasing the fixtures for the c2 and c3 corvette side exhaust headers. i have a strong interest in historic corvettes that run in the svra and hsr series. i know any corvette that ran well back in the day seemed to be running stahl headers.well, as they say, that's how it all started! the way it ended is that advanced composite products inc. (acp) purchased the corvette fixtures, along with many of the original stahl header jigs and fixtures. acp also purchased all the specialty manufacturing equipment used by stahl headers, hired their lead fabricator, greg stump, and acp headers is up and running. we are building original design stahl headers using the original stahl fixtures.acp headers is ready to take your order for headers, flanges and other accessories. acp is honored to continue the tradition of excellence and quality in building stahl headers, whose dedication to quality has resulted in a product that became the standard by which others are judged.we invite you to grow with us and stay up to date on new products that will be offered by acp headers.kerry hitt

  the #1 choice for vintage
drag race headers
 drag racing was the core of stahl headers and remains so with acp headers. no other form of motorsports is more nostalgic than drag racing. we build our classic muscle car and drag race headers using the same jigs, production methods and passion that have been a staple of stahl headers since the beginning. if you need a set of period correct headers for your chevy ii, tri-5, camaro or 409 give us a call.


  
  classic road racing headers
 stahl headers have been in the winner's circle with some of the biggest names in road racing. from countless big block and small block corvettes to the penske traco camaros driven by mark donohue, our headers have a history of winning on the road circuits. v8, 6-cylinder or 4-cylinder we are the top choice to build period correct exhaust for your classic road race car.


      available in various forms for 

             every pocketbook
 for those seeking to go racing right out of the box, we offer fully assembled headers that are ready to bolt on. we also have partially assembled headers that require you to finish the welding at the flange and collector. our header kits come with pre-bent tubes, flanges and your choice of welded or slip-on collectors. for unique applications where there is no pre-bent kit available, we also offer a complete selection of header parts.
 



   



    our employees
 the core of the acp headers staff is made up of employees who came directly from stahl headers. this gives us 30+ years of experience in the header business. from custom work to production work, you can count on our experienced staff to provide a level of expertise that cannot be found elsewhere.



   

             our headers

stahl headers are legendary for their performance and durability. we carry on that tradition at acp headers. every header is hand made for your application from american-made materials. we follow the same production methods pioneered by jere stahl. in fact, the only difference you will find between an acp header vs. a stahl header from 20 years ago will be the name tag.
