america greatest family resort


in 1700, whaler john peck began using the barrier island as a place where he and his men could put their freshly caught whales while they went out searching for more. the island eventually became known as peck's beach. after peck's inhabitation, the island had a few purposes: it was an indian summer fishing camp, a place for cattle to graze and sometimes mainlanders would boat over for a picnic or to hunt. the somers family originally owned the land and several other families lived there including parker miller. in the mid 19th century, it was parker miller and his family that became the first year-round residents of the island. the millers lived at what is now the corner of seventh street and asbury avenue. parker worked as an agent for marine insurance companies, raised cattle and farmed the land that was known as peck's beach. it was almost 30 years later when the ocean city we know today was born.
