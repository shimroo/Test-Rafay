welcome to my world 
  
hi! my name
is teresa.  i love to sew, quilt, crochet, knit,  
cross stitch.  i love all needlecrafts.  my main objective for 
       
this website is to help beginners by giving them 
  step-by-step directions
for a needlecraft that will give them 
many enjoyable hours.

i was born and raised
in smith county, tennessee and will probably live 
here until the day i die.  i was
the firstborn child to naomi and willard.  i have one

sister, nancy, and one brother, edward. 
for the first sixteen years of my life, i 
lived in
ashhopper hollow which
was just around devil's elbow, about 2 miles 
from defeated.  and just down the
road is difficult.  now how's that for names of 
rural communities?
 




do
        you know what an "ashhopper" is?

i am 
a firm believer that everyone needs a hobby.  i hope the information on my 
website helps you in the search for one.  first,
let me tell you -- i'm not an expert but i have tried my hand at
all of these needlecrafts down through the years. the websites i have
linked to are sites that i have searched and found to be, in my
opinion, the most informative and would be most beneficial to a
beginner. just pick a topic from the table above and enjoy your stay! 

please take 
time to sign my guestbook.  i love to hear from people that have visited my 
website and found something of interest.
