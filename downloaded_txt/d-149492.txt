what we offer




welcome to stag leap cabins, a private retreat with a bed-and-breakfast flair in the heart of east texas. stag leap is on a 200+-acre woodland with secluded cabins scattered along the sandy-bottom bonaldo creek. we are the perfect getaway for a romantic weekend, family reunions, small group retreats, or extended stays. our relaxing, cozy, home-like setting doesn’t compare to what you’ll find in a hotel!
stag leap cabins is close to numerous popular activities and attractions. we are ten minutes from historic downtown nacogdoches with its brick streets, quaint antique shops, and numerous museums and historical landmarks. a short drive from our property is stephen f. austin university, home of the lumberjacks and its state-recognized azalea gardens, the largest in texas. nacogdoches is also a prime destination for pickleball and disc golf enthusiasts, and fishermen love that we are just four miles from lake nacogdoches, which provides boating, swimming, fishing, and disc golf opportunities. as part of the texas parks and wildlife pineywood trail, we also offer excellent opportunities for bird watching and other wildlife without ever leaving our property, so bring your binoculars!




we offer seven uniquely decorated cabins that are private and secluded from each other. our cabins offer various sleeping accommodations and have fully stocked kitchens, free wifi, satellite television, charcoal grills, and air conditioning. most have whirlpool jacuzzi tubs (inside or outside) and electric log fireplaces for a romantic ambience. all linens (sheets, towels, washcloths, dish towels) are provided.
a large, centrally located hot tub is available for all guests but may be reserved for private use an hour at a time. we also offer other amenities and activities such as golf cart rentals, disc golf, basketball, horseshoes, and hiking.
our cabins are perfect for long-term stays for individuals and families. after a long day of work, a short drive to the countryside helps you unwind, and then you are beckoned into your comfortable, relaxing cabin that provides the rest you deserve.
cash discounts and extended stay rates are available.
