opportunity 



donate
whether it’s making a monitory donation, donating the use of an event or meeting space or resources, or purchasing an item from our wish list, there are numerous ways to donate that will make a direct impact on early childhood education in our community.






volunteer
becoming a volunteer allows you or your organization to make a hands-on impact on the lives of children and families in our community. whether you volunteer your time, special resources, or share a unique skill you may have, there are always events, programs, and initiatives in need of a helping hand.






advocate
every child deserves a champion. word of mouth is one of the best ways to advocate for the success of our community’s children. whether it’s sharing our graphics on social media or inviting us to speak at a meeting or event you are a part of, helping us spread the message of early childhood education is one of the most vital parts of our mission.






sponsor
serving as a sponsor of one of our programs, events, or initiatives allows an organization or business to create a personal relationship with the specific goals and outcomes of the partnership. whether your interest is early literacy, community engagement, health and wellness, or professional development, we have opportunities for you to become more deeply involved in the success of specific initiatives.
