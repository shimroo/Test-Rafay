the complete list of muscle cars






what is a muscle car?
there are many different definitions of what qualifies as a muscle car. the broadest definition is any car with a large and powerful engine and a beefed up suspension. upgraded interiors, fancy paint schemes and nicer wheels and tires are also usually part of the package. using this definition, huge cars like the 1970 impala and even compacts like the 1964 chevy nova made the list. there is even room for pony cars like the camaro and mustang. the mighty corvette qualifies as well.
purists narrow that definition considerable and only include midsized cars as muscle cars. these cars include the chevrolet chevelle, the dodge charger, plymouth road runner and the classic pontiac gto. other performance oriented car categories include: pony cars and american sports cars. pony cars include the ford mustang, chevrolet camaro and dodge challenger. american sports cars include the chevrolet corvette and the dodge viper.
below is a list of the american performance cars broken down by category and years manufactured. note that we used the “muscle cars” label for both the full sized, compact and, of course, midsized cars. for this list we have expanded the strictest definition a little. we have also included a list of pony cars and sport cars. taken together, this lists represents the best performance oriented cars ever produce by american manufactures.
