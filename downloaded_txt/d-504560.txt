a very weak attempt to link sandy hook to satanism





as discussed in my last post, many conspiracy theorists are trying to link the aurora and newtown massacres to satanism. the video below is one of the silliest examples of this effort. it attempts to connect the dots among a perfume commercial starring lady gaga (a favourite target of vigilant citizen, and others who search for illuminati/occult symbolism in movies, music videos, and tv commercials), the latest batman movie, aurora, and newtown. 
the major flaw with this approach is that any number of interpretations can be made of lady gaga's videos. they are artistic, dark, and more than a little twisted. beneath the video, i've added my own interpretations of some of the imagery in the perfume commercial to show you just how easy it is to bring your own experiences and perceptions to the table.



the "matrix-style surgical probe": this is actually just a light mounted on a flexible, snake-like tube. it does not enter the statue. the black bodysuit: i doubt this is a nod to catwoman. gaga likes bodysuits, as evidenced by the white where the wild things are-inspired latex bodysuit she wore at the beginning of the "bad romance" video. 
the "trooper hat": an old-fashioned ladies' picture hat, updated 
the mirror: clearly a reference to cocteau's  orphée, in which orpheus is transported to the underworld by stepping into a mirror with a liquid surface. we know that gaga admires french culture; she speaks french at the beginning of the video for "papparazzi". we know she likes classic film, because she references hitchcock four times in a single verse of "bad romance". and i'm not the only one who sees a correspondence between cocteau and gaga - check out this fan video of her song "bad romance", set to scenes from cocteau's beauty and the beast. we are not dealing with satanism here. the black mirror is a straight-up homage to french arthouse cinema. 
[i wrote the passage above before re-watching the mirror scene in  orphée. when i reviewed it, i realized gaga was definitely, absolutely, beyond any question in the world, re-enacting it. watch it yourself, and note how orpheus and gaga extend their arms and place their hands in the same position as they cautiously approach the mirror. note, also, that gaga hesitates before the black mirror, while orpheus allows himself to be coaxed into his mirror by an underworld minion. give her credit for that, at least! 
fun fact: while gaga's mirror is cgi, cocteau filmed someone submerging their gloved hands into a pool of mercury to create the shimmery ripple effect.]
"portrait: death of children (ovum and sperm)": i don't see ovum or sperm in this image, so abortion doesn't come to mind at all. the gold jewelry gaga wears reminds me of slime mold. 
"look how they prequel shooting children!": but there are no children in this scene. there is a cgi rendering of a metallic gaga aiming a gun at a flesh-and-blood gaga. i don't think the metallic gaga represents a child.
the backmasking of lt. paul vance: i closed my eyes for this portion of the video, and typed my own interpretation of the backwards words. someone says, "let us now...worst-dressed. now. worst." then vance says, "excellent. herb get it done initiate get some i said go. said the wood a sauce throat dead sarah the one with oss nitiate.get some mean you left paw. nnnnasty deep blue knew it he blew it no [or know] me luck. still when this window go in and out ffth with a maze gazoo [or kazoo] with your breath. with your breath a syndrome go pull out the waw never been there rash knees bucksters soreth give [gibberish that sounds like "mickulick"]. judith or a nay she not pay up. 
so from this we can determine that paul vance is owed money by a woman named judith, has an accomplice named herb, and may or may not like the flintstones. 

as for production designer nathan crowley being related to the infamous occultist, aleister crowley was, as nathan told the art newspaper in 2008, his grandfather’s cousin, but nathan was "never allowed to even mention his name because we were a very quaker family.”

weak attempts to link the connecticut shootings to devil worship





tabloids, christian websites, and youtube auteurs are attempting to link newtown, connecticut, killer adam lanza to satanism - on the softest evidence you can possibly imagine. 

a daily mail article quotes trevor l. todd, a "former classmate" of lanza, as saying that adam once had a "satan worshiping" web page with a banner that featured the word devil in a red, "gothic-style" font. this vaguely-remembered website supposedly created by a middle school student is the only evidence presented to suggest that lanza was a satanist. to date, the web page's existence hasn't even been confirmed. 
the
 article goes on to claim that fbi investigators "strongly believe he made use of devil-worshiping and suicide sites and 
boasted of his murder plans on message forums". no source is given for this information. 


world net daily doesn't have any more solid information than the daily mail, but the writer of this article attempts to give the story some teeth by throwing in references to other murders committed by "satanists". aaron klein even speculates about a possible satanic conspiracy: 
"was lanza part of a larger satanic or ritualistic subculture locally or 
online in which he could have revealed his plans or could have even 
received support in preparing for the killings?"


then he takes other media outlets to task for failing to report on the satanic angle of the aurora, colorado shootings. "although largely underreported, satanic subculture and so-called devil 
worship has been a factor in numerous other mass killings, including the
 recent batman shooting massacre." at this point, klein is forced to  concede that james holmes wasn't actually a satanist; he just liked the joker as played by heath ledger a lot, and the joker had satanic attributes. you know, like every supervillain in every comic book ever. 





klein goes on to educate wnd readers about other infamous "satanic" murders, starting with the manson family killings:
"according to reports, tate was originally selected to play the main 
character in her husband’s rosemary’s baby, a film about a pregnant 
woman who fears that her husband may have made a pact with neighbors to 
use her child as a human sacrifice in their occult rituals. actress mia 
farrow ultimately got the role, while tate did make a brief appearance 
in the film."
this is wrong on just about every level. sharon tate was never considered for the role of rosemary in her husband's film. the film itself has absolutely nothing to do with the murders; the tate/polanski residence was targeted by manson and his followers because polanski and tate were subletting the house from music producer terry melcher, a man manson deeply resented for failing to turn him into a recording superstar. 



richard ramirez is the next "satanic" killer on the list, and he's the only one who really qualifies for inclusion. ramirez did identify himself as a satanist. but sean sellers, the teenager who converted to christianity in jail after murdering his parents? he may have promoted himself as a "reformed satanist" who killed only because he was under the devil's influence, but an examination of his criminal appeals tells a different story. sellers was so desperate to escape the death penalty for crimes he admittedly committed that he pled diminished capacity due to demonic possession, and later claimed to have multiple personality disorder. sellers was a shrewdly manipulative man who knew exactly what he was doing at all times. 

the last case klein cites is the murder of steven newberry by a trio of teens, led by a charismatic thug named jim hardy. the killers practiced some rudimentary form of "satanism" that mostly revolved around torturing and killing cats. the murder of their "friend" newberry was a thrill killing that would have been committed with or without their childish attempts at devil worship. klein's efforts to lay the blame for adam lanza's crimes on satanism are baseless. to call lanza's evil deeds "satanic" because he allegedly expressed interest in the devil in his teens is just as absurd as labelling a murder "christian" because the killer was once an altar boy.  



some christians don't want to stop at blaming satanism for the massacre, though. they also want to blame the victims' parents and even god himself, arguing that mass murder of 6-year-olds is god's just punishment for "kicking god out of schools". in the video below, christian rapper tireo tells us that god granted satan permission to "demonize" adam lanza so that he would murder children, but the media won't disclose this because adam was white. also, the victims were handpicked (by god?) because their parents "had sin in their lives."

"call me maybe" announces the arrival of the antichrist





remember william tapley, the dude who calls himself the co-prophet of the endtimes and the third eagle of the apocalypse? his videos about the "satanic" mural at denver international airport went viral last year, strictly because it's hilarious to watch a poker-faced man condemning imaginary penguin erections.

in his latest video, tapley explains how a crappy music video for some teenie-pop hit is actually about the arrival of the antichrist, and analyzes the new world order/antichrist numerology cleverly hidden in the video for "gangnam style", which is basically just a song about south korean hipsters and their sexy ladies.

best youtube comment: "thank you so much for counting the number of horses by pointing to each 
one with a pencil and saying the﻿ numbers out loud. that was very 
helpful."
tapley's reply: "yes, it's amazing what god requires prophets﻿ to do. i'm really lucky! 
in the old testament, one prophet had to eat manure and another was 
required to marry a prostitute!"

blaming satan






tim wildmon, president of the american family association, has stated that satan was behind last week's murders in newtown, connecticut.  

tragic events like the mass murder of schoolchildren certainly have an evil aura, and it isn't out of line to label the killer's actions as evil, in my opinion. but to attribute the killer's actions directly to satan, as wildmon has done, is problematic. first of all, it's entirely possible that adam lanza had an emotional or mental disorder that interfered with his ability to feel empathy for others, manage his emotions, or control his impulses. the notion that mental illness is caused by demonic infestation or satanic influence, promoted by alex jones and others, is positively medieval and has no place in an informed, educated society like our own. it will not benefit the mentally ill, their caregivers, mental health professionals, or family members to fob the blame off on the devil. if lanza was not mentally ill, then he was fully responsible for his crimes, and no one else (including satan) deserves even a shred of the blame for what he chose to do.

in the news






people often ask me, "but haven't you ever come across a real case of ritual abuse?". the answer is yes, i have. and i can tell you this: almost without exception, that ritual abuse has involved small christian cults, rather than international satanic ones. for example, the hosanna church cult in ponchatoula, louisiana, was originally branded a satanic cult that ritually abused children, but victims who testified at the trial of pastor louis lamonica jr. mentioned only ritual abuse committed in a christian context.
now we have even graver allegations being made against a young bible study leader in kansas city, missouri. micah moore, 22, has been charged with the murder of nurse bethany deaton, 27, and claims that he was persuaded to kill her by bethany's own husband, tyler deaton. tyler is an "ex-gay" who has headed a small, tight-knit christian group for the past several years. some members are so devoted to tyler that they followed him from southwestern university in georgetown, texas, to his current home in kansas city. tyler and bethany had been married for just three months when she died.
bethany's death on october 30 initially appeared to be a suicide (her body was found in a van parked near longview lake, a plastic bag over her head). no one suspected otherwise until moore turned himself in earlier this month. he told police that tyler has been engaging in "spiritual sex" with several of the young men who share his house, and that he routinely drugged bethany so that his followers could rape her. moore even claimed to possess video footage of these sexual assaults. fearful that bethany would tell her therapist about what was going on, tyler approached micah with the idea of murdering her and disguising her death as a suicide.
at this early stage, it's possible that moore's story will turn out to be false. maybe he killed his leader's wife on his own and pinned the blame on tyler. however, at least three of the deatons' four roommates have confirmed that tyler was having sex with them and that he termed these relations "spiritual". the fourth roommate feels he was being groomed to become one of tyler's sexual partners.
in texas, tyler felt that the official student clubs at southwestern university weren't hardcore enough for him, so he formed his own independent group. members would spend hours of every day in the campus chapel, praying and singing under tyler's direction. they also engaged in "holy laughter", and attempted faith healing of severely disabled people on at least two occasions. tyler preached to his group about the evils of homosexuality, claiming he "overcame" his own gay orientation through the power of christ.
by the end of the 2008-2009 school year, southwestern administrators were so troubled by the group's activities that they denied deaton further use of the chapel. that's when tyler, bethany, and several young men decided to relocate to a more sympathetic school, the international house of prayer university in kansas city.
in missouri, bethany and tyler attended forerunner christian fellowship church. they married in august of this year.
if the allegations made by micah moore are true, then a murderous christian sex cult has been active on the campus of a christian university for the past three years, engaging in ritualistic sex and rape under the direction of a charismatic but deranged leader. will we call this group's practices "christian ritual abuse"? or will we continue to insist that abusive sexual practices are the exclusive domain of satanists, when all evidence indicates that satanic crime is, in fact, far less common than christian crime? when you think about it, this makes sense. there are far fewer satanists in america than christians, so the rate of crimes committed by christians should be much higher than the rate of crimes committed by satanists. this includes sexual abuse and murder.



another forerunner was in the news this week, when 19-year-old two and a half men star angus t. jones declared in a video produced by the forerunner chronicles that he feels terrible about being on a show that is "filth" and might even be contributing to satan's plan to subvert humanity. he urged americans to avoid television altogether, in fact. he has since qualified his remarks, stating that he has a lot of respect for everyone who works on the show; he considers them members of his family. he has not attempted to explain how a program produced by such good people can be a tool of the devil.
the man who appears beside jones in the video is christopher "forerunner" hudson, a youtuber who believes that jay-z is a satan-worshiping freemason. hudson also buys into and promotes a broad range of conspiracy nonsense: the death of osama bin laden was faked, michael jackson's death was engineered to distract the world from the pope's plea for a new world order, etc.  



charisma magazine is the most popular christian magazine in the world. despite its conservative slant, the articles featured in it are usually timely and concisely written, with little of the bombast you'll see on tv programs like the 700 club or jack van impe presents. what, then, shall we make of a recent article titled "can you be raped by the devil?", which claims that the medieval notion of succubi and incubi invading our bedrooms at night is valid, and that the content of our dreams can be influenced by these demons? the article, which relies heavily on the anecdotal accounts of one former stripper, even suggests that sexual orientation can be altered by sexual demons. does ancient superstition such as this really belong in the world's foremost christian publication, read by millions? what is this teaching the younger readers of the magazine - that every wet dream they experience in adolescence is actually a visitation from a demon bent on making them gay?

pat robertson and the "demonic"





media matters has a story on pat robertson's growing catalogue of things that are "demonic", which includes (but is certainly not limited to): alien abductions, anything having to do with eastern religions or cultures, homosexuality, and the twilight franchise. i can't really disagree with him on that last one.robertson's christian broadcasting network is still the number one christian network in the world, and its flagship program, the 700 club, is watched by about a million people every day.

the west memphis three are out!





this is a beautiful day: the day that i remove the "free the west memphis three" posters from my blogs. after spending the entirety of their young adulthoods in prison, jessie misskelley, jason baldwin, and damien echols have been freed after a plea deal. sadly, the deal prevents them from suing for wrongful prosecution or anything else related to their false convictions, and it is incredibly unlikely that west memphis investigators will ever admit their mistakes and search for the real killer or killers.not just three, but six boys' worlds were destroyed by the murders of stevie branch, michael moore, and christopher byers. now that the west memphis three have some justice, let's see some justice for the three boys who lost their lives. enough time has been wasted. i'm dismayed by some of the media coverage of this. for instance, abc news posted a video with the sub-headline "three men convicted of killing three boys in a satanic cult ritual are set free." really? the prosecution couldn't present any evidence of a satanic ritual, because there wasn't any. at all.
