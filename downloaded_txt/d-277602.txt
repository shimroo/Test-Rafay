the military and hospitaller order of saint lazarus of jerusalem












thank you for visiting this website.
the order of st lazarus is an ancient order of chivalry which has adapted to remain relevant to 21st century concerns and needs, using relevant social media platforms. 
established during the second crusade, we have cared for those suffering from hansen’s disease (leprosy) throughout our history, and still do. now, we also help them to become active contributors to their local economies.
additionally, we care for those who are on the margins of society, social outcasts, the homeless and those in poverty.
i hope that you will find this website informative and useful.  if you have any questions, please contact us at info.iprcc [at] st-lazarus.net.
