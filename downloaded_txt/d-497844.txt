featured wines



fiano di avellino, donna paolina, campania, italy, 2022


					few areas in italy have a more ancient wine tradition than the zone around naples, the region of campania. this southern region can be quite cool in the mountainous, inland areas, producing crisp, white wines with enticing minerality and depth. the donna paolina winery was born in 2011 of a collaboration of 3 stars of campania. the alois family was looking to expand their operations in the region seeking out the most iconic white grape of campania, found in the hills surrounding avellino. the fiano grape, on these soils of  volcanic origin, gains finesse with complexity. the paolina bottling, shows aromas of ripe fruit, hazelnuts, flowers and honey. on the palate, it is round and fleshy with good acidity and structure, delivering tropical fruit notes. a terrific match with our seafood dishes.

						quarto $22


						bottle $56




langhe nebbiolo, la spinetta, piedmont italy, 2023


					as the fall season approaches, we start thinking of the prized truffle harvest in piedmont, and the nebbiolo grape that is historically favored to compliment this delicacy. used in baralos and barbarescos, the nebbiolo can express itself in a complex array of flavors.
the la spinetta bottling benefits from winemaker, giorgio rivette, who displays a masterful touch making exciting, ripe, fruit forward
wines. the 2022 vintage is sourced from his three barbaresco vineyards, predominantly from the starderi vineyard, whose grapes express a richer character, while maintaining great elegance. the featured wine is a vibrant red showing ripe, red currant, and pomegranate notes. the wine finishes with soft, dusty tannins, framed in coffee and spice. the la spinetta is a wonderful pairing with the truffles, and it’s also is a terrific match with our meat based dishes and tomato based pastas.

larry mindel
proprietor



after 30 years of building successful restaurants, larry mindel has cut quite a wide swath in the culinary landscape. with poggio, he makes his definitive mark. it’s been a long and adventurous trip to complete his vision of what a great restaurant can be with poggio, one that began with personal epiphany years ago during his first trip to italy and that has since included uncountable trips between california and ‘the boot.’ but for italophiles everywhere, it was a journey well worth the effort. larry opens a restaurant that reflects not just where he’s been, but who he is. poggio is the natural extension of a career marked with numerous accolades and wonderful restaurants.“i’m not trying to build a new empire here,” says larry. “this is just all of my experience wrapped into four walls. my hope is that it will be a place my friends and family feel comfortable in.”millions of people across the country have enjoyed visiting larry’s restaurants, though many are likely to recognize the establishments before they recognize the man. combining a passion for italy and keen restaurant savvy, larry has created such trend-setting restaurants as ciao in san francisco, which was the first restaurant in the u.s. to feature exhibition pasta making in view of the dining room, highlighted with all-white décor and floors made of white pirelli rubber. two years later, larry opened prego in san francisco, bringing one of the first restaurant exhibition pizza ovens to the united states and launching this nation-wide trend. he also reinvented il fornaio, changing it from a charming collection of italian bakeries into an empire of restaurants and bakeries in five states generating more than $150 million in annual revenue.after graduating with a bachelor’s degree from the university of michigan, larry’s career took root in san francisco when he became ceo of the caswell coffee company. under his direction, the company doubled revenues for four consecutive years. from there larry founded spectrum foods, where as chairman and ceo he began changing the california restaurant scene with the likes of guaymas in tiburon, california and macarthur park in san francisco and palo alto. when spectrum merged with saga corporation, larry was named the president of the company’s restaurant group, in charge of more than 200 restaurants generating a combined $375 million in annual revenue.in 1987, larry became chairman and ceo of il fornaio. within ten months he opened the first il fornaio cucina italiana e panetteria just outside of san francisco in corte madera, california, a concept that quickly caught on and has grown to include restaurants, bakeries, and retail outlets throughout the western us.larry has been widely recognized for his achievements within the hospitality industry. these awards include the 1998 international foodservice manufacturers association “gold plate” award – considered by many to be the industry’s ultimate honour — and induction into the california restaurant association’s hall of fame, also in 1998. perhaps the honour closest to his heart, however, is the caterina de medici medal, awarded to him in 1985, when larry became the first american and first person of non-italian descent to receive this medal from the italian government, recognizing excellence in the preservation of italian heritage outside of italy.with more than 30 italian restaurants under his belt, larry is zeroing in on a definitive spirit with poggio. “i feel i have gotten as close as i can to the very heart of what italian cooking and hospitality are about,” he says. “and this is one person’s dream of doing a restaurant as well as it can be done.”in 2016, larry created convivo restaurant and bar in the santa barbara inn. the novel "nomad italian" restaurant was featured in the new york times' 52 places to visit in 2019. in addition to serving breakfast, lunch and dinner 7 days a week, convivo also provides catering and room service for the aaa four diamond hotel. those at the four diamond level, just 6.3 percent of aaa inspected & approved hotels, must be "refined and stylish with upscale physical attributes, extensive amenities and a high degree of hospitality, service and attention to detail," a description as good as any for all the restaurants larry has brought to life over the span of amazingly successful career. in his spare time, larry serves on the board of the cheesecake factory, inc., enjoys fishing and spending time with his family.

benjamin balesteri
executive chef / partner



benjamin balesteri was born in monterey and raised in the salinas valley. the swiss farming family on his mother’s side gave him an appreciation of growing seasonal vegetables, artisanal cheese, and seasonally butchered meats. the sicilian fishermen on his father’s side taught him how to fish in the monterey bay and the best ways to prepare freshly caught fish and seafood and bring out their unique qualities.balesteri showed a natural aptitude for the culinary arts. he began working in restaurants at an early age, and eventually enrolled in culinary school at the california culinary academy in san francisco. through visiting chefs, he was given an opportunity at tra vigne to travel to italy. his time in italy was both familiar and inspiring to him and it was during this period of his life that he learned firsthand his own italian culture as well as the language. “just like the people in italy, i’m guided by what’s available in the wild and in the garden,” balesteri explains. “in italy, they don’t manipulate food, but rather, bring out what’s best about it. i do this at poggio, as well.”upon his return from italy, he joined poggio as a sous chef, and in 2010, he couldn’t resist the challenges of new york city and became the opening sous chef at lincoln, working under acclaimed chef jonathan benno.in early 2012, the lure of fishing, surfing, and the country’s best fruits and vegetables brought balesteri back to california, where he was welcomed home to poggio. in early 2013, balesteri was promoted to executive chef at poggio where he is leading the kitchen and continuing the exciting house-cured charcuterie, fresh pasta and culinary program the restaurant has become known for. “growing up, great food was important to my family, but it was really about people coming together,” balesteri said. “this is the tradition of poggio that i intend to carry on.”
