                90 years of winter tires
            "for 90 years, our winter tires have been synonymous with safety in winter weather conditions. softer rubber compounds improve adhesion, while sipes provide grip on snow and ice. and wider grooves displace water particularly effectively," explains martin welzhofer, head of global tire testing at continental tires. "we put our winter tires through their paces during testing on snow and ice, in germany and sweden."please find here the complete press release “ninety years of winter tire development at continental”

								continental further increases earnings
							
					
											november 11, 2024
										
									
									continental increased its earnings in the third quarter of 2024, as expected. in particular, the automotive group sector made progress thanks to the measures taken to improve earnings, and it aims to make further gains in adjusted ebit in the fourth quarter. as in the second quarter of 2024, the tires group sector posted a good adjusted ebit on the back of improved business in europe, boosted not least by encouraging early sales of winter tires. earnings in contitech, by contrast, were dented by continued weak industrial development in europe and north america. continental does not expect the industrial business to recover in the fourth quarter and is therefore adjusting its sales and earnings outlook for contitech. as a result, sales expectations have also been lowered for the continental group as a whole.
