friendly, first class, affordable.
honeybrook is a semi-private golf club nestled among the amish farms of chester county, pennsylvania. open to the public every day, honeybrook offers 18 challenging yet playable holes that are fun for all skill levels. it's a mixture of wide-open links, tree-lined fairways and subtle elevation changes that combine natural beauty and great golf.
protected wetlands weave throughout to form breathtaking vistas and memorable target greens. once you cross the brandywine creek to amish corner, you'll escape from the outside world and hear nothing but the clip-clop of horse-drawn buggies and the chirping of the birds
the atmosphere is friendly and laid back - both on the course and at the greenside grill. stop by anytime to relax and enjoy a cool drink or a hot meal. you'll see why honeybrook breeds the loyal following of golfers who call it their home.
