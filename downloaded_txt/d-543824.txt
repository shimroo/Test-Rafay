the declaration of independence








drafted
by thomas jefferson between june 11 and june 28, 1776, the
declaration of independence is immediately the country's most
appreciated image of freedom and jefferson's most persisting
landmark. here, in lifted up and exceptional expressions, jefferson
communicated the feelings in the personalities and hearts of the
american individuals. 






the political rationality of the declaration
was not new; its beliefs of individual freedom had as of now been
communicated by john locke and the continental thinkers. what
jefferson did was to condense this logic in "undeniable truths"
and put forward an arrangement of grievances against the king with a
specific end goal to legitimize before the world the breaking of ties
between the states and the motherland. we welcome you to peruse an
interpretation of the complete content of the declaration.

the conservative party












the conservative
party, formally the conservative and unionist party and particularly referred
to as the tory party or the tories, is a centre-right political party in the
united kingdom and adopts the philosophies of conservatism and british
unionism. since 2013, it is the major political party in the united kingdom,
being the chief single party in the house of commons with 303 mps, the biggest
party in local government with 8,628 councilors, and the largest british party
in the european parliament with 25 meps. it regulates in coalition with the liberal
democrats, with david cameron, the leader of the conservative party, as prime
minister.



the
modern conservative party of the united kingdom, also known as the unionist
party in the early 20th century, sketches its origins back to the
"tory" supporters of james stuart, duke of york, later king james vii
& ii, during the 1678-1681 exclusion crisis. the name was at first meant as
a pejorative—a 'tory' was a type of irish bandit.



the
name 'conservative' was suggested by john wilson croker in the 1830s and later
officially taken on, but the party is still often referred to as the 'tory party’.

conservative party 










the conservative party, officially the conservative and
unionist party, is a centre-right political party in the united kingdom that
espouses the philosophies of conservatism and british unionism. as of 2012 it
is the most powerful party in the united kingdom, being the largest single
party in the house of commons with 303 mps, the largest party in local
government with 9,391 councillors, and the largest british party in the
european parliament with 25 meps. it governs in coalition with the liberal
democrats, with party leader david cameron as prime minister.



colloquially referred to as the tory party or the tories, the
conservative party was founded in 1834. the party was one of two dominant
parties in the 19th century, along with the liberal party. it changed its name
to the conservative and unionist party in 1912 after merging with the liberal
unionist party, although that name is rarely used and it is generally referred
to as simply the conservative party.



in the 1920s, the liberal vote greatly diminished and the
labour party became the conservatives' main rivals. conservative prime
ministers led governments for 57 years of the 20th century, including winston
churchill (1940–45, 1951–55) and margaret thatcher (1979–90). thatcher's tenure
led to wide-ranging economic liberalisation and saw the conservatives become
the most eurosceptic of the three major parties. the party was returned to
government in coalition, having failed to win a majority, in 2010 under the
more liberal leadership of david cameron.



in the european parliament, the conservatives are the largest
british party with 25 meps, who sit with the soft eurosceptic european
conservatives and reformists (ecr) parliamentary group, while the party itself
is a member of the alliance of european conservatives and reformists (aecr)
europarty. they are the third-largest party in the scottish parliament and
second-largest in the welsh assembly. they were formally allied to the ulster
unionist party (uup) as part of the ulster conservatives and unionists arrangement,
with the uup currently participating in the five-party northern ireland
executive.

cajun





cajuns are an ethnic group mainly living in the u.s. state of louisiana, consisting of the descendants of acadian exiles (french-speakers from acadia in what are now the canadian maritimes). today, the cajuns make up a significant portion of south louisiana's population, and have exerted an enormous impact on the state's culture.

while lower louisiana had been settled by french colonists since the late 18th century, the cajuns trace their roots to the influx of acadian settlers after the great expulsion from their homeland during the french and indian war (1754 to 1763). the acadia region to which modern cajuns trace their origin consisted largely of what are now nova scotia and the other maritime provinces, plus parts of eastern quebec and northern maine. since their establishment in louisiana the cajuns have developed their own dialect, cajun french, and developed a vibrant culture including folkways, music, and cuisine.
