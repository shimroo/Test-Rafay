about us








at nyu langone’s department of cell biology our goal is to advance knowledge and understanding of fundamental biological processes, from the level of the genome to that of cells, tissues, and organisms. we employ cutting-edge technologies to investigate cell structure and function, intercellular communication, signal transduction, cell migration, signaling between organs, and the response of cells to the environment. our faculty work with an array of model systems to best address scientific questions in stem cell biology, developmental biology, neurobiology, immunology, genetics, epigenetics, and cancer.
we are committed to excellence and innovation in an environment that values curiosity, creativity, and collaboration. our interdisciplinary research brings together basic scientists and clinical faculty to make discoveries that not only expand our knowledge of biology but contribute to ameliorating human disease.
contact us
our laboratories and offices are located in multiple nyu langone research facilities, which include the medical science building and the joan and joel smilow research center, both located at 540 first avenue, the science building at 435 east 30th street, and the alexandria center for life sciences at 430 east 29th street.
