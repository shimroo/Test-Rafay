residential living




university life at its fullest


 

while college is first an academic experience, it’s also a social experience since
                           you’re making a new home and meeting new people—and western carolina university's
                           residential communities are a great place to start.
we provide clean, safe, and healthy living environments that enhance and support the
                           educational mission, goals, and creed of the wcu.
we strive to create living and learning communities where students feel valued as
                           individuals and where diversity and fellowship with others can be celebrated. while
                           maintaining a high level of quality service, we also encourage and provide opportunities
                           for personal growth and development of character, leadership, honesty, respect, and
                           pride.
campus life is greatly enhanced by the comforts, conveniences, and experiences that
                           living in a residence hall provides. studies of college and university students across
                           the country have shown that students who live on campus have higher graduation rates,
                           higher gpas, and report a greater satisfaction with their collegiate experience.
