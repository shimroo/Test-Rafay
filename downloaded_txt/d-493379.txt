preserve, protect, and promote

waterfowl, waterfowl habitat, and waterfowl hunting
 

we teach folks about waterfowl, waterfowl conservation, sportsmanship, shooting, hunter safety, and waterfowling. we also study, advise, recommend, and secure enactment of legislation in the interest of waterfowl, their habitat, and waterfowl hunting.

habitat

improve waterfowl habitat through various activities such as providing nesting, planting forage, cleaning garbage, and more.  the wwa partners with the wdfw and with other conservation organizations to identify the needs of the birds and where our public waterfowl habitat can be best improved.

access

volunteer our time and money to improve public access on public lands.  building blinds, cleared brush, and worked with local and state agencies to push to have projects of waterfowling access prioritized.
 
education

provide education for kids and adults through our mentorship program and mentored hunts.  publish useful information pertinent to the waterfowl world in our newsletter.  local chapters get speakers and provide programs to educate our members on a wide variety of topics.

advocacy

act as the voice of the washington waterfowler.  fight for public lands and hunters rights across the state.  from submitting positions in public comment, to attending local government forums, to sitting on state advisory groups.  the wwa works on the local, state, and federal levels to ensure that waterfowl and waterfowlers are represented.
 
community

create an inclusive environment where people of similar interest can interact together.  there are wwa events regularly all over the state of washington.  members make life-long friends in our organization.  the wwa is an entirely volunteer organization and many members will attest, you get out what you put in.
