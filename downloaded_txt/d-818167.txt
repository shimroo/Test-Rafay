new owners are doing this historic inn the justice it deserves!
my husband (a civil war buff) has always wanted to stay here. we have followed the new owner's journey and couldn't wait for it to re-open. we were not disappointed! jeremy and danielle are the sweetest couple. the room (ap hill) was clean, bright, and comfortable! all the amenities are needed for your stay. there was no tv but give me a cool evening rocking in the chairs on the front porch enjoying nature any day!
the inns parlor is a great place to relax and the general store has the cutest things! jeremy was super knowledgeable about the inn's history and the tour of the basement was creepy and cool! the restaurant is not open yet but jeremy is an excellent cook. the breakfast was delicious! he uses local meats (bacon, sausage, scrapple) that were so outstanding we had to go to the butcher and bring some back to nj! üôÇ i highly recommend this inn, the owners "are doing it right!"

i have been to the cashtown for dinner when i lived in pennsylvania, and always wanted to stay there some day. we stayed in the general lee suite and also had dinner one evening. the suite is charming, very clean and absolutely lovely. brian was amazing and very helpful, and as he showed us to our room we got a peek at the imboden room and it also looked very nice. the new owners, danielle and jeremy, were so kind and accommodating. my daughter is 12 years old and once she started looking into the supernatural events that have occurred there, she was very nervous. however, our stay there was very peaceful and uneventful. there was a book where guests wrote down their experiences and used the book to see if coins would move. we also love sam elliott, and we thought that it was so cool to stay in the room where he stayed when he played general buford in the gettysburg movie!

we‚Äôve been coming to cashtown inn for years and every visit has been so special to us. our most recent visit was a real delight. the dinner was absolutely amazing! the food was out of this world! all of the wait staff work hard to make your experience extra special. everyone is so polite and professional! a special shout out to brian for making our dinner feel especially elegant! breakfast is amazing as well, and jeremy sure cooks the best bacon around! the historian, bruce, made for a very interesting breakfast on our parting day. one of the reasons we love cashtown is its unique history. bruce taught me some things i didn‚Äôt know! thank you to all the staff and jeremy and danielle for everything! hope to see y‚Äôall again soon!
