what our customersare saying










★★★★★“just wanted to let you know we were so pleased with the installation. the installation crew was fantastic. arrived early, neat as a pin and very helpful. they even put up the arm which holds our shower head and turned the flange around on our basement shower door so the water would stay inside the shower. there was a guy installing closets and painters and they were very cooperative. polite, pleasant and everything looks great. can’t wait to use the shower. thanks for everything. we will definitley sing your praises to anyone who needs a shower door install. thanks again.”  -bh
