life after tomorrowwhat do sarah jessica parker, alyssa milano, and molly ringwald have in common? they all began their careers as child actresses appearing in the hit musical "annie."life after tomorrow is a personal journey of filmmaker and co-director, julie stevens, who played one of the orphans in the broadway cast and national tour. with partner, gil cates, jr., the filmmakers spoke with over 40 women who played orphans in the show during its original run on broadway, from 1977-1983. the film explores the life-changing repercussions of child performers in "annie" as many orphan cast members revisit their experience in the show, their childhood, family support structure, what happened when they left the show and tried to resume a "normal" childhood, and what they are doing today.
