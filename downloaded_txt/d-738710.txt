hurricane ian notice









 
thank you for visiting bailey’s general store. on september 28th, 2022 hurricane ian passed sanibel, and our beloved store and shopping center received extensive damage due to wind, rain, and an unprecedented storm surge on sanibel. this immense damage forces us to close for major renovations. since 1899, we have had the pleasure of taking care of our community of residents and visitors, and we look forward to the time when we can welcome you back to our store. bailey’s will rebuild with a focus on sustainability and improved offerings to our guests.
as you may know, bailey’s is owned and operated by the johnsons of the bailey family. we also own and operate the island store on captiva, which is open for business! please visit us on captiva and follow our social media pages for timely updates and information.
with love,
your friends at bailey’s
