welcome to
debbie's dachshunds.

miles northwest of san antonio, texas and just 75 miles from austin, texas.
we have been
breeding different
colors of miniature dachshunds since 2001.  we have had dachshunds in our
lives and part of our family for over thirty years.  our dogs are raised in a loving and caring
atmosphere with plenty of room to run.  all of our dogs are registered with the
american kennel club.

our dachshund puppies are sold with only 
	limited akc registration.
	limited registration means that the dog is 
	registered but no litters produced by that 
	dog are eligible for registration.

we
            use nuvet plus daily canine supplement.  we strongly urge all
            dog owners to use nuvet plus to help ensure that your pet has a long
            and healthy life.
nuvet plus can only be
            purchased directly from the manufacturer, nuvet labs.  nuvet
            labs can be reached at the following number 1-800-474-7044.  you
            can purchase nuvet plus at the wholesale price if you use my order
            code when placing your order. 
            my order code is 13191.
when you order nuvet
            plus daily canine supplement for your puppy, don't forget to put it
            on autoship.  the autoship program is great because you'll save
            15% off the wholesale price and your orders will automatically ship
            at predetermined intervals.  it's easy and saves you money!
