it would be easy to underestimate the usefulness of the products i have purchased
                                from schoolhouse technologies. i teach spanish, french and english to adults, and
                                i'm very impressed with the vocabulary worksheet factory and schoolhouse bingo.                            
                                all of the schoolhouse technologies programs are super easy to use, and the tech
                                support has been excellent. i had a strange quirk in using the program which was
                                related to my computer's in unique configuration, and the response from tech support
                                was very quick and resolved the problem completely.

well, my hours of sitting at the computer every weekend have just been halved, even quartered. 
                                thank-you so much for this remarkable site! i have already sent links to my colleagues who are also sitting at home making worksheets.
                                today i did a little "tutorial" on the whiteboard for my colleagues to demonstrate my new discovery. everyone is delighted. 
                                you can be sure they will also be downloading and using all three programmes.

your products are wonderful, and i will recommend them to my colleagues! i only
                                wish that i would have had them 32 years ago when i began teaching!

i've used schoolhouse technologies software now for gosh...i don't know how long...but it's been a long time. 
                                i wouldn't be without it. your products are the best!                            
                                i teach general ed, but am certified in special ed, as well. 
                                usually, i take the inclusion class which means i always have a wide range of abilities in my room. 
                                the schoolhouse family of products make it so easy for me to differentiate instruction for my kids. 
                                especially when you have the option to provide hints. i am able to tailor the worksheet to a child's specific needs 
                                and/or, make it more challenging for those without learning disabilities.

i have been teaching foreign languages to adults mostly, and a little bit to kids, for about 24 years.                            
                                i love every piece of software i have purchased from schoolhouse tech! i use your products every day. 
                                they make my lesson preparation much easier, and make my lessons more fun and effective.

we can't thank you enough! this will give our daughters (especially the older) the
                                challenge they've been wanting.                           
                                your programs are at the core of our home school, and have been since the beginning.
                                    we have always appreciated your excellent products, but we have an even deeper appreciation
                                    for your customer service and support.
