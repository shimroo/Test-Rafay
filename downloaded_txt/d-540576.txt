playing games is great,

but the computer can also teach skills for use off the computer!

playing the piano is one of these phenomenal skills.


learning to play the piano - especially as a young child -

greatly improves math skills,

builds science and literary skills,

instills concentration,

builds confidence,

.....the list goes on!



the anybody can play piano app teaches:

1. playing songs with each hand alone,

2. playing songs hands together,


and

3. reading music!





playing the piano involves two visuals.  the app uses the keyboard visual.  a free notation visual is included on this website for those who wish to incorporate the two visuals for students who are ready - or beginning to be ready - for both
watching and reading.
