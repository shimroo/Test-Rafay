first color photo of earth from space – the berg film iv

first color photo of earth from space (part iv):
life magazine & aftermath
the story of the first color photographs of the earth from space continues in otto berg’s own words, with light edits and editorial notes.
in this new enthusiasm over the montage, my new boss, dr les meredith, and i decided to take the photo to the national geographic society in the hopes that they would be sufficiently interested to reproduce the montage in professional color. they sadly declined based on the very high cost of doing that. on the return to the lab., we passed by the life magazine offices and decided to see if they would print it in true color. seconds after we entered the life magazine offices, we were surrounded by every member of that organization, i believe even the janitors. they tried their darnedest to talk us into leaving the photo at life overnight, but  […]

first color photo of earth from space (part iii):
more useful purposes
the story of the first color photographs of the earth from space continues in otto berg’s own words, with light edits and editorial notes. 
the next day, i brought the montage (actually, i simply referred to it as a mosaic until life magazine referred to it as a montage) into the lab and, again, my colleagues were mostly impressed by the large area of planet earth shown and the curvature of the horizon.
 detail of the nrl-berg mosaic detailing the “discovery” of a tropical storm over texas and the value of space spaced photography for weather observation 
the montage occupied a humble spot on the workbench in our labs for several days as we would briefly discuss it over a cup of coffee. eventually we began to realize that the huge white cloud glob in the picture was somewhat  […]

the mission & the montage

the story of the first color photographs of the earth from space continues in otto berg’s own words, with light edits and editorial notes. the individual earth photos appearing here (other than berg’s original montage) were scanned and processed from the decades old internegatives that otto berg produced in order to create the earth montage in 1954. there was significant color fading of the negatives as compared with the 16mm film itself, which will be scanned as individual frames at the highest resolution available. for now, the images appearing here are the best versions of these images available, though when the 16mm film  […]

first color photo of earth from space unearthed!
on october 5, 1954, the naval research laboratory (nrl) launched an aerobee sounding rocket from the white sands proving grounds in new mexico. on board were two 16mm movie cameras peering out small holes, one with black and white film and the other with color film.
on that color 16mm film would be recorded the very first color images of earth from space.

remembering apollo 7 astronaut walt cunningham (march 16, 1932 – january 3, 2023)
 walt cunningham during our “apollo reflections” interview, august 30, 2018 
yesterday, we lost another giant of the apollo program, apollo 7 astronaut walt cunningham. i had the good fortune of meeting walt on many occasions over the years – the first time at a uacc autograph show in houston, texas in 2000. then, as always, walt was funny, gracious, accommodating, and friendly to all.
 with walt at uacc autograph show, houston, 2000 
as he was in the photograph below from the same event posing with members of the yahoo astronauts news group i had founded a couple of years prior, with a few familiar faces to the space memorabilia collecting community including (starting 3rd from left) myself, walt, steve hankow (farthest reaches), apollo 14 astronaut ed mitchell, and gerry montague (astronaut archives), and  […]

a distant world
 voyager i view of earth and moon. credit nasa/jpl 
at top is a photograph from the cassini spacecraft at saturn, approximately 900 million miles from earth, showing earth just below the rings on july 19, 2013. above, the first full-disk picture of both the earth and the moon as seen by voyager i on september 18, 1977. voyager 1 snapped this picture approximately 7.25 million miles from earth. this was the first image to show both the full earth and moon in the same frame.
robotic spacecraft have ventured deep into space, far more distant than human beings have yet travelled, allowing a perspective that we could previously only imagine. the voyager i spacecraft was the first to image the earth and moon together on its way out to jupiter and saturn, the first probe to visit those planets, and now exploring interstellar space. fifteen years later, on december 16, 1992, the galileo spacecraft took  […]

discovering earth

“we came all this way to explore the moon, and the most important thing is that we discovered the earth” – bill anders, apollo 8, “earthrise” photographer

above, the first photograph of an earthrise in black and white, and moments later, the first color photograph of earthrise as seen with human eyes.
on december 21, 1968 humanity left the comforting confines of home on a journey to earth’s nearest neighbor. on their way, the apollo 8 astronauts came to see all that has ever been as a thumbnail in endless space. the first photograph of the whole earth as seen by human beings appears below. most of south america is visible at bottom center. north america (upper left) is mostly obscured by clouds, with florida and mexico visible. upper right is western africa.
