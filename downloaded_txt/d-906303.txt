how biology broadens your career“i learned two valuable lessons at the uo: the first was that contrary to what i previously thought, i was really good at science. the second was that pursuing basic research is an incredibly rewarding and enjoyable way to spend one’s life. the latter was absolutely due to my time in the biology and chemistry departments and participation in undergraduate research. the latter is also what made me resilient through all the challenges i faced during my graduate and postdoctoral training. it's why i was able to persist and find the opportunity to start my own research lab at harvard. i couldn’t have made a better choice than joining the uo department of biology, and i would not be where i am today without doing so.”—aleena garner, undergraduate researcher in bowerman lab, bs biochemistry, bs psychology, '07,




our degree programsthe department of biology prides itself on spanning a wide range of biology disciplines. students can explore career opportunities and state-of-the-art research in many areas of life sciences, including cell and developmental biology, computational biology, ecology and evolution, marine biology, and neuroscience. this rich disciplinary mix provides for a diverse and collaborative educational experience that is the hallmark of our department. undergraduate degreesbachelor of science in biologybachelor of science in marine biologyminor in biologygraduate degreesmaster of science in biologyphd in biology

bad bacteria can trigger gut pain, new research shows how


january 24, 2025



biology, physics - a new study published in the journal mbio shows how one kind of bacteria, vibrio cholerae, triggers those painful contractions by activating the immune system. the research also finds a more general explanation for how the gut rids itself of unwanted intruders, which could also help scientists better understand chronic conditions like inflammatory bowel disease. the research was led by julia ngo, a now-graduated doctoral student in karen guillemin and raghu parthasarathy’s labs.






 




a century beneath the waves


december 13, 2024



biology - in 1924, the university of oregon began teaching marine biology classes in a ramshackle collection of tents in a cove along the southern oregon coast. but what started as a couple of professors bringing some students on a summer camp has now become a permanent, year-round marine field station with a hundred years of coastal research and education.






 




researchers unravel how a breast cancer gene affects fertility


december 2, 2024



biology - women with a harmful mutation in the brca1 or brca2 genes have a 60 percent chance of developing breast cancer at some point in their lives, and a many-fold increased risk of developing ovarian cancer. uo college of arts and sciences biologists have uncovered how brca1 gene influences fertility. “this is a breakthrough discovery that enables potential therapeutic avenues for understanding how to correct or treat fertility issues in brca1 patients,” said diana libuda, an associate professor in the institute of molecular biology at the uo.
