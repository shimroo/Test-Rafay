icarus ii ... the beginnings






 
few 
                of today's ultralight enthusiasts truly understand the unique 
                beginnings of ultralight aviation.




imagine ...

a world where the term "freedom 
                      of flight" is an oxymoron... a sad joke, if you will. 
                      sure, free to fly... if you have the income to afford the 
                      extensive training, licensing, and time requirements of 
                      conventional aircraft flight. then, suddenly, you hear of 
                      a new type of airplane that
anyone can fly!
without the restrictive 
                      licensing and expensive flight time! a new avenue suddenly 
                      is thrown open to the entire world where a man, woman, or 
                      even a teenager can now own and operate an aircraft of their 
                      own, even of their own making! freedom of flight at last!
                    all 
                      because of one man's courage to "test the system", 
                      to push the envelope of conventional thinking and open the 
                      skies to the common man, a most uncommon man: 

                      john k. moody

                    to understand his story, order the video, or, schedule him to
                    speak to your group. 
                    become part of aviation history by opening your mind and heart to the dawn of ultralight 
                      aviation!
