beastly gifts ( mrbeast ) usa, llc (âwe,â âusâ and âourâ) operates this website, as well as other websites (collectively, the ârzu websitesâ), where you can earn rewards â merchandise or gift cards (ârewardsâ) â by registering and providing information and completing certain promotional deals (âdealsâ).  by accessing and using the rzu websites, you agree to and accept these terms & conditions, as well as our privacy policy and any additional terms, conditions and policies published on rzu websites (collectively, the âagreementâ).  if you do not agree to and accept the terms of the agreement in their entirety, you do not have permission to visit and/or use any of the rzu websites.
mandatory arbitration. these terms & conditions contain a mandatory arbitration provision, as detailed below, that requires you to arbitrate, individually, all disputes or claims that you may have with us, our parent, related parties, advertiser clients and marketing partners (collectively, âmarketing partnersâ) who are third-party beneficiaries of the mandatory arbitration provision.  thus, for example, if you provide prior express written consent to be contacted via telemarketing or sms/text messaging, any claims that you may have regarding any telemarketing or sms/text messages that you receive are subject to the mandatory arbitration provision.  the mandatory arbitration provision also waives your right to participate in a class action or multi-party arbitration.  there are two narrow exceptions to the mandatory arbitration provision: (1) you may opt-out by providing written notice of your decision to do so within thirty (30) days of the date that you first register on a rzu website; and (2) you may opt-out by filing a claim in small claims court provided the requirements described below are met.
how the promotions work.  to earn a reward, you must: (a) be at least 18 years old and a u.s. resident; (b) submit your accurate name, contact (registration) and demographic information including your valid residential and email addresses; (c) complete the survey questions; (d) meet the applicable promotion requirements set forth below within a twenty (20) day period beginning with the date of your first completed deal(if you register but donât complete a deal, the twenty (20) day period does not start); (e) start the reward claims process within ten (10) days of when you complete the required number of deals; and (f) provide a properly completed claim form and supporting documentation (see below) within thirty (30) days of our sending you the claim form via adobe echosign.
you must use the same accurate contact information for completing the required deals as you did during the registration process.  you may not have a third party (friend, relative, etc.) complete deals for you.  if you donât complete all of the requisite deals during your initial visit to this rzu website, go to reward status and log in and use the provided link that will enable you to resume signing up for deals or contact customer support who will provide you with a re-entry link.  you should retain any confirmation emails or other documentation received applicable to the completed deals.  you cannot sign up for the same deal more than once to get credit for a reward.  the silver, gold and platinum deals appear after the registration forms, surveys and optional offers, which do not count towards earning a reward.  to be credited with the completion of an deal as shown in the table above, you must first access the deal through this rzu website or through a valid link provided to you by customer support.  we use third-party services to verify your registration information.  if your registration information is determined to be invalid, we reserve the right to not display the pages with the promotion deals.  in that case, you will be ineligible to earn a reward.  
for a subscription or purchase deal, the advertiser must be able to successfully bill your credit card at least once or for the number of times specified in the particular dealâs terms to receive credit.  some of our advertisers will not accept prepaid cards to complete deals.  you will not be credited with completing a deal unless the advertiser confirms your completion, so do not use a prepaid card for deals or cancel a deal right after you signup.  many advertisers will not give credit to a âquick cancel.â  for this reason, there may be a delay from the time you sign up for a deal and when it appears as a completed deal on your reward status.  additional terms and conditions may apply to participate in select marketing deals.  you should read the terms of each deal provided by the advertiser for an explanation of these terms (if applicable).  the representative deal chart provides important information on many of the deals including initial cost, ongoing obligations and how to cancel.  if you have questions about any deals, please review the chart or contact the third party sponsor/advertiser.  customer support is also available to provide assistance here.
reward status. you can check on your progress at any time by logging in with your email address on reward status  (if you havenât completed any deals, you will not be able to log in to reward status). sometimes deals arenât properly accounted for when you check your reward status.  you should keep email confirmations from completed deals as we may ask for them during the claims process to confirm youâre entitled to claim a reward.  we also reserve the right to require you to provide us with proof of payment for completed deals.  acceptable proof includes copies of bank or credit card statements.  when you make copies of your statements, we ask that you cover your account number.
1. log into the website and select âclaim reward.â log into the website here with your email address by selecting âclaim my rewardâ at the bottom of the page.  then, complete the following required information: name, residential address, email address, and telephone number.  we will review your claim and confirm whether you have completed all the required deals to earn a reward.  
2. verifying your deals. if one or more deals havenât registered in our system and you believe that you completed more deals than are displayed, please send us an email letting us know what deals you  completed.  we may ask that you provide an unaltered copy of the confirmation email(s) of the deals that you completed, proof of payment, and/or a screenshot of required documentation, such as a screenshot of a mobile application, using your smart phone.
4. provide proof of id and address. once we have verified that you completed the deals and received a properly executed claim form, you must provide proof of id and current residential address.  for tier 1 rewards, you must provide either (i) a valid and unexpired government-issued photo id (you can cover your identification number from the id) (âphoto idâ) and proof of your current household residential address (e.g. a utility bill) or (ii) if the address on your photo id matches the address that was used during the registration and claims process, then we only require a photo id. for tier 2 rewards, you must provide a  photo id and proof of your current household residential address.  
5. selecting your reward. after you complete steps 1-4, you will receive an email requesting you to choose between a virtual gift card, which is delivered free of  or a plastic gift card, where you must pay the third- party shipping costs.  
once you have completed the above steps, we will send you your reward within six weeks.  we reserve the right to audit claims to ensure that only users who fully comply with these terms & conditions can claim a reward.
you need to complete the claims verification process within sixty (60) days of when you first start the process by clicking on claim my reward and then you must file your claim form with your id and proof of address within thirty (30) days of when we send the claim form.  we reserve the right to substitute a reward of equal or greater value if the reward you earned is unavailable for any reason.  we are not responsible and will not replace any lost, stolen or mis-delivered rewards unless the mis-delivery is clearly because of our error.
we rely on our users providing accurate registration information so we and our marketing partners can connect with and market to our users.  if your registration information (name, postal address, email address) does not match the information on your claim form, we reserve the right to disqualify you.  in some situations, our system may pre-populate inaccurate registration information.  if this happens, please contact us here and provide us the correct information so we can update the system.
