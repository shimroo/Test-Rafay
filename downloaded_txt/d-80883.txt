news: new blogit mobile-friendly layout










                "i often use scenes or excerpts from my fiction writing in my journal blog here. readers tell me if the scene works, if it is compelling or confusing - the feedback sharpens my blue editing pencil. i learn a lot from their comments. thanks to all. :) " --
