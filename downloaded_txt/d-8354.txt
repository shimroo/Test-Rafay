to create a new tour you will need to:





1) name the tour





a.	this title shows on the page as the link your users will click to start the tour. name it accordingly - make it short, but also catchy.
b.	choose if you want the tour to start for everyone that visits the page for the first time.





2) add steps to your tour: try not to make it more than 6-8 tour tips per page. more than this, it gets too long to click through all the tips, and people are less likely to get to the last tips.





a.	click the green plus and add all the details of the tour tip





i.	click the area of the page you want the tip to “stick” to.
ii.	give the tip a title and description
iii.	choose the location of the tip, keeping in mind the edges of the page!





b.	re-order any tour tip by easily click-and-dragging the tip to a new location in the list.





3)	click through the tour to check tip placement and completeness. make any changes necessary.

the baldwin park story

when you think of baldwin park, you're probably thinking of the gorgeous homes, the countless parks, runs around the lake, exceptional schools and the shops, restaurants, and events that make it one of the most desirable neighborhoods in the city beautiful but there is so much more! 
 
baldwin park has a rich history reaching all the way back to 1942 when the area was known as the orlando army air station.  in the 1960s, the air station closed its doors, and the land was turned over to the us navy for use.  the area became the orlando naval training center and remained that through the early 1990s.
 
in 1997, almost three years after the base had formally closed, the process began to transform baldwin park into what it is today, a city within a city for families, young adults, entrepreneurs, business owners and so much more!
