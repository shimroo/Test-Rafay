free webinarthe key to your next good hire that also lowers turnover



                the cost of a bad hire in both dollars and damaged morale can be devastating, yet too many organizations are making 
                crucial hiring decisions based on impressions and “gut” rather than data or science. in this informative 30-minute 
                webinar, you will learn the key to your next successful hire--job fit. in a harvard business review study of hiring 
                practices, job fit was determined to have the only real effect on turnover… not experience, not college degrees,
                not age or sex. how are you filling the gap between the resume and the interview with job fit data that you can trust?

                during this session, you will be introduced to pxt select™, a powerful selection assessment that provides hiring authorities 
                with crucial insight into each candidate’s cognitive abilities, behavioral traits, and interests, forming a vivid picture 
                of potential job fit. a simple format will help you interview better and hire smarter. its intuitive suite of reports helps 
                you select, onboard, coach and develop employees to their full potential, leading to better hires and reduced turnover
