traveling through the open road tolling plazas on the ohio turnpike? here’s what you need to know


 








 









 








 









 
mount your e-zpass transponder to the windshield correctly to avoid additional charges
many changes have occurred across the 241-mile ohio turnpike that require e-zpass customers to properly mount their e-zpass transponders to the windshield behind the review mirror and away from any tinted areas.

these changes include the new open road tolling lanes for e-zpass customers to travel nonstop at highway speed; the removal of all gates in the entrance lanes and e-zpass exit lanes at 20 toll plaza interchanges; and the installation of video cameras to capture images of license plates, which is required to mail invoices for unpaid tolls.

numerous tolling points to detect an e-zpass were added to the ohio turnpike’s new open road tolling system, so waving an e-zpass transponder by hand is ineffective and unsafe. if an e-zpass transponder is not read properly by the system (no entry point was detected), the likely outcome is a max fare charge.

to avoid other potential billing issues, e-zpass customers should also keep their online accounts up to date, including a listing of vehicle license plate number(s), a valid credit card as well as full contact information and email address.

to pay a toll online, visit www.ezpassoh.com or call customer service at 440.971.2222.

for more details about the ohio turnpike’s new tolling system, visit www.ohioturnpike.org/openroadtolling2024.

adopt a new mindset behind the wheel – be safe together
by ferzan m. ahmed, p.e.
june 24, 2024
to reduce vehicle crashes on roadways everywhere, tolling agencies from across the globe have issued a call-to-action urging motorists to be self-aware of unsafe driving behaviors behind the wheel – such as speeding, distracted and impaired driving, and not wearing a safety belt.
it is part of a new global roadway safety campaign, be safe together, led by the international bridge, tunnel and turnpike association (ibtta).
ibtta’s first global road safety week, which runs from june 24-28, 2024, is highlighting the steps the tolling industry is taking to make our highways safer as well as urging motorists to drive in ways that are both responsible and safe.
