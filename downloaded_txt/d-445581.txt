hardiest palms









.
 


























if you've ever longed for a home in the tropics but just couldn't make it happen, perhaps you should try converting your current landscape into that tropical paradise. with a little effort you might just be able to grow a few palms of your very own. some palms are actually quite cold-hardy and routinely endure sub-freezing temperatures. one species, the needle palm, has even withstood temperatures as low as -20â°f. with some protection, even the less-hardy palms can pull through a cold winter. and, the toughest palm may need no protection at all! so experiment a little and see if you can turn that ho-hum landscape into a tropical paradise.
