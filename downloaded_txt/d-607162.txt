all is rooted in love





1 as a prisoner for the lord, then, i urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received. 2 be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. 3 make every effort to keep the unity of the spirit through the bond of peace. 4 there is one body and one spirit—just as you were called to one hope when you were called— 5 one lord, one faith, one baptism; 6 one god and father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.   i read out of ephesians 4 today as part of the devotions i'm doing for the church in greenhills. verse 2 in particular struck me because it contains three character traits that i strive to have but really don't have naturally, and thus i rely on and need the grace of god to make it happen. lord, i need you.

aww, crap





it looks like google did something to me again. lol the hits on the other website are down 60%. sucks to be me right now, with my son battling the mumps and my site's traffic down, 83% of which is search engine driven. ah, i need to build me some community! listening to the museum

daniel fast day #8





today, i'm on the eighth day of my daniel fast. it hasn't been as difficult as i thought it would be, primarily because i love vegetables to begin with. i'm trying to get more creative with my food choices, even as i wait on god to heal three people of their cancers. they're so strong; it's the least i can do to help support them. listening to: casting crowns,  courageous
