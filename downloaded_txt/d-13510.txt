    appointment cancellation policy

your appointments are essential to all of us at interface. your appointment is reserved especially for you, and we understand that sometimes schedule adjustments are necessary; therefore, we respectfully request at least 24 hours notice of cancellations. 
    strict and enforced 24 hour cancellation policy 

please understand that when you forget or cancel your appointment without giving enough notice, we miss the opportunity to fill that appointment time, and clients on our waiting list miss the opportunity to receive services. our appointments are confirmed 48 hours in advance for your convenience. since the services are reserved for you, a cancellation fee will apply. less than 24 hours' notice will incur a $50 cancellation fee. 

  arriving late

if you are at most 10 minutes late for your designated appointment time, we may be unable to accommodate you. in this case, we will need to reschedule your appointment and charge a cancellation fee of $50. 



    appointment no shows 

no-shows will be charged $75; we require a $75 deposit to book future appointments. the deposit will be deducted from your service amount once you arrive at your appointment. a credit card "hold" transaction may be made on your credit card to reserve your designated appointment time. our cancellation policy allows us to inform our standby guests of any availability and keeps our interface team members' schedules filled, thus better-serving everyone. our policies at interface are presented and enforced to provide excellent service to all of our established and future clientele. 

  confirmation calls

as a courtesy, we will personally call/text and email you to confirm your appointment two business days before your appointment date. however, if we are unable to reach you, please understand that it is your responsibility to remember your appointment dates and times to avoid late arrivals, missed appointments, and the cancellation fee. we appreciate your business and thank you for your cooperation! -interface indy staff
