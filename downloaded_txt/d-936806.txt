panama city beach florida                 has long been one of america's top beach vacation destinations due                 to its accessible panhandle location,  wide variety of vacation rentals and condos, eclectic shopping, restaurant and entertainment options and most importantly its reputation for having "the                 world's most beautiful beaches".





with  over 27 miles of award-winning beaches, panama city beach florida's beaches earn awards each year from many sources including the travel channel, southern living magazine, hotels.com, and even dr. beach as one of the top us beach panama city beachations. panama city beach's unique crystal white sand beaches and sparkling emerald green water are striking and many say the stretch of beach from panama city beach to panama city beach rival the world famous caribbean beaches in their beauty.  throw in the pleasant                 year 'round temperatures and an average of over 320 days of sunshine                 per year and its easy to see why panama city beach is a sun and fun seeker's dream. 





panama city beach lodging is often a surprise to guests who have not visited the area in the past few years. long gone are most of the little mom and pop motels that once lined the beaches. luxury high rise condos line the beaches now and guests often find that they can now stay in a very luxurious condominium with a full kitchen, living area and multiple bedrooms and bathrooms for a price that is not much more than they would pay to stay in a small hotel room in other beach destinations. the enormous supply of panama city beach condos makes for a very appealing vacation rental market for guests. there are still many hotels and some resorts, but condos are by far the vacation lodging of choice for most panama city beach visitors.

                  head start in planning their vacation. although the area is probably best known for its beaches, panama city beach also offers many off the beach family vacation                 attractions, including a zoo, many amusement and water parks, a                 marine park, racetrack, miniature golf courses and much more. 





seafood and all industry related thereto have become a way of life in panama city beach, which may be why it has been called the "seafood capital of the world". as would be expected, seafood restaurants in the area thrive on this reputation and there are few places in the world where a guest will find so many opportunities to get the freshest seafood possible - in some cases diners are given the option of choosing their entree right off the boat where it was caught. also, there are numerous casual  dining spots as well as award-winning  fine-dining establishments that offer all sorts of non seafood fare. budget concious diners will be pleased to find that many restaurants in the area are also pocketbook friendly and most will discover that the area's restaurants have something for nearly every taste, style and budget. visit our panama city beach restaurants page for contact information, phone numbers and website links for many of the area's most popular restaurants.
