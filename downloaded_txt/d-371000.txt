jeff licquia’s site


        hi!  this is my site, where i post about stuff.
    







site refactor
    


first of all: hello, remember me? itâs been quite a while. lots has happened since last we chatted. if iâm being honest, youâre likely reading this because you read something else here, and youâre trying to figure out what makes me tick, in which case: welcome!
thereâs too much to cover for the intervening time, which will likely get covered as needed when needed, but for now: iâm planning to get back onto writing on various topics, and to avoid some of the things that got me hung up before, iâm refactoring the site....
