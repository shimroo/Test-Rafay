  it is everything that is missing. flesh that is not metal. smell that			is not sprayed on. hunger neither bought nor sold. life that is not machine. the song of			blood you know, hear, feel, search for everywhere, but cannot find. or you find it, and			are home forever: the epiphany of earth. — barbara mor elcome to the newly redesigned wild ideas, a site dedicated to the celebration			of the wild in all its forms. this site is divided into a number of subject areas,			dealing with different facets of wildness, from the familiar concept of wilderness and			wild nature to looser interpretations of the term in the contexts of spirituality,			sexuality, creativity and politics. the defining quality is:  wild adj [me wilde fr. oe, akin to ohg wildi wild, w			gwyllt] (bef 12c) 1 a : living in a state of nature and not ordinarily			tame or domesticated...   3 a (1): not subject to restraint or regulation:			uncontrolled; also : unruly...   (2) emotionally overcome; also			: passionately eager or enthusiastic...   b marked by turbulent			agitation...   c going beyond normal or conventional bounds...  			d indicative or strong passion, emotion or desire...   5 :			characteristic of, expressive of, or appropriate to wilderness or wildlife...  			6 a : deviating from the normal or expected course...		 please note that wild ideas is still partially under construction at this point. although			most of the “placeholder” pages are gone, a few places are still pretty			skeletal (notably the book reviews, and the faq areas outside the temple). there may			also be a few broken links that we haven't caught yet. the process of restructuring and			redesigning such a large site has been more of an uphill battle than we had anticipated!			if you'd like to be kept up to date on the site's status, you can sign up for the			wildnews announcement list using the form to the left.
