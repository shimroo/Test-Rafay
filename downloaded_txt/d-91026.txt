inspired by games for the commodore 64 and amiga computers, blitwise productions llc was founded in 2001 to release “shareware-style” games on modern computers.  our goal is to write indie games that evoke both a sense of the demoscene with it’s dark backgrounds and vibrant colors, as well as the humble notion that the kid down the street could have written this in their back bedroom after school.meet the author:creator of scorched tanks, dx-ball, pocket tanks













michael p. welchmike@blitwise.comstarting out as a shareware game developer on the amiga computer, michael has been writing games since the 90's.  from hundreds of mailed-in donations for scorched tanks, to 60+ emails a day from dx-ball fans, to millions of pocket tanks downloads, his games have been played all over the world - much to his surprise!  he believes in making a video game like an author writes a novel; handcrafted from scratch by one person.  if you are looking for games that have a unique charm that only a 'single-person, single-vision game' can provide, then you've come to the right place.
