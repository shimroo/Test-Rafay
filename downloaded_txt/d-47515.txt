visit your local the cheese steak shop to purchase.








old cheese steak done righti grew up on the east coast where this particular delight was perfected… they know their core competency: steak and cheese. the menu is variations on the classic, with sides (steak fries or curly) and a self-serve soda station. service is speedy, but they only make your sandwich after it’s ordered. the sandwiches are the real deal.

a philly boy gives y'all props.i just wanted to say as a philly native-born and raised that this is the best steak shop outside of philly. i travel for a living and can tell you personally that no one comes close. i wish you all the best in these rough times and any time i’m in the bay area i will be ordering from here.

the best-tasting cheesesteaks anywherei’ve been patronizing your pleasanton and walnut creek shops for years. without a doubt, the best tasting cheesesteaks anywhere. i have recently moved back to the east bay area and happily found that they are still the same, incomparable, flavor. thanks for not changing the recipe.

went to law school in sf in the early 80’s. if i had to pick 3 things i miss about sf, your original cheesesteak would be one of them. please open one in dallas.
