                            our mission                    


                    to ensure conservation of missouri’s wildlife and natural resources, and preservation of our state’s rich outdoor legacy through advocacy, education and partnerships.
                         








more about us










the conservation federation of missouri is a private organization made up of thousands of missourians who work together to better our natural resources and represent missouri’s citizen conservationists. actively involved in state and national issues that relate to conservation, the federation has long been a prominent and effective voice before the missouri general assembly, the missouri department of conservation, and the missouri department of natural resources.the members of cfm are the conscience of hunters, fishermen, foresters, campers, trappers, hikers, paddlers, birdwatchers, and more. cfm speaks for sportsmen and sportswomen whenever and wherever it is necessary, to support our collective opinions on the future of missouri outdoors. in fact, most of the conservation legislation in missouri today exists, because of the federation’s strong advocacy work. cfm is not a branch of state government or an entity of a public agency.   














                            vision statement                    


                    the conservation federation of missouri (cfm) envisions a future of continued strong citizen support for conserving our state’s rich natural resources including abundant wildlife, healthy forests, clean water and air, and land in which missourians enjoy the outdoors. cfm envisions missouri’s public and private natural resources are scientifically managed by private landowners and strong, science-based agencies for the benefit of all missourians.

"conservation, at the bottom, rests on the conviction that there are things in this world more important than dollar signs and ciphers. many of these things attach to the land, and to the life that is in it and on it. people who know these things have been growing scarcer but less so in missouri than elsewhere. this is why conservation is possible here."


aldo leopold, 1947
