about
since 1926, driving down route 66 has been the experience of a lifetime for travelers, adventurers, desperados, and dreamers. the historic 66 website provides free information for all those who want to learn more about the legendary route 66.
while officially route 66 no longer exists, the majority of it remains to be driven and enjoyed. the turn-by-turn road description will guide you on your journey through all eight states from chicago to los angeles. not only will it help you to stay on track, but you’ll also find some background information on the hundreds of roadside attractions that dot the landscape.
in the picture gallery, you’ll find inspiration for your upcoming voyage or take a trip down memory lane. thanks to the preservation organizations, volunteers, and business owners, a lot of these landmarks can still be admired in real life along route 66. some treasures, however, have disappeared and can only be explored through pictures.
