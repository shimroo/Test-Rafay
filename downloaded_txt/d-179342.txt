we’re ready!
ccdre stands prepared with a warehouse of supplies ready to have on the road within hours of a disaster.



give today





























the best way to assist those in need is to donate money. 
for 2025  through february 11, the total value of goods given to families affected by major disasters in the us and us territories  was $361,440.58.  we delivered 16 shipments, to 12 townships/counties, in 8 states, providing  food, personal hygiene, infant care, new clothing, water, and cleaning supplies for anyone affected, along with shipments of new furniture, new appliances, new mattress sets, and new water heaters for uninsured-low income families to help replace items they lost because of the disaster. to see the detail of locations where we have helped this year, through the end of last month, scroll to the bottom of this page and select  ”2024 monthly report”. in 2024 we provided the same supplies worth a total value of $7,501,458.98.  in summary, we were blessed to be able to help disaster survivors in 72 townships/counties in 19 states with 232 shipments. to see the detail of areas we helped in 2021 through 2024, scroll to the bottom of the page, and select the annual report for the year you’d like to view.  all the glory goes to god!your donations allow us to purchase needed supplies in large volume, at extreme discounts, whenever we need them. we are able to stretch your donation dollar and buy 3-4 times what you could purchase at retail prices.  we don't have to wait for donated goods to come in before we can send supplies out. we keep between 20 to 30 shipments of supplies in our warehouse at all times, so we stay prepared for the next disaster. you’re donations will help us replenish what we’ve already sent to families in need.  you don’t need to earmark a donation for a specific area or a specific disaster before we will help them. we will help anywhere in the us or us territories, and we are always on standby. we get in touch with church of christ congregations in the areas affected as soon as possible. in the case of hurricane’s, we will call congregations in the forecast path of the hurricane before it makes  land fall, to tell them we’re waiting on their phone call. if an area needs help, we will send supplies as quickly as the local church tells us they’re ready for them to be delivered. in most cases we will help an area within a day or two of the disaster, so your donations help us replenish supplies we already had ready to send, so we can continue to help others.
