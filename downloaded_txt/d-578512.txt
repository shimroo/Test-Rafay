who we are
dignity housing is the first housing and supportive services program in the nation to be founded and guided by homeless people and activists. since 1988, dignity has provided both quality affordable housing and supportive services to thousands of people – primarily single african american women and their children. dignity has cultivated an individualized services approach to meeting the complex needs of homeless individuals and families.learn more



 




 

our impact



since 1988 dignity housing has been providing homeless families and single adults with the housing and support they need to break the cycle of homelessness and poverty. we are honored and pleased to report that over 5,000 homeless families and individuals have been served by dignity. 

 

housingdignity provides quality, affordable housing in 3 housing programs, each specially designed to meet the varying needs of the resident population. dignity currently manages an inventory of 58 units of transitional and long-term supportive housing concentrated in northwest philadelphia.promoting self-sufficiencyat dignity housing, we know that affordable housing alone will not move individuals and families out of poverty. for that reason, dignity’s provides housing in combination with supportive services designed to promote the self-sufficiency of our residents.



creating opportunitiesdignity creates many opportunities for our residents to become independent, such as the after school enrichment program and plans for housing after dignity.other initiativesdignity has a computer lab that is free and open to the public. we are also breaking ground on a playground that is safe and fun for children to play.
