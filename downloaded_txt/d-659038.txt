 1.	he that hunts religion for sensual strength shall be aqta‘, the actaeon deceived by diyana’s crescent crown.
2.	in the time of turbulence, god gives you all you need behind your private door: perfume, prayer, woman.

4.	never, never, never, grow old in vain.
5.	respect the young, for they are likely to be closer to the fitra than you.
