    what child maintenance is



child maintenance covers how your child’s living costs will be paid when one of the parents does not live with the child. it’s made when you’ve separated from the other parent or if you’ve never been in a relationship.
this is a financial arrangement between you and the other parent of your child. making arrangements to see your child happens separately.

this guide is also available in welsh (cymraeg).

you must have a child maintenance arrangement if your child is under 16 (or under 20 if they are in approved education or training).
both parents are responsible for the costs of raising their children, even if they do not see them.
