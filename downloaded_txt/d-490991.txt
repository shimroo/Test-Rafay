                                stainless steel is a name of high alloy steel used mainly for its anti-corrosion properties. the main characteristic of the stainless steel family is that they all contain a minimum of 10.5 percent of chromium.

                                            stainless steel sheet

                                the percentage of carbon in steel affects the hardness, strength of elasticity and ductility of steel. low-carbon steel, also known as mild steel, has similar properties to iron but it is softer and easy to form.

                                 hot-dip galvanized steel combines utility with beauty. it consists of tin, chrome, zinc or paint, which are the extra finish applied to the natural steel surface.
