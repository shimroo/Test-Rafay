what our clients say





                  we needed to be able to identify what, who and where
                  information was being printed. with print manager software and
                  reporting, we are able to track printer usage, advise on and
                  troubleshoot any printer abuse, and direct staff training to
                  ensure that colleagues understand the appropriate use of
                  printers for standard file types.
                
manager, marsh usa inc.





                  we implemented print manager plus to assess our printing
                  operations and develop a plan to reduce cost. the software was
                  easy to install and setup on our server. we were then able to
                  look at each individual printer costs and determine that we
                  could save about $2,000 per year just by moving users to the
                  most cost effective printer.
                
chris noyes, i.s. technical specialist, florida league of
                  cities





                  in an open academic environment printing costs can quickly
                  spiral out of control. with print manager plus, we have been
                  able to curb our over- zealous users with a simple,
                  cross-platform solution.
                
bryan lewis, school of information management and systems
                  university of california at berkeley





                  print manager plus gave us the ability to make students and
                  teachers accountable for what they print and how much. users
                  are now pausing before they print, and with the ability to set
                  limits to print jobs, the 100 page books that were being sent
                  are a thing of the past. print manager plus is a great product
                  for taking back control over spiraling print cost and saving
                  the environment from wasteful printing.

                  to find employment or to succeed in school, access to a
                  computer and to the internet is indispensable. we estimate
                  that our new partnership with print manager helped us address
                  the funding gap by reducing print related costs by as much as
                  50% at our millenium learning centre.
                
michel gervais, executive director, vanier community service
                  centre





                  thank you for installing the software that limits the number
                  of copies that can be printed at one time. it has proven to be
                  a useful tool to help staff manage resources and a great cost
                  saving tool for our organization. with the installation of
                  print manager, we now use 30% less paper and ink cartridges!
