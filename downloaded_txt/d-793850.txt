the list of advertising offenses





an oldie from 1998.here at commercials i hate, we have astutely noticed that america's most hated commercials have many factors in common.with this in mind, we have compiled a checklist of crimes committed in advertisements that we callthe list of advertising offensesspouse hiding the product in pursehusband has a terrible cough and has been hacking loudly through dinner.he uses his own cough drops, but continues to bark like a dying seal.only then does the wife reveal her cough drops,which have been cleverly hidden in her purse the whole time.what the hell was she waiting for?i have never understood why commercials show spousesusing competing products, as if they have a bet or something.#72, the numbered seriesusually shown as two 15-second clips back to back.the first one is number 34 in a series of helpful tips.the next commercial is number 18.what's up with the random numbers in random order?it's not as if there are really 34 commercials and you've only seen these two.there are always just two.ad execs only think this is a good idea because they saw someone else do it.it's a cop-out and we can tell.not showing the productyou'd think it would be obvious.the television has a screen for viewing things.why not show your product?not saying what the product is or doesanother brain-stumping error in the world of tv advertising.most common with medication(you'd think it's an important detail, knowing what the medicine is for).liquid pouring and splashing up into the airthis is shown most often in commercials for cereal,where the milk pours into the cereal from a stupefying height,cresting and splashing up and out of the bowl.this is also shown in ads for kool-aid and nestea.this is supposed to represent what exactly?who pours liquid from way up high and splashes it everywhere?they also do this in commercials for liquid bleach!who would be so careless with liquid bleach?car spinning out of controlthe commercial is for a car, and they always show the car fish-tailing to a screeching halt.this is supposed to demonstrate what exactly?i suppose this stunt is to appeal to my alpha-male side.yeah, give me a car that spins. preferrably spraying a fine mist from a wet road, or spewing dust in a giant cloud as i rip through the desert, destroying my clear-coat.you know what? i just don't get it.when you see a car spinning like that on the real road, you know someone is about to die, and that car is about to become a coke can.totally unreal situationsthese ads show people in situations they would never really be in,like two grown women grocery shopping together with one cart,or a girls soccer team eating cheerioswith bowls and spoons on the soccer field.i saw an ad where a guy eats cereal at an outdoor cafe,with the cereal box on the table.people eat cereal at home and that's it.nobody goes out and pays to eat cereal in a cafe.and on the soccer field? give me a break!i'd like to see an ad that shows single people eating right over the sink.now that's a real situation.michael jordanhere is a man who can play basketball,but who absolutely can not talk.it amazes me that mci, a communications company,used a spokesperson who can barely communicate.you can barely understand the man.he slurs his words together like a drunk stockbrokeror a teenage girl smacking on bubblegum.or maybe he still has hot dog bun stuck to the roof of his mouthfrom that delicious ball park hot dog!if someone was paying me millions of dollars to say something asinine like,"now i can talk with all my space jam buddies",i would make damn sure that what i said clearly sounded like"now i can talk with all my space jam buddies".what did they do, shoot one take and go home?in recent years it seems nike, hanes and others have gotten the message.nowadays the michael jordan of commercials only stands there silently, makes a face, or shoots hoops.people using the word "brand" in casual conversationprime example is the newly revised,"i am stuck on band-aid brand, 'cause band-aid's stuck on me"and who could forget the natural-sounding delivery of..."new lean pockets! from hot pockets brand!"people do not use the word brand when speaking aboutor requesting a product. it doesn't happen.the interviewthis is when the ordinary joe/ headache sufferer/ dentist's wiferesponds as if being interviewed, and they never everlook in the direction of the camera.the camera keeps switching angles for no reason-she's talking to the left, she's talking to the right,you want to yell "hey! over here, sugar!"people finishing each other's sentenceshere we show people from all walks of life,each speaking a fragment of a sentence,edited together into a big annoying mess.the worst part comes at the end, when each person in turn says the last part of the sentence. we get to hear the same three or four words spoken by 5 or 6 people. somebody somewhere thought this was cute.i'd like to put cactus quills in that guy's scrambled eggs.the stupid mani know why they do it.they do it because the woman is the consumer of the household.but men make buying decisions too, ya know.and we don't like to see ourselves portrayed as glazed-eyed, mouth-ajar helpless morons.daddy can't cook. daddy can't clean. daddy can't discipline the child.daddy can't control himself in circuit city.daddy runs in circles holding a baby at arm's length.he has absolutely no idea what it is or why it makes that noise.daddy takes the kids to mcdonalds because mom's not home.and the single woman watching at home laughs heartily "ha! it's so true!"actor tries to sound unrehearsedthis is when the actor goes "uh.." and hesitates and talks all slow, in order to sound more natural.all this does is piss me off. i'm like "spit it out!"it's really lame actually. it doesn't sound more natural,it just sounds like the person can't remember what they were just talking about."simply the best"the commercial uses the tina turner song "simply the best."a brilliant song, using the innovative rhyme,"you're the best / better than the rest",tina turner's dopey "simply the best" has been used bycruise lines and roofers alike, all claiming to be the best.give it a rest.shouting at meshouting at me doesn't inspire me to do business with you.people talking like the product descriptionmy favorite example is v8 splash, where the mom says,"my guy loves his v8 splash fruit juice drink."the posthumous endorsementit should be illegal to use marylin monroe to sell tommy perfume,fred astaire to sell vacuums, and steve mcqueen to sell khakis.the blue liquidthe ad is for pads or tampons or diapersor any product that absorbs pee, and they prove the product'sspongeworthiness by pouring blue liquid on it.bastardization of a popular songthis is when they take a popular song and change the lyrics so the song is about the product.remember "toyota's hot hot hot" and budget gourmet's "things that make you go mmmm" ?this is not the same as when they use a song you used to love, and play it until you hate it - like what cadillac did to led zeppelin (as if any cadillac driver can stand led zeppelin). now i have to skip past the song when i pop in the cd because i've gotten so sick of hearing it.person who doesn't get itthese commercials feature some thick-headed guy who just doesn't get it.even though someone is talking right to his face,the guy can't hear or can't understand,leaving their exasperated friend to repeatedly shout,"it's not delivery, it's digiorno" or "aflac"i should point out that repeatedly shouting anything within a 30-second periodis a great way to annoy people really quick.commercial is an old navy commercialeven if they started making good commercials, we would still hate them.we would hate them for what they've done to us.we would hate them for the big-glasses ladyand for magic the dog and for the tv rerun parodiesand for lisa ling and morgan fairchild and for the guywho can only be known as the old navy guy.annoying, annoying annoying.

advertising offense: nabisco "tip #94"





i picked up a 100-calorie pack of "oreos" in someone's kitchen today (oreos in quotes because these are thin chocolate cookies with no filling and not even shaped like oreos) and on the pack it says 100 healthy living tips" tip # 94 treat yourself to dessert - sensibly. balance out your favorite treats with fruits and vegetables throughout the day to keep your diet on track. for more of the 100 healthy living tips, please visit www.nabiscoworld.com/100caloriepacks of course, to be a dick about it, i went to the website and there's no 100 healthy living tips. a google search of "nabisco 100 healthy living tips" revealed a message board where some ladies were going to post all of the 100 tips they found on their 100-calorie cookie packs. guess what the first one was? #94, posted above. in fact two ladies found this one. hmm, surprise. in fact only three unique tips were discovered and posted by these ladies. interestingly enough, my google search also turned up a page on the website for nbc's the biggest loser where there is in fact a nabisco-sponsored list of 100 healthy living tips. and #94 is, like on the cookie bag, treat yourself to dessert. healthy living, here i come!

repeat offender: wayne wilderson





meet wayne wilderson. he's teaching a group of kids about the chevy tahoe. he's the friendly washington mutual banker who is so embarrassed by that flock of old "white man" bankers.want to rent a car from avis, he's your man. popeye's fried chicken? he's done it. and the fruit of the loom guys? he's the grape. ladies and gentlemen, i think i may have found the only black man in america. what if the ad agencies couldn't find wayne?there could possibly be no black people in commercials that day. i believe wayne actually inherited the role of "the only black guy in every commercial on tv"from this man, thom barry, who has since graduated to the cast of cold case.

i am tired of asking. "are you in line?"





okay, people. we've been doing this since we were four years old. it's time to learn how to stand in line. nobody likes to stand in line. i'm not asking you to like it. just do it. please. if there are people in line when you arrive, please take a moment to notice what direction the line is pointing in. now stand behind the last person in line. no, no, no, wait. not over there. come back over here. thaaat's right. you want to position yourself so that the person in front of you is between you and the person in front of them. see? now you're in a line. you're not standing three feet away and off to one side. no one needs to ask you if you're in line. you are a living breathing part of the line. isn't that better? okay now wait a moment. i can see you're excited about finally being a part of the line. but hey - not so close! the person in front of you doesn't need to feel the twin blasts of breath from your nostrils on the back of their neck. they also do not need to feel the cold metallic kiss of the buckle on your purse or belt. back off a little bit. hey, not so far! you only need to back off a little. now there's room for one or two more people in front of you. everyone will ask you if you're in line or not! don't you want to be a part of the line? step forward, so that you are 12 to 18 inches from the person in front of you. and here's the key - when the person in front of you steps forward - you step forward, too. who are these morons that leave all the space in the line? scoot up! please don't make me ask if you're in line or not. just get in the fucking line. please.

the riaa and illegal downloading





every day on the news, the riaa is going ape shit over file-sharing services ruining their business. people can download music for free, says the riaa, and those are people who aren't buying cd's in the store. i'd like to point out that the public library system has been in place forever. anyone who wants to read the latest bestseller can get it for free at the library, where it is then passed on to another reader. there's two readers that didn't buy the book. and i don't hear the publishing industry raising hell over it. people still buy books, and publishers still get paid. writers don't drive bentleys upholstered with burberry fabric. i didn't see chuck palahniuk on mtv cribs. recording artists are paid exorbitant sums. how dare the riaa even imply that file sharing is taking food out of anyone's mouth! it's so stupid and transparent, it's making my head hurt.

to the tiny woman in the cadillac escalade who nearly ran me onto the shoulder this morning.





excuse me. this is a merging lane and i'm attempting to merge onto the freeway now. it's clearly my turn. i'm not sure why you keep scooting up. where do you expect me to go? it's supposed to be like a zipper, lady. one car from your lane, then one car from mine. we merge and then we go about our business. zzzz-zip. hey, what are you doing? please stop inching forward. hey. hey. okay, please listen to my horn now for the next fifteen seconds. you like that? i'd like to now direct your attention to my hoisted middle finger. yes, that's right, apply your brakes now. oh, you can see me now! i understand. you forget to look down here sometimes. and now i can see you. hair-do, knuckles and steering wheel. nice death machine you have there. how many people are in there with you? none? really? what the fuck are you driving that thing for? you don't even know how to control it. you can't see a car right next to you. you are a danger to yourself and everyone on the road. why are you driving that outrageous monstrosity? you look like a tiny white termite in a gorilla's nostril. now you must know what your own tiny brain feels like rattling around inside your head. what are you, hauling construction beams in that thing? what do you need it for? wait, i know. it's to feed your idiot greed and lust for stupid expensive sh*t. well, we're all very impressed here on the 101 freeway. oh, i can't see you in my rearview mirror anymore. you're a little speck back there. gosh, you drive so slowly when traffic is moving, i wonder why you were in such a hurry when the traffic was stopped? maybe you're on the phone now and can't be bothered to step on the gas. if only the people behind you could see the 50 feet of empty road in front of you. i bet they'd like to be driving on it. well, this has been fun. i'll leave you behind for now. see you tomorrow!

the baby bulldozer





as my girlfriend and i squeezed past 250 of hollywood's slowest people this weekend at the grove, i remarked, "suv's aren't enough anymore. now they have to have suv's for their babies." it's horrifyingly true. no longer limited to the look-at-my-big-rock newly married sandal-wearing white yuppie couple, the giant navy blue baby shopping cart phenomenon now crosses racial and economic borders. armenians, persians, hispanics, asians, blacks, all of them with baby carriers wider than the escalator and taller than their oldest child. clogging up the paths of shoppers everywhere, these plastic monstrosities often contain piles of shopping bags, purses, grocery bags, extra sandals, sunscreen, diapers, and no baby whatsoever. the baby bulldozer is a total nuisance. there's no way around it, over it, or through it, and the oncoming parent inevitably steers it directly toward your feet. fuck that shit. i told my girlfriend if i have a baby i'm carrying it in a backpack. i'll stay the fuck out of everybody's way if they stay out of mine. you. with the overflowing pillow-top hooded navy blue segway-wheeled double-decker 4-foot-wide plastic baby escalade. why don't you just carry your baby in your huge giant purse instead of putting purse and baby inside that obese excuse for a stroller? or why don't you just stay home?
