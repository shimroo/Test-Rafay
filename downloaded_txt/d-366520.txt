crayons reached a major milestone in its 27+ year history. since 1997, crayons has now distributed more than $200 million worth of school supplies, incentive items, classroom enhancements, hygiene items, and healthy snacks to area teachers and their students in need. crayons began in a small corner of the freestore foodbank and provided 125 local teachers from 22 schools with basic classroom supplies on day one. today, crayons has the potential to serve more than 11,000 teachers, from 517 preschool through grade 12 schools, and more than 100,000 students in 16 counties throughout the greater cincinnati area. this milestone would not have happened without our many loyal volunteers and generous supporters. we look forward to the next $200 million.

2023-24 difference made































 

in their words …(stories from teachers in greater cincinnati)



“i am not here to dwell on the negative. instead, i want to talk about hope. i want to talk about the power of education and the incredible potential of our students. we have dedicated teachers who work tirelessly to educate our students, and we have students who are eager to learn and grow. most people do not know how teachers “really” make things happen. as educators, we know that crayons to computers will be there for us to get what we need in order to serve our students.”—tiffani maherpincipal, rees e. price academy 



“crayons to computers make our students feel “worthy”.  that worth is shown in the smiles when they are given materials without asking for anything in return. it is shown in the relief on the face of a foster child when they receive a packet of school supplies so that they do not stand out as being different. the worth is shown when assignments are completed because the obstacle of having materials to complete the work has been removed. we are thankful for our partnership with crayons to computers. the supplies have removed obstacles and opened new opportunities for the students at mt. healthy city schools. thank you!”—valerie hawkinssuperintendent, mt. healthy city schools
