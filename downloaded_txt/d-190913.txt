2023 sausalito art festival newswe thank you for your continued interest in the iconic sausalito art festival. since 1952, the sausalito art festival has been recognized as one of america's premier outdoor art festivals and is a winner of countless industry awards. set on the waterfront in sausalito california, the festival is attended annually by thousands of visitors. it is “the place” to spend labor day weekend and enjoy fine art, food and wine.in 2021, a homeless encampment moved into marinship park, the location of the sausalito art festival and the festival was canceled for obvious reasons. although the encampment was removed in 2022, the park is still closed and in disrepair.the sausalito art festival foundation (saff) has explored many other locations in which to hold the festival but each location, for various reasons, was deemed unacceptable for an event even half the size of the sausalito art festival.while saff waits for marinship park to be repaired, its board of trustees has been producing other events to help fulfill its mission to “encourage, promote, and support the arts for the community.”  a list of the events are presented below, with others on the drawing board.additionally, saff has played a major role both financially and through knowledge-share, of establishing the sausalito center for the arts (sca). with the help of saff, sca is creating a vibrant and active arts association supporting a variety of artistic programs for residents, and visitors alike.we invite you to frequent this page to keep up with news about the festival as it is our intent to one day bring it back to glory.
