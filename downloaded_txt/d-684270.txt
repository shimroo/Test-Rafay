 "mike and mike were amazing. the kept us informed during our "weather break" in bethel, and made every effort possible to make the trip happen. i appreciate the planning and preparation involved in pulling together our complicated trip. when don had a medical issue, they handled it with sensitivity, and arranged for an airlift out, ensuring the safety of all involved. the guides are hard working guys, with great personalities. they shared their extensive knowledge freely, as well as their life stories. i feel that i made a couple of new friends.i will be fishing with them again!if you're looking for the adventure of a lifetime, call these guys up, and do it. what an experience we had."

jeffrey morrow
"i fished the goodnews river with alaska rainbow adventures and head guide mike bianchi last week and had a great time. it was my first time in alaska, and an adventure it was. mike and his crew worked hard all day, everyday to ensure that the guests were well taken care of, and of course, to get us into fish. some in our group caught all five salmon species, plus lake trout, rainbow, dollies, and grayling. but this was so much more than a fishing trip. the beauty of southwest alaska is something to behold, complete with wildlife and majestic landscapes. flying in a float plane and camping on the river brings home the wilderness that still remains in this beautiful country. mind you, this is not a trip for those that want to be constantly pampered... it's a camping and fishing expedition guided by experts. if you're ready for an adventure, give alaska rainbow adventures a call, you'll be glad you did!"

i floated the goodnews in early august. the experience was everything i expected. alaskan rainbow adventures is a very professional and a top notch guide service. the guides were very knowledgeable, friendly, and hardworking. the food and camp experience was incredible as well. the fishing on the goodnews river was excellent. although the silver run was delayed, we were still able to catch eight different species of fish, including the salmon slam.
the goodnews river offers many photographic opportunities. between the continuously changing landscape and the encountered wildlife, anyone with a camera will end up with hundreds of photographs at the end of this trip. i would definitely recommend alaska rainbow adventures, and i plan on using this guide service in the future.

alaska rainbow adventures not only crossed off an item on my list, but it also exceeded all of my expectations! from the moment i arrived in bethel until i left 10 days later, the trip was truly remarkable.
i came for the fishing, which was phenomenal, but i was treated to so much more thanks to our guides. they were supremely courteous and professional, and very good at what they do. however, what they did was so much more than just putting us on the fish. working 14-hour days every day is tough enough. but when you consider all that they do during those 14 hours, that's when you begin to appreciate the magnitude of their efforts.

their duties included making breakfast, breaking down camp, loading the rafts, guiding and rowing the rafts safely down the river, always positioning the boat correctly to maximize the fishing, netting the fish (we caught hundreds of fish), finding suitable campsites, unloading the rafts, setting up camp, cooking dinner, cleaning dishes, building fires, making lunch for the next day, and being responsible for our safety and security for the entire trip. they did all of this with not only a positive attitude but also with a smile on their faces and a genuine concern for their clients.
i am not sure how much they get paid, but it's not enough. they definitely deserve a raise! the incredible fishing, to steal a phrase from one of my trip-mates, 'size and volume,' was expected (and it was awesome), but mike and dac's incredible work ethic, positive attitude, knowledge/experience, and genuine likeability made this trip extraordinary. this was the trip of a lifetime and hope to return to alaska for another adventure, and if i do, it will undoubtedly be with the crew from alaska rainbow adventures!

i had done this type of float fishing and camping trip up in alaska in the past with another outfit that is no longer in operation, since then i have been talking with paul hansen about his trips with alaska rainbow adventures, after having been recommended to him by a guide friend of mine. when things on my end finally allowed me to pull the trigger on heading to alaska again, i chose their goodnews river trip, in this case the last one of the season and a ten day trip to boot!
thinking back on all the lodge and camping trips i have done in the past, let me tell all who read this, that this is the kind of trip for you, especially if you are a fishing junkie like myself! while lots of lodge trips are more luxurious, on those trips we all find ourselves back at the lodge by 4 o`clock swapping stories, comparing the days fishing, showered and drinking. on this trip at 4pm you are still out fishing as hard as you like and can continue to do so all night if you have not gotten enough. imagine after dinner wandering back to the river and fishing for a couple of hours and adding five to twenty additional fish to the days already ludicrous tally and only then throwing in the towel for the night!

if you are reading this you are most likely considering going to alaska, if you do, be sure to give seriously consideration to this professionally run tour in which every comfort is taken into consideration. on this trip there was a shower, bathroom, comfortable sleeping accommodations, and most importantly 'great guides' who never stopped working for you!!!
the guides were completely professional, hard working and put us on so many fish that we were actually whipped by day's end, and what day's they were! we would wake up to an excellent breakfast, fish until lunchtime when we would have shore lunch if we were traveling that day or perhaps something more hearty if not. fishing and moving down river would resume after and last until we stopped at that nights camp / fishing hole, where we would have dinner, and as i said earlier, fish after if you wish!
everybody owes it to themselves to try one of these trips, and when you do, it surely will be fondly burned into your memory until your end of days. so figure out what fish you want to target, sign up for one of their killer trip's and have a great time! i will be returning again and again to make more of those memories with alaska rainbow adventures, they run an awesome program.
