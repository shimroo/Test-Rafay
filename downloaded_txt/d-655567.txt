essays by louis beam

   essays on government, politics, religion,
history, vietnam, the emerging federal police state, and love. 
   with so much being written about me, and so little of my work actually on the
net, i thought it prudent to make available some of my essays. 
   i leave it to the reader to determine the worthiness of my work. 
 





the true purpose of the united states' 
"war on terror is not to install at most the pretense of democracy in far-a-way 
places that do not want our "democracy" but rather a secret  malevolent 
purpose of curtailing freedom at home by people who do want it.  as james 
madison, a founding father of the republic said 'if tyranny and oppression come 
to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy.' 
 

more laws restricting freedom and 
liberty have been passed since the birth of the war on terror here in the u.s. 
than in all the history of this country combined from 1779 to 2001. it is quite 
apparent as well that this is true in other countries who are also engaged in 
this orwellian war without end.  a world-wide police state will be the only 
lasting legacy and results of "the war on terror."  which is the very exact 
reason why such an event as (9/11) was allowed to occur. (http://youtu.be/cvc1rnkmcwa)  elitists in the power structure of command and 
control do not believe for one brief second this so called war will end in 
victory nor do they need for it to do so to achieve their objectives.  for 
they know that they have already won the victory of an emerging police state 
without borders.

there is, in fact, one thing these would be world-wide potentates do not 
comprehend to the full extent of its value.  we will resist.  from the rising of 
the sun on the european continent to the setting of the sun in america and 
beyond a world-wide bond of freedom loving people is developing.  these 
resistors to tyranny may not agree on many things that is true. nor is it 
necessary that do so to effectively resist. for there is beauty in differing men 
agreeing to oppose a common evil.  there is  one thing all agree upon: freedom 
is worth fighting for.  let each person look to past examples of his own 
countrymen who fought nobly for freedom and liberty.  let those many and varied 
methods of resistance become a guidepost to the future for each of us in our own 
way and form. let us seek to create a song of freedom to be heard around the 
world, which is composed note by note in our individual acts of resistance to 
tyranny.  we will be heard. let the music begin.

letters to louis beam
 
requests for my 1983 book
le fleur arrangement by louis beam
 
a brief message to my many readers (5,000 per month and counting):
 

i understand from the many e-mails i receive that there is 
considerable demand for me to add more essays to this site.  many political 
science classes, history classes, and various colleges  use my essays for 
assigned student reading.  from these students i get requests for more 
information as well as biographical requests.  i have little free time to 
answer e-mail and no desire to give interviews.  what i have to say i place 
on this web site.  i am adding more material from time to time, so i hope this 
helps all of you who are requesting more essays.    

as to requests for factual 
  biographical information.  i have never had the desire to make my 
  struggle one about myself, but rather about my ideas and analysis.  is 
  what i say "true?"  if so, that is the issue to be discussed.  
  however, several professional hate groups (people who make their living off of 
  "hate" issues) have for years provided almost totally inaccurate and 
  completely misleading information that i have never seen fit to reply to.  
  nor do i now see fit to do so.  i am not the issue, the issue is what i 
  say and write about.  nevertheless, the tactics of those who do not possess the truth is 
  to attack the messenger.  so i am creating a page with some documents of 
  my qualifications to write about what i deem important.  keep in mind 
  that there are many people with no degrees and a lack of vast world 
  experiences who are far superiour in intellect and knowledge than those 
  holding degrees and titles.  it was my experience in college that the 
  best liars were those with the most degrees. so i make no claim to great 
  knowledge from having attended a four year college. my claim, if any be 
  necessary to write words upon a page, is that i have read, listened and 
  pondered life and it's issues with an open mind that i did not have in my 
  younger years and sharply honed it by great experiences.  you 
  may go to this link to see the first posts to that section of this web site: biographical  link.
interesting mail:
more letters from a russian 
history professor
some letters i have found most interesting:
first from 
an arab: "people like myself used to think 
that only our leaders were filthy dictators..." 

the letter that means the most to me:  

i am a survivor of the holocaust...
