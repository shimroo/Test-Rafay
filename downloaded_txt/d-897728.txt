a blind man and his dog...





i'm not sure what made me remember this today...

about 30 years ago i
 had just boarded a plane from chicago to amarillo.  i settled into my aisle seat when i noticed a blind man with his seeing eye dog making their way down the
 aisle.  the stewardess (that's what they were called then) directed him
to  the two seats right across the aisle from where i was sitting. 

the guy
 got to his seats, directed the dog to hop up and sit in the aisle seat.
  the dog did that, but as the man reached up to put his jacket into the overhead bins - the dog moved over to the window seat, sat down and pressed it's nose against the window.

after stowing his jacket, the guy felt around for the dog in their seats, 
found it sitting in the window seat and ordered it back over into the 
aisle seat.  then the moment he took his hands off the dog in order to move over to his window seat, the dog moved back
 over into the window seat behind him where the man started to sit down on top of 
it. 

the dog yelped and he stood up quickly.  then he moved the dog back into the aisle seat, 
and turned to sit down again, just as the dog moved back over into window 
seat, and got sat on a second time. 

the guy moved the dog back over to the aisle seat again, then held it 
in the aisle seat while he sat down in the window seat.  the dog 
immediately tried to climb into his lap.  he pushed it away and directed
 it to "stay".  the dog sat there, leaning closer to him, trying to look out the window, and then
started a very low plaintive whining. 

at this point i started laughing -
 out loud, i just could not help myself.  the guy turned my direction 
and asked what was so funny?  i told him  "i'm just watching a blind man
 and his dog fighting over the window seat in an airplane."  he looked 
stunned for a moment, then laughed, changed seats with the dog and the 
two of us visited together all the way to amarillo. 

funny part was, it was evening and we flew over heavy cloud cover the whole way.  so there was nothing outside that window for the dog to watch, but it sat there in that window seat with its nose pressed against the window the entire flight.

more taxes!!!





once again the voters in ca have decided to fix our state's out of control spending by volunteering to pay higher taxes.

prop 30 passed 53.9% to 46.1%.  

yep, the voters in ca once again spun the cylinder, but the barrel to our heads and pulled the trigger.  did the gun go off?  we'll let you know...

recent headlines on the drudge report: afghan president wants u.s. troops out of villages...u.s. moves massacre soldier to kuwait; afghans furious...thousands protest, chant anti-american slogans...taliban suspends peace talks with u.s....obama fills out ncaa basketball bracket...  yep.  the country is in the very best of hands.  the war in afghanistan is going to hell in a handbasket.  the people we are protecting are protesting and killing our troops.  we are actually holding peace talks with the organization who attacked us on 9-11.  excuse me for a moment -we are holding peace talks with the freaking taliban??????????why are we not killing them every place and time that we find them????ok, i'm better now...no wait - i've got one more -if the taliban has ceased peace talks - why are we not killing them?????all of them!!!!!ok, lets try this again.but with all this - our president's main concern is his ncaa basketball bracket?he even mentioned his freaking bracket in a press conference that he had with david cameron. i'm sure glad that our commander in chief has his priorities straight.  maybe he'll spend the rest of the week golfing.  he seems to be a much more effective leader when he's golfing.

gun show or parking lot?





according to fox newssavannah, ga. – authorities say a u.s. man is recovering after accidentally shooting himself in the leg at a gun show.police say 26-year-old charles lake was leaving the georgia gun show sunday when he discharged a round into his leg while reloading his pistol.savannah-chatham police spokesman julian miller says lake bought the pistol at the gun show saturday and had returned sunday to buy another.police say he was reloading the pistol in the parking lot because loaded guns weren't allowed inside the gun show.the savannah morning news reports lake's injury was not considered life-threatening.would i have clicked on the link to their story if the headline had been"police: man accidentally shoots self in parking lot"?probably not....but then most folks probably wouldn't. as a general rule the only news i listen to on tv is fox news. but occasionally something like this pops up and reminds me that even though they may not be as biased in their reporting as all the other news agencies, they are still a main stream media outlet, and you have to keep that in mind with everything they publish.

crickets in the media





why has not one word of this been spoken by the main stream media in this country?in mid october, at the end of his bus tour our president had this to say to the firefighters and emergency workers:"a fair shot for everybody; a fair share from everybody. that's the principle that built america."does that sound at all familiar?  maybe a little something like:"from each according to his ability; to each according to his needs."not only is our president quoting karl marx, but he is advocating marx's communist principles are what this country was built on.i don't know what is more disturbing - that this american hating, communist clown thinks that this country was built on the basic tenets of communism.  or that he is stupid enough to think that we will all believe him when he spouts that drivel.  or that his handlers, his speech writers, his keepers are dumb enough to let him say something like that in public.or is it not stupidity, is it arrogance?  is it the arrogance to believe that you can do whatever you want and say whatever you want, because you know that there is nothing that can be done to stop you?  because if he is thinking that way, what does he know about the upcoming elections that we do not know?
