we are returning!

we were here, but one day i fell from a ladder. while i was in a coma, the url genealogyforum.com did not get renewed in time and we disappeared.

now i have recovered and we are returning, similar, yet different. the forum once had over 100 volunteers, but now it's just me.

please have patience and check back often as i rebuild what once was here.
