st margaret's school for girls
"this is, we think, an outstanding school." the good schools guide



pupils meet her majesty queen camilla, january 2024

from the first day of nursery at st margaret’s, we nurture the communication skills, resilience, self-confidence and global outlook necessary for our pupils to thrive in an ever-changing world. as the only girls’ school in aberdeen – catering for around 370 girls from age 3-18 – we understand girls: how they learn, play and develop. and our bright and well-equipped campus, located in the city centre, meets all the requirements of a modern 21st century education.

if you have any questions or require further information, please get in touch with us and we would be happy to help: contact us
