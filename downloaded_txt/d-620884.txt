					the sisters of saint joseph of the sacred heart acknowledge aboriginal and torres strait islander peoples as the traditional custodians who have sovereignty of the lands and waters where we live and work. 
we respect their historical and continuing spiritual connections to country and community and pay our respects to their elders past, present, and emerging. we commit ourselves to the ongoing journey of reconciliation.
