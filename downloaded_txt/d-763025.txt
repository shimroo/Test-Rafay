the len's cove marina assurance plan 



people often try to sell you the right priced boat, or the right looking boat (essentially the “right now” boat)! at len’s cove we take a longer term view, and dig deeper by asking more questions. we work with you to identify a boat that is right for the most important person…you! if we don’t get it right, or your needs change drastically, you are protected.
