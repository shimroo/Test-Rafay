	 interview
	 
    


via obewaankobe on jacks site.interview"what happened with the radio show you used to have in la?i did that for about a year, and i won’t even mention the name of the station. i got to play whatever i wanted. but when i started getting ratings, the geniuses at the station started formatting the show, and i just couldn’t do it anymore. i’d do it again, but there’s nowhere in radio that would let me. i mean, i was playing housemartins into devo and that’s not how it works in real radio.

	 all things change.
	 
    


1 year later...michael steele is gone as program director. most of the speciality shows either moved to the weekend or just disappeared ( the red zone ??? ). rollins had resigned at one point when they tried to move his show.new breakfast show, mostly standard rotation music .one of the main early commenters here and who vented a lot about the removal of dicky passed away a few weeks ago. bye , gidge.

	 dicky on 97.1
	 
    


dicky was on adam carollas show this morning.not much mention of old show except for when super dave was on the phone.link to blog write up ( 8.40 am )link to mp3 ( some fm noise and i left the 6 minute advertising block in :-) )[ a commenter noted someone asked about this whole thing when rollins was on stern;here is what i found;according to the amazing resource;http://www.marksfriggin.com/news06/4-17.htm#thuhenry rollins visits. 04/20/06. 8:40am"another caller asked henry about this guy dicky barrett getting fired from the station he works at. henry doesn't know what happened there but dicky told him to carry on while other people have told him he should quit. he doesn't want to quit because he really enjoys the job. he has fun doing his 2 hour show every tuesday night."  ]

la times april 11 2006 trying to corral stern's lost herdi wonder who just got rid of a morning show host who fitted this as well ?"morning talk radio tends to be dominated by conservatives, but stern's audience tends to be centrist to liberal in political orientation, for which npr is a better fit, analysts say. and both shows emphasize lifestyle, quirky or offbeat takes on the news and appeal to baby boomers, they say."if you love bluegrass, you're not supposed to love metallica, but you do," said alex demers, head of a media consulting firm near philadelphia. "there's more than a surface connection between howard and npr. as much as howard is put down as being all about dirt and sex, it's also intelligent talk, and he's funny."

	 notes
	 
    


there is a statement from shepard fairey over on that blogging.la link below.it does not make sense to me in terms of the mms time extensions; removing the jonesy replay; never updating the mms graphics to show the new start time; the replica format of the current show; the lies around dolores o'riordan "co-hosting" ; etc.i will write up my thoughts more later but the statement just sounds wrong to me.[ edited  2.10 pm : there was more here but not about the mms. i moved that  to my other blogs where it was more appropriate . back later. ]

	 guest hosts
	 
    


i think the guest hosts are getting away with more to try and show some "indie" cred.if they were on multiple days in a row and did this it would end. link[ after posting this i listened for half and hour. i got a 10 minute advert for the hosts book and clothes line. same heavily rotated songs and some from the station computer that probably sound brand new if you recently started listening to indie . that postings author is hearing something different than me. 9.38am ]how about this; one of the guest djs phones up the same radio host in south dakota that dicky spoke to and get an update and let them know what happened to dicky .lets see if that would be allowed to happen.i am interested to see if rollins mentions any of this tonight ? its his first live show since this all happened. ( missed linking to this before. )

	 pants on fire
	 
    


remember the hype for dolores o'riordan hosting the show from dublin. all lies. a cranberries news site"update: a source close to dolores tells zombieguide that indie 103 originally planned to have a phone interview with dolores (not an in-person appearance) for their st. patrick's day show. however, since the show planned to broadcast remotely from dublin, they realized shortly after scheduling that they would not have the proper equipment to relay a phone call on air. dolores was never scheduled to appear in person.therefore, the phone interview was cancelled shortly after it was scheduled, yet the show's hosts mistakenly continued to report that she would indeed appear. the hosts' later excuse that dolores was "stuck in traffic," according to the source, was completely false. "to quote;"lie lie lie lie liar you lielie lie lie lie lie tell me whytell me why why d’you have to lie"

	 alternative != amateurism
	 
    


amidst all of this, the saddest things is that the people in control in indie appear to think that independent , alternative music means sloppy, crappy amateurism.listening to cretins like tk pretend to stumble over adverts ( you know dumbass either man up and say the swear word or edit it out completely ) you realise they hated the audience they had that made them noticed. tk is the epitome of the people they want. pretend punks thinking they are, what they are not. the station was called "cool" because of the authentic music; clash/pixies/ramones/adolescents/crowd/husker du etc. they played, not the kroq/kiis-lite that is now on heavy rotation. any band that aspires to indie 103.1 is a pale,pathetic under-achiever trying to claim credibility from the bands that got the station notice.  losers !( n.b. i had the largest number of pageviews yesterday and lavoice.org is seeing the same )

	 me thinks they doth protest too much.
	 
    


when you start a show late and have to explain to listeners which vast corporate network owns a station there may be some problems. nice of dave to say they would be screening calls though.
