 explore majors and emphases 






anthropology minor
because we study all aspects of humans, anthropology is holistic and inter-disciplinary and
                                       anthropologists work hand-in-hand with other sciences such as biology, physiology,
                                       sociology and psychology—just to name a few.
 
integrative human biology minor (ihb)
engage in research in human form and function, human evolution and biological variation,
                                       human behavior, and the roles humans play in local and global ecosystems. students
                                       will acquire the broad but rigorous background they will need as professionals in
                                       the 21st-century health sciences and many other fields that engage directly with aspects
                                       of human adaptation and welfare.
