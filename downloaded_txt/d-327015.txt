                "this year's award goes to a company that's best known for doing something that is, on the face of it, ordinary: providing package holidays to greece. lots of companies do this. few will take you to tiny unknown towns, you invariably fall in love with, to stay in small family-run hotels. few strive so hard to put you among the locals, rather than in the poshest hotel, away from the action. it's a travel buzzword, but this company pulls it off: its holidays are 'authentic', without the hairshirt - or the price tags - that often involves. now the company has an ever-growing list of destinations, but the med is its home turf, and we hope it will continue to combine innovation with authenticity there for another 47 years."
                - stephen bleach, travel editor
