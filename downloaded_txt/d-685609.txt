shaver lake village hotel

the shaver lake village hotel is located in the village of shaver lake, california about 50 miles east of fresno. we are nestled in the spectacular sierra national forest at an elevation of 5,370 feet in the clean mountain
air. the mountains in the summer offer mild temperatures and winter provides excellent skiing conditions at china peak ski resort.


the shaver lake village hotel is an ideal jumping off point for recreational activities. summertime activities include fishing, boating, jet skiing, hunting, hiking, rock climbing, biking, four-wheel driving, horseback
riding, water skiing, exploring and camping. wintertime offers skiing, snowboarding, cross country skiing, snowmobiling and just playing in the snow! our lake contains nearly 2,100 surface acres of water surrounded by 15
miles of granite covered shoreline. we are also the entrance to six major mountain lakes including huntington, florence, wishon, courtright, edison and of course our favorite, shaver lake.
