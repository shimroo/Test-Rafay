what our dance families say about us:




i was blown away by all the crafts they did during their camp, their routines & all the fun they all obviously had, and we will definitely be back.

- jacklyn g. 




my three year old toddler takes tap, jazz, and ballet. it is the cutest thing in the world, it absolutely melts my heart to see her dance. our whole experience from a to z has been amazing.

- thomas d. 




my daughter has had a great experience since she started coming to dance attack. the teachers here are great!

alyssa m. 




i couldn't ask for a better place for my daughters to spend their time dancing, and growing as young women. i believe they get the best technical training possible.

- paula r. 




the instructors are great at making the classes fun, and enjoyable for all of the students. my daughters have been coming here for a few years now, and they love it! 

- celeste s.




my children have been enrolled in combo classes at dance attack for a few years. they love the tap, jazz, and ballet, and show me what they learn after every class. they have so much fun with it! 

- sara j.




great studio that cares about technical dance and not memorizing a dance. happy we made the change!

- eleni k.




my daughter has been fortunate to dance here since the age of 3 for over 14 yrs. so grateful to all of the teachers who have shared their art and supported her over the years at her second home.

- nira s.




my daughter has grown up with this studio. she found her love for dancing here due to the caring teachers and staff. she has met many close dance friends that inspire and encourage her to do her best.
