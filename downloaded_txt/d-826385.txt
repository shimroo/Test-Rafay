oscoda michigan
 s interesting name comes from the indian words, ossin and muscoda, which means pebbly prairie. oscoda is a small town located at the mouth of the au sable river on the shore of lake huron in the northeastern region of michigan, easily reached via u.s. highway 23. once the home of the wurtsmith air force base from 1923 to 1993, the 2000 census reported the towns population to be only 992. although small, oscoda is one of the countrys premier locations for fishing, hunting, swimming, canoeing, boating and tubing, due to its close proximity to the mighty au sable river and beautiful lake huron. it was originally settled in the late 1860s and played a key role in the lumber industry as a major distribution point for shipping lumber on the great lakes. today, the towns main industry is tourism. oscoda has everything from fishing to birdwatching and everything in between- almost any type of outdoor sport imaginable is available in the area. more than 35,000 acres of woodland trails are here for hikers, backpackers and cross-country skiers, and the lake offers a beautiful sandy beach for swimming. over 1,000 feet of lake huron shoreline is located in downtown oscoda beach park, and more than twenty miles of pristine, sandy beach can be found along the lake shoreline altogether. oscoda beach park is located just east of u.s. 23, offering a multitude of recreational options for residents and visitors. a lighted boardwalk, which runs alongside the shore, is perfect for an evening stroll, and grills and tables are available for picnics. the chamber of commerce hosts regular community concerts at a newly completed band shell, and a large playground, open-air pavilion and paved parking are also features of the park. 

oscodas downtown area has a great selection of shops and restaurants, and lodging is plentiful and varies from hotels, lakeside resorts, cabins, cottages and campgrounds. along with the many outdoor activities available in the area, oscoda also offers a variety of other pursuits. the ausable-oscoda historical society sponsors a history museum in downtown oscoda, and the wurtsmith division of the yankee air force, based in two hangars at the former wurtsmith afb, has a museum and hosts special events and fly-ins. the gagaguwon powwow celebrates this areas first inhabitants with traditional native american dancing, food and authentic arts & crafts. other cultural and visual arts include the shoreline players theater group, the sweet adelines barbershop chorale and the northeast dance and movement dance studio. oscoda, where the mighty au sable meets beautiful lake huron, is a four-season vacation region  not just in summer. nearly 100 miles of groomed trails are available in the area for skiing in winter and the breathtaking colors of autumn draw visitors from all over in the fall. visitors fall in love with the peace and serenity of northern michigan  a welcome change of pace in an unspoiled part of the country many have yet to discover.
