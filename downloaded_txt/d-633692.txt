cincinnati friends meeting is a semi-programmed quaker meeting, which means that we have a pastor who gives a brief message at the beginning of the service. the rest of the hour together is spent in silent, open worship as we listen to what the still, small voice of god might say to us. sometimes others might speak out of the silence, or request a hymn. through such shared ministry we grow together in spirit and in community.
we are an open and affirming congregation, and a solidarity congregation in relationship with the sanctuary movement. by tradition we are christian, but we recognize that the world is interdependent, composed of many cultures and faith traditions. we seek to grow together spiritually and learn from one another in peace. respecting our differences, we seek a more compassionate and loving world. we welcome everyone interested in our way of worship and the quaker testimonies: simplicity, peace, integrity, community, and equality.
