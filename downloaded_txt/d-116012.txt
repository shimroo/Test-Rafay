what is a conference? 
any business has to develop. when it is necessary to solve problems, exchange opinions, hear different points of view, coordinate the work of branches, departments and employees of the company, develop the most optimal course of development, get new suggestions and stock up on ideas, visionary executives hold large meetings in the conference hall.
conference – a meeting, a meeting of groups, individuals, organizations to discuss certain topics.
however, the conference is a tool not only for business. it is also a tool for scientists (scientific conference), the media (press conference), officials (round tables to discuss problems), and any people who want to solve problems collectively and share experiences – for example, a conference of tenants of the area on the improvement of the territory.
