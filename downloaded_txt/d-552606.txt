just a little report on our 2 day stay at black bear lodge. the lodge was just great, clean and real homey with the great food.   guides cj and rial; rial….. know’s how to make you relax and enjoy the float, coaches very well and was a delight to be around.  he makes the extra effort to make things happen, not afraid to change fly’s when it’s slow.   i have been fly fishing with guides since the early 70’s…i gage him to be one of the best.  we like guides that are not lazy and have great idea’s on how to catch fish.  i brought my son and son in law for their first fly fishing experience with a guide. they can’t wait to go back.  looking forward to next year, thanks to your staff…. you told me that these fish were strong and big like in the photo’s you sent to me… so true, some of the best looking trout that i have ever caught for sure.  thanks again, see you next year. best,

jack,
it can’t be any better.  the sun was out, some big yakima trout were willing to play, and keith worked hard to find them. another great day with evening hatch guide service and their fine personnel.

“jack mitchell – the evening hatch built the steelhead ranch on a plateau above the valley of washington’s klickitat river. the beautiful home is both lodge and the centerpiece in a complex of new buildings for clients and guides. unique among non-wilderness lodges, the superb guides are on site 24/7. and they find steelhead; angler success is astonishingly high. accommodations can be brochure boilerplate, but here fly fishermen live large with new friends. i don’t know of another steelhead river served so well. see you there!”

“the “meriwether lewis” of washington state. nobody has put in more time searching and developing opportunities for fly-fishermen in washington than jack. from the steelhead of the klickitat and the olympic peninsula, to the trout of the yakima and upper columbia, jack knows about it. his operation is top-notch and remember “trust your guide”

thanks, jack.  we greatly enjoyed this year’s trip to the steelhead ranch.  your guides were uniformly terrific!  the fish were participating. the food was great, and the ranch is always a comfortable place to rest up and unwind after a full day on the river. it was great to see you once again,  i wish that we could do it more frequently. i particularly enjoyed the opportunity for the guides to join us for dinner.  they are a great group, and we enjoyed swapping stories and jokes with them and picking their brains for tips on how to improve our performance on the water. a great time was had by all.
