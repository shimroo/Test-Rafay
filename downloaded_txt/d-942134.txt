help - 2022 reunion photos wanted






01 nov 2022 8:03 am |
                david kenney (administrator)





memory book photos- we're looking for photos that can also be included in the memory book. our president is collecting as many as he can get to view and select for the book that the photographer is assembling for us. we'd like these asap to be able to get submissions into the photographer for publishing. 
if you attended our 2022 reunion in warwick and have some photos you wish to share with cva, we're interested in seeing them! 
to ensure those who are sharing are getting photo credit, anyone who wishes to share photos should contact me at seadog1975@gmail.com and let me know about how many photos you have. share as many or as few as you'd like.
please do not send photos via email!!!
email servers are limited in capacity and may not send large files - plus, i have to extract each one from the email which is very time consuming.
after i receive your email, i will set up a dropbox folder just for your photos. i will send you a link just for you to upload photos to a dedicated folder. it is a very simple process. once they are uploaded i'll confirm i have them. 
your photo will be tagged with your name for credit and we'll post them up on the 2022 reunion photo album on our website. 

cdr, usn-ret.
vice president - cva

new website look has arrived!






08 oct 2020 11:13 am |
                david kenney (administrator)





many may have already noticed the new look and feel of our website. we hope that you'll find it easier to navigate. some changes to note:
1) drop down menu is now on the right vice the left. just mouse over the elipsis (...) on the right of the top bar and the drop down will pop up.
2) color blocks and menus are cleaner and more in line with current website standards.
3) allows us a better support experience from our hosting company, wild apricot. 
4) new page header with hull number and a "navy steel" background motif. 
we'll continue to work page by page to make improvements along the way to the look/feel/style to make it more appealing and hopefully easier to find things. 
regards,
dj kenney
cva - vice president
