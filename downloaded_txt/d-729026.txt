alumni profiles
“i chose communication, culture & technology because i wanted to make sense of all my interests. i was a tinkerer who dabbled with code, had an affinity for brand strategy and loved to write. cct helped me turn my many interests into a focus and eventually a career.” ~ deron hogans, cct 2012

faculty profiles
“those who hire communication, culture & technology  grads know: in addition to technical skills, they have something even more valuable at the leadership level – a conceptual, ‘big picture’ understanding of the complex web of cultural, political, and economic relations in which our technologies are embedded.” ~ martin irvine, founding director and core faculty

mission statement
cct is an interdisciplinary master’s degree program devoted to the study and design of communication, media, and information technology in the full scope of their social, political, cultural, technical, and economic complexity. we promote a holistic, multidisciplinary analysis of communications and media systems, expanding the boundaries of theory, substantive knowledge, making, and practice. our curriculum prepares students to be critical thinkers, exemplary scholars, and content creators who apply their knowledge in meaningful ways to the problems and challenges of a world being shaped by the globalizing forces of computational and digital communication and information technologies and international media systems. 







“as one of the most innovative, interdisciplinary graduate programs in the world, we move beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries to explore complex problems that require innovative approaches and thoughtful reflection.” jeanine turner, cct director
