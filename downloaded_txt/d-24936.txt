“we are living in an interminable succession of absurdities imposed by the myopic logic of short-term thinking.”—jacques-yves cousteau














scott supak loves prediction markets













prediction markets are pretty good at predicting.
predicting things like elections, current events, or climate change can help corporations, ngos, and governments prepare for the inevitabilities our choices bring.  find out more about scott’s involvement in prediction markets on the about us page.scott is active at predictit.org and at a new prediction market with a $25,000 per contract limit (instead of the $850/contract at pi): kalshi. 















willful ignorance is the most powerful force in the universe.
when people let their biases cloud their judgment, they are far too often never held to account for the results of their bad judgment. prediction markets will pay you to make them smarter, but they will also charge you if they make you smarter. whether you actually do get smarter after your loss is up to you.















learn before you leap.
as you should with anything new that involves risking your hard-earned money, start small, learn as much as you can about what it is you’re investing in, learn the tricks others will use to separate you from your money, and get better slowly over time. keep an open mind and don’t be afraid to try new things! for example, i learned that i can invest in rental real estate through lofty, with a minimum investment of only $50. earn a $25 lofty gift certificate when you invest in your first property and hold all tokens purchased for 90 days.
