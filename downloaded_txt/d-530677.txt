as this is a managed environment, you will occasionally be aware of essential maintenance – another element of the gardens’ soundscape. please respect the quiet time of other visitors.

				camp dartington			

if you’re looking for a more affordable accommodation option at dartington…does camping on a medieval estate with uninterrupted views of haytor sound tempting?

at camp dartington we have this and more. stay on our heritage site and enjoy our super chilled campsite, a calendar of exciting cultural events, our grade 2* listed gardens, our 14thc  barn cinema and loads of great places to eat and drink.

				schumacher college student membership

				changes to parking charges			

please be aware that from the 1st of may, we will be increasing our parking charges and changing our parking system to number plate recognition.
we have taken the difficult decision to raise parking charges, as part of a range of initiatives designed to raise revenue, investment and donations to dartington. as you know, being a charity, we offer a lot here for free – not least access to the beautiful woods and gardens. a small increase in parking fees helps us keep the estate open to all and contributes to funding our wide array of projects.
from the 1st may, the new parking charges will be:

1 hour – £1.00 (free at the shops at dartington)
2 hours – £2.00
3 hours – £2.50
4 hours – £3.50
all day – £6.00

they will continue to apply only from 9am-6pm. if you visit here regularly, there is the option to become a dartington member and buy an annual parking permit. find out more here (from 1 may).
