perspective, the journal, started out in the early 90’s as a newsletter circulating between six or eight friends, designed to share resources for bible teaching.about perspective

historythe journal grew to 300+ subscribers scattered around australia and the world. but the people who made perspective the journal happen, were also all in demanding ministry roles, and meeting the deadlines became harder and harder.in 2006, perspective became a simple resource archive.the old perspective resources are maintained here – many of them are still exceptionally helpful! – alongside some newer content.
