									i can't credit the college staff in creative arts and the platform theatre enough. they've pushed me and it's really helped me to specialise in what i'm now doing. it's been amazing, everyone's really nice. it's just a great place to be.

									it was hard  getting back into academic writing but all the support was there. i found the bitesize nature of the course, and the length of the sessions, meant that it was all achievable. it was manageable to fit around work and life schedules.
