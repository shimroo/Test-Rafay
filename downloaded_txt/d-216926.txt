about us
welcome to pantheon theatre (the pantheon club glasgow), a critically acclaimed musical theatre company based in glasgow, scotland. pantheon have been entertaining audiences for over 90 years and have become one of the uk’s foremost amateur theatre companies.
born in a glasgow coffee house in 1926, pantheon was established by 5 young men to embrace the arts of theatre, singing and drama. now, almost 100 years later, pantheon has built a reputation as the leading theatre company in glasgow, having performed almost 400 musicals, plays and pantomimes.
pantheon has seen many of its performers go on to professional careers including; sabrina carter (elpheba understudy, wicked & nancy, oliver), andrew keay (warhorse, london & international tour) and connor going (chuck, footloose) to name a few.  with a membership of almost 100 and regular auditions for new talented people, we hope pantheon will continue to be a prominent feature on the glasgow stage for many years to come.
