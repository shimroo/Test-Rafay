the transportation
                             
                            the most critical step of the process is the transportation of the grains from the fields to the factories. as rice has a lot of water in it, more than 16%, transportation is carefully looked after to keep the grains safe from weather and make sure the water content remains intact.
each grain is carefully held in woven bags and covered with protective tarps during transportation, keeping it safe against any harm along the way.



careful handling & distribution
transportation post packaging is as crucial as it is during the processing stage. we ensure the rice after it has been packed is carefully transported and distributed so that its integrity is maintained throughout the supply chain and our hard work doesn’t go in vain.
we use efficient logistics solutions and temperature-controlled storage facilities to keep the rice safe and preserve its quality during transit. our big network makes sure it gets to shops and buyers fast and timely, making sure you can always find our premium rice when you want it, irrespective of whether you want to buy basmati rice online or offline.

                        the nurturing
after harvesting, our rice is further processed at highly advanced and fully automated facilities all over india. we handle each grain with great care, making it with a 'cleanroom concept'. we pick and grade it carefully to ensure flawless quality across our product lines. this way, you get perfect rice every time, as if a mom made it with love.
at the heart of our process lies the art of ageing rice to perfection. we house rice in silos with a staggering capacity of 1.5 lakhs, the largest in india, ageing each grain for up to two years.  through our meticulous "sambhaalkar" technique, we nurture each grain exclusively for you. 
employing cutting-edge technology and top-notch machinery from japan and germany, we ensure each grain meets the highest standards, delivering the perfect basmati experience to your table. it's only after undergoing our rigorous ageing process for up to two years that the grains acquire their lustrous sheen, enticing aroma, and irresistible flavour. we spare no effort in curating only the finest for you.
every grain at the daawat factory undergoes several rigorous processes which are:


cleaning
it is done to remove dirt and unwanted bits. it uses top-notch machines and strict checks to keep the rice clean, keeping its natural taste and good nutrients. cutting-edge machinery and strict quality control checks are employed to keep the rice clean, keeping its natural taste and nutritional value. this makes sure each grain is perfect and of the highest quality.
ageing
in this process, rice is carefully aged to perfection, allowing the grains to grow and develop their signature taste, aroma, flavour, and texture. this process enhances the taste profile of the rice, offering a richer and more satisfying experience. the way each grain is precisely aged and cared for is reflective of our commitment to providing premium rice to our consumers.
dehusking
using expert methods, the outer shell of daawat basmati rice is gently removed to preserve the pristine inner grain. this process cleans out impurities but keeps the integrity of the rice kernel, making it ready to cook. this way, each grain stays perfect for the next steps in the kitchen.
grading
our rice undergoes a stringent grading process wherein each grain is carefully checked and evaluated for its size, shape, colour, and purity. this is done to ensure consistency and quality in every batch. this step-by-step check makes sure each pack is filled with only select rice, ensuring uniformity and consistency. from the field to your plate, we promise quality that you can taste in every bite.
