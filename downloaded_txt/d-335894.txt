if you’re considering liposuction to permanently remove areas of fat, recontour your body, and boost your self-esteem, our plastic + hand team has the most qualified liposuction surgeons in maine.
often, even with diet or exercise, your body can have unsightly bulges and fatty areas. this could be a matter of heredity, something that’s not in your control. if you’re concerned by diet-resistant fat deposits and are looking for a body contouring surgery that gives you the appearance that you want, liposuction is one of the most performed cosmetic surgery procedures today. as effective body sculpting, liposuction is most often applied to the belly, love handles, arms, neck, legs, and chin.
you’ll first discuss your liposuction options with your plastic + hand surgeon. during your initial consultation, your surgeon will evaluate your health, the condition of your skin, and the fatty deposits to be removed. your plastic + hand surgeon will then recommend the procedure that will offer the best results for your unique makeup.

after pregnancy or after weight loss, or even aging, you may need excess skin removal, want to tighten loose skin, or you may be looking for a body contouring surgery that gives you the appearance that you want.
the first step is to discuss your tummy tuck options with your plastic + hand surgeon. depending on the degree of change you’d like to see, your tummy tuck procedure options might include a mini tummy tuck (partial abdominoplasty) or full tummy tuck (standard abdominoplasty). liposuction may also be recommended to improve the appearance of the flanks, love handles, or the central abdomen.
while there are many reasons to seek tummy tuck procedures (notably achieving a flat abdomen and regaining your self-confidence), our leading abdominoplasty surgeons in portland, maine, will work with you on realistic expectations prior to the surgery.

whether you feel that your nose is too short, too long, too wide, too narrow, off-center, bumpy, or twisted, a reshaped nose can be highly effective in changing your appearance.
most healthy people who are dissatisfied with either the appearance or function of their noses are candidates for nose surgery. typically, rhinoplasty procedures can be performed following the completion of nasal development, usually after 15-16 years of age.
while there are many reasons to seek nose surgery (whether you’re unhappy with the nose you inherited, or an injury has changed its appearance), our leading rhinoplasty surgeons in portland, maine, will work closely with you to discuss your medical history, and your nose surgery expectations, and set a realistic goal for your rhinoplasty outcome using advanced computer-generated imagery.
