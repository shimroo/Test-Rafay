toledo symphony orchestra








a toledo organization since 1943 welcome to the toledo symphony orchestra the toledo symphony orchestra is a community-supported organization of professional musicians and teachers who deliver quality performance and music education for all. formed in 1943 as the friends of music and incorporated in 1951 as the toledo orchestra association, inc., the toledo symphony orchestra (tso) has grown from a core group of twenty-two part-time musicians to a regional orchestra that employs sixty-nine professional musicians who consider the toledo symphony their primary employer, as well as numerous extra players annually as repertoire demands. 
the toledo symphony reaches more than 260,000 individuals annually through performances and education programs. the series concerts (masterworks, pops, chamber, and family series) are the critical underpinning of the orchestra’s artistic mission and regularly draw people from 135 postal zip codes. education programs, student performances, and community concerts are held in schools, neighborhood churches, performing arts centers, and community facilities throughout the region; many are offered at no charge or provided at a reduced fee to help expand participation.
