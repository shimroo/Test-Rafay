multi award winning accommodation

multi award winning! with its unique contemporary eco-friendly design and quiet rural location not too far from padstow, old barn tregonetha is a true luxury self-catering gem. the vaulted ceiling of the first floor sitting room creates a large open space for accomplished pianists to play the regularly tuned quality piano. during summer months open the south facing balcony door to welcome in the all-day sunshine and enjoy the peaceful wildlife in the mature well-kept garden. old barn tregonetha has everything you need including a modern kitchen including state of the art electric aga and separate utility room. we also have ev chargers installed so you can remain ‘fully charged’ throughout your stay! we are an independent property and not part of a complex.

every once in a while you experience something special and the property is just that. the fresh flowers, cake, fruit and hamper, along with the traditional stone and timber features which blend perfectly with the solid oak timber fixtures and fittings throughout the property. it´s ultra modern and bang on trend with no expense spared. well done stephen and thanks for a wonderful stay. 
a happy guest

 
 


thank you for letting us stay in your gorgeous home, we will be sad to go home! it’s been wonderful exploring the area and then sitting by the wood burner with a glass of wine in the evening, perfect! 
a happy guest

a happy guest

 
 


the property was outstanding. the owner stephen was on hand if any problems arose (but there wasn´t any!). the old barn was in a great location especially for those wanting to relax with peace and quiet.
from booking to the holiday itself and upon our return; the service we have received has been outstanding 
a happy guest

 
 
 
 
 



staying green!
sustainability & accessibility
we have 2 electric vehicle chargers available to our guests; 1 dedicated tesla and a 2nd for all type 2 electric vehicles. we try and remain as sustainable as possible where we can including our laundry utilities.
old barn tregonetha being some 250 years old is not obviously accessible to all, however, we have made a main ground floor access which is level and wide enough for wheelchair access. our policy is to be open and welcoming to all, matched with a high level of support and customer service.
