presentation folders make a good first impression, whether you are presenting a key to a room or the features of a new home. pockets let you include additional information.







large quantities of color masters may be printed on our traditional presses, then imprinted with personalized information on our digital presses.







economical and efficient, saddle-stitched binding works great for magazines, catalogs, newsletters and other publications with fewer pages.







colorful printed, die-cut and glued boxes help sell retail products. start with a die line that fits.







when you have more pages than can be saddle-stitched, or you prefer the look and feel of a perfectly flat, glued spine...






smaller displays may be printed directly onto cardboard, up to 24 pt. litho labels may be glued to corrugated board for full-color larger displays.







maps, product posters, listings... sometimes you need to go big. prographics can print sheets up to 40", then fold to fit a required size or standard envelope.







wire-o binding allows books to lay flat when opened to any page. perfect for calendars, cookbooks, workbooks and reference materials.






special events deserve special treatment. put your invitation in a matching printed envelope, and make it impossible to resist opening.







when you want to make an impression, consider pop-ups, embossing, metallic foil, spot uv, specialty substrates, and more. the sky's the limit.







shingled, die cut, drilled and packaged for you to slip into a loose-leaf binder, tabs are an essential tool for organizing information with impact. 






choose prographics to be your go-to source for all your business printing. we can maintain and update as necessary to help your business run efficiently.
