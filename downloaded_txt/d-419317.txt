	 my new lease of life
	 
    


the last entry that i had updated was in august. after a good 4 months, it seems that i should start blogging more frequently. i always told myself so… oh well…. it was really interesting to look back at what i had done and to realize that i had indeed achieved some small success. for one, i finally got someone who loves me so much to be mine for the rest of my life. yes, he proposed and we are officially married in the eyes of law. he actually proposed in feb. it was on our anniversary. i was totally unaware, talk about dimwitted… i had reservation of whether i could be a good wife, will our love stay strong for the remaining (i dunno, 80 years?) years of our lives and what would our home be like etc. yet as usual, the very good commonsensical guy spoke with conviction that he made his decision because he could believes he could love and take care of me for the rest of my life and let him worry about all the real stuff. well, who won’t say “no” to such offer? i took up his proposal and we registered our marriage on 13 september, 2008. the day just swept pass so quickly that i thought we would like the day never to end (despite being really tiring to look pretty). the luncheon was held at royal china at raffles hotel. only our immediate family members and our closest friends were invited. it was our day and we wanted only the most intimate gathering for family n friends to witness our never-ending love.   our very short and quirky vows nothing beats a big hug from my closest friendthank you for all those who came and i was deeply touched when andy and kevin called me from la and atlanta respectively. guys, you have no idea how happy i was to hear your voice to give us your blessings. i almost tear a little tear! just a tiny tear… haha.

	 simple pleasures
	 
    


within a short period of time, there seemed to have lots of changes in my life and those who are around me. well, all i could say that the changes are actually pretty good. friends are moving out of singapore to live in america and to work. life would really never gonna be the same without them. the parties will never be the same as before, our gatherings would seem to be less fun and most importatnly, i am starting to miss them.i guess, when we grow older, worked longer and gotten use to the mundane life's routine, we would somehow envy those who led a carefree life... or rather a life that seem less bounded, something remotely more exciting... so here i go again just to lament that i didn't choose to stay in my previous previous job which i would probably be travelling every few weeks... or maybe i should cheer that i had bravely took a step to venture into the unknown and worked hard to get to where i am. i am not that far off anyway right? * a pat on my own shoulders* i travel too for work, i learn new things all the time and importantly, i get to stay under the covers of my hello kitty covers everynight, ahhhh that's a pleasureable nightly ritual!simple pleasures to perk myself up is important, for the lack of it will really drive me crazy. like what i just said, i think the simplest of pleasure to me now is to crawl under hello kitty and nest my head... enuff said... "cheerios"

i am a lazy lass and cannot commit to writing too frequently if you ask for my geniune opinion of myself. ha.. yes, i promised that i will be writing more but sometimes there's this writer's block... i'm sure you know what i mean... it's simply means sharon is lazy!oh well, heck, i write for my own pleasure and is not meant to be scrutinised right? anyway, i will try to continue writing the drips and drapes i can remember of my trip. i still got to write about the 1 and only american family that i have visited, anaheim disneyland and last stop in hong kong.yes, i will finish the story that i have left dangling for the last 5 months... boy, it's that long already?!

	 day 15 - 3 places in 1 day
	 
    


mar 25, 2007 – we missed the sunnyvale’s farmer market last week and we are determined not to miss it this time round. the usual roads were blocked so that it can be path with small stores. oh, how i love such make shift markets, it’s always full of live and the products that are on display are so fresh!  sunnyvale farmer's market starts business from 8.00am - 1pm every saturdayfresh red strawberries anyone? fresh flowers. a sure sign of spring. business is brisk!the next stop is to visit san jose's flea market. it is the biggest flea market in town. you wouldn't believe me if i were to tell you that the sheer size of the car park is already bigger than suntec city. but that is true! the flea market is very much like our singapore's version of pasar malam, very cheap deals. i observed that most of the buyers and sellers are mexicans and there's also a handful of chinese. this is really interesting as the different culture's product blends in so well with one another, this place reminds me a bit of xiang yang shi chang, in shanghai. very vibrant and full of nick nacks.the entrancein order to accommodate huge crowd, the walk way is huge!they even sell second-hand cars here. the merc from 2002 cost only usd21,000 thereabout. i bet you can't get a decent car in singapore with this amount.liqing with his rodeo hat! i think he looks nice.a very interesting fruit named chirimoya. a mexican delicacy maybe.after shopping around in the flea market, we proceed to santa cruz. this is suppose to be a beach area and is popular among the locals. the sun, sand and sea seems inviting to tropical islanders like us.brrrr.... we are kinda wrong. this is the first time in my life that i visit a beach wearing thick clothings! haha... and there aren't that many bikini clad babes too, they are all gear in their sweaters and track pants too.the pathway with restaurants lining on the sidefresh lobsters and crabs! look, they are really big starfish glued to the pillar of the bridge. trivia: do you know that starfish has no brains?a seagull taking a nap ducks waddling in the sea. they all travel in the same direction, as if they observe traffic rules!sailing, a leisure past-time. it reminds my old days when i sail on a laser 420santa cruz's amusement parkit's so cold that beach goers are all wearing track pants and sweaters while playing beach volley ball. how weird to us right?i finally get my first taste of caramel candied apple!

	 day 14 - dinner
	 
    


mar 24, 2007 – i stayed home as i am worried about spending too much money. it’s a nice day to begin as i have invited chris and his colleagues back for dinner tonight.the menu of the day: cheesy rugout spaghetti, beef pot roast and blanched vegetables with cajun chicken on the side.cooking dinner seems to take quite a bit of my time. really, i love to cook stews as they are so easy to do and it’s tasty too.take a look at my creation!   liqing is lactose intolerant, so he couldn't stomach the cheesy spaghetti too well... i didn't know as he eats chocolates and ice cream, hence it never ocur to me that he might be lactose intolerant.  so good host must always find out the dietary preference of your guests. else, no matter how great tasting the food is, the guest can't really appreciate it.

	 day 13 - san francisco alone
	 
    


mar 22, 2007 – an exciting day. i am off to san francisco alone today! yea, i left home at 8.30am to take the train from sunnyvale so that i can reach sf by 10:02am as stated in the schedule of caltrain.the train came at 9:56am on the dot (hmmm… not bad this time). they have a tendency to be late and occasionally early.do you know that i seem to attract the train conductors all the time? the train conductor seemed to be checking whenever i board a train or light rail. such coincidence, luckily i am a law abiding freak. the conductor ain’t going to have a chance to fine me! btw, the fine is usd$250! yikes… it’s always better to be safe than sorry.my first stop in sf, macy’s on o’farrell st. it’s about 10:30am, i was greeted with smiles and the shop assistants were all bright and chirpy. always ready to take the day and make you feel good. this is something we really don’t see in singapore.anyway, i went to the visitor centre on the 6th level to get the international visitor pass so that i can get 11% discount on all items except fragrance and make-up. this is great because, it is valid even if the item was on discount.this macy’s is really quite big, it span over 6 levels and it’s dedicated to women only. the men’s department takes on another building opposite. so cool right?!i left macy’s without purchasing anything. i walked down geary st, to take a photograph of union square.   union square, there's people siting on the stairs to be in the sun and to enjoy their lunchi was kind of hungry and boy, i am so glad that i made peanut butter sandwich, it saves me money and time to look for an eatery. time is racing, and i haven’t scored anything yet!forever 21, located near the powell st station (for cable cars) is the flagship store i believe. it has 3 levels and each level is bigger than the store in wisma. you can imagine my excitement. the clothes here are not as pricy as compared to singapore. i figured each piece is about a good 20-30% cheaper. the all time favourite t-shirt cost about sgd$13 in singapore and, the colours and sizes are always limited. here, it cost usd9.99 for two pieces (before tax), that’s about sgd8.50.this trip to forever 21 is great, i bought 3 lovely blouse and 2 t-shirts. when i was at the cashier, one of the t-shirt that i grab was not on sale, the cashier was so kind to tell me that if i should be taking 2 for usd9.99 t-shirt, i should be picking those with the tag says “key”. so anyway, she said she will help me to get grab the right t-shirt. all i had to do was to wait for her while she dashed up to the 2nd level and to dig that t-shirt for me. i was impressed! superb service rendered! i am sure that if this were to take place in singapore, i just have to go grab the t-shirt myself (dig into the pile) and to re-queue to pay. sigh.next shop, h & m. i bought a blouse and a skirt. not fanciful but its very prim and proper clothes for the office. i mean, i have to grow up a bit now that i am 27 in a few months. i can’t try to be a teeny booper all the time. not that i dress poorly, but there was once i met my uni classmate on the mrt. he said that he couldn’t recognize me for a moment as i look so ol (office lady/girl). look so different in school and during those gatherings. that was a bit of a wake up call. i mean, i don’t want to be an ol! i am doing a lot for my company and i co-ordinate from the small to the big things in the office. i plan the advertising campaigns, do the press release, make sure all the brands are done properly etc, how can i just be an ol?!! so i mean, i have to look the look if i want to be taken seriously like a career woman right?! it doesn’t help that my bosses calls me “ah girl” so affectionately, but sometimes, you don’t want to be an ‘ah girl’ or ol. i am supposedly due for appraisal when i go back to the office. so, if i could get a promotion, my effort to change my wardrobe to be more sophisticated, will it command more respect?!time passed so quickly that it’s already 5ish when i am done doing the rounds on ellis st. i don’t know why but i headed back to macy’s. i walked into the fragrance department and a fagot attended to me. he was really nice and spoke with an italian accent. he really knows his products. he could rattle on the ingredients used in each perfume that he tested on me. he even try to find out my personality so that he could better pair me up with the right fragrance. this is what i call service! i was smitten… no not by him, it’s euphoria by calvin klein. that’s my final choice.sonia, the assistant who helped me through the whole purchase transaction is worth all the mention as well. she asked if i’ve got the macy’s card as it would save me 15%. that’s about usd18. this card is even better than the international card for visitors as the discount is better and it is also valid for fragrance and cosmetics! she quickly proceeds to apply the card and is supposed to be approved on the spot.as i am an overseas visitor, the process to apply is a little more stringent and difficult. to apply, make sure you have your credit card (citibank, chase or any of the world renowned banks), passport, driving license or id and a valid us telephone number will ensure your application. this discount card works like a credit card, so make sure you will be able to receive the card before leaving usa, else someone else might just use it.i went home with a big grin. i am tired and hungry! i’ve shopped in san francisco for 9 hours… quite a feat! now, that is what i call taitaidom. eh… how come i can hear chris grunting at the background (my imagination!)?!

	 day 12 - toilet is one of the best place on earth
	 
    


mar 21, 2007 – i found myself waking up to go jogging in the bayland park. it was barely 12 degrees and i was clad in my adidas and a cardigan. nowadays, my green cardigan has been my best pal as it shields me from the wind. well, it barely helped but still it is better than not having anything to wear. i mean, i couldn’t be wearing my thick sweater while trying to jog right? it’s just weird.i jogged and found myself very alone in the park (again), i was kind of worried as my stomach felt queasy and needed the bathroom quite badly. yet, i couldn’t muster enough courage to go to the one in the park. what if there’s no toilet paper, there’s a pervert in the bathroom waiting for its prey or the bowl is full of s*** already?!! these perverse thoughts race through my puny brain as i jogged passed the toilet. decided that i will give it a miss, i quicken my pace in hope to reach back to the apartment at thunder speed.alright, it’s lucky that i hadn't crack in the pants. i mean, i almost did if i were to be 2 steps slower! it was the longest jog ever! the agony of finding a bathroom at high tide and at the most critically urgent of times. anyway, i am sure you too had seemly familiar situations before. hee…so i say, the toilet is really one of the best place on earth*! you can find peace and it sooth all your bowels away… hahaha* it will be, provided it is clean, has toilet paper and it smells good…

	 day 11 - palo alto
	 
    


mar 20, 2007 – today, i went out on my own. i took the caltrain from sunnyvale to paolo alto. palo alto is where stanford is. my intention there today is not to go to the bookstore though i would love to go, but to do some shopping. yea, it's a bit bimbo, i mean travelling for shopping... but i have been cooped up long enough and i just wanna go out a bit. shopping is free if you ain't buying nothin'. hahaha... the train ride took about 20mins. it is always thrilling for me to travel alone. it is like a mini adventure and from experiences; it makes you think about things. pensivei thought about what bargain i can get, i thought about what i will make for dinner and i most of the time i looked out of the window just to make sure i alight at the right stop and of cos thought about the way home. i am worried if i didn't get off on the right station, it would mean i will have to go the next station to wait for the next train. caltrain's frequency is not like mrt about 10 mins off peak hours. caltrain can go up to 30 mins! it is not as convenient in singapore especially this place is so huge. i can’t just cab home as and when i like either.  finally palo altoi stayed at stanford shopping centre for about 5hrs. the shoppping arcade is really beautiful with lots of lush greenery around but i didn't manage to get any photos as the shoppers must thing that i am crazy to do photography here. basically, stanford shopping centre is a plot of land where they build shopping centres. it has macy's, bloomingdale and many other small shops. as compared to great mall, the things here are all 30% higher. they do not have any discounts either. everything starts from $89.00 onwards. i must be crazy to buy.i saw this really pretty bag, i am tempted to buy, i made 2 calls to esther to made sure that i should buy it or not. i suppose my phone call had interupted her sleep but i didn't care ahaha... for once, i had to be selfish. it's a sgd$500 bag! i can't make a mistake here, can i?dear esther was so kind and patient to be so understanding of my impending crisis... we analysed and thought through the worth of the bag, its original price and the clothes that i can match it with etc. finally, the verdict - buy it if i have spare stash of cash (which i didn't) and i almost did just that. i went to macy's for the 10th time to put on the bag and look myself into the mirror. my reflection shows this marvellous bag and i look great! hahaha... then the image of chris appeared. he looks crossed and unhappy. shudder. oh well, i dump that bag and took the train ride home.after i went through all the trouble to look for it, i didn't buy. i am still hesitant about spending that sum of money.hey, how about you giving me your views about the worth of this bag. to buy or not to buy. tell me! coach patchwork shoulder tote

	 day 9 - day out in monterey, ca
	 
    


mar 18, 2007 – we went to monterey. it’s going to be a pictorial blog today. there’s nothing much to describe other than that the scenery is simply too amazing that i can't conjure much thoughts to it. i mean if you were to be here, there’s really no need to talk but just immerse yourself to the natural surrounding and just let the nature (no pun intended) takes it course.you will be in awe that with so much consumerism, technological advancement and development going on every minute as i write, nature seems to have made time come to a stand still.please take some time off once in awhile to enjoy the breeze and relax in the arms of the nature. it is a gift. it is precious. it is priceless.maybe we should also start doing our part in conserving nature, keep our nature in its original place, it will be us that will benefit.ps: if you have the time, watch “the inconvenient truth” by al gore. it’s all about the effects of global warming. xinyu has the vcd/dvd, she might just lend you if you asked her. the begining of monterey. it used to be an old fishermen's wharf. seals likes to "dock" here too... (they are on the breakwater) bubba gump, a forrest gump inspired restaurant. great food and service, just along monterey cannery area. the servers will run along if the sign says "run forrest run" they will stop to check on you when you have your sign up!! not kidding. their famous clam chowder... mmmm... yummy! all things shrimp~taste so good especially the "net catch" in the foreground just outside bubba. the weather has turn sunny! yeah... the fun starts now... the drive into 17 mile.i caught an escargot! i think it might just be sea slug... bleahthe lonely cypress tree... it has been overlooking the pacific ocean for 250 years nowthe golf course in 17 mile drive. i made it old fashion looking, its the best way to see it.the enterance to the clubhouse, which is also an expensive hotel. chris hopes that the snoopy group can come here together to spend a vacation of luxury and leisure...
