department 56 addams family village




   it was 1938 when the charles addams cartoon depicting a quirky group, the addams
   family, first appeared in the new yorker. in his words, a closely knit
   family, the real head being morticia  although each of the others is a
   definite character gomez and pugsley are enthusiastic. morticia is even in
   disposition, muted, witty, sometimes deadly. wednesday is her mothers
   daughter. the house is a wreck, of course, but this is a house-proud family
   just the same and every trap door is in good repair. money is no problem.

vic mizzy, composer of the addams family theme passes at age 93.



  october 20, 2009.

  you may not know vic mizzy's name, but you know his works. vic mizzy wrote many of the iconic tv themes of the 1960s and 70's.. perhaps
  his most memorable theme song is the addams family theme, he also wrote the theme for green acres, starring eddie albert and eva
  gabor.  vic mizzy also scored many of don knott's movies. addamsfamily.com sends our condolences to the mizzy family and friends.

 read his obituary from the la times:
