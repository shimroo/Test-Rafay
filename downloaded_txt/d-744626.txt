jitterbugs' night outfind a classspecial events “jitterbugs has created a built-in date night for us. it’s also opened doors for many new friendships and a way to forget about the challenges of our week and simply have a great time on the dance floor with no stress and some good exercise to boot. while we are older than many of the participants at jitterbugs, we always feel younger there!”
rod van horn“i love omaha jitterbugs! at 74 years of age, i still go and dance all night! all different ages and different styles dance together which makes it even more fun. no one judges; we all just have fun and dance.”
connie mcmillian“the friendships i have made through dancing have carried me through some of the most difficult times in my life. knowing there is a community to call on, for myself, for my daughter is something invaluable to me.”
katya brunette“i started dancing in 1998 and was a little nervous because i was the oldest one there. but everyone was so welcoming that i kept coming back and still am 20 years later!”
