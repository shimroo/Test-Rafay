for undergraduate students
undergraduate general award & scholarship opportunity
chemistry students:now is the time to submit your application for any one of our chemistry awards and
                           scholarships! we have a variety, and we’ve made it easy for you to apply. simply click the link above and submit your application. submission of your information enters you for each scholarship or award you are eligible for.deadline for applications is feb. 15th
acs bridge travel and career/professional development award
the award is open to undergraduate students interested in the chemical sciences and
                           are from groups traditionally underrepresented in chemistry and chemical engineering.
                           namely, underrepresented minorities include african americans, hispanic americans,
                           and native americans. the goal of this professional development award is to increase
                           the number of urm students that gain access to doctoral programs in the chemical sciences. the
                           professional development award will defray the cost of any online workshops, courses,
                           virtual conferences, and/or events that will assist urm students gain access to doctoral
                           programs in the chemical sciences. each award will be for up to $1000 of eligible
                           expenses based on the review of materials.
