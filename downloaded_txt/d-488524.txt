welcome to english yarns with shoreham knitting & needlecraft

shoreham knitting and needlecraft began selling knitting machines and coned knitting yarn in 1972 and were known as shoreham knitting machines. we first stocked rowan coned yarn in the early days of rowan in 1978 and this was the beginning of our close association with rowan.  we are rowanâs oldest stockist, both here in the uk and worldwide. in 1983 we moved to much larger premises and branched out into handknitting and needlework. soon afterwards the name of the shop changed to shoreham knitting & needlecraft. in 1997 the english yarns website was launched!  monica and the team are passionate knitters, crocheters, and needleworkers, and are always ready to help and advise with any new project, whether online or in our retail store. we specialize in rowan, sirdar and sublime, yarns and patterns, dmc and anchor threads and needlework kits, and have a vast range of accessories for knitting, crochet, needlework, and haberdashery.
