doesn't pelosi here look kind of like that brain-sucking fungus thing on aqua teens -- and i mean that in the best way possible.  the purple dude to the left here:i rule you!  me lawyer!the whole bag news notes post that i stole the pelosi pic from is worth looking at. including his analysis of just how nancy ruled him -- dba acting like a responsible, temperate adult.

	 in search of .... his own brain
	 
    


i've always liked the episode of star trek in which the alien woman surgically removes spock's brain from his skull, and mccoy rigs up a remote control so he can walk spock around, and eventually puts spock's brain back into his head, partly pretty much winging it after the knowledge from the badass alien teaching machine wears off, and all this without shaving leonard nimoy's head.what i hadn't remembered was that the babe who actually absconds with spock's brain was wearing one of the best sixties outfits in the show, with purple crotch-high boots, and also she was smiling throughout like a charter member of the manson family. it looked like this:only now do i realize the message the show's producers were trying so desperately to convey:  hippie women will steal the brain out of your head.

	 bush:  super bowl loser's state to invade winner's state
	 
    


george bush today noted that america has a “unique opportunity” because the super bowl competitors, the indianapolis colts and chicago bears, are located in states that share a common border.“emotions are running high in both indiana and illinois. they have been enemies in the past and continue to be enemies,” bush said at a meeting of gop leaders. he continued, “i must protect america from enemies. today i announce plans for federalizing the national guard of whichever state loses, and using it to launch a long-needed invasion of whichever state wins. go bears.”

$10 says that bush starts trying to insinuate the idea of "what's so bad about going to war for oil?" in his speech tonight, not so much because he thinks it'll have any effect in whatever debate occurs over escalation in iraq*, as because of the need by his corporate sponsors to move the discourse in this direction, in the same way that they've been trying to normalize policies that previous administrations have tried to frame as nonexistent (torture) or unavoidable evils (aggressive war).* although i'm sure they know it'll feed the "realist" element of "the base" -- cf. ann coulter, "why not go to war just for oil? we need oil. what do hollywood celebrities imagine fuels their private jets? how do they think their cocaine is delivered to them?"

yet another $1,000,000 idea:you take a group of 10 or 12 regular average folks and expose them to tuberculosis.  then you tape little "up close and personal" sessions with them, have them dance, sing (better to do this part early in the season before they all start coughing a lot), etc., and you give cipro to the one who ends up most popular with the audience.
