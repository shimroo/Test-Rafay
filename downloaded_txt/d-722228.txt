erdas raises radar mapping to a new level erdas announces the industry’s most advanced radar mapping technology in the latest release of the imagine radar mapping suite. in the imagine radar mapping suite 9.3, erdas continues to focus on operational software, taking the best of developmental algorithms and implementing these into a user-friendly environment, easily accessible for both the novice and the expert user. with intelligent defaults and optimized processing, the imagine radar mapping suite is fully integrated into erdas imagine, the world’s foremost solution for manipulating, processing and understanding imagery and vector data. with over 15 years of experience in radar image processing, erdas continues to build partnerships with leaders in radar worldwide. the imagine radar mapping suite is currently being enhanced in collaboration with the german aerospace centre (dlr). recently, the dlr-created srtm unwrap algorithm was incorporated into the imagine radar mapping suite. these new modules are flexible and can be customized to meet any organization’s needs. “radar mapping offers a highly complementary alternative to traditional optical imaging and mapping methods, providing different perspectives on the earth’s surface and information content that is unavailable in optical imagery,” said brad skelton, chief technology officer, erdas. “the imagine radar mapping suite provides specialized tools for processing radar data in a standard remote sensing or gis environment.” the imagine radar mapping suite includes imagine orthoradar, imagine radar interpreter, imagine stereosar dem, imagine insar and the newest module, imagine coherence change detection. imagine coherence change detection assists the analyst in detecting changes in interferometric sar data. with tools for georectifying, filtering and calibrating radar images, analysts can derive elevation information regardless of cloud cover, day or night from stereo or interferometric image-pairs. in the imagine radar mapping suite, analysts can save their radar data in any raster format, create color images to emphasize the magnitude of change, derive binary images to detect the most dramatic changes, create shapefiles for gis applications and more. utilizing the power of erdas imagine, these tools are interoperable, supporting all raster file formats, with the ability to seamlessly connect your radar data to any of erdas’ portfolio of solutions and many other geospatial products. imagine radar mapping suite supports a growing number of satellite sensors, including ers-1, 2 and envisat, radarsat-1 and 2, terrasar-x (with one meter spotlight modes), alos palsar and more. data from other radar sensors is supported by a generic import interface. in early 2009, erdas will add a d-insar capability and cosmo support to imagine radar mapping suite. press release - erdascopyright 2008 by erdas, inc.

learn to use ogc web services integrated into esri's arcgis server 9.3esri will host an online live training seminar this month that will show how expanded support for open geospatial consortium, inc. (ogc), web service standards at arcgis server 9.3 will foster greater collaboration when working with geographic information system (gis) data and maps.leveraging ogc capabilities in arcgis server 9.3 will air october 23, 2008, at www.esri.com/lts. participants can tune in to the no-cost seminar at 9:00 a.m., 11:00 a.m., and 3:00 p.m. (pacific daylight time).arcgis server 9.3 software, released earlier this year, now includes support for publishing gis vector data using the web feature service (wfs) standard and raster data using the web coverage service (wcs) standard. it also includes enhanced web map service (wms) functionality. esri's support for these standards promotes interoperability on the web that allows gis professionals to more widely share maps, images, and data with colleagues, enabling faster and more efficient decision making.the seminar's presenters will provide an overview of ogc web service standards and the role these standards play in web gis. they will then discuss how support for these services is integrated into the arcgis server framework as service capabilities that can be easily enabled and configured using arcgis server manager or arccatalog.the presenters will also explain web service fundamentals and workflows for wfs-, wcs-, and wms-enabled services and demonstrate how easy it is to publish maps and data using arcgis server. these and other ogc services can then be consumed by a wide range of esri and third-party ogc-enabled client applications such as arcmap, arcgis explorer, gaia, and google earth. for example, a wcs service can provide web access to raster datasets, allowing a client application, such as arcmap, to perform spatial analysis and geoprocessing directly with web datasets.the seminar also will cover two more advanced ogc  web service topics. one will be support for wms styled layer descriptors (slds), which allow clients to display map layers using a variety of symbologies or styles. the second will be transactional web feature service (wfs-t), which permits a wfs service to support ogc client-based editing of enterprise geodatabase vector data.seminar participants should have a basic familiarity with using and administering arcgis server including knowledge about publishing and managing gis services. an understanding of basic server and web service concepts is also helpful.a broadband internet connection and an esri global account are needed to watch the seminar. creating a global account is easy and free: visit www.esri.com/lts, click login, and register your name and address. a few weeks after the live presentation, the seminar will be archived and available for viewing on the esri training and education web site.for more information about this free live training seminar, as well as upcoming classes, visit www.esri.com/training.press release - esricopyright esri

global map systems announces release of logiq pdf map publishing system global map systems today announced the release of their logiq pdf product suite – geodataembed and geodatavu, the most advanced pdf map publishing tools available on the market. with these products, map- makers can create pdf maps that allow for powerful spatial analysis features typically found in products like esri’s arcmap. this functionality is made available for free to adobe acrobat users. logiq pdf maps offer advanced spatial analysis features such as point-on-geometry analysis, attribute statistics, frequency tables and export to shapefile. logiq pdf is a patent-pending technology that embeds the table schema, feature geometry, and other components of gis data directly into the logical content of a pdf file representing a published map. by embedding data such as field definitions, data types, spatial references, attributes, and actual geometry in map coordinates, the pdf file contains all the essential gis data behind the map, not only making it a potential medium of data exchange, but also enabling spatial analysis. these pdfs can be combined with existing pdf map books to extend even more gis functionality to map users.embedding map data in logical content allows map publishers to export an esri arcmap layout and all of the map data that went into its production into a single pdf file. the pdf file acts as a medium of gis data exchange. pdf map users with the free adobe acrobat plug-in can for the first time ever: - perform point-on-geometry analysis to identify features on any layer. not only are embedded attributes displayed, but also the length and area of the feature geometry in map units. - query map features in any embedded layer based on attribute values. - analyze and calculate attribute statistics for feature geometry length or area. - generate a frequency table for any embedded layer. - export any layer to shapefile, allowing the map data to be imported into other gis applications for true round-trip gis data exchange. "the most exciting aspect of our technology is the potential for disconnected users to perform classic gis analysis on the spatial data underlying a pdf map document”, said mark cederholm, cto of gms. “the power and flexibility of logiq pdf will eventually provide our customers with nothing less than a mini-gis for acrobat." logiq pdf is available for immediate download at the low introductory sales price of $399 at www.globalmapsystems.com press release - global map systemscopyright 2008, global map systems
