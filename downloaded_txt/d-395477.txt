the granddaddy of live music venues, the continental club has enjoyed a coast-to-coast and worldwide reputation as the premiere club for live music in austin since 1955 and in houston since 2000.the historic austin live music destination first opened its doors in 1955 as a swanky private supper club, but in the decades since, it's become a mecca for roots, rockabilly, country, swing, rock and blues music every night of the week. the classic neon sign flashing above the entrance is a landmark on south congress, and vintage cars and hot rods often line south congress avenue in front of the dimly lit club.  in the year 2000, the world famous continental club spread it's wings and opened up a second location in another historic building, pioneering a resurgence in the mid-town area of houston on main street. both clubs offer the best of the best when it comes to a menu of live music and entertainment!powered by our sponsor:
