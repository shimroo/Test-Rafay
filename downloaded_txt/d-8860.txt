welcome to norwoodrich in pride, tradition, and heritage, the city of norwood, ohio has long thrived as an enclave nestled in the heart of the greater cincinnati metropolitan area. occupying a land area of just over three square miles, norwood has been blessed with a strategic central location, excellent transportation accessibility, a diverse economic base, and a strong sense of community. since its founding in 1888, norwood has grown into a center for commerce and industry proudly serving as birthplace and home for numerous office, manufacturing, service, and retail businesses. norwood's distinction as an independent community in the center of a major metropolitan area continues to offer a unique blend of advantages for the residents and businesses that call it home.
