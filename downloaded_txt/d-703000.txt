why bgst? 
bgst’s aspiration is that all christians may become effective ambassadors for christ where he has called them. to do so, however, they must become ‘theologically mature as they are professionally competent’. to be able to work out how god’s word may be applied in god’s world – at their workplaces, churches, and the communities they serve in. at bgst, we offer a wide spectrum of courses and postgraduate programmes to help marketplace christians achieve this. we also partner closely with churches to enable them to cultivate strong marketplace leaders and disciples.
