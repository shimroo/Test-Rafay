see all categorieswho we are
we at techtonics tuning inc. are passionate about our volkswagons: we want to get the most out of our vws and we want you to do so as well.  while we may look different from many vw or other high performance catalogues, it’s because we are performance oriented. we work hard to make and sell parts that are dependable, efficient, and effective in their purpose.  we like to do things our own way, and we have prided ourselves on being different from the rest of the gang since 1981.

here is what some of our customers have to say about us:

the best in the business. best products and best support. friendly, helpful and beyond knowledgeable. collin and the crew do a fantastic job. this is coming from a vw audi shop owner. techtonics is unmatched in the industry.
– rusty shackelford
literally the best aftermarket automotive parts company out there…never once have i ordered something form there that wasn’t absolute perfection, and ever once did i ever have an unhelpful call. highly recommended!
– frankenbuilt
ridiculously fast as usual. called yesterday, exhaust showed up today. looks beautiful and i assume it will fit just as well as the last one i purchased from techtonics. these guys know what they are doing and have been doing it for a long time.
