meet the bad kids

















each bad kid is hand drawn by a computer. they mix and match over 400 unique parts, including bodies, hair, mouths, noses, and backgrounds. each one is unique. some are super rare. all of them are bad. they also have different superpower attributes and stats to go with them. there’s a secret gallery where you can see those secret traits. each bad kid doesn’t have a name (for legal reasons) but if you wanted to name your own you can and should











statsare you the kind of person who prefers numbers to pictures? well we have got some good news. each bad kid comes with a bunch of stats: age, brains, muscles, and of course, badness. every bad kid is bad, but some are even badder. the numbers are generated based on the art and rarity of each kid. you can also learn the names of the parts, like the eyes, hairstyle and more. 




pfp readyno matter where you sit in the telegram versus signal wars, your bad kid is ready to be dropped in as a pfp. we hear they even work on whatsapp, discord, slack, and twitter, too.
