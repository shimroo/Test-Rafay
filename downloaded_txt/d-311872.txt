i'm starting my third month with formwell and i am really enjoying this!  i came from another trainer where it was the same exercises week in and week out.  this team does a great job of keeping everything fresh.  yes, the squats and lunges are still there, but there's a lot of other exercises too.   where they really excel is in working with you and your particular pain points to find exercises that work the body part, but protect things like knees and back.  as a bonus, there are events off-site like at the park on saturday morning, or even something that's purely social.   i'm well over 70 and keeping strong  with the help of cody and his team.

i love formwell! environment is perfect. i am a former college athlete and have been wanting a coach ever since. i am 48 years old and have several past injuries. they are fantastic with working me hard without aggravating those injuries. everyone that goes there is encouraging and i have never felt judged or self-conscious that i am trying to lose weight and get fit. the environment is overall extremely positive.
