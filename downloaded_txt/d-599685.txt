our mission






north carolina farm bureau federation was formed in 1936 as a non-profit general farm organization to serve farmers and provide a unified voice for the interests and needs of the farming community. today, north carolina farm bureau serves as an advocate for our members at the local, state, national, and international levels – providing educational, economic, public affairs, marketing, and various other services to our members. over the years, north carolina farm bureau federation has grown into the largest general farm organization in the state with more than 500,000 member families, yet we remain true to our grassroots heritage and steadfast in our mission to advocate for farm and rural families.
