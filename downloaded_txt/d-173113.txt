wildwood survival




the wildwood survival website contains information on wilderness survival skills from the viewpoint of the ancient philosophy of living in harmony with the earth, which is what might be called "wilderness mind". 
			there are over 500 pages on this site about various survival topics, 
			including fire, shelter, water, food, tools, and much much more! 
			whether you travel in the wild areas by yourself or not, you never 
			know when you will be stranded somewhere and be forced to rely on 
			your own resources to stay comfortable or to even survive.
there is plenty of information here for the casual 
			internet browser, student of wilderness survival, naturalists, or 
			hard-core survivalist. please take some time to browse around. enjoy 
			your stay at wildwood survival!
as well, the famous   fire from a can of coke & a chocolate bar 
	and
			
fire from ice articles 
	are here on this site!
