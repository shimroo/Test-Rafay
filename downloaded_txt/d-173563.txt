"ovation guitars really don't get the respect they deserve! ok, i came out and said it.  
i am positive that if you are at this site you agree with that statement and it is 
probably the reason why you are here." (alex pepiak)
the ovation fan club is the brainchild of both miles-kevin baron of 
www.mileskbaron.com
and alexander pepiak of 
www.lostartvintage.com.  
miles, is a long time fan of the ovation 
solid body and storm series guitars, and is probably the primary collector of these 
instruments and ovation memorabilia in the usa. al is a huge fan of the adamas guitar, 
and has probably owned more of them than one person should be allowed, and has also owned 
some rare and prototype ovation guitars as well.   neither profess to be experts, but both 
possess a vast amount of knowledge about them,  and most importantly a love and enthusiasm for 
ovation instruments.


the purpose of this site is to inform, educate, communicate and share knowledge of 
ovation guitars. this board is not meant as a substitute for 
www.ovationguitars.com but 
is intended to fill the void between the print advertising and the official ovation site.
