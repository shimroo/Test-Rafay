featuresubmit a prayer requestjesus’ example teaches us that prayer is essential to following god. our ongoing conversation with god the father is the first place we share our joys, concerns and sorrows. we sometimes think of prayer as a last resort, when in fact, it is offered by god as our first step in building a relationship with him.be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to god. and the peace of god, which surpasses all comprehension, shall guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus. philippians 4:6-7
