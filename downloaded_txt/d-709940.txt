partners


                      in any relationship, it's important that all parties have the same expectations, understanding and knowledge. the most important thing in both relationships is trust. from day one, trust needs to be established. getting to know each other and understanding both your businesses can go a long way towards building trust. you’ll need to do business with a vendor a few times to build trust, but most partners can prove trustworthy or not during the introductory phase.
