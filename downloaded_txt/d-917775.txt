how to properly apply moisturizer 

by secure_admin | sep 23, 2022 | moisturizing | 0 comments
moisturizers are essential for keeping skin looking healthy and hydrated, but many people don’t know how to use them properly.  

if you’re a guy, chances are you haven’t used moisturizer in your entire life. you’ve probably read about some benefits of moisturizing your skin daily. so, you’re now learning how to apply it properly.  
in this post, we’ll teach you how to apply mattifying moisturizer for men so that you can get the most out of it.  
apply moisturizer on a damp skin 
for best results, apply moisturizer to damp skin. this allows the moisturizer to better penetrate the skin and helps to lock in hydration. dry skin is more susceptible to wrinkling and other signs of aging, so keeping the skin properly hydrated is essential for maintaining a youthful appearance.  
in addition, damp skin is less likely to irritate the delicate skin around the eyes. when applying moisturizer to the face, be sure to use gentle circular motions and avoid pulling or stretching the skin. and always remove any excess moisturizer before applying makeup or sunscreen. by following these simple tips, you can keep your skin looking its best. 
don’t over-apply  
have you ever wondered how much moisturizer you should be applying to your face? if you’re using too much, it can lead to problems such as clogged pores, breakouts, and even milia. milia are tiny white bumps that can form when dead skin cells and oils become trapped under the skin. while they’re not usually painful or harmful, they can be difficult to get rid of.  
applying a thick layer of moisturizer is one of the main ways that people end up with milia. so, if you’re concerned about these pesky bumps, it’s best to use a light touch when applying your moisturizer. this way, you’ll be able to avoid any over-applying issues. 
dab the moisturizer before massaging 
before you start your facial massage, it is important to apply a layer of moisturizer. this will help to protect your skin from friction and ensure that your massage is as effective as possible. when applying the moisturizer, be sure to dab it on rather than rub it in.  
this will help to prevent the formation of microscopic tears in the skin. once the moisturizer has been applied, begin your massage with light strokes. slowly increase the pressure as you move around the face. be sure to avoid any areas that are particularly sensitive or prone to irritation.  
after a few minutes, you should notice that your skin feels softer and smoother. in addition, your complexion may appear brighter and more evenly toned. 
don’t forget to moisturize your neck 
one of the most important, yet often overlooked, steps in any skincare routine is to moisturize the neck. the skin on the neck is thinner and more delicate than the skin on the face, and it is exposed to a lot of environmental stressors throughout the day.  
as a result, the neck is susceptible to dryness, wrinkles, and sagging. a good neck cream will help to hydrate and nourish the skin, while also providing anti-aging benefits. look for a cream that contains hyaluronic acid or glycerin to help lock in moisture, and make sure to apply it twice a day for the best results. with regular use, you’ll notice softer, smoother, and more youthful-looking skin. 




how frequently should you clean your carpet?

by secure_admin | oct 29, 2021 | carpet cleaning | 0 comments
as a homeowner, you should know that there is a huge difference between hiring a professional to clean your carpets and spot cleaning them.  

it’s understandable that it can be hard to know when to hire a professional to clean your carpets. this is particularly true if your carpet still looks clean.  
while your carpet might look clean with your naked eye, that isn’t the case always. your carpets experience a lot of wear and tear every day, especially if you have kids and pets.  
because of this, there are several questions you need to ask yourself to determine if you need to hire a seattle carpet cleaning company.  
do you have allergies? 
over time, carpets can accumulate allergens and dirt. this is particularly true if you don’t vacuum it regularly.  
though vacuuming your carpet is useful, you can’t properly remove the allergens from your carpet if you don’t do other cleaning tips.  
you need to shampoo your carpets every 2 months to help remove the allergens from your house. aside from that, think about hiring a professional to clean the carpets every 3 months. 
do you have a cat or dog? 
we all know that our pets are dirty. they love to run around outside. this means that your carpets are filled with debris and dirt that they track inside on their paws.  
aside from the dirt they track, pets are also shedding dander regularly. this accumulates in your carpets and increases allergens in your house. also, it is crucial to clean up messes as they occur to prevent long-lasting smells.  
if you’ve got a pet, you need to vacuum your carpet two times a week. then, you also have to hire a professional to shampoo or steam clean your carpet every 3-6 months.  
if you don’t take care of your carpet, your pet will easily destroy it. pets can drastically lower the lifespan of your carpet. thus, it’s best to hire a professional to clean it every 3-6 months.  
do you have kids? 
your house might be dirtier than you think if you’ve got kids in your house. kids are extremely playful. they will spill, smudge, and smear anything on your carpet.  
because of this, you need to vacuum your carpet every single day to keep your floors clean. also, professionals recommend you steam clean or shampoo your carpet every 4 to 6 months if you’ve got kids.  
even with regular vacuuming, you still have to hire a professional to clean your carpets. households with kids need to hire a professional to clean their carpets every 12 to 18 months.  
how frequently do you vacuum? 
routine maintenance of the carpet of your house will have an influence on how frequently you need to hire a professional to clean them.  
when it comes to carpet vacuuming, you should think about doing it once every 7 days. however, you might have to vacuum twice a week in high-traffic areas.  
you can lower the number of allergens and dirt that accumulate on your carpet if you clean it regularly.

benefits and drawbacks of triple-paned windows

by secure_admin | jul 21, 2021 | window cost | 0 comments
are you planning to replace your old windows? if so, there are a couple of options to choose from. the three most common types of windows are single pane, double pane, and triple-pane windows. a single pane window has one sheet of glass, while a double pane has two and a triple-pane has three.  

so, which type of window is ideal for you? many professionals recommend triple-paned windows. of course, there is a reason for that. keep in mind that nothing is perfect. triple-paned windows also come with several drawbacks.  
today, we’re going to share with you the benefits and drawbacks of triple-paned windows. this includes the window cost, efficiency, and more. 
benefit: you can still use them if one pane breaks 
typically, double-paned windows are better compared to single-paned windows. however, you lost most of the energy-efficiency benefits if one of the sheets of glass develops some type of hole, chip, or crack. the insulating gasses will escape. hot or cool air gets sandwiched between the window panes.  
you can always hire a professional to fix the window and restore the insulating gases. however, you’ll see lowered energy efficiency in the meantime.  
on the other hand, even if a single sheet of glass breaks, you’ll still have two layers of windows with a triple-paned window. this means that you still have a single layer of insulating gases. this provides you a bit more time to fix the window before you really start to see lowered energy efficiency.  
drawback: they do not provide a sound barrier benefit unlike double panes 
triple pane windows might be a waste of money if your only concern is sound. the reason for this is that according to studies, the noise reduction offered by triple-paned windows is not much different compared to the noise reduction provided by a double pane window. if you choose an asymmetrically glazed double pane window, you might get a better sound reduction.  
benefit: they’re energy-efficient 
compared to other types of windows, triple-paned windows are more energy-efficient. the reason for this is that this type of window has three sheets of glasses. this helps produce a thicker barrier between the air inside your house and the air outside. this lowers the risk of drafts and hot spots by reducing the transfer of heat.  
also, triple pane windows provide better energy efficiency since the gaps between the panes are filled with insulating gasses, such as argon, xenon, and krypton. it will lower the energy efficiency if the gas leaks out. however, the gas isn’t dangerous to you, your pets, or your loved ones.  
drawback: they’re expensive 
triple pane windows are expensive. however, they’re a well-worth investment. aside from increasing your home’s value, the energy savings will help lower the amount of money you spend every month to cool or heat your house.  
usually, homeowners spend around $500-$800 for every window. then, the labor for window installation will cost around $40 per hour.  
double pane windows usually cost 10-15% less. singe pane is the most affordable type of window. unfortunately, they provide little-to-no energy efficiency.
