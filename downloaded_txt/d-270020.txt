latest news
october 10, 2023
the original genome annotation for p. fluorescens sbw25 has been re-added after being erroneously deleted (ncbi had flagged it as an anomalous assembly).
october 6, 2023
pseudomonas genome database version 22.1 released.

										4883 curated updates to annotations.
									

										new pseudomonas genomes added and older versions of assemblies have been removed. database now has 7982 pseudomonas aeruginosa genomes and 14229 pseudomonas genomes overall.
									

										updated antimicrobial resistance gene predictions based on the resistance gene identifier (rgi) and card version 3.2.5.
									

										updated functional domain predictions based on interpro version 5.63-95.0.
									

										updated 3d structures: rcsb protein databank structures (downloaded aug 24, 2023) linked to pseudomonas proteins using sequence similarity.
									

										new link to search for alphafold 2-predicted 3d structures: previously, p. aeruginosa pao1 links were available but now it is possible to link other genomes using the uniprotkb accession.
