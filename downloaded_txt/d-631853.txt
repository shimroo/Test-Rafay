learn about cmek
cmek is the premier basketball program geared towards the development of kids’ abilities in basketball. our coaching staff helps young athletes make challenging goals for themselves and helps them pursue those goals.
we strive to maintain a balance between teaching and fun, structure and freedom, and supervision and competition. it remains our view that these years are filled with fun and excitement for our participants. we recognize that every single player is different, and so we try to organize teams by placing kids into groups where each feels comfortable participating.

julie brodskyhi chad. jack and andrew love your camp. in fact…jack thinks it’s the best because it is the most fun…with each day a little different and not just hardcore drills…a good balance. andrew loves the coaching he gets at cmek and i will agree….the balance between you and sasha is great. your intensity is perfect for him and what he needs. thanks!

larry kaufmannhi chad, congratulations on winning the championship. it doesn’t get any better than that! you did everything you said in your initial email to the team. alec showed up determined to win and did not disappoint, he absolutely left it all on the court! not too many skeptics left! i’m glad you are now a believer. alec enjoyed this season including playing for you.

fred baumi just want to thank you for justin’s development as a basketball player. we have been together for years and years and his game has got better and better. i am really grateful because without cmek basketball, justin would not have been able to get as athletic as he has. again i am really grateful with what we got in return from you and your program. thank you.

shira markschad, i was extremely impressed with the game today. your coaching really allowed the girls to play like a team. you constantly instruct them throughout the game. you substitute them appropriately so they aren’t fatigued and you find a good combination of players to work together and be productive. their desire to play and compete, in addition to their ability to execute is amazing to watch when you are with them. with this type of coaching they are knowledgable and know exactly what is expected of them. they do not look confused and they have an eagerness to win. thanks
dina schwartzhi chad, i wanted to let you know that david really enjoyed playing for your team and absolutely wants to continue to play for cmek going forward. we are just sorry that we did not discover your organization a few years ago as we have found the professionalism and caliber of the coaching/league to be far superior to the others we have experienced.

phil gazzillochad – tanner really liked your camp; he said he learned a lot more here than in other camps and actually i can see it in him as well. he showed me a few drills in which now he wants me to do with him (thank you very much..) ie: the tough guy drill and home on the range. on a personal note, my wife and i both want to say thank you for all the different techniques you and your coaches are teaching. as i said in the beginning of this email, i can definitely see the progress in tanner.

naomi fischmanchad – thank you for all your work with noah. he’s really driven to succeed. cmek has been his favorite part of moving to nj.
(mother of noah, moriah englewood)
scott magerchad,
tammy and i thank you for your kind words. more importantly we thank you for being such a good coach, mentor and teacher to our son. he has been absorbing the basketball skills and sportsmanship values you and your staff have been teaching like a sponge. i once told you that i thought that every minute david spent under your tutor ledge was positive and good for him and this past year certainly is evidence of that.
(father of david – englewood)
karen palermochad,
omg!! confirm they are in are you kidding me..wild horses couldn’t keep them away from playing for cmek!! and i am not under any circumstances blowing smoke. both my boys love, love, love playing for you and your coaches. you have an incredible program (which i tell everyone i can).
(mother of philip and mark of paramus.
