with an eye for subtlety and detail, cynthia employs a shadowing technique that gives her artistry depth and dimension. she has developed an ever widening reputation for her sand carved glass vases with their decorative exteriors and their innovative cut-away rims.
cynthia’s work is featured in collections and galleries in europe, japan, and the united states. she sells wholesale to fine shops and galleries and directly to private individuals. she also creates original pieces on commission.
all pieces are hand blown, made in america individually drawn and sandblasted, signed and dated.
