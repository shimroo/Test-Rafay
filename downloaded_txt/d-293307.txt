greetings. welcome to rusty's home page.

currently reside in the prospect heights neighborhood of
brooklyn.

here are some of my books:


























my family keeps bugging me to "write a book they can understand" so i hope one day
to branch out of the computer book ghetto and write some more general non-fiction.
it hasn't happened yet though. in the meantime, though, i've begun keeping a blog and  online journal
about whatever topics strike my eye, including 
fast times at ridgemont high, 
buffy in cyberspace, 
intelligence,
timothy leary, 
the spot,
fruitopia, 
fuzzy truth,
edward abbey's the monkey wrench gang, 
the vagaries of book titles, 
cab rides in new york, and 
robert anton wilson's the new inquisition


the quickest, most reliable means of reaching me 
is to send email to elharo@macfaq.com.
i don't give out my phone number or street address to any and all on the net; but
if for some reason you'd like to call me or send snail mail, send me email with your
phone number, and i'll get back to you.  (it wouldn't hurt if you
told me why you wanted to call me either.)



as well as my popular books and writings on the web, i've written and cowritten a number of 
technical papers on topics ranging from solar physics to
railguns to baseball. most recently:

harold, e., "obscuring xml", extreme markup languages 2005
harold, e., "xom design principles", extreme markup languages 2004
harold, e., "sax conformance testing,"  xml europe 2004
bukiet, b., harold, e., and palacios, j.,
"a markov chain approach to baseball,"
operations research, volume 45, number 1, january-february 1997, pp. 14-23
t.r. rimmele, p.r. goode, e. harold, r.t. stebbins, 
"dark lanes in granulation and the excitation of solar oscillations," 
astrophysical journal,
444, l119-l122 (1995). 

harold, e., bukiet, b., and peter, w.,
"maximum projectile velocity in an augmented railgun,";
ieee transaction on magnetics, volume 30, number 4, july 1994, pp. 1433-1436


i've also been known to cross over to the other side of the fence and do some editing
on occasion. i've been technical editor for 
teach yourself perl 5 in 21 days
by david till, the 
developer's guide to the java web server by dan woods, larne pewkowsky, and tom snee,
and for the java chapter of andrew tanenbaum's 
computer 
networks,
3rd edition, and the xml chapter of cay horstmann's big java, 2nd edition.
