talon, akc/ukc ch. chimeric desperado, cd rn ht tdi earned a 
			herding group one
			at the 
			lehigh valley 100th anniversary dog show, sat december 12, 2009!!

			not too bad for a dog that hasn't been shown since may ;-)

welcome dita!!!
luavjan's eldee 








 



  
			congratulations to chilli!!!!

			she is now officially

ch. chimeric 
			hellfreezesover, rn

			like both her sire & dam, it didn't take long to complete the ch 
			title...and chilli did it in fine style, 
			wins over specials, majors over males, 
			bob from the classes and even
			a group 4 from the classes!

			she easily qualified for a hic, so it looks like
			herding is next on our agenda...



 


 
 
congratulations to 
			billee and dylan!
			together they earned billiee's very first akc title...    
			
			dylan is 
			eternity's unique, rn
