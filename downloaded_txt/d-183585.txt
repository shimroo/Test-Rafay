truerta's 
				  audio spectrum analyzer software shows you a detailed picture 
				  of what you're hearing in real-time, that is, as it happens.

				  all you need is a windows pc with basic sound capability. the test instruments found in
                      	truerta include:
● real time 
				  audio analyzer● low distortion signal
                      generator● dual trace oscilloscope● db 
				  spl, dbu and crest factor meters


winspeakerz is a loudspeaker simulation
        program. this popular speaker simulator lets you propose various speaker 
				  systems and then
      evaluate them in software before you cut wood or order expensive transducer
      components.● customize your driver library● box calculators
				  ● crossover calculators

introduction to loudspeaker design is written for students, 
				  technicians, engineers and hobbyists seeking an overview of 
				  the technology of loudspeakers. topics include:

● loudspeaker design tradeoffs● 
				  spatial loading● diffraction loss● cavity effect
				  ● enclosure construction

dats measures loudspeaker 
				  parameters or passive component values in just seconds and 
				  even includes our unique impedance based rub and buzz test.
● measure 
				  speaker parameters

● perform rub and buzz 
				  testing

● measure  
				  r, c and l values

● generate audio waveforms

create your own audio measurement system
starting with truerta software 
					and your windows pc. then add a measurement 
					microphone and usb interface and you have a full 
					audio/acoustic test setup. start with the free level 1 
					edition which provides a 1 octave spectrum analyzer, a dual 
					trace oscilloscope and a signal generator. level 1 never 
					expires. once you get to see the power of the software and 
					how easily you become productive with it you will want to 
					upgrade to a higher level with greater resolution.

 "while lots of audio measurement 
					software applications exist for the pc, the one that seems 
					to have captured the hearts of engineers and enthusiasts is 
					truerta, available at trueaudio.com. most speaker engineers 
					i know keep a copy on their computers."

as an experienced

							recording and processing lp records. 
kudos to the true audio team.

																"i'm using true 
																rta installed on 
																an iview 
																cyberpc. it's a 
																wndows 8.1 pc on 
																a hdmi stick. 
																it's plugged 
																into a powered 4 
																port usb hub to 
																which the uca202 
																is connected.

																everything 
																worked first 
																shot, no issues 
																with either the 
																software or 
																hardware. in 
																fact, the first 
																sweep i did 
																showed me i had 
																a problem with 
																the amp being 
																tested!

																so, just this 
																note to thank 
																you for the 
																great product.
																

																best, jack"






"i find this 
				quite an amazing package. to put this amount of test gear 
				together in earlier days would have cost me tens of thousands of 
				dollars. very nicely designed, very user friendly, and tells me 
				all i need to know in a quick and efficient way. i take my hat 
				off to your designer !! - arthur"
