night music

sum of it all are a new musical experiment of accretion from the minds of st. john’s musicians liam clancy and david kerr. sum of it all seeks to create unique and interesting soundscapes through a combination of trumpet, percussion, vocals, ukulele, and various other instruments as well as found sounds both acoustic and electric.

as with all editions of night music, we cap of the night with an open jam after the musicians of the hour run through their set. so bring an instrument and make some noise!

calling all improvisers!
night music is an improvisational music series held the third thursday of very month at the ship pub. local musicians play a set of their own music, which serves as the basis for the improvisation that follows. musicians collaborate with organizer craig squires to present the evening of music, both planned and impromptu. this is not an open mic, but all players are invited to come down and join the fun.
find information about upcoming shows on our facebook and instagram pages.
does your band want to anchor an event? contact us!
sponsored by the sound art initiative, inc., and presented by the downtown academy of improvisers.

happy new year from all of us at sound arts! 2024 was an incredible year – immense thanks to all of the night music artists, sound symposium xxi participants, drone day droners, our community partners, and everyone who came out to take it in.

last month saw the in-person release of interior landscapes, a project that celebrates the creation of three new works born from collaboration between visual and sonic artists throughout eastern canada. we are very pleased to release these short films online alongside q&a sessions with the artists – check it out on our youtube channel.

thanks to sawtooth (sarah albu, matti pulkki), caitlin b. whelan, jing xia, amery sandford, xia-3 , heather rumancik, vainweather (kate read, tiber reardon music, benton roark, michelle lacour), and everyone else involved for being a part of interior landscapes.
