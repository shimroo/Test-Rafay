the children's alliance offers the evidence-based model approach to partnerships in parenting preparation programs. the mapp approach rests on four cornerstone principles to promote foster and adoptive parent readiness.



























partnership
mapp prepares prospective foster and adoptive parents to partner with families to offer the best possibility for family reunification and to ensure healthy family connections while children are separated from family. 











healing
mapp provides foster and adoptive caregivers with the knowledge and critical skills to support healing for children and youth while they are in foster care…and sometimes as an ongoing resource.











mutual selection
mapp ensures both prospective foster and adoptive parents and agency staff make a mutual decision about readiness for foster caregiving. there are multiple opportunities for consultation and self-reflection.  











integrated learning
mapp combines the best of adult learning principles and child welfare content delivery.  caregivers retain important concepts and are prepared to support children in foster care.
