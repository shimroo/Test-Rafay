from naiia members 


















						the naiia is an amazing relationship building vehicle. there’s not a single piece of business that we get that
cannot be related to someone we met at naiia or who is connected to someone we met, etc.					


peter crosapeter j. crosa & co., st. petersburg, fl 






						do you remember when sally field received an oscar and in her acceptance speech she said, “you like me,
right now, you like me!” …. i thought that was a different, unusual speech… now, i understand it! what
she meant was she now knew she belonged with the elite of her industry.  i felt that way when my
membership application to the naiia was approved.  i felt like our firm had “arrived”.					


david mcculloughcentral adjustment co., inc., little rock, ar 






						the naiia provides its members with opportunities to associate with firms from across the country that
provide similar services to the insurance industry.  through these opportunities, member firms are able
support each other and learn from each other.					


donald e. lederer, cpcu, aic, aim, armjohns eastern company, inc., lakewood ranch, fl 






						it brings friendship, affords networking, and allows you to further one’s knowledge both as an adjuster and
business owner among your peers.					


michael nardulli, rpa, ciu, ciaexecutive general adjuster, mclarens, patchogue, ny 






						our company is a member of naiia, and has been for decades, because the organization offers benefits far
greater than very affordable membership and conference fees. these benefits include an open phone line to
many of the greatest claims minds in the claims industry whenever we have a need or question. the
regional and annual meetings are always content rich, and we enjoy the relationships that we have
developed with other members over the years.					


michael j. marsh, rpa, cpia, cia, ciumidland claims service, inc., billings, mt 






						the reason our firm is a member of the naiia is that it is the most professional adjusters’ organization in
the country. networking with likeminded industry professionals has been most beneficial for our firm which
we have enjoyed since the 1940’s.					


charles j. (chuck) reilly, jr., cpcu, rpa, cpauedward r. reilly & co., inc., new york 






						during my 50 plus years as an independent adjuster and 30 plus years owning an independent adjusting
firm i am still of the opinion that if you want to grow your business, join the naiia, and network with a
group of professionals who exemplify the best of the best.					


roy c. hintonclaims service corporation of america, richmond, va 






						i have been a member of the naiia for over 30 years.  i recommend joining the naiia as fast as you can.					


chris koningkoning & associates, san jose, ca 






						i consider the members of the naiia to be the best of the best adjusters, with high standards of integrity
and leadership being hallmarks of the association.  the naiia banner assures my clients that they are hiring
the best. additionally, the relationships built through the association are rewarding on many levels.					


rock phillipsr.k. phillips & associates, houston, tx 






						being part of a 200+ member organization has created opportunities for our firm to network with other
independent adjusting firms throughout the country, generating business for our firm. it has also provided
a platform on a larger scale for our members to voice their opinions and have an impact within the
insurance industry.					


nino a. berardi, rpal. j. shaw & company, lombard, il 






						this is one of the best organizations i have been associated with. i have met so many wonderful folks and
developed relationships with numerous ia owners and adjusters that have become great resources.					


jon o’neal,bitco insurance companies, little rock, ar 






						the naiia and their members are experts in the insurance claim industry.  claims are complicated.  claims
are at the heart of the insurance promise!  my company does not have boots on the ground throughout the
country.  boots on the ground is where the naiia and their members work their magic.  naiia members
know the local lay of the land in terms of rules, regulations, codes, contractors, and costs.  they know
claims and excel at customer service!   whether it be wildfire claims in the west, hurricane claims in the
south, or freeze claims in the midwest, i know help from an naiia expert is only a phone call away.
