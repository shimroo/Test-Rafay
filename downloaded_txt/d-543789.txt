welcome
            to somos primos, a publication dedicated to past and present
            articles, events and information concerning hispanic heritage
            issues. somos primos is an all volunteer effort.  there is no cost for accessing issues.  

           
        










            the editorial focus of somos primos is to connect present day
            situations to its historical foundation. the goal is to awaken all
            those with a heritage connection, a link to spain/hispania, to the fact,
            that we are walking, following in the footsteps of our
            ancestors. whether that path is clear to our vision or not, we are
            in the midst of that road. 

 it is imperative that we grasp the unique
            and individual part in world history, and especially united states
            history, that our grand-parents played. the contributions of our
            ancestors are important to understand the many social issues of
            today.

            whether the umbrella title is hispanic or latino, the problem is one
            of a confused and distorted image. who are we? the identity problem
            is based on many historical occurrences, political and social
        factors which are currently being explored, on many levels.

        somos primos originated in 1986 with a different name.  it was
        first as a flyer posting upcoming meetings for a hispanic research study
        group in orange county, california. the study group grew into a
        non-profit, and the flyer developed into somos primos, a quarterly for
        the now named society of hispanic historical and ancestral research,
        shhar, 
 a
        28- page hard copy published from 1990 to 1999. www.shhar.net 
        is distributing a cd of those ten years.  

january
        2000, the first issue of  the monthly somosprimos.com was posted
        online. as increasing amount of information was shared by individuals
        and groups, the online issues grew to a journal length monthly.  

        somos primos online exposure resulted in many and increasing national
        [project for promoting spanish language heritage and history. in
      2004, somos primos was invited to assist in organizing the first
      conference on hispanic heritage ever held at the national archives in
      washington, d.c. "hispanics and the formation of the american
      people"  during 2005 we were involved with and facilitated six heritage
      events.  for more information, please go
      to:  nara

in 2012 the national council of la raza invited somos primos to
        participate in their national conference, held in las vegas. we
        were invited again in 2013,  held in new orleans, a very
        historic city.  read
            more

the goal of somos primos has been to encourage
        family history research, with the mission of strengthening families by
        compiling correct heritage information.   

        purpose: strengthening
        the individual's self identity and heritage,  with a bridge to the past, and a connection to the
        present.

my goal was to take those of us with spanish surnames in
        the united states back spain and southern europe, to the origination of
        the surnames we were carrying.  i wanted to show us all over the
        world, and in every time period.  i wanted to show how our roots
        were entrenched in the history of the world, and had shaped the
        establishment, growth and development of the united states.  i
        wanted to show that we had every reason to be proud of our roots, our
        heritage, and our spanish surnames.  i wanted to show that we were
        of mixed racial heritage, with indigenous, african, asian, anglo and
        middle-east blood.   

        we are primos with the whole world.  

        i was hopeful that this knowledge embedded within our hearts would make
        us grateful to be latino americans, and create in us a bold patriotic
        stand.  our ancestors, and we now, are part of the great political
        experiment, of freedom and justice for all.  let us use our
        energies as did our ancestors to maintain the freedom . . .  based
        on equal treatment under the law to help.   through wars and
        turmoil, we reached the highest level of freedom, equality and social
        order in recorded history. let us unify to uphold our treasure, the
        united states of america.
