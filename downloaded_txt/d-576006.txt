about

locws international is an award-winning artist-led organisation that was established in 1999 by artists david hastie and tim davies with the aim of making the arts more accessible to the public. based in the city of swansea, the organisation has developed a range of educational and participatory activities that enables members of the community to take part in and broaden their understanding of the arts.
 




over 18 years the organisation has delivered its art across the city programme, which has built up an impressive archive of projects with the delivery of over 100 commissioned public artworks for accessible public spaces across the city and an award-winning arts outreach and learning programme that has enabled thousands of people from across the district to take part and learn about the arts in an open and accessible way.
