                                                delayed envelope delivery
                                            



please note that many envelope deliveries have been delayed due to several usps holidays as well as the size of the easter mailing being larger, necessitating hand sorting. we have been advised that they are still in the delivery process. please use a blank envelope in the meanwhile ensuring that your last name is clearly written on the front.
