furthermore
furthermore supports publication of nonfiction books that concern the arts, history, and the natural and built environment. since its inception, the program has assisted more than 1,400 books with grants that total over $8 million. it was founded by joan k. davidson, who loved books for the role they play in recording our world and cultivating reflection. furthermore is currently on hiatus as the fund considers how to best honor joan’s memory and legacy as a philanthropist, civic leader and champion of the publishing arts. please join our email list if you’d like to receive updates.
