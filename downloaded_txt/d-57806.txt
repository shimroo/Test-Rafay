background

                pennsylvania is a national leader in agricultural production. pennsylvania agriculture provides products such as apples, grain, and livestock to countries around the world, yet many pennsylvanians don't even realize what is available within a few miles of their homes. local farmers may not be aware that the supplies that they are looking for are available in the next county. area businesses that use agricultural products might not know that what they need is available locally.
