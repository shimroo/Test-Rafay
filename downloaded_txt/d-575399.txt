welcome to the rotunda














i'll try to make this as simple as it's always been: progressing past this point indicates you understand that there are rude comments, dangerous ideas, and even (gasp) naked people here. i am not your parent, guardian, or a defender of whatever you consider to be "decent", "moral" or otherwise in the best interests of the politically correct mafioso. this holds true even if you entered the site via a direct link that skips this page.


clicking "enter" or the rotunda artworks banner will send you to the site proper. if you're so panicky that big brother (your boss, the church, or your mommy) are about to bust you that you are incapable of clicking the "back" button on your browser, click the "leave" button. all flames sent to /dev/null. no warranty is expressed or implied. read the goddamn constitution sometime.


it should also be noted that i have finally designed this site using cascading style sheets (css). this means that older internet explorer, netscape, and other browsers might render the pages oddly, though i have tried to put in alternative links to get around where ever possible. i strongly recommend you upgrade your browser, if you can. the latest versions of aol, netscape, omni, opera, and ie will all work correctly as far as i know.
