the signing process can differ according to what is contained in the lpa, but this will not be a problem for you because we will give you detailed and personalised step-by-step instructions for what to do e.g.ensure a and b are in the room with you. turn to page 13 and sign in box 14 while a and b watchthe instructions are so precise and easy to follow that we have yet to hear of one of our lpas being refused registration.please read our note at the bottom of this page regarding the cost of registration of an lpa.


we give you direct access to all of the documents you will need over the lifetime of your lpa, including all of the documentation required to register it.(please read our note at the bottom of this page regarding the cost of registration of an lpa.)


the questionnaire is a simple multiple-choice format and allows you to complete either just an lpa-pa, or an lpa-pa plus an lpa-hw.(don't worry if you only want an lpa-hw  you can choose which documents to purchase at the end)when you've completed the questionnaire, all you then have to do is check the summary, pay, download, print and sign.(please read our note at the bottom of this page regarding the cost of registration of an lpa.)


when you've completed the questionnaire we show you a simple plain english summary of your lpa, so you can check that what you've entered corresponds to what you want the document to say.if you find something wrong, you can go back and correct it. alternatively if you've no more time to spare you can save your details and come back later.at this point you will still not have been asked to pay anything.


you can choose to purchase any or all of the following:-lpa-palpa-hw (if you've completed one) document correction, printing, and binding (additional charge)


a ‘lasting power of attorney - property & financial affairs’ (‘lpa-pa’) allows you to appoint somebody to look after your money and property and other related affairs if for any reason you become unable to manage them yourself e.g. you suffer an accident and are confined to bed or hospitalyou suffer a more serious accident which permanently incapacitates youyou become mentally incapacitated or develop dementia as a result of old age or for some other reason(note: the lpa-pa effectively replaces the old enduring power of attorney (epa))


a ‘lasting power of attorney  health and welfare’ (‘lpa-hw’) allows you to appoint somebody to make personal health and welfare (including, if you specify in the lpa-hw, life-sustaining treatment) decisions on your behalf if for any reason you become unable to make them yourself e.g. you suffer an accident and are confined to bed or hospitalyou suffer a more serious accident which permanently incapacitates youyou become mentally incapacitated or develop dementia as a result of old age or for some other reason


the questionnaire is a simple multiple-choice format and allows you to complete either just an lpa-pa, or an lpa-pa plus an lpa-hw.don't worry if you only want an lpa-hw  you can choose which documents to purchase at the end.


as current legislation stands, if somebody has to go into long term care the local authority has the power to seize all but £23,250 of their assets as a contribution towards the cost of that care.up until april 2015 that included being able to force the sale of their home, but from april 2015 (under a new ‘universal deferred payments scheme’, intended to prevent anyone from having to sell their home in their lifetime to pay for residential care) local authorities will instead be able to take an interest-bearing charge on the property of an individual against the cost of care fees, to be repaid after the individual’s death. interest will be chargeable throughout the lifetime of the deferred payment.so, whilst your home will not be sold while you are alive, its value will still be used to pay for your care costs - preventing you from being able to pass it on to your loved ones.this issue is real: official government statistics show that the some 69,000 homes each year have their equity used to fund long term care (which is equivalent to one home every four minutes).if you are a couple and you jointly own your home then your home is at risk of being taken from your loved ones once you have both passed on, sold, and used to pay for the costs - plus interest - of your long term care.however, you can easily protect at least 50% of your home by making a pair of protective property trust wills.


click the large ‘start here’ button and we will lead you through the very simple 2-step process of protecting your home from the local authority:-making protective property trust willsensuring that you own your home as ‘tenants in common’that’s all there is to it. if you are interested in the detail of how it all works, please read ‘how do protective property trust wills work?’ further down this page.


your wills will be straightforward mirror wills that include a ‘protective property trust’. you will also be able to specify gifts and/or legacies, state who you wish to inherit your estate, and appoint guardians for any children you have under 18.in other words, your protective property trust wills will cover your entire requirement for a will and not just the ‘property protection’ angle.


for your property protection trust wills to work, you must jointly own your property as ‘tenants in common’.you dont need to know what this means (although see ‘frequently asked questions’ further down this page if you are curious). all you need to know is that:-we will lead you through the simple process of checking if you need to take action then we will lead you through the simple process of creating the necessary documentation (note if this is necessary there is a further £41.65+vat charge for this part of the service).

on august 17th 2015 a new european regulation came into force. the new regulation is technically called regulation 650/2012
but is more commonly known as ‘brussels iv’.this regulation allows you to now override the ‘forced heirship’ succession laws in an eu country in which you hold assets
and instead have the succession laws of the country of your nationality apply.
all new wills made at tenminutewill.co.uk allow you to take advantage of this new regulation.
