			national yo-yo museum
		





the national yo-yo museum features the worlds largest public display of yo-yo, yo-yo memorabilia, and contest awards.
the national yo-yo museum is open in conjunction with business hours for bird in hand and is free to enjoy as a self-guided tour. docent led guided visits are available to groups by special arrangement.
big-yo: the scaled up working version of the iconic 3-in-1 no jive from tom kuhn.
our centerpiece is big-yo, the scaled up working version of the iconic no-jive 3-in-1 from tom kuhn. at 256 pounds, big-yo made it into the 1982 guinness book of world records claiming the title of ‘worlds biggest working wooden yo-yo’. and yes, it does really work. you’ve heard of paul bunyan right? actually, with the assistance of a large crane and a skilled operator, big-yo can successfully make its way up and down the string.
