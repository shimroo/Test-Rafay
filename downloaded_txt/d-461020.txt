"thanks for taking the time to browse my web site. i hope you will enjoy viewing my art work as much as i have enjoyed creating it. true historical art is very time consuming but also very rewarding. it is exciting when i add color and texture to a canvas and bring to life an event we all know but have never really seen. making history live is what my work is all about."
