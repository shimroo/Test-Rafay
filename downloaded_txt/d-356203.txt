our vision is that through the power of the holy spirit, youth 2000 will raise up a new generation of saints to evangelise the nations. 













our mission is for every young person to be connected to friends, committed to christ and his church, commissioned for the mission & set on fire with the holy spirit.













we hope to see young people devoted to the eucharist and mary, who invite their generation into relationship with jesus, rebuild the church, and transform society into a civilisation of love.













we provide retreats, formation and opportunities for young people to encounter god in the heart of the catholic church










all for jesus through mary.
