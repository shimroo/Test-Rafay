hair accessories





i adore hair slides, so obviously love making them. i have a little collection made now so thought i would show you. all of these are for sale in my folksy shop. enjoy!







<--- a trio of purple and brown coloured slides, purple and brown are my two favourite colours, i had to make something with these!


winter blues ---->







these slides i call the 'nature beach' slides as they remind me of summer's nature. i've included a real shell found in a beach here in ireland and a stunning beautiful fabric button with a butterfly on.
i love these ones







these orange and yellow slides are perfect for brightening up any old plain outfit. the colours beautifully complement each other and the set is truely unique.






i think these slides are so kitsch and cute. 'polka dot rain' a gorgeous trio.








my last set of hair slides in my shop are my favourite set.
also completely unique, they consist of 3 stunning vintage style chic slides!
i'll let the picture speak for itself


i hope you enjoyed my hair slides! 
thanks!

p.s. all are £10 a set if you have to have them!
