beatlemania now - the world's best beatles tribute band



























phil roura of the new york daily news called the ( beatlemania now ) showâ âa fab forceâ and said,
âevery now and then a show comes along that doesnât just entertain but has a sense of history. that's exactly what you'll get at beatlemania now, a tribute to the fab fourâ¦( as seen on broadway & around the world )
beatlemania now â isâ quite extraordinary ;
			createdâ with affection for it's subject matter, it enriches the present while honoring the pastâ.
			through 5â scenes and costume changes the shows' cast performs live on stage against a backdrop of stunning images spanning the most exciting and turbulent decade of modern times... the 60âs!
roura further wrote,
âas a beatles' songbook opens, a grainy portrait of the 1960's unfolds on the screen. one moment, there is the innocence of kennedy's camelot. next the searing loss of jfk's assassination. the image flickers and then martin luther king jr. dreaming of a different america, flashes onto the screen. in an instant it is over, consumed by the horrors of vietnam and the drug culture it spawned.
			all of these events influenced the beatles - from their pop music beginningsâ in liverpool, through their triumphant invasion of america in 1964 and their eventual breakup. audiences get that feeling of the passage of time as timeless songs like âshe loves youâ, âyesterdayâ and âstrawberry fields foreverâ, are played, climaxing with âhey judeâ.
			itâs an exhilarating performance.
			from the moment this amazing cast of ersatz beatles appear on stage
			in their tight dark suits and skinny ties,
			audience members remain under their spellâ¦
			and although they're all americans they sound as if they've just stepped off a plane from liverpool.
			itâs a show that should have you singing along,  dancing in the aisles and experiencing emotions you thought were long forgottenâ.
beatlemania now... the music transcends time and generations...a "must see and hear" experience for all ages!
			don't missâ beatlemania now!

after 50 years, beatlemania rocks washington anew
by robert macpherson (afp)

 washington â beatlemania returned to washington on tuesday when the fab four's earliest hits once again echoed through the venue where they played their first concert on us soil 50 years earlier.
		instead of screaming teenagers, the rather more adult sell-out crowd of 3,000 at the old washington coliseum initially opted to remain seated and sing along to beatles classics such as "i saw her standing there."
		but they sprung to their feet and erupted in dance at the opening chords of "i want to hold your hand" as a tribute band, beatlemania now, in moptop haircuts and sharp 1960s suits, ran through the original 12-song, 35-minute set.
		"there's a great energy in here. i feel i'm 16 instead of 66," banks told afp during an intermission, after which beatlemania now returned in full sergeant pepper regalia to play some later beatles numbers.
		sixties rocker tommy roe opened tuesday's concert, just as he did 50 years before, playing his then-hits "sheila" and "everybody" and reminiscing with the crowd.

after 50 years, beatles fans take magical history tour
by dan zak, updated: wednesday, february 12, 12:04 am


under the concrete ribs of the barrel-shell roof of a crumbling coliseumâ¦ the washington coliseum, the site of the beatlesâ first north american concert, on feb. 11, 1964... the capital awaits the beatles. or, rather, the beatles tribute band. the real thing is exactly 50 years gone on this tuesday night, in this exact spot in northeast d.c.,
beatlemania now, the expert imitators of that night 50 years ago, are being watched by a man who was there, opening for the beatles: the singer tommy roe.
		âitâs kind of spooky,â says roe, who will now open for an imitation, half a century later. also, says roe: âsurreal.â
		but on this night, for one night only again, the beatles haunt the coliseum in shadows and echoes.
		they have to go on at 8:31, because thatâs when the beatles went on.
		and they do, as they did, and they bang out the hits that were banged out before. âi saw her standing there,â âi want to hold your hand,â âshe loves you.â
		a lone redhead in the audience is standing and dancing during the first few songs. the rest of the crowd joins her, until everyone is shimmying upright for âtwist and shout,â
