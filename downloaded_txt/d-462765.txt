think for yourself





do we ever?  i mean, we all make decisions and once we do we second guess it once someone we tell disagrees with the decision we made.

fear of my birthday





i haven't had a birthday i've looked forward to in a long time. last year i was depressed cause i was in a relationship that was ending and i had almost lost a friend. the year before, i found something bad out about one of my friends and i've told no one. the year before i had just moved here, had a fight with my ex and was depressed.  2 birthdays in the past i recieved phone calls telling me my dad had taken out loans under my name and never paid them. thanks to him i have bad credit. this year i am at the dr's office for a sickness i've had fr 3 weeks and told no one about. the dr's reaction made me nervous and what he had to tell me made me scared, upset and depressed. apparently i can't eat seafood, dairy products or drink. that doesn't sound so bad except for the fact i mostly eat seafood and i have my birthday/going away party this week. he also has me going for 3 tests. one test today and 2 in a couple of days. he also wants me to take tomorrow off from work. that sounds nice except i could use the money and i already have been sick so much this year. i'm pretty confused. my birthdays scare me when they approach.

r.i.p. studio 60





i'm glad i didn't do another vlog to get my hopes up.a few months back i made an announcement on my other blog jeanspants.blogspot.com that studio 60 was canceled.  well about a month ago my friend mike who works for nbc sent me an emailing stating that studio 60 will take er's time slot at the end of may to air it's remaining episodes. usually this means the networks wait and see to see if a new time slot and new day will bring more viewers to help save a show.well, nbc's fall lineup is up online and no studio 60.  so this means that nbc airing studio 60 at the end of the month is just a favor to fans like me. should i be grateful?no "studio 60", no "arrested development", no "action" (an old show with jay mohr), no "freaks and geeks", no "dead like me". i guess i should just be happy that people now watch "the office". i was scared there for a while.

damn, shit, that is whack!





i did it. i started this new blog so i can dedicate my other one to doing a show of some sort.  now that i made this step, what's next? what's my show about exactly?  do i have a cast? do i have writers?  is it just me with the 1 tripod doing things the same way i've been doing them or is there something new up my sleeve that i haven't found yet?  i have people interested in helping me create something funny and entertaining that may appeal to the masses but our schedules are always opposite.thats not the only reason why i haven't posted a new video. this has been a pretty busy week for me. i helped a friend move which was a combination of shitty and fun, i've been trying to spend more time with mollye and i've had another crappy/busy weekend at work which just drained my energy.i'm still having a little trouble trying to figure out final cut pro. mike showed me how to use it a while back and i'm still having a tough time with it. so that probably means i need to ask him when he might be free to show me what i'm doing wrong.  plus he's been really busy with project pedal for the last few months now so we haven't really just hung out for a while now and i would really like to make time for that too. if you don't know what project pedal is then go to projectpedal.com.    shout out yo!so please bare with me for a short time. there should be a video up shortly. hopefully i wont let any of you down.  for the time being, i hope you enjoy anything i might post here. i will leave you with the trailer for the one movie i am so looking forward to this summer. it's 25 days away from today. woo hoo!!!!

i've been tagged, that sucks!





ok, so mike from caliblog.com (that son of a bitch) tagged me. i've been tagged to name 7 of my favorite songs and seven strange habits i might have.let's do the habits.1. i'm a bigger fan of sleeping on the floor then sleeping in a bed. is that weird?  well it gets weirder. when i sleep on the floor i prefer to be close to a wall.2.when i'm home alone and have nothing to do i prefer to find something to do with someone. but, when i cant find anything to do or anywhere to go i tend to get some of my best ideas on paper or video. but there are days i have stayed home with the goal to get work done only to achieve nothing. 3. i have double jointed thumbs.4. my obsession with the entertainment industry is thanks to my parents. i was raised by a vcr.  what i need to do is get on one of those game shows dedicated to movie pop culture. i can tell you just about when any movie came out in the 80's/early 90's and what there box office take was. let me just say that the summer of 1989 was a great year for the motion picture industry.4. i have this strange obsession and hatred with death.  i can't explain it. it could be the fact i've been to more funerals and wakes then anyone i know. being sometimes atheist and sometimes agnostic i just cant help but wonder, is there a soul, where does it go, if theres no soul then what happens. do we just cease to exist? then there are times i contemplate getting cremated or buried. what makes more sense? there are so many graves that just sit in one spot for eternity with no one to visit them. its a waste of space. so cremation makes more sense. but then i think we should all be put in the dirt with out a box or anything. that way we can all become one with the earth.5.theres a movie out there called "the midnight hour". it sucks! but i need to watch it once every halloween.  it was a tv movie about zombies and vampires made for abc and aired the night after halloween back n 1985. when i was a kid i loved it. they actually released it on dvd for a limited time back in 2000 for $19.95. i bought it of course. if you go on amazon now you can buy it for the low price of $285 dollars. yup, i said $285 dollars heres the linkhttp://www.amazon.com/midnight-hour-jonelle-allen/dp/6305971714/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-1917895-1679020?ie=utf8&s=dvd&qid=1177654131&sr=1-16.i have trouble reading fiction which is strange since all i do is write and create fantasy.  i do have adhd which makes it a lot harder to read in general but when i know a story is real, i find it easier to focus.7.i've always wanted a real aunt or uncle and i also want to be an uncle.  its just desire i have.  also for some reason i always wanted a sister. i still want the brother i have, i just also wanted a sister.now i guess this is where i will wrote my 7 favorite songs/1. charlene by stephen and the colberts2. paris by a faulty chromosome3. the adventure final by angels and airwaves4. we built this city by starship....because the song is fun...dont judge me5. brian wilson by barenaked ladies6. bad moon rising by credence clearwater revival7. anything george clintonnow im suppose to tag 7 people so please forgive me. mollye, claire aka little miss sunshine, rissa, spinning girl jillie aka nurserachete, bex, trailerboy.

welcome to the new world of pants





here's the story.  i want to separate the blog from the video blog.  to do this i have created a new page.  this is it.  i would like for  jeanspants.blogspot.com to be strictly video and hopefully fun.  this page is where i'll get my write on. get it? as opposed to my groove on, i get my write on?  forget it.i thought i might talk about my weekend starting with thursday night. on this night mollye and i had sort of a misunderstanding/miscommunication.  as i result i didn't get much sleep because i like to see her happy and i wasn't going to wake her to find a way  to fix things. that would suck.  so i didn't get much sleep.friday night everything between us was good again and since i didn't get much sleep the night before i passed out at midnight.  that never happens. but my body did get up at 4am and it never went back to sleep which sucks because i had to work in retail hell at 9am and it was a saturday.  that was going to suck, and it did.so that saturday customers were complete assholes. more so than usual.1. a customer called me an "asshole".2. i customer asked "what the fuck is wrong with you" (her was referring to the store i work for)3. i was referred to as euro-trash.  that was weird4. a kid kicked me to get my attention.5. an employee decided that while i was talking to a customer she would poke he a few times to get my attention and then when i didn't respond to her because i was in mid sentence, she pulled my hair.  that was awesome.6.  for some reason that day i kept having dizzy spells and i had to sneak off the floor to sit down.7. i was emotionally and mentally messed up that day too. when i had a customer that was nice to me i would thank them a lot. i also tried my hardest to help them those leave the store happy. the way my store works is the customer is suppose to write everything down themselves. it's kind of the policy.  when a customer was nice to me i would stay with them and write it down for them.  thinking back on it, was i nice or was i just afraid to leave the nice people to possibly encounter an asshole?so this post wasn't fun at all was it.  this is why i wanted this type of stuff separated from the videos.  my goal on that page is to make you laugh and entertain which i hope i do.  i would hate to put up a fun video then immediately follow it with something grumpy and dull. like this post.
