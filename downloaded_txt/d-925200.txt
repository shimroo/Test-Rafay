what's available in ebook formatall twelve miss zukas mysteries are on the amazon kindle. and the nook ...all three ruby crane mysteries. ...and two of my three young peoples' books originally published by atheneum: glom gloom, a fantasy, and  the lone sentinel, a science fiction. for those who've asked about the difference in prices of the miss zukas mysteries, it's because prices are set by my publisher, avon/harpercollins for the tenth and eleventh titles.****
