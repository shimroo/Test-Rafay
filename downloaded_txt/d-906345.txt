unstable angina







unstable angina is angina that occurs without any physical or emotional exertion precipitating it. this type of angina needs immediate medical attention as it can be signs of a heart attack.



although the symptoms of unstable angina and stable angina are the same the frequency, the duration of the pain, and the causes are different. unstable angina can occur due to a spasm in a artery or a rupture of plaque on the arterial walls. this type of angina should be treated immediately without any delays in the nearest emergency room.

stable angina







stable angina is a symptom of heart disease. it is usualy precipitated by exertion or emotional stress, and exacerbated by having a full stomach or cold temperatures (the "4 es": exertion, emotion, eating and extreme temperature).



an attack usually comes on with a sudden seizure of pain, felt at first over the region of the heart, but radiating through the chest in various directions, and frequently extending down the left arm. a feeling of constriction and of suffocation accompanies the pain, although there is seldom actual difficulty in breathing.

when the attack comes on, as it often does, in the course of some bodily exertion, the sufferer is at once brought to rest, and during the continuance of the paroxysm experiences the most intense agony.the countenance becomes pale, the surface of the body cold, the pulse feeble, and death appears to be imminent, when suddenly the attack subsides and complete relief is obtained.

stable angina can be treated by taking a nitroglycerine either prior to a period of known exertion or by taking the nitroglycerine during the actual angina attack.

stable and unstable angina







physicians distinguish between stable and unstable angina

stable angina

occurs during exercise or stress, and is relieved with a nitrate spray or tablet.

ustable angina

occurs at rest, or is unrelieved by the usual medication, a patient with pains that is increasing in frequency or severity is also said to have ''unstable angina''.

unstable angina is very predictive of a future heart attack, and requires immediate medical attention.

these are the questions that you will be asked by your doctor to determine if you have stable or unstable angina.

quality- how does it feel?
location- where does it bother you?
severity- how bad is it? on a scale from one to ten how would you describe it?
provocation- what brings on the situation? exertion? cold? at rest?
onset- does it come suddenly or gradually?
relieving factors- what reduces or eliminates the pain?
frequency- how often does it occur?
association- do you have any problems along with it?
duration- how does it last?


if you think you may have angina

if you do think you may have angina pains regardless if it is stable or unstable angina pains.don't delay, it is better to be safe and healthy then sorry and…

being brave and disregarding the pains and symptoms of angina can be extremely detrimental. if the symptoms are real and the underlying cause is coronary heart disease delaying can cause a heart attack.

if a heart attack does occur nearly 50% of those attacked never make it, and those that do, their hearts are damaged for ever.

why take the chance? call a doctor or an ambulance immediately it is better being safe then dead.

what is angina?





angina pectoris (latin for "chest constriction") is the result of a lack of oxygen supply to the heart muscle, due to reduced blood flow around the heart's blood vessels. this lack of oxygen to the heart is known as myocardial ischemia.

angina pectoris is a common symptom of myocardial ischemia, which people with coronary artery disease are most often affected by. it is caused by stimulation of nerve endings in the heart muscle and its blood vessels.

angina the most common symptom of heart disease





angina is one of the most difficult symptoms of heart disease to describe. all heart patients feel it differently and describe it differently.

it is described as a burning, constricting, strangling, pressurized, full, heavy, aching crushing sensation pain explosion permeating in the chest, upper body, upper arm, jaw and upper back.

personally, i have difficulty describing it. to me it seems to feel like a combination of all of the above, and not always do they come concurrently. at times it feels like my chest is exploding, at other times it feels like a clamp attached to the middle of my chest and the center of my back is being tightened and screwed inwards.

if you are in pain don't delay, it is better to be safe and healthy then sorry . being brave and disregarding the pains a can be extremely detrimental. if the symptoms are real and the underlying cause is coronary heart disease delaying can cause a heart attack.

if a heart attack does occur nearly 50% of those attacked never make it, and those that do, their hearts are damaged for ever. why take the chance? call a doctor or an ambulance immediately it is better being safe then dead.
