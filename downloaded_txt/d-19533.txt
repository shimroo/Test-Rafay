news:
one in three american women will have an abortion in their lifetime. we are your mothers, daughters, teachers, students, co-workers,  and friends. read the   story from tanika, a 38 year old mother, in our collection of personal stories. and the one from solene who  learned to listen without judging. you can also share your story.
important life decisions such as when and whether to have a baby belong to the woman who is pregnant.  we say: trust women. 
we recommend  rachel maddow's documentary on the assassination of dr. george tiller, a kind-hearted wichita kansas physician who treated  women with respect and expert care when no one else would provide them with health care.
