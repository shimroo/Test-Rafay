flea markets | vendors | wholesale
since 1999, 

we have invited flea markets across the country to submit information on their 

markets.

keysfleamarket.com continues to be the most popular resource for treasure 

hunters, bargain shoppers, and organized bus tours! here you will find them 

all... from the smallest to the very largest, indoor and/or outdoor, rural and 

urban, all organized by state, for your convenience. 


       while every effort is made to ensure the information published here is 

correct and up to date, we encourage people to always call the market before 

planning a road trip.
