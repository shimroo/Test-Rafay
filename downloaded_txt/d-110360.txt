plu graduates are difference makers who engage the world in all its complexity with open minds and caring hearts. they’re engaged citizens who strive to serve the common good, and who are local, regional and global leaders in fields like health care, technology, the performing arts, and education.



allan belton, president
pacific lutheran university





my plu education taught me to think critically, challenge the status quo, and advocate for my community. plu was also where i found my passion for both the outdoors and environmental advocacy.  i fell in love with puget sound and mount rainier and enjoyed exploring both...i loved my time at plu.



shannon murphy ‘07, president
washington conservation voters





plu is a caring community that allows you to make mistakes, express yourself foolishly and ultimately be yourself. your beliefs, values and thoughts will be challenged and you will get the opportunity to reassess these in a supportive environment. this will either strengthen and solidify your beliefs or change them, allowing space for new seeds to grow.



oni mayer ‘19, student-athlete
former asplu vice president





i can’t imagine myself anywhere else. my time at plu has made me more thoughtful in my actions, more passionate about my work, and has shown me what it means to care for your community. these values make me a better leader and i have plu to thank for that.



kennedy gwin ‘20, current student
former asplu president
