xygz : the white cloud 2011





check out our friend xygz's latest installation, a customized porsche cayenne. the full body kit is just the the tip of the iceberg on this transformation. inspired by the city of guangzhou and the legendary monkey king, the subtle detailing on the white cloud sets it apart from the all obnoxious designs we see on tv. it could be viewed as a unique statement about the influence of western capitalism in china and its impact on art and culture or just a sik whip to ride in to this brave new world called china.          xygz: xygz : the white cloud 2011: "this customised porsche cayenne was inspired by the city of guangzhou china and the legend of the monkey king. the monkey king travelled on..."

look inside 2011





its been a while... but id is far from dead. i have spent much of the last few years in my apartment/studio cutting stencil, painting canvas, and making art. i finally put the collection together a few weeks ago and hosted an exhibition of my work. we released a book as well featuring some of the work i have done with my accomplices in china, indonesia, and ghana. it has been an awesome trip and the exhibition was the perfect way to bring closure to one era and present new adventures on the horizon. ever ready, ever sure, we will continue to create and try to make sense of our time in this space. miss you z.  much love and respect to all ma peeps who made it out, the ma familia who could not be here.
