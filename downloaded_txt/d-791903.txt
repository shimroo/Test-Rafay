                “jack olsen was a respected journalist and prolific writer who pioneered the genre of "true crime." olsen also wrote fiction and books about sports and social issues, but it was his true-crime writing that earned him national acclaim and readership. the washington post gave him the title of "dean of true-crime authors." olsen preferred to be characterized as a hard-nosed reporter seeking the truth and getting it right....”

salt of the earth

joe gere said he died on the afternoon his twelve-year-old daughter brenda disappeared. it was left to brenda's mother elaine to sustain her stricken family, search for her missing child, and pressure the authorities for justice. from the first minutes of the investigation, suspicion fell on michael kay green, a steroid-abusing "mr. universe" hopeful, but there was no proof of a crime, leaving police and prosecutors stymied.tips and sightings poured in as lawmen and volunteers combed the cascades forest in the biggest search on northwest history. years passed with no sight of the blue-eyed girl or the bright clothes she'd worn on the day she disappeared, but elaine remained undaunted. salt of the earth is the true story of how one woman fought and triumphed over life-shattering violence and how she healed her family-and herself.

night of the grizzlies

for more than half a century, grizzly bears roamed free in the national parks without causing a human fatality. then in 1967, on a single august night, two campers were fatally mauled by enraged bears -- thus signaling the beginning of the end for america's greatest remaining land carnivore. night of the grizzlies, olsen's brilliant account of another sad chapter in america's vanishing frontier, traces the causes of that tragic night: the rangers' careless disregard of established safety precautions and persistent warnings by seasoned campers that some of the bears were acting "funny"; the comforting belief that the great bears were not really dangerous -- would attack only when provoked. the popular sport that summer was to lure the bears with spotlights and leftover scraps -- in hopes of providing the tourists with a show, a close look at the great "teddy bears." everyone came, some of the younger campers even making bold enough to sleep right in the path of the grizzlies' known route of arrival. this modern "bearbaiting" could have but one tragic result...

silence on monte sole

olsen's true story of the massacre of monte sole is an overwhelming account of an outrage that has remained buried among the forgotten atrocities of world war ii: the coldblooded murder by german soldiers of more than 1,800 italian civilians, men, women, and children in the fall of 1944. monte sole had the bad luck to lie on the main route of withdrawal of the retreating german armies â a route vitally important to field marshal albert kesselring. under the fierce command of il lupo (the wolf), the partisans of the stella rossa, headquartered in the hills of monte sole, harassed the germans by attacking convoys, derailing trains, even capturing the top-secret plans of the german gothic line. as the allied advance stormed up italy to the very shadow of monte sole, axis frustration reached its peak. with full authorization of kesselring, and with an infusion of dread ss reinforcements, the germans deliberately set out to neutralize monte sole. this massacre constitutes the core of olsen's monumental book, which brilliantly recounts in spare, almost dispassionate prose the life and death of monte sole.

aphrodite desperate mission

this is the incredible story of the most incredible mission of world war ii ... born in desperation ... carried out with foolhardy courage and at the cost of brave men's lives. because it was so daring, so super secret -- many of the facts revealed here were designated highly classified until now -- all sorts of fantastic stories sprang up about what actually happened. here, at long last, is the truth about aphrodite. in late 1942 and 1943, reports (see back page) reached allied intelligence that german super weapons of advanced design and terrifying power were being readied to snatch a nazi victory from the jaws of defeat. then, shortly after d-day, the first v-1 burst over london. as death rained down, from the skies (more than 300 v-l's were fired in one, twenty-four-hour period), the allies activated a desperate mission to stave off the threat of the dread german missiles ... and even deadlier rockets, known to be nearly operational, that threatened not only the british capital â but new york as well. heroic and tragic, brilliant and stupid, the full story of aphrodite â a real-life catch-22 â is a powerful exposition of military thinking and the bravery (and lunacy) of war.

the bridge at chappaquiddick

on the night of july 18-19, 1969, a black oldsmobile sedan plunged over the edge of a narrow bridge on chappaquiddick island, martha's vineyard. the overturned car, submerged in the swirling waters beside the bridge, was not discovered until morning. inside the car was the body of mary jo kopechne. a short while after the discovery -- though many hours after the time of the accident â edward moore kennedy, u.s. senator from massachusetts and a potential leading candidate for the presidency of the united states, walked into the edgartown police station on martha's vineyard and said that he had been the driver of the car. thus began yet another tragic ordeal involving a kennedy, an ordeal fraught with confusion, mysterious discrepancies and unforeseeable political consequences for both senator kennedy and the nation. in the weeks that followed, the accident and the events surrounding it, as they were explained and rumored and theorized upon, became, for many, only more mysterious, more suspect, more impenetrable. as the questions multiplied, the possible answers seemed to recede, until a majority of americans came to believe that the whole truth had not been told. according to some, the whole truth would never be known. a precise and detailed account of the hour-by-hour and day-by-day events of the accident, this carefully and closely researched account has been added a reconstruction of what may have actually happened on the night of july 18-19.

black is best

although perhaps the world's best known athlete, cassius clay (mohammed ali) was far more important as an american phenomenon of the 1960âs than as a prizefighter. in his career as a boxer, he followed a traditional, even a stereotyped road to the top for an african american, but his distortion of the american rags-to-riches story is peculiarly his own. when he defeated sonny liston for the world's heavyweight championship in 1964, he was hailed by press and public alike as the clean-cut kid who would, by his exemplary life, restore wholesomeness to the tainted world of boxing. three years later, he has made a hash of these earlier impressions. his affair with the black muslims, his outspoken support of black power, his inflammatory statements about vietnam and his controversial draft status have all contributed to the vilification to which he is currently subjected. olsen talked at length with those who surrounded clay â his family, his first boxing coach, his trainer, his physician, the group of white businessmen who gave him his start and dozens of others, thereby allowing those closest to the champion to offer, through observation and anecdote, their own interpretations of what makes cassius run. even more to the point, the author dogged clay's footsteps and his own account of what he saw and heard, including clay's extensive conversations, presents a firsthand record of the life of a truly puzzling personality. a classic sports biography.

the climb up to hell

the north wall of the eiger mountain, an awesome and storm-battered crag rising in the bernese alps, has long fascinated the world's best mountain climbers. almost every attempt to conquer it has resulted in defeat or disaster: eighteen men have died in the twenty assaults that have been made on it. the eiger's formidable history includes one of the strangest episodes in the annals of mountain climbing -- the 1957 expedition of the italians, corti and longhi, and the germans, nothdurft and mayer. one man alone, claudio corti, returned from that expedition, and he did so only with the help of some fifty of europe's finest climbers, assembled virtually overnight in a spectacular rescue attempt. corti and stefano longhi were climbers who depended more on strength and endurance than on skill and knowledge. nothdurft and mayer were among the best european mountaineers, but they attacked the eiger north wall almost whimsically, in the midst of a vacation, with inadequate preparation or planning beforehand. neither team knew the other was making the attempt. carefully researched and documented, the climb up to hell is a taut, edge-of-the-chair true adventure story.

predator

from childhood, mcdonald smith took to heart the lessons drummed into him by antisocial relatives and peers. as a teenager, unburdened by conscience or pity, he experimented with child abuse and bestiality, then moved on to larceny, stickups, incest, and, finally, rape. warned by a "witch" that he was about to be arrested, he fled los angeles for seattle and the northwest. there, for years, he stalked the women of seattle, seeking his prey on the dark streets and in the quiet homes, then returning to his wife and family: too careful â and too clever â to be caught. mac smith's luck held when a respectable young businessman named steve titus found himself charged with one of smith's most sadistic rapes in a nightmarish case of mistaken identity and injustice. the idealistic titus was certain that the american system of justice would clear him â right up to the day that a jury of his peers returned a verdict of guilty as charged. while mac smith continued to terrorize the women of seattle, titus lost everything: his reputation, his job, his loved ones, his freedom. it was only when a pulitzer prize-winning reporter answered titus's pleas for justice that the terrible truth emerged: a truth that was darker than anyone imagined.

the misbegotten son

from publisher's weekly "an experienced and skilled writer, olsen proves himself equal to the formidable task of studying serial killer arthur shawcross. born in 1945 in upstate new york, shawcross was perceived as different even in childhood (his classmates dubbed him "oddie," and elementary school officials called for mental health evaluations). in the early '70s he murdered two children and was sentenced to up to 25 years in prison; he served less than 15 years before he was paroled. he was difficult to place--townspeople drove him out as soon as his past became known. after three such episodes, parole officials sent him surreptitiously to rochester, n.y., where he killed at least 11 prostitutes. he was arrested in and eventually sentenced to 250 years in prison. during the trial, he claimed that he had been physically and sexually abused by his mother (untrue, the authorities concluded) and that he had committed horrible atrocities in vietnam (probably untrue). he did not fit the classic pattern of the sociopath, nor did he seem either schizophrenic or paranoid. it remained for psychiatrist richard kraus to hypothesize that physiology was the basis for shawcross's behaviorâhe diagnosed shawcross as suffering from a metabolic ailment known as pyroluria and an abnormal genetic constitution. told by olsen with contributions from others affected by shawcross's crimes, the story is a triumph of true-crime writing."

the last coyote

(previously published as slaughter the animals, poison the earth) it is the extermination of the coyote â a shrewd, wily, solitary scavengerâ that serves as the central theme of jack olsen's ragingly indignant, beautifully written and deeply moving book, perhaps the most gripping and important work of its kind since the publication of rachel carson's silent spring. poisoned, hunted, a bounty placed on their heads, their pelts nailed to fence posts, the coyotes symbolize the heartless and brutal way in which man has made the west his own as if nature had no place there. olsen describes how, in the vast stretches of the american west, the wildlife is being systematically exterminated for the profit of ranchers and stockmen ... with the cooperation of government agencies. hardest hit of all the animals are the great predators -- wildcats, wolves, eagles, bears, mountain lions, coyotes -- all now on the verge of extinction.

give a boy a gun

in this book, the story of claude lafayette dallas, jr., olsen takes on perhaps his most challenging assignment -- explicating the curious relationship between a homicidal young "mountain man" and those who saw in his colorful ways the embodiment of the cowboy mystique of the west. on a snow-blown day in january, dallas killed two game wardens who entered his trapping and poaching camp in ldahoâs owyhee desert. the cold-bloodedness of dallasâs crime shocked the west. stained with his victim's blood. he confessed to a companion, "this is murder one for me." then claude dallas vanished into the wild and rugged mountains that had sheltered him for so long. for fifteen long months he was the subject of an international manhunt until the fbi and a drawling country sheriff joined forces to run him to earth in a rain of bullets. only then did lawmen learn about the network of friends who had helped him elude capture. to some of dallas's rustic neighbors the deadly progression from cowboy to poacher to killer seemed justifiable, even admirable. only olsen, through painstaking research into dallas's background and exhaustive on-the-scene interviewing, could unravel such a rat's nest of contradictions and confusions and create so compelling a portrait of the killer whose bloody deeds might have been foreordained from childhood.

son

this is one of the most remarkable true crime books you will ever read. it is many things at once. for months, the story of a mother, a son and a city enmeshed in tragedy made headlines across the nation. this is the story behind the headlines. it is also an extraordinary examination of the mind of a psychopath and of the women -- and men -- who were his victims. and it is a chilling investigation of the consequences of a crime that does not kill but which destroys as surely as any knife or gun. for more than two years, a rapist prowled the night streets of the homey, "all-american" city of spokane, washington, terrorizing women, sparking a run on gun stores, and finally causing one newspaper to offer a reward, the calls taken by the distinguished managing editor himself, gordon coe. in march 1981, luck and inspired police work at last produced an arrest, and spokane shuddered. the man was clean-cut, teetotal, conservative -- and gordon coe's son. the family rallied behind fred coe. they had an explanation for everything. fred's mother, ruth, gave "son" detailed alibis for the rapes. but the evidence was overwhelming. as fred was led away, ruth coe was heard to say, "down, but not out." it was no mere gesture of defiance. ruth coe was bent on revenge, and soon the judge and the prosecuting attorney would feel the full force of her murderous wrath...

cold kill

david west loved cindy ray and was loved in return. or so he thought. the troubled young man clung to his new love and dreamed of their future together. so begins the chain of events that was to evolve into a horror of terrifying proportions. jack olsen reveals the details of a true-life romance gone hideously awry. after weeks of planning, the young misfits from two fine old texas families donned grotesque battle gear and crept into the luxurious home where cindy ray's parents lay asleep with her two small sons. in the hot muggy room, the "cold kill" was over in seconds. everyone who knew the unpredictable cindy suspected that she was involved, but the ghastly crime had been so carefully orchestrated that houston's top homicide detectives could get nowhere. cindy wore black and sobbed at the funeral, then began a frenzied attempt to collect her inheritance and as many of her wealthy parents possessions as she could haul away. no one except david west was surprised when she walked out on him.

have you seen my son?

have you seen my son? is jack olsen's powerful novel of child-snatching and a mother's obsessed hunt for her five-year-old son - "a gripping, intensely moving novel," writes robert daley, author of prince of the city and year of the dragon. "the ending left me with tears in my eyes. there is no love like mother love, is there?"
and no greater test of it than what lael pritcher is about to endure.
one cool april day, mike pritcher visits the home of his estranged wife, lael, and takes their son, ace, for an overnight outing. "she pushed her son's black-rimmed glasses up the slope of his thin nose. he jerked away like a puppy slipping its leash. a giggle, a crunch of gravel, a single wave of a grimy hand, and her only child was gone."
gone - child-snatched, though lael won't realize that right away, and won't understand what it means even when the police tell her it's a "domestic matter." "you got the right to snatch him back," her lawyer explains. "that's about it." so that's what she sets out to do, in one of the most suspenseful, emotion-wrenching novels in recent years. have you seen my son? is lael pritcher's story, as she searches for her son throughout the northwest, canada and finally mexico; an odyssey of near-misses and sudden reversals, searing loneliness and unshakable love, as lael reaches deep inside herself for a resourcefulness and strength she never knew existed. combining intimate drama with powerful suspense, this is a story with which every woman â and every man â will identify.

missing persons

missing persons is jack olsen's novel of contemporary suspense and horror, combining the shock and tension of a stranger is watching with the gritty realism of the blue knight â a story of terror and loss and love that unlocks the nightmares lurking behind the faã§ades of ordinary lives.
could it happen to you? severn gamble's wife walks into the justice building of a major northwestern city to pick up some typing-and never comes out. ("margot?") no one has seen her. ("margot!") she has disappeared. ("margot!") and the nightmare begins.
gamble starts to hunt for her, joined by two police officers, johnny boon, case-hardened, cynical, and with a wife who's just walked out on him; and tally wickham, young, pretty, smartass, and as compatible with boon as oil and water. together and separately, the three of them undertake a search for margot gamble, a search that soon becomes obsessional, as others begin disappearing too, beginning with a child...
and ending no one knows where. "god, please god, let her be alive. and god... let her not be in pain..."
never faltering, thick with vivid characterization and building to one of the most terrifying climaxes in years, missing persons is a masterpiece of suspense, a novel to read and remember and dream about... on dark nights.

night watch

a young woman lies dead, strangled by a killer still prowling the sweltering run-down neighborhood. the young wife of a police lieutenant receives threatening phone calls; the precinct's patrol cars are sabotaged; even the puppies the officers have adopted as mascots are savagely slain. it looks like there's a psycho on the loose with a vendetta against the cops. and then the widow of a precinct cop is found horribly murdered. the signature of the first crime is on this one. but a deadly new element has been added â another murderer is imitating the first one's methods.
olsen's ear is uncanny â the language, the psychology of cops rings absolutely true with all the brutal authenticity of joseph wambaugh. he makes them intimate, real, alive -- the burly, 37-year-old watch commander, lt. packer lind, a dedicated cop; his adoring 21-year-old wife amnee; precinct commander julius singletary, 47 and estranged from his wandering wife agate; sergeant turk molnar, the prototype of a big, dumb, good-natured flatfoot; the lovable smart-ass artie siegi, sex-driven billy mains and his new patrol car sidekick, bosomy mary rob maki; and their patrolmen pals â including gerald yount, 24, whose wife darlene has been cruelly unfaithful, precipitating a nightmare that brings olsen's novel to its thunderous resolution.
night watch is a superb evocation of the real world of big city police today. it is a rare combination of action and a novel of character. in telling this riveting story, jack olsen portrays a memorable man in watch commander packer lind, along with marvelous creations of the characters of the cops under his command and their wives and the pressured lives they lead.
for more than a year, olsen studied policemen at close range: on their beats, visiting them in their homes, joining in their off-duty revelries, riding shotgun as they chased speeders and burglars and killers, walking side by side with them into the bars and back alleys and tanks and dives and sometimes onto the killing grounds of this most dangerous of occupations. after sharing their pressure-cooker lives, olsen calls them "the most undervalued members of our society: good and decent men, for the most part, whose stresses and torments are only dimly understood by the public they serve. they live on the edge of a knife-blade, and they pay the price in broken homes, tortured lives, and uncertain futures. the wonder isn't that there are so many bad cops. the wonder is that there are so few."

the secret of fire 5

fire 5 is a special roving unit, which comes to the aid of other fire companies that run into trouble all over the city. its story is told by one of the men of the unit, charly sprockett, and from the very first scene jack olsen hooks the reader with his remarkable ability to write dialogue that rings true and to create characters who jump to life.
we live with the men in the station, take drills with them, hear them swap funny stories, marital woes and sexual adventures. we watch them razz the probies, initiate their first fireperson, lulu ann tompkins, and unite in common hatred of their tyrannical new battalion chief, h. walker slater. we see them crawl through burning buildings, dragging out people trapped within. we join the hilarity when they come to the rescue of a four-hundred-pound woman who gets stuck in her bathtub, and we root for charly as he climbs out on an overpass over a freeway to talk a desperate young girl out of leaping to her death.
but beneath the ribald humor lies an urgent suspense story. somewhere in the city lurks the firefighter's deadliest enemy â a vicious arsonist who has been pouring gasoline over derelicts and setting them aflame.

the secret of fire 5

this is the story of george, an african american who grew up in a caucasian suburb of seattle, where his unaffectionate mother and racial isolation led him to develop an effervescent personality in order to get along. he became a small-time burglar and an accomplished liar--a wisecracking "smoothy" who pretended to be an undercover detective. george made lots of friends, especially within a subculture of giggly young white women who partied endlessly in upscale seattle clubs during 1989-90. and he murdered three of them, bizarrely mutilating and "staging" their bodies. the drinks, dancing, and deejays--the group pad where george lived with an adoring coterie of feckless college kids--olsen gives us the quirky details that make the murderer's well-hidden rage and misogyny all the more shocking. as the new york times wrote, "like fine cinema veritã©, [charmer] mesmerizes us with the sense of watching real life, unaugmented, move before our eyes."

the man with the candy

the mass murder of almost thirty young boys in houston may well have been the most heinous crime of the century. how could such a series of murders go undetected for almost three years before being exposed? the man with the candy is a brilliant investigative journalist's story of the crime and the answer to that question.
the night david hilligiest didn't come home was both like and unlike other nights when other houston boys disappeared between the years 1971 and 1973. at three in the morning the police were called, but they just said that boys were running away from the best of homes nowadays and that they'd list david as a runaway. no, there would be no official search for the youngster.
aghast, the hilligiests, in the months that followed, hired their own detective, put up posters, even sought the aid of clairvoyants. but david never did come home again because, along with at least twenty-six other houston boys, he had been murdered and buried by the homosexual owner of a candy factory, the mass murderer of the century, dean corll, according to his two teenage confessed accomplices, elmer wayne henley, jr., and david brooks. many of the young boys had not even been reported as missing, and the fact that they were dead would probably never have come to light had not one of the murderers confessed. for in houston, where in a typical year the total number of murders is twice that of london despite the fact that london is six times as large and far more densely populated, missing persons and violence are likely to be considered commonplace.
in the months before the trial of henley and brooks, jack olsen interviewed and probed for answers about the criminals, the victims and the city itself, which remained for the most part silent, angry and defensive. the result is a classic of true crime reportage.

hooked on crime
between salmon trips, jack olsen fishes for lurid storiesthe morning news tribunemay 30, 1990
from the green, saltwater retreat of bainbridge island, the road runs 850 miles across i-90, then south on wyoming 310 to the dusty, shadowy town of lovell.
                        jack olsen knows the way. he knows it by heart. he made 10 trips from the south end of bainbridge island to lovell -- the droopy, demoralized mormon enclave known as the rose city of wyoming.
                        because of olsen's snoopy skills, all the world knows lovell for more than roses. olsen's book doc hovers atop the paperback best-seller lists, celebrating lovell as the town raped by its own doctor.
                        doc is the startling story of lovell's last two doctors. the town doesn't dote on doctors much anymore. dr. william watts horsley planted rose bushes all over lovell in the 1940s, '50s and '60s before he died in 1971. but horsley's real legacy to lovell was having sex with boys and men in his office.
                        introducing lovell to the reader through the dying old rose bushes lovingly bequeathed by horsley, olsen tells the story of lovell's most celebrated doctor, john huntington story, who left a bruised legacy. he raped from 45 to 100 of his women patients.
                        called a sawed-off cary grant by olsen, called a trustworthy doctor by some lovellites, and a dirty pervert by other townspeople, story, 63, is doing 15 years in wyoming state prison at rawlins.
                        olsen, 64, works on his crisply written crime books while harbored on the south end of bainbridge island.
                        long a newspaper reporter and magazine correspondent, and the former fishing editor of sports illustrated, olsen's vivid writing has made him ace of the true crime writers. he works in a cramped room between the garage and back yard where his wife, su peterson, who was cover girl for sports illustrated's first swimsuit issue in 1965, grows rhododendrons, tomatoes, nasturtiums and herbs.
                        the work room has a computer, stacks of unopened mail, a sign reading "welcome home dad" from olsen's 9-year-old son, harper, who is known as harper the barbarian, and a shostakovich tape roiling almost constantly. olsen considers himself the foremost expert on south bainbridge of dmitri shostakovich, the russian composer.
                        "i am a spasm writer," olsen said. "i might not write for two weeks."
                        olsen's biggest distractions are telephone interviewers bursting to discuss his latest book -- "i do phoners by the millions," he said -- and salmon.
                        "i don't get writer's block," olsen said. "it just means i'd rather be fishing. so i go fishing and call it writer's block."
                        when this affliction strikes deep, olsen can be found in a 17-foot open boat just off lapush.
                        the telephone also brings ideas for books. just as olsen completed cold kill, a book about texas murderer david west, he got a call from a sacramento psychologist and criminal justice consultant named tom hill. he told olsen, "my cousin is getting railroaded in lowell, wyo., by a bunch of mormon women."
                        they claimed that story, the trusted family practitioner, had been raping them for years, disguising the act as a pelvic examination. it did seem strange that women suffering from infected ear lobes and sore feet were regularly subjected to long, painful pelvic exams by story.
                        "i drove down to lovell, sat eight of these women in a living room and listened to their stories," olsen said. "i figured either these women were the eight greatest actresses in history, or story raped them."
                        a jury agreed with the women. after story was convicted and sentenced in 1985, olsen made 10 pilgrimages to lovell. he read books on mormonism. he read gynecology textbooks. he and a pocket-sized panasonic tape recorder listened to hundreds of people in the town of 2,447.
                        "i embrace technology," olsen said. he remembers lugging a 35-pound revere tape recorder about little rock, ark., in 1957 when he covered the integration of central high school for time magazine.
                        "both sides in lovell were eager to present their sides of the story," olsen said. "the case against dr. story was voluminous. at least 45 women came forward to admit that be diddled around with them."
                        "many of the women were quite intelligent," olsen said, "but they were products of lovell. they were strict mormons in a small mormon town, taught by their pastors and parents to look up to males. and they were taught never ever to discuss sex, no matter how extreme."
                        olsen interviewed story's victims for six months, intentionally avoiding the doctor.
                        "i wanted him to hear a lot about me, what i was doing," olsen said.
                        story's curiosity landed olsen a seven-hour interview at rawlins state prison.
                        "he displayed all the symptoms of a psychopath," olsen said. "he attacked everyone else. he admitted nothing. he had a narcisstic view of himself."
                        olsen continues exploring dangerous geeks. a book takes olsen 18 months: one year of research, six months of writing and fishing.
                        he is now working on "the man on the bike."
                        "it's about a guy in rochester, n.y., named arthur shawcross," olsen said. "he killed two children, spent 15 years in the joint, got out and killed 11 prostitutes.
                        "the title comes from shawcross's bicycling. he rode around rochester on this old piece of crap bike."
                        someone who submerges himself in such a creepy netherworld of rapists and murderers might be expected to live in a seedy chicago rooming house, with the el trains rattling past, smoking camels and drinking rye.
                        olsen once was immersed in city slime. a native of philadelphia, he lived in new york, washington and chicago before finding better places. he was a deputy sheriff in gilpin county, colo., 9,200 feet up on the continental divide before heeding the call of saltwater and moving to sequim 19 years ago. a resident of bainbridge island for 14 years, olsen takes his family to seattle mariners games, listens to shostakovich and dreams of salmon.
                        "the real world is a long ways from here," he said. "out here is a fairyland, a fantasy that lets me wash off all the grime."

all the rage
it's what spawns psychokillers, the master crimewriter says. that, and another crushing condition.the philadelphia inquirermay 2, 1993
the day after a particularly grisly murder-suicide of a geriatric couple in a fancy rittenhouse square high-rise, a burly, upwardly middle-aged man with a badly twitching face of a pug hears a police siren, sticks his head out his nearby hotel window, cranes his neck in curiosity and proclaims, "they're playing my song."

    always trying to figure out the siren's source, that's jack olsen, master of true-crime writing, an upper darby fugitive who attended penn on the gi bill. "i haven't had an honest job for 20 years," teases the best-selling edgar-winning author, a former time magazine bureau chief who lives on a "crime-free" island in puget sound with his second wife -- a sports illustrated bathing suit-model-cum-nutritionist -- and their two young children. "i'm just fascinated by human behavior. what makes people do the things they do."

    creeps, weirdos, perverts: jack olsen is their dostoevsky. blood-and-guts is his meat-and-potatoes, but it's blood-and-guts-with-soul. the latest of his 25 books published in 11 countries and nine languages, the misbegotten son, is an amazing exposã© of a serial killer's psychology, a spectacular study of sociopathy, detailing the lurid progression of a sweetheart of a guy from starting fires, torturing animals, molesting children, to eventually offing at least 11 women while managing to marry three more who didn't suspect a thing. yuck.

    gee, i'm confusing mass murderers and serial killers. "the serial killer kills, cools off, kills, cools off -- that's the way the fbi defines it," he says, launching into a digression on mathematics and psychopathology. "a psychotic," he explains, taking a nip from his apple juice at the latham, "thinks 2 and 2 are 5. a normal person knows 2 and 2 are 4. a neurotic knows 2 and 2 are 4, but can't stand it. and a psychopath knows 2 and 2 are 4 or 6 or 71 or 800, depending on what he thinks you want him to believe, because he's just putting on a show, an appearance."

    how'd get into this stuff? "right here. a penn criminology professor brought our class to holmesburg prison. so i get inside and see that these dudes look like me. me plus a few years. that was a shocker," he admits. "i thought criminals were gap-toothed, slimy mustaches, crew cuts and muscles. anyway, these guys, they looked like me, except i was pretty young. and i since have found that out at penitentiary after penitentiary: they are me but just another version. they took another fork in the road. so that probably is what hooked me."

    doesn't he ever get creeped out immersing himself in their mental and emotional processes? "hey, i got news for ya. all of these people were once 7 or 8 or 9 pounds of protoplasm in their mother's arms. that's the way they started, just like you and me. what happened? what happened to make them into these bizarre things?" right -- what turns someone into a hannibal lector? "just keep reminding yourself that silence of the lambs is fiction. the typical sociopath is not like hannibal lector," he declares.

    "you couldn't be in that guy's presence for more than a few minutes without realizing there's something wrong here. he's not your typical sociopath. when you're in the presence of your typical sociopath, he acts just like me, or the bartender, or your husband, whoever.

    "that's their stock-in-trade; they don't act like hannibal lector. hannibal lector's the least-likely psychopath i've ever encountered in literature or film. because he's got a big sign on him: sociopath. that's the very opposite of what sociopaths do, you see."

    are these multiple maniacs proliferating? "yes, there are certainly more of them. between 1900 and 1910, there were something like two serial killings in the united states. and then it continued along about that way until around 1940 or 1950, when it just went -- whew! -- straight up the graph until it's just a commonplace now. why? flux. social breakdown, social disintegration. you don't raise well-adjusted, bonded, attached, caring, loving people in a state of constant flux. and i mean that to apply even to the 'upper classes'...

    "it's partly that. it's partly that everyone has weapons. it's partly that everyone can get from one place to another overnight. the killing of one human being by another does not seem bizarre to us because we see it all the time. if you're stuck in a hotel room and you flip that tube -- last night the first four stations that i flipped past, three of them had a human being holding a gun on another human being. the act of holding a gun on another human being is one of the most profound acts that you can commit. within a fifth of a second he's dead and you're a criminal. and yet you see it on tv as if it were, you know, get up in the morning ordering breakfast, it's so common. we no longer have a reverence for proper behavior, for life. the bonding procedures are completely screwed up."

    is serial murder a sex-linked trait? "most criminals are men. most sex criminals are men. see, is this sexist? it's just a fact. men have more," he pauses, "they seem to have more difficulty with the oedipus complex than women have with the electra complex. for one thing, men seem to have more trouble with mommy than women have with daddy," he says, sloughing off my disagreement. "my idea about crime is that crime is created by rage... rage and arrested development...

    "i have a secret impulse that i've never admitted publicly until now. to rub men's noses in the crime of rape, and let them know what it's really like. because i don't think the average male has the slightest understanding of what rape is like. at the most extreme, you get guys like the police captain in my book son who advised the women in spokane, 'if you're gonna be raped, lie back and enjoy it.' that's the worst type," he fumes. "but the average male still thinks, yeah, well, ok, it's not pleasant, i know that, but there are a lot worse things can happen.

    "well, i want to say that there aren't many worse things can happen to a woman than rape. rape is a," he fumbles, "rape is a little murder. and i realized that in research, in interviewing the women for son, hey, this is a heavy-duty crime, this is not fun in any way, shape, manner or form. and this stays with these women. i interviewed a prostitute who had been raped five years earlier, a prostitute who couldn't talk about it without becoming semi-hysterical. that's when i really got the message this is a terrible crime. so i always sort of wanted to rub men's noses in rape." he thinks his works have done that. "so i'm satisfied."

    having peeled away the psyches of these brutes, what's his solution to america's crime explosion -- the lethal carjackings, the senseless muggings, the roving bands of thugs, the drive-by shootings, the druggers? "well, it's certainly not the usual law-and-order cliches -- more prisons, longer sentences, police crackdowns, etc. those are band-aid answers by cheap politicians running for office on the backs of others. at the risk of sounding pompous, i think the essential problem is our economic system.

    "yes, it's superb at creating big care and computers and supermarkets and rows of toys at toys r us, but it's also superb at producing alienation, loss of personal touch, feelings of inadequacy, despair and uselessness. and far too much of our criminal behavior grows from barren, frustrating, stunted, unfulfilled, enraging situations, which more often than not are rooted in poverty.

    "america has more than enough resources to provide a decent life for every citizen. but these assets are distributed neither equitably or with foresight. for the most part, those who are down are doomed to stay down, to live and die in the ghetto, to spend their lifetimes looking up. when we solve the eternal problem of the distribution of opportunity and wealth, we'll have solved the problem of crime -- and not before," says jack olsen. "everything else is rhetoric."

"i've always gravitated to crime"
new york timesmarch 14, 1993lynn karpen
"i have always been a journalist and i've never been anything but a journalist," jack olsen declared during a telephone interview from philadelphia, where he is currently on tour to promote "the misbegotten son." the author of more than 25 books ("i'm not sure how many; i've sort of lost track") on subjects ranging from bridge to boxing, he has always simply chosen whatever interested him to write about.

    "i guess it was a little self-indulgent, but i figured if i was interested, the public would be too. the problem was," he continued, "you can't build a nucleus readership this way. people didn't know what they were going to get next."

    "the misbegotten son," the carefully researched story of a serial killer, is the latest of mr. olsen's books about crime and criminals. "all through my career as a newspaperman and magazine writer, i've always gravitated back to crime," said mr. olsen, who is 67 years old. "i've always been interested in crime, right from the start, right from a criminality course i took at penn state. i took it as an elective because it looked easy. then we took a field trip to holmesburg prison, and i'm 19 years old and we get inside and i see all these guys who look just like me. i thought that criminals looked different. and this is what i attribute my interest in crime to.

    "i start every book with the idea that i want to explain how this seven or eight pounds of protoplasm went from his mommy's arms to become a serial rapist or serial killer. this is my drive and my compulsion. i think a crime book that doesn't do this is pure pornography."

    mr. olsen is currently working on his next book, the story of a triple murderer, in his own backyard of washington state, where he lives on an island in puget sound. researching "the misbegotten son" in watertown, n.y., near the canadian border in the dead of winter made him determined to stay close to home next time. "i said to my wife, "i don't care if it's just a book about shoplifting, but it's going to be around seattle."

interview with jack olsen about his book charmer
q. what's "charmer" about?
                        a. in one sense, a series of horrifying murders. in another sense, race. it's also a story about homicide detectives, their stumblings and bumblings, hard work and intelligence and dedication. real detectives, not tv or mystery characters.
                        q. who is "charmer?"
                        a. george walterfield russell jr., a cunning african-american murderer from an affluent suburb of seattle.
                        q. what was his problem?
                        a. he had many. one was a problem that is common to many blacks in america, including 0.j. simpson. george russell was an "oreo."
                        q. what's that?
                        a. the word originated in the prison culture to describe a black man who downplays his racial identity and tries to out-white the whites. a black man who is treated like a pet by his white playmates and classmates but only allowed to come so close. a toy black, an icon, a symbol, but not treated as a fellow human being.
                        q. what characterizes "oreos" like george russell?
                        a. confusion. despair. alienation. and that great common denominator of violent crime: rage.
                        q. what were russell's crimes?
                        a. he seduced and impregnated young teen-aged white women, assaulted others, and eventually murdered three women in their twenties and posed their bodies artistically to provide the ultimate shock value. a prosecutor called the gallery of bodies "the collected works of george walterfield russell." a dildo was rammed into the mouth of one victim and a copy of "more joy of sex" placed by her body -- in an example of a rare sexual perversion known as "piquerism," he stabbed one corpse 231 times after death and played a game of tic-tac-toe with his knife.
                        q. to what do psychiatrists attribute piquerism?
                        a. uncontrollable hatred and rage. in russell's case, homicidal misogyny. he hated women to death.
                        q. did russell have prior relationships with his victims?
                        a. barely knew any of them.
                        q. what did they represent to him?
                        a. in my opinion, females in general. the snooty white socialites who toyed with him in high school. the lustful sufferers from "jungle fever" who used his body but refused to take him seriously. the teenage white girls who fell for his seductive charms but rejected him as they matured. also some of the black women by whom he was raised and -- in his distorted view -- by whom he was discarded.
                        q. didn't russell have any social life with black women?
                        a. none except his beloved half-sister. he shunned the company of black women and bad-mouthed them on every occasion. he appeared to be as anti-black as the most ignorant racist.
                        q. how was he caught?
                        a. partially by extraordinarily ordinary police work -- thousands of hours of gumshoeing, canvassing, interviewing and re-interviewing, the kind of work that seldom draws attention. and partially by leaps of inductive reasoning by a couple of brilliant detectives. and partially by forensics: dna testing and other analyses.
                        q. were the dna tests the final nail for russell?
                        a. it doesn't appear that dna testing ever produces absolute results, at least as of the time of the russell case. the tests showed probabilities -- 86% that the killer was black, for example. ninety-four percent that a certain hair came from russell. that sort of thing. but taken in toto, the dna evidence was powerful.
                        q. what kind of family produced this strange man?
                        a. russell's mother is a professor of english and the humanities and a lecturer on black culture. one stepfather is president of san francisco state university, another is a dentist. his sister is a recent graduate of yale. his grandmother taught school in florida. a remarkable thread of achievement runs through the family.
                        q. how was he raised?
                        a. in the typical american flux and confusion. when he was an infant. his bright young mother left home to get an education, leaving him in the care of his grandmother and four aunts in a backwater florida town. when he was six, his mother brought him to seattle to live with her dentist husband while she taught at the university of washington. the family soon moved to upscale mercer island where russell hobnobbed with the children of boeing execs, corporate lawyers, doctors and other professionals. there were six or eight black families on the island, but neither russell nor his parents had much to do with them. his mother and stepfather split up when the boy was fifteen, and she went east to teach at the university of maryland and later tufts. russell chose to remain among the wealthy whites of mercer island.
                        q. books on african-american killers are almost nonexistent. what made you decide to write one?
                        a. george russell's crimes were horrendous but fascinating, unique and significant. they were largely ignored by the media just as most black crimes are ignored or played down, o.j. simpson being the rarest of exceptions. the present tendency of newspapers to play black crimes on page 34 or ignore them altogether is a disturbing variety of racial prejudice which can only make a difficult problem worse.
                        q. what difficult problem?
                        a. african-americans make up twenty percent of our population and commit fifty percent of our crime.
                        q. because they're inherently evil?
                        a. because ninety-nine percent are deprived, alienated, stigmatized, isolated and rejected on a systematic, institutionalized basis -- and thus enraged on one psychological level or another. the privileged one percent (e.g. clarence thomas, richard pryor, mike tyson, o.j. simpson, george walterfield russell) live in a confusing world of rejection and self-doubt.
                        q. why can't the black community step in and solve its own problems?
                        a. you don't ask the man whose neck is being stepped on to stop the fight.
                        q. in your opinion, what creates black criminals like george russell?
                        a. to vastly oversimplify, a national pattern of racial prejudice, which produces rage, which produces crime.
                        q. so george russell should be forgiven his sins?
                        a. of course not. he should be exactly where he is, serving life without chance of parole. to try to understand him is not to excuse his murderous behavior. every criminal of every color must accept responsibility for his crimes. otherwise we face anarchy.
                        q. what got you so interested in racial matters?
                        a. i was raised by a man who ranted constantly about "niggers," "shines" and "jigaboos." i rebelled against him and his ideas in my teens, and the subject of race prejudice has preoccupied me ever since. i was thrown out of a second-floor barracks at keesler air force base for telling a group of southerners that it was okay with me if my sister married a black. as a time correspondent, i was ten feet away when hard-hat racists spat on elizabeth eckford and the other black children trying to integrate little rock central high school in 1957. i wrote "the black athlete: a shameful story" and "black is best -- the riddle of cassius clay," both prize-winning books. my five-part series on how organized sport is helping to destroy a generation of black males was characterized by the editors twenty-five years later as "the most important series" the magazine had ever run.
                        q. why is it more important than ever that whites and blacks understand each other?
                        a. because race prejudice is destroying america. because the problem worsens every day. because a state of terror exists in black neighborhoods and is spreading outward.
                        q. can the problem be solved?
                        a. yes, but only by a massive effort, and i mean massive, on the order of what we did in world war ii. not by phony wars on crime, or hot-air campaign speeches, or token gestures.
                        q. and if the problem isn't confronted and solved?
                        a. our peaceful democracy will cease to exist. ghetto crime and terrorism will become the norm in and out of the ghetto. neither black nor white will be safe. the american way of life will end.
                        q. unless we begin to understand people like george walterfield russell?
                        a. exactly.

amazon.com talks to jack olsen
amazon.com: how did you begin writing? did you intend to become an author, or do you have a specific reason or reasons for writing each book?
j.o.: i began writing in desperation -- i kept flunking my engineering courses at the university of pa. while getting straight a's in a subject entirely alien to me: english. then a criminology professor took us on a field trip to a penitentiary and i discovered that the place was filled with guys who looked just like me. that began a lifelong interest in what makes criminals, how to detect and avoid them, how not to raise them, how to live in a culture that is becoming increasingly criminal in nature. in my 26 books and hundreds of articles, i've written about everything under the sun, but my last seven books have been about crime.
amazon.com: what authors do you like to read? what book or books have had a strong influence on you or your writing?
j.o.: i enjoy authors who write seriously about crime -- non-embroidered, non-embellished true journalism. i mean authors like darcy o'brien, fox butterfield, pete earley, jim schulte, harry maclean, shana alexander, lowell cauffiel, t. j. english and others. the strongest influence on my reporting has come from joseph mitchell, a. j. liebling, john bartlow martin, john mcphee, gerold frank, dr. frederic wertham, dr. hervey cleckley, john hersey and red smith. the strongest influences on my writing have been james joyce, e. annie proulx, j. b. priestley, r. f. delderfield, james m. cain, john o'hara, james thurber, earl thompson, stendhal, ford madox ford, tolstoi, and of course the greatest of them all: bill shakespeare.
amazon.com: could you describe the mundane details of writing: how many hours a day do you devote to writing? do you write a draft on paper or at a keyboard (typewriter or computer)? do you have a favorite location or time of day (or night) for writing? what do you do to avoid--or seek!--distractions?
j.o.: my writing habits are so lousy i hate to commit them to paper. i might write for 12 hours straight and then go fishing for a week. i might go fishing for 12 hours straight and then write for a week. i write at all hours of day and night. i've worked on a computer for at least a dozen years, starting on a lanier word processor that cost $15,000 and crashed every hour and a half. i wouldn't know what to do without one. i can't imagine how keats and tolstoi and all those other dudes got along without at least one megabyte of memory. they must've had huge craniums.
amazon.com: do you meet your readers at book signings, conventions, or similar events? do you interact with your readers electronically through e-mail or other online forums?
j.o.: lately i've been flogging salt of the earth and meeting my readers under any and all conditions, including at least two dozen signings and a raft of radio, tv and press interviews. i'm also active on compuserve's author and crime forums, and on internet's true crime and book review newsgroups.
amazon.com: when and how did you get started on the net? do you read any newsgroups such as rec.arts.books and rec.arts.sf.written, mailing lists, or other on-line forums? do you use the net for research--or is it just another time sink? are you able to communicate with other writers or people you work with over the net?
j.o.: i've become so dependent on the internet for research that i think i'd just quit and become a sanitary engineer if i had it to do all over again.
amazon.com: feel free to use this space to write about whatever you wish: your family, your hometown, hobbies, favorite places, where you've lived, where you went to school, what jobs you have had, your last (or planned) vacation, your favorite color/food/pet/song/movie, what books you'd take to a desert island, what you intend to do before you die, or what you think of just about anything.
j.o.: before i die i would like to take some small part in the rehabilitation of the so-called "true crime" genre, which to my eyes has become more like the "false crime" genre. so many embroidered and embellished works are being published as fact that it's tilting the whole genre away from true journalistic competence. as an edgar judge last year, i discovered that in this morass of compost some really good stuff is being published -- though not necessarily being read. four great examples are darcy o'brien's power to hurt, fox butterfield's all god's children, jim schutze's by two and two, and pete earley's circumstantial evidence (edgar winner). i recommend them all. and throwing modesty to the winds, i can tell you that the new york times has published two very favorable reviews of salt of the earth, for which i'm grateful, and the other reviewers have more or less followed suit.

true crime doesn't pay
a conversation with jack olsenpoint no pointwinter 1998/99michael hood
"the true crime genre is dead and i'll tell you why." jack olsen declares, holding forth on his favorite subject these days, the sorry state of writing and publishing non-fiction books.
                        jack olsen, 73, is a former time magazine bureau chief and sports illustrated editor. the bainbridge island resident has written more than 30 books, including six novels, but he's best known for his reportage over a half-century career. his work covers a wide range of subjects with books such as the bridge at chappaquiddick about ted kennedy's bad night; the night of the grizzlies, an eco-thriller; and silence on monte sole, a detailed study of a nazi massacre in italy. his account of an ill-fated alpine expedition in 1957, the climb up to hell, is being re-released this fall by st. martin's press.
                        olsen has made his most visible mark, however, in the genre of true crime, or "crime journalism," as he prefers. he began chronicling psychopaths before anyone (himself included) really knew what they or their diseased behavior were bout. olson wrote one of the genre's defining classics, son: a psychopath and his victims. it is the story of kevin coe, spokane's south hill rapist, whose rich and influential mother was sent to prison after trying to hire a hitman to kill the judge and prosecutor responsible for convicting her son.
                        another of his major works is doc: the rape of the town of lovell, an incredible account of a wyoming doctor who relied on his small town patients' naivete and mormon female submissiveness to rape generations of them on his office examining table. olsen has won two prestigious edgar awards from the mystery writers of america, including a special edgar for son and the 1989 prize for best fact crime for doc.
                        so why does jack olsen pronounce his genre dead?
                        because he feels that it no longer stresses accuracy, substance over style, and the reporter's responsibility to get the facts right without inserting himself or herself into the story. olsen believes these values are being abandoned by current writers, but the complaint is as old as the true crime genre itself.
                        the problem presented itself at the very beginning with truman capote's inventive conjecture and manufactured quotes in writing in cold blood. this extravagantly successful "non-fiction novel" about the 1957 clutter family murders in kansas is considered the first true crime book.
                        blood's success also pumped up a new journalism that emphasizes character and social analysis over the who, what, when and where of traditional reporting. olsen is definitely and defiantly a member of the old school.
                        "i recognized it as a work of art, but i know fakery when i see it," olsen says. "capote completely fabricated quotes and whole scenes.... the book made something like $6 million in 1960's money, and nobody wanted to discuss anything wrong with a money-maker like that in the publishing business."
                        nobody except olsen and a few others. his criticisms were quoted in esquire, to which capote replied, "jack olsen is just jealous."
                        "that was true, of course," olsen says, "i was jealous -- all that money? i'd been assigned the clutter case by harper & row until we found out that capote and his cousin, harper lee, had been already on the case in dodge city for six months.
                        olsen explains, "that book did two things. it made true crime an interesting, successful, commercial genre, but it also began the process of tearing it down. i blew the whistle in my own weak way. i'd only published a couple of books at that time -- but since it was such a superbly written book, nobody wanted to hear about it."
                        olsen fast forwards 30 years to the tremendous success of the so-called "non-fiction" book, sleepers, by lorenzo carcaterra. "here was an $8 or $9 million book, a story of injustice in hell's kitchen. very sensational -- a priest suborning perjury, the da putting in the fix, two heroic boys getting even for a year in a reformatory where they were sodomized."
                        just one problem, olsen adds: "it was 100 percent bullshit." he and six other crime authors petitioned the publisher, ballantine, to withdraw the book, to refund the money of those who bought it under its pretense of non-fiction, and to reissue it as a novel.
                        all to no avail. though thoroughly exposed to be unfactual by olsen's group and many others, the paperback was published a year later still claiming to be a true story. "i was trained as a journalist. i wasn't trained as a wonderful guy [but] an accurate guy, an honest guy. i was trained as a journalist and if you're a journalist, you better get it right! that's the difference between myself and all these shuck and jive artists.'
                        take midnight in the garden of good and evil, another extremely successful book, a unique combination of travelogue and true crime in savannah. olsen says, "it's an amazing story. as i was reading it, i was saying to myself: john berendt goes down to savannah, georgia, he meets all these fantastic people, he meets the killer, he gets intimately involved in this whole murder -- i'm saying to myself, why can't this ever happen to me?" then olsen met berendt at a writers' conference and learned that he hadn't been involved in the murder at all, he'd merely inserted himself into it as a vehicle for telling the story.
                        "so here's perhaps your best-selling hardcover book in modern history and the main thrust of it is faked. he came down later and constructed the whole thing with himself in it. it was a literary device he never let us in on. i have to say it was a good job of craftsmanship -- except it was not true."
                        random house sells midnight in the garden of good and evil as "true." the new york times has listed it for nearly four years as a "non-fiction" best seller, even though berendt acknowledges "rounding the corners" and inventing dialogue "to make a better narrative."
                        "apparently it's no longer important to the reading public whether you go out and bust your ass to get the facts right or you just make it up. that completely wipes out the main tool we journalists have -- technique, journalism, research. you don't need that any more."
                        book sales are down for true crime which has always been, surprisingly, predominantly a women's market. true crime no longer pays and the best crime journalists are quitting. the list of deserters is impressive.
                        edgar winner harry mcclean, an attorney who made the new york times best seller list twice, has taken to writing legal thrillers a la john grisham.
                        darcy o'brian, a tulsa literature professor and author of the classic study, two of a kind: the hillside stranglers, publicly abandoned true crime shortly before his recent death, declaring "it deserves to sink."
                        masquerade author lowell cauffiel told the new york daily news he's written his last work in the genre because "it's gone the way of westerns."
                        barry siegel, author of a death at white bear lake, is now writing novels. and you can now add olsen as the latest mia. he has forsaken the genre and is now working on a "justice book" relating the story of geronimo pratt, a black panther who spent 27 years in prison for a murder he didn't commit.
                        true crime's decline can also be blamed on so-called "instant books," which exploit the public's prurient interest in lurid crimes with bad writing and superficial research mostly based on newspaper clippings. ann rule, the genre's "queen," laments that true crime is "drowning in its own blood."
                        "i've reached the point," olsen says, "if my next door neighbor turned out to be the goddamndest quadruple murderer involving sex, incest, serial murder, i wouldn't dream of writing about it. because it would go right on the true crime shelf, in between this piece of crap and that piece of crap, and the average reader is going to say there are three pieces of crap."
                        economics also plays a role. the cost of researching serious true crime accounts, with all the travel and other expenses, is usually over $50,000 per book. most authors have to front these expenses out of their own pockets. "the best true crime authors can no longer afford to spend a year and a half, two years getting it right when there's no premium for it," he says. "we could just as easily sit home and make it up.
                        "other forms of journalism have been engaged," as max frankel observed in the new york times magazine, "in a heroic battle... to preserve the meaning of fact and the sanctity of quotation marks.... reporters have been losing their jobs for committing fiction, a crime that is no crime at all in too many other media."
                        olsen agrees. "these other forms of journalism insist on things being true, but the one form that'll be sitting around a hundred years from now -- books -- nobody cares. i've suggested that book publishers have fact-checking departments just like newspapers, but they say it's too expensive, that books cost too much already. with the computer and its search facilities -- this should be the heyday of truth and accuracy in journalism. my career would be over if it weren't for the computer. the computer has extended my career by 10 or 15 years."
                        another reason for this situation, olsen says, is a lack of good critics. "the fact that carcaterra can get away with sleepers [is because] we don't have critics like dwight macdonald or a.j. liebling -- they would've taken that guy apart."

'son' author 'documented humanity of his victims,' friend says
the spokesman reviewoctober 8, 2015carolyn lamberson
from 1978 to 1981, more than 40 women were brutally assaulted on spokane's south hill. eventually, kevin coe (then known as fred coe) was convicted of some of the assaults. he served 25 years in prison and remains confined to the special commitment center on mcneil island. he has always maintained his innocence.
                        the story was already national news. after all, coe was the son of a prominent spokane family - his mother, ruth, was a noted socialite, and his father, gordon, was managing editor of the spokane daily chronicle. the case took a bizarre twist when his mother, ruth, was arrested and convicted for trying to take out a hit on the judge and prosecutor in her son's case.
                        in 1983, journalist jack olsen published "son: a psychopath and his victims," which became a national best-seller and won an edgar award for nonfiction.
                        now, scribner has re-released "son" in print and for the first time as an e-book. olsen, a longtime resident of bainbridge island, died in 2002. his friend gregg olsen, a best-selling true-crime writer and no relation to jack olsen, was tasked with writing a new forward for the book. in an email interview, we talked with gregg olsen about the lesson that can be learned from reading "son" today and the impact jack olsen's work had on his own life.
                        q. you write in the new forward that "son" inspired you to become a true-crime writer. what was it about "son" that you found so fascinating?
                        a. while the crime spree was horrific and disturbing enough, one of the things that made "son" such a compelling book was the way jack olsen dug into the history and psychology of both sides of the crime. he wrote about fred, ruth and gordon with a kind of immersive narrative that put you, the reader, right there with them. reading that book is like lifting up the curtain and finding out that the people next door were not as they seemed at all â and once you got to know them, you wanted to put up a for sale sign and get out of the neighborhood.
                        as great as jack olsen's research and writing could be, it was the way he documented the humanity of his victims that also resonated with me â and still does. i always considered jack's books to be about people first. not a crime. they were people who were touched by something very dark and evil. for the victims in jack's books (he wrote 30 others, many dealing with true stories of rape or serial killers), the evil didn't define them at all. for the perpetrators, he made us see the trajectory of life events, circumstances, sometimes even biology that led them to do the unthinkable.
                        q. since the coe case, spokane has seen its share of high-profile crime and intrigue. the serial killer robert yates, ousted mayor jim west, ruby ridge just up the road from here, even the recent rachel dolezal controversy all come to mind. why re-release "son" now?
                        a. "son" is an american classic in a genre that doesn't get a whole lot of respect. it has been out of print for many years and there's a renewed interest in the kind of thoughtful reporting on crime that "son" exemplifies.
                        q. did you ever interview coe?
                        a. no. the closest i got was talking to a woman who was in love with him, wanted to marry him and was trying to help win his release. she was sure that he was not the monster the world â and this book in particular â had made him out to be. he'd convinced her that he'd been wrongly convicted.
                        q. what can we learn from revisiting this story now?
                        a.  so much time has passed that the coe story has now drifted into the realm of spokane history, but like other notorious crimes they linger in the memories of those who lived through it. what can be learned? i'm still inspired by the victims who stood up and faced their attacker when rape was something that was barely talked about in polite company.
                        rape still exists, of course. but i think "son" is a great reminder that evil can be extinguished when we rally around each other with compassion and vigilance. guys like coe are out there and when they do their evil deeds, we know that no one asked for it. we know that no one should live with shame because of it. but there was a time, not long ago, when all of that wasn't true.
                        jack olsen's book reminds all of us that no matter how beautiful the place, no matter how pretty it's surface, bad things lurk there. and we're just not going to stand for it.
                        "son"
                        by jack olsen, with a new foreword by gregg olsen ($18 paperback, $7.99 ebook)
