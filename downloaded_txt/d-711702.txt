a couple more themelesseses

i'm not sure how far apart i made these two grids.  but they have an answer in common so i figure that i should either post them together or post them far, far apart.  i'll just get it overwith.

across lite puz:
click to solve.
the next one sat around for a while because it repeated a word in two different answers and i couldn't find a way to fix it without re-doing half the grid, until yesterday.

for any uninitiated droppers-by who don't yet have, or don't know what is, across lite, it's a program that let's you solve crossword puzzles right here on your computer screen.  the download page is here.  it takes merely a minute or less to install, so get crackin', by cracky.

splitsville

i made this one about two years ago and didn't care for the excessive number of abbreviations and such.   but i wanna post a themed puzzle, so here 'tis.

update:  the answer at 37-across has one too many circled squares.  but, rather than type the whole shebang over from scratch, i'll just warn you about it.
"real high-end operation we got going here, eh, bob?"

gallimaufry 1
and, we're back.

now that hurricane and blizzard seasons are officially overwith i feel like getting back to normal.
most of what i'll be posting in the coming weeks will be crossword puzzles that i've made over the past four years but never posted due some fatal flaw i thought they had at the time.  i've been able to re-do an area here and a corner there to fix old wrongs.  for the most part.
first up, a themeless freestyle gallimaufry.

a coupla years ago, i was interested in coming up with grids that were asymetrical yet aesthetically pleasing.  this one worked much better when i tried it as a 19x19, but i never completed the fill in that one.  ah, well.

untitled themeful

long time, no see.  
i was about to clue and post two or three of the many puzzles i have laying around.  but, the reason they're laying around is that i don't think they're very good.  even by my journeyman-level criteria.  
but then i was lying awake a couple of nights ago and thought of this one.  it's a slight variant on a widely used theme.  but it's something.  so i finally made a new puzzle.  woo hoo!

across lite:
click to solve.
for anyone stopping by who doesn't know what across lite is, it's a crossword solving program that allows you to solve puzzles on your computer.  it's easy to use and takes just 1.3 jiffies to install.  download it here.
also, if you're interested in what the new york times crosswords were like in the decades before will shortz took over the editing reigns, check out the pre-shortzian puzzle project.  
the goal is make every new york times crossword puzzle from 1942-1993 available for reviewing and for solving.  currently, there are four years (1990-1993) of pre-shortzian puzzles available for on-screen solving from the eugene maleska era (1977-1993), with more being added all the time.   
solve pre-shortzian puzzles.

today
holy moly, i haven't posted a crossword puzzle in over a month?!  
alas, yes.  so i speed-created this one.  and then speed-clued it.  (though, i must say, cluing the puzzle takes a helluva lot longer than creating the grid. at least, in this case.)

the four 15-letter answers came rapid fire, and the rest is what is it.  but, just solve it before midnight, so all will be right with the world.

i didn't proofread it before posting.  hopefully, everything's in order.

thin themes
as an autodidactic apprentice, i'm a little self-conscious about what i post.  since i have no "mentors" or "test solvers", i'm left to judge for myself what's postworthy or not. 
since i haven't made a brand spanking new crossword puzzle in a while, i've decided to make it up you with a three-in-one post, made up of puzzles from the pile of thin-themed crap. 
first up:  a weak theme if there ever was one. i'm pretty sure that this dates back to my "make a real puzzle no matter how boring" days.  nine months ago, i think.

newly clued, of course.
across lite:
ye must clicketh.
of today's three, this next one is the most recent.  i had big dreams for it, at the time. but i just couldn't hit on that bigger idea that would've made it more than it is:

mozel tov!
across lite:
click to solve.

third up: i don't even remember making this one.  i think it's one of my better early puzzles, but it contained too much garbage even for my standards at the time.  imagine that.

i just finished cluing it so at at least it has that going for it.  :-d
an across lite file follows almost immediately:
clicky doodle.

my next post will consist of either a new puzzle or more old crap.  time will tell.

turning up the pressure

i've made several versions of this puzzle over the past four weeks.  the sad thing is, i don't know if this version is much better than the first incarnation. hah!
the above picture has nothing to do with the puzzle. i made it in photoshop and don't expect to find any use for it, so there it is.

a cheerful puzzle


i've been working on one particular puzzle for over two weeks now and am still not happy with it.  but, rather than go another week without posting, i grabbed one from the old pile of unposted grids.  
this is probably about a year-and-a-half old.

freestyle 13

so anyway, i was over at beq central on friday solving the friday bonus puzzle and reading the interview with guest constructor tim croce.  tim wrote: 
but quad stacks? that's where i draw the line. soon as i saw the partial "o' tea" in a quad stack i solved, that was it for me. don't wanna even try anymore.
so, of course, i figured i'd try a quint stack, placed in the center of the grid.  
after about an hour of entertaining that silly idea i decided, instead, to pick three 15-letter answers that were on my list of words and phrases that aren't in matt ginsberg's clue database, and to see if i can make them work.  the only non-random criteria was that the first three letters had to allow a coherent down answer.  
my first three choices didn't pan out.  but i replaced one of them with another and i was off and running.  the result of that friday afternoon grid-building is, for the most part, this puzzle.  (i tweaked a few areas on saturday, and clued it on sunday.) 

there are two entries in here that are not only fresh, but that i've never heard nor seen before.  one is one word, the other is two words.  but they're legit.  and they're not latin or otherwise foreign.  i tried to make the clues mediumishly challenging, but even one of the 15s might be a tough nut to crack for latter-day xers and millenials (and maybe even some geezers).

crossover artists

two puzzles this week, since i missed last week.  
the first one should be an easy solve.  it's a theme that we've all seen a hundred times.  it's okay to fall back on an old staple, now and then.

update: and i just realized that there's a slight "problem" with the third theme entry.  you may see it right away.  but, i think i'll just leave it as is as a reminder of what happens when one constructs and clues a crossword puzzle on very little sleep.  

"53 across"
across lite:
click to solve.
---------
this second one should be more of a challenge.  i don't want to say too much and reveal spoilers, but this is a theme that you may have seen before.
it went through a couple of re-dos, complete with different theme entries and, of course, entirely different grids and fill.  i'm still not satisfied with the way it turned out, but not so much that i want to try building another version from scratch.  (hopefully, i'm just being overly self-critical.)

caveat emptor

the good thing about making up your own quote is that you can tailor it to split evenly for the grid.  

and, being a quote puzzle, i made this one nice n' easy.  i think.

progress

i made two puzzles with this theme sometime in this past spring or summer. i posted one then and saved one for now, just to put some space between them.  it's a standard theme idea, taken one step further.

happy new year!

more fun with photoshop
so anyway, i came across this beautiful photograph of the galaxy named ngc 3041.  or, as i like to call it, snookums.  it looked so much like a painting that i decided to put my photoshop semi-skills to good uselessness.  and since my version is over ten years old, this may be as good as my photoshop fu gets. 


i grew up wondering why i couldn't see the bright center of our galaxy, even on a moonless night.  now, of course, i know that it's because of interstellar dust and the lights of the cities.  needless to say, living within 50 miles of times square isn't the most condusive environment for stargazing.
but i found a photo of the milky way above a tree-line, and decided to photoshop it with a manhattan skyline.  the blueness of the sky contrasts (read: clashes) with a colorful cityscape.

i like the boldness of the contrast between the "macro-natural" galactic center and the man-made beauty below, but not the lack of realism.  the two elements don't appear to be occupying the same universe.
so then i found a clearer picture of the milky way and put it together with a different new york skyline photo, and threw in the moon for good measure.

i like the mix of that one much more, but i regret having the milky way perfectly horizontal. so i tilted the same photo and added yet another skyline shot.

aah, now we're talkin' 'bout a penthouse view.  
but, based on the earth-bound photos, i seem to have placed the milky way too far off in the distance.  
the center of the galaxy is very far away, but it is frickin' huge.
anywho, i then grabbed a more real-color photo of the milky way above a treeline, and added something beautiful that is both natural and man-made.

love the j-lo dress.
and finally, for now, the previous background with the pyramids that were built along the nile, which was thought to represent the milky way.

edit to add:
a timelapse recording of the galactic center passing over a popular stargazing spot in texas at about 5,000 ft elev. with clear dark skies. 
galactic center of milky way rises over texas star party from william castleman on vimeo.

freestyle 10

i really gotta start coming up with titles for these themeless puzzles.

i had eight different southeast corners for this one.  the cleanest ones were the dullest, of course, so i went with one of the dirtier ones.  i opted for this one in particular once i found a clue for 55-down that was more "user-friendly" than what i thought i'd have to use.  (something to do with politics in the great white north.)
