chaos at maryland





















the idea that many simple nonlinear deterministic systems can
behave in an apparently unpredictable and chaotic manner was first
noticed by the great french mathematician henri
poincar√©. other early pioneering work in the field of chaotic
dynamics were found in the mathematical literature by such luminaries as
birkhoff,
cartwright,
littlewood,
levinson,
smale,
and kolmogorov
and his students, among others. in spite of this, the importance of chaos was
not fully appreciated until the widespread availability of digital computers
for numerical simulations and the demonstration of chaos in various physical
systems. this realization has broad implications for many fields of science,
and it is only within the past decade or so that the field has undergone
explosive growth. 

it is found that the ideas of chaos have been very fruitful in such diverse
disciplines as biology, economics, chemistry, engineering, fluid mechanics,
physics, just to name a few. chaos is a multidisciplinary science, and this is
reflected in the fact that the members of the group are affiliated with diverse
departments and institutes: 


department of physics
department of mathematics
department of electrical engineering
institute for physical sciences and technology (ipst)
institute for research in electronics and applied physics (ireap)
institute for systems research (isr)
applied math and scientific computation (amsc)

since the mid-1970s, the chaos group at maryland has done extensive research in
various areas of chaotic dynamics ranging from the theory of 
dimensions, 
fractal basin boundaries,
chaotic scattering,
controlling chaos, etc. it is hoped that the
knowledge we have gained is of use to others, and it is the objective of this web
site to disseminate those fruits of labor. enjoy!
