      a brief history of the dry dredgers
      by-laws of dry dredgers, inc.

the
        dry dredgers is an association of amateur geologists dedicated to the
        knowledge and enjoyment of fossils. the association was founded in 1942
        and continues to bring together those interested in ancient life. its aim is to stimulate interest in geology, to
        encourage the collection and identification of fossils, and to
        participate in field trips and exhibitions. the club is affiliated with
        the 
university
        of cincinnati geology department , and annually awards
        the paleo research award

        backgrounds, and levels of expertise, sharing a common and sincere
        interest in fossils. average yearly membership is about 200 families.

        every month from september to june. at these meetings, projects are
        discussed, field trips planned, lectures presented and fossils

all meetings are held in room 201 braunstein hall  on the
        university of cincinnati campus. field trips take place monthly in the
        autumn and spring, usually within 100 miles of cincinnati.
