the voyage of 
				erasmus: greenland to the mediterranean



to all friends,

in this, the second of three parts, 
				helga and david discover generous scottish hospitality along the 
				caledonia canal and confusing english eccentricity in the 
				harbour of tollesbury. they cruise the lovely canals of holland 
				and belgium, where theyre adopted by a water-ski club and feted 
				as celebrities. from a romantic berth in paris, they reach the 
				mediterranean to island-hop in greece, turkey, and cyprus, 
				becoming part of a cosmopolitan cruising cultureintrepid 
				risk-takers from many lands, for whom each day brings some 
				unexpected drama.



in its 238 lavishly illustrated 
				pages, volume 2 of the voyage of erasmus is packed with humour, 
				great stories, stunning photographs, and charts. david and 
				helgas tale is a heady mix of the familiar and the exotic, the 
				idyllic and the life-threatening, the splendours of the 
				wilderness and the warmth of strangers. it will delight seasoned 
				sailors and armchair travelers alike.
roy macskimming, author of 
				laurier in love

the voyage of 
				erasmus: ottawa to the arctic



to all friends,

below is information about our ebook that 
				tells the story of our voyage out the st. lawrence and along the 
				labrador coast to baffin island in the mid 1980s.  part of the 
				pleasure in writing and designing it was remembering the warmth 
				of our welcome whenever we came ashore and the awesome scenery 
				of that rugged coastline as we travelled ever further north.
				 
				it is more than 170 pages and has over 90 photos and charts, 
				some hyperlinks and video.  it is a pdf, the format most 
				everyone can read 
on their desktop or laptop computer.  it 
				is not meant to be read on a kobo or kindle type reader.
