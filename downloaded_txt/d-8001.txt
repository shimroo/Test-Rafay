the latest photographyworkbook is here.
there’s always been something about seeing work in print. that’s why there’s the print workbook. it’s a tangible statement by our creative talent. but if you don’t have the place for such things, there’s always our digital book. there’s everything you get in print, plus animation from the artists and video from the photographers. it’s eye and ear candy. sweet.
