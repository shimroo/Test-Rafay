our mission our mission is to prevent cruelty and neglect to animals; to educate children and all members of the community about animal welfare issues; and to provide for the health and well-being of animals with an emphasis on spay/neuter to prevent pet over-population.
we achieve our mission statement through the following programs and services to the community:
low cost spay/neuter, vaccine and wellness veterinary clinic, humane education and cruelty investigation.
the hssbv does not receive any funding from government/city/county agencies or any national animal organizations, such as the humane society of the united states. all of our funding is received through private donations, fundraising efforts and grants. in order to support these efforts on a local level, donations can be made directly to the hssbv.
the hssbv is not an animal control agency or a shelter. we do not adopt out animals, pick up deceased animals or strays, license pets or provide any animal control services. if you are looking for animal control services in your area, please click here to see which organization services the city you live in (hyperlink animal control blog).  contact your agency of service for information on strays, lost pets, animal complaints, licensing information, animal pick up, etc.*******************************************************************************************************·        clinic service:   both the hssbv clinic waiting area lobby, as well as the
appointment center, are open to the public!
·        
please be advised, that some of our check in procedures, for
example the surgery check in line, will still take place partially outside.
this time of restructure has introduced ways to streamline some of our
processes both for our clients and our staff.
thank you for sticking with us and choosing us
to treat your beloved four legged family members.
unfortunately, not every client we encounter
shows this same patience and kindness. as a reminder, the hssbv will not
tolerate aggressive behavior to our staff, volunteers, or other clients under
any circumstances. we have a zero tolerance policy. aggressive clients will be
asked to leave and their pets will not be treated. we reserve the right to
refuse service to anyone. please treat our staff, and especially our dedicated
volunteers, kindly. 8/15/24 please note the following updates to our euthanasia policy.euthanasia services will be performed by appointment only (between the hours of 9:00 am and 3:00 pm monday – friday).  if your pet is experiencing a medical emergency, please contact us immediately. euthanasia can only be performed when official ownership of the pet is established.  this is done with the pet owner’s state issued photo identification card which must match either: pet license paper work, paperwork with the pet’s information and owners name from a veterinary office, official adoption/purchase records or microchip registration. if the pet is a patient at our clinic with the appropriate pet owner’s information, no other documentation is needed.  we understand that there are situations when a deceased family member’s pet has to be put to sleep.  in these cases, we ask that you have power of attorney of property, provide a death certificate, and the proper proof of ownership.  there are no exceptions to this rule and photos of/with the pet will not be used to establish ownership, regardless of the photo’s time/date stamp.  if you find a stray that is injured or suffering, you should take them directly to your local animal control.  should this option not be available to you and you come to the hssbv the animal will be evaluated by the veterinarian. we understand this decision is never easy.  euthanasia pricing is based on donation, which means you pay what you can or what you feel is appropriate.  if ownership is established, no client will be turned away due to inability to pay.  optional cremation services are available through gateway pet cemetery for a fee, paid directly to them (cash, check or credit accepted). while we will assist with facilitating this process for you, we do not upcharge for this service.  the hssbv is comprised of dedicated staff and unpaid volunteers who care deeply for animals (and their owners).  we ask that our staff is treated with respect and kindness at all times, but especially as they assist you with the difficult process of saying goodbye to your beloved pet as they cross the rainbow bridge.  while this is emotional for you, it is also emotional for us.  veterinarians and veterinary staff often suffer from compassion fatigue. if you have an issue with our euthanasia process, policies or experience, we must insist you communicate this with kindness.  we always do our best to help our clients and their pets, but our resources do have limitations.  ************************************************************************************************************************** want to share your experience with us? visit our client satisfaction survey and let us know how we did!
