minimising the environmental impact of chemical processes and creating long-lasting materials for medicine are just a few of the exciting developments in recent chemistry. on bsc chemistry, you’ll join like-minded students who are keen to tackle global challenges and make a valuable contribution to society. 
spectroscopy, quantum chemistry, and organic synthesis – these are just some of the modules you can study. you’ll thrive as you put knowledge into action in our modern facilities. including our state-of-the-art laboratory and analytical suite. 
we’re at the forefront of research and teaching. globally recognised and multi award-winning. our course is also accredited by the royal society of chemistry, giving you the confidence that your education is high quality. 
employability is important to us. we work closely with the careers team and regularly invite successful industry speakers. we also offer the opportunity for you to become a school rep, outreach ambassador, and join our chemistry society.  
choose your own pathway through this degree — add a year in industry or studying abroad, or carry out an additional year of advanced study to graduate with an msci.
 professional recognition
this programme is accredited by the royal society of chemistry, giving graduates associate member status. structureyou can complete your chemistry degree in three, four or five years. 

if you are a bsc student and choose to do a year in industry or study abroad, this will take place in year 3, and the year 3 modules will instead be studied in year 4. if you are an msci student and choose to study abroad, this will take place in year 4, and the year 4 modules will be studied in year 5.

year in industry
want to pick up some solid work experience while practising your skills in a real-world laboratory? apply for our chemistry bsc with a year in industry/research. some of our students have been awarded prestigious work placements with uk and international pharmaceutical companies.
during your second year, you will identify and apply for a placement opportunity, with one on one support provided by your adviser. if successful, you'll spend your third year working in the pharmaceutical industry or carrying out an extended research project.
please note that placements are highly competitive and awarded based on your application, academic track record and performance at the interview. should you not succeed in securing a placement, you'll transfer onto our bsc programme and complete your third year at queen mary.

msci
apply for our chemistry msci to spend an extra year undertaking an extended research project and studying advanced modules. consider this option if you’re interested in a career in academic or industrial research.

year abroad
go global and study abroad as part of your degree – apply for our chemistry bsc or msci with a year abroad. queen mary has links with universities in europe, north america, asia and australia (partnerships vary for each degree programme).
find out more about study abroad opportunities at queen mary and what the progression requirements are.
you can do either a year in industry or a year abroad – you cannot combine these options.





testimonial
my chemistry degree helps me expand my knowledge not just in the chemistry field but also explore the physical and mathematical side. it causes me to push myself as an individual due to the diverse nature of the course itself.
nishma thakor, chemistry with a year in industry (2020)

the department of physics and astronomy’s teaching academics work on high-profile international collaborations, including experiments at cern. our researchers are searching for new planets around distant stars, developing and applying quantum technologies and theoretical concepts. our psistar physics and astronomy society is extremely active with around 200 members. our academics use cutting edge experimental and theoretical techniques, alongside modern data science, to push the boundaries of their research areas.
the department is proud to have played a role in some of the most exciting discoveries of the past 100 years, including the discovery of the w, z, and higgs bosons, the discovery of the closest earth-like exoplanet to us, proxima b, and the first ‘superstring revolution’.
we have recently recruited new staff in key areas such as particle physics, quantum technology, and space weather. we have state of the art laboratories, computing facilities, and a rooftop observatory, offering high-quality support for physics and astronomy teaching and research.
the department of chemistry enjoys an outstanding research and teaching quality reputation. we are a vibrant department, carrying out internationally leading research in fields such as functional materials and nano science, synthesis, catalysis, and physical and computational chemistry. in the most recent research excellence framework (ref) 2021, chemistry ranked 8th in the united kingdom for research impact and 9th in the uk for research output.
we have recently recruited new staff in key areas such as carbon nanotechnology, organic electronics, and catalysis. the £5.2m refurbishment and modernisation of our chemistry lab facilities have secured the highest quality standard for chemistry teaching and research.
