how to apply and remove daytrana




















long lasting
but not too long



the once-daily daytrana patch is a long-acting adhd treatment that can be removed early to
							fit your childâs individual needs.â 
â daytrana should be applied 2 hours before an effect is needed.
							daytrana should not be worn longer than 9 hours a day. consult your doctor about early
							removal of the patch.






getting started
children come in different sizes. daytrana does, too.

























sizes depicted are relative; dimensions appear below dosage strengths.






sizes depicted are relative; dimensions appear below dosage strengths.


the once-a-day daytrana patch comes in four sizes.

each size delivers a different dosage strength designed to help manage the symptoms of adhd
							in children ages 6-17. the suggested starting dose is 10 mg.
							the dosage may need to be gradually increased based on the patient's response.
together, you and your doctor will find the right dose for your child. the patch provides up
							to 10 hours of efficacy when worn for up to 9 hours—the maximum recommended wear time.

how to apply and remove daytrana
when applied correctly, the daytrana patch should stay in place for the full duration of
							treatment. exposure to water during bathing, swimming, or showering may affect how well the
							patch sticks, so be sure to follow the 6 steps below to ensure you apply the patch properly.
						














carefully cut open the pouch containing the patch, and make sure
										it is not damaged. the patch should separate easily from the protective liner.
										do not use patches that have been cut or damaged in any way. throw away the
										patch if the protective liner is hard to remove.


hold the patch with the protective liner facing youâthe word
										"daytrana" will appear backwards because you are looking at the bottom of the
										patch.


gently bend the patch along the faint line, and slowly peel half the
											liner to expose the sticky surface underneath. try to avoid
										touching the sticky part with your fingers. if you do touch it, wash your hands
										immediately after application.


place the sticky side of the patch firmly on the hip and smooth it
											down. make sure the skin is clean, dry, and cool without any
										powder, lotion, or oil. alternate the hip on which the patch is worn each day to
										reduce potential irritation.


gently fold back the other half and slowly peel off the
										remaining protective liner.


press the entire patch firmly into place and hold for about 30
											seconds. this ensures adhesion of the patch to the skin. go over
										the edges with your fingers to make sure that it's secure.

note: wash your hands immediately after applying the patch. patches should
							not be reapplied with bandages, tape, or other household adhesives. also, do not use hair
							dryers, heating pads, electric blankets, or other heat sources directly on the patch. if you
							have to replace a patch that has fallen off, the total wear time for the first and second
							patch should not be more than a total of 9 hours in 1 day. do not reapply the same patch
							that fell off.









the daytrana patch can be easily removed in 3 steps.






peel the patch off slowly, then fold the used patch in half
											so that it sticks to itself.


flush the used patch down the toilet or, if you have a
											septic tank, dispose of it in a lidded trash receptacle right away.


remove any adhesive residue from the skin by gently rubbing
											the area with oil or lotion.

3

note: any unneeded or expired daytrana patches should be
							disposed of properly. remove patches from their protective pouches, peel off the liners, and
							fold the sticky sides together. then flush the patches down the toilet or throw away in a
							lidded trash receptacle right away. wash your hands after you handle the patch. proper
							disposal is important since unneeded or expired patches still contain medication that could
							be harmful to small children or pets if touched or consumed.
