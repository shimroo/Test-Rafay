morning light



morning light, originally uploaded by m. rosenberg.via flickr:this field is right off of a busy roadway that i take every morning to drop my daughter off for daycare.  i just noticed how the sun hits the wheat/grain/whatever at 8 am every morning.  took this shot with my iphone 4s while sitting in the car at the light.  now my plan is to get out there with my real camera one weekend morning to take a proper shot.  this will have to do for now.    also, that wire won't be there in the next one.  still, i think it's a cool shot.  the iphone 4s can do so much.

velvet sunset



velvet sunset, originally uploaded by m. rosenberg.a tropical sunset, over a tropical sea, next to a tropical pool, with a tropical flower. pretty simple.i was messing around with some processing techniques and somehow ended up with this. i really like the colors, focus, and semi-surreal nature of the picture. it just feels right to me.

guard chair



guard chair, originally uploaded by m. rosenberg.a lonely lifeguard chair staring out at the turquoise waters of montego bay, jamaica.  i'm not quite sure why this beach was empty.  if i remember correctly, this was taken before noon, so most vacationers were still eating late breakfasts and nursing the previous night's hangover.  this was also the farthest beach from the main resort buildings, so it it was always the quietest.this is a two shot vertorama.

sasha at the park



sasha at the park, originally uploaded by m. rosenberg.our 6.5 month old german shepherd sasha out for a walk in the park last weekend. i wish i had something more exciting to post, but i just haven't had time to shoot recently. with a trip to jamaica coming up next week, that could all change quickly.

sasha



sasha, originally uploaded by m. rosenberg.this is sasha. she's our new puppy. today, she turns 10 weeks old (but was 9 weeks old when i took this last week). she's a purebred german shepherd and she's awesome. her full name is sasha fierce von fluffytail. i realize how ridiculous that is, but my wife and i are ridiculous people. you can just call her sasha.i realize puppy pictures aren't for everyone (they weren't for me before i had one), but you'll all just have to indulge every now and then.

my first west coast sunset



my first west coast sunset, originally uploaded by m. rosenberg.the title says it all. i've been to europe, australia, japan, iceland, and many other places, but until two weeks ago, never california. this was my first west coast sunset, taken in pacific beach, san diego. hopefully, there will be many more. unfortunately, i didn't have my tripod, so i had to take a ton of shots and hope that some came out okay. this one is almost sooc.also, it should go without saying that it's embarrassing that i've gone over 2 months since i posted my last shot. i hope there are still some of you that follow my photostream. things got very busy with work, and i just didn't get out to shoot at all. things are only going to get busier on friday when we pick up our new puppy, but at least that will give me a new subject! more coming soon and no more 2 month hibernations.

autumn



autumn, originally uploaded by m. rosenberg.one more shot from my walk in fairmont park last weekend. i wish there hadn't been so much rain this month, as there would probably gave been more leaves on the trees and less on the ground.i did a bit of digital cross-processing and added a texture to give it an older-painting feel.

last light



last light, originally uploaded by m. rosenberg.two exposure vertorama of another beautiful jamaican sunset. i think i'm just about done with the jamaican pictures, although i like this one a bit better. i feel like i overprocessed one or two of the others and this is a bit better. this is what it actually looked like standing on the beach. my wife and i have made a pact to get down to the caribbean at least once a year. it's too easy and there are too many good deals from philly not to.

warmth



warmth, originally uploaded by m. rosenberg.more of the beautiful colors of fall as seen in fairmont park. it never ceases to amaze me as i hike the trails of the park that i've never left the philadelphia city limits and i'm less than 5 miles from my house. pretty amazing park for a huge city.

fall



fall, originally uploaded by m. rosenberg.every year the tree behind our house turns a brilliant hue of orange-red. my wife and i love the few weeks each year when we walk downstairs and see the tree blazing in the sunlight though the window. it's the perfect symbol of fall.i tried to capture its beauty with this shot. this is actually a huge (for me) file made up of 4 separate raw shots stitched together. also, i've decided to add a watermark with my name and title to each shot. thoughts?
