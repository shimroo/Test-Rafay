welcome letter from the pastordear parishioners and visitors, greetings and welcome to st. isaac jogues church in wayne and its website! may the grace of our lord jesus christ, the love of god the father, and the communion of the holy spirit be with you. the mission of the church is the mission of jesus christ, “to have life and have it fully.” jesus is our priest, prophet, and king who sanctifies teaches, and governs the people of god in his church. each parish is part of a universal church in the diocese in which it is located. it exists to carry out the mission of the local ordinary to teach, sanctify, and govern under the ministry of the local pastor and those who assist him. “the parish is a privileged place where the faithful concretely experience the church.” (ecclesia in america#41) the parish “is the place where all the faithful can be gathered together for sunday celebration of the eucharist. the parish initiates the christian people into the ordinary expression of liturgical life-it gathers them together in this celebration, it teaches christ’s saving doctrine, it practices charity of the lord in good works and brotherly love.”you cannot pray at home as at church, where there is a great multitude, where exclamations are cried out to god as from one great heart, and where there is something more: the union of minds, the accord of souls, the bond of charity, the prayer of priests. (new catechism, #2179 and st. john chrysostom) i am pleased to welcome you to our website. our website which includes general information, sacramental celebration and requirements, and parish organizations, programs, etc. is offered to you as a means to assist you with becoming familiar with our parish and participating more fully within it. i encourage each of you to live your lives fully in jesus christ by participating fully in our parish liturgies and the various opportunities we provide through our organizations and programs. may our parish become a vital one through the power of the resurrection and the intercession of st. isaac jogues. — sincerely yours in christ, rev. stephen a. moerman, pastor
