specialist applications









focus on bedding - poultry
correct litter management greatly improves poultry health and comfort.









feeding - straw
feeding straw to dry cows has become a popular strategy to improve health post-calving.









bedding - loose housing
put the priority on quality resting time for your livestock.









maintaining butterfats
when out to grass, traditionally butterfats crash but by adding consistent pre-chopped straw to the ration we have seen butterfats at over 4% in the summer and in the winter up to 4.3%

teagle is a market leading manufacturer and global distributor of robust, reliable and precision made agricultural machinery. 

with a continual investment plan toward product development and manufacturing technology, whilst still holding true to the values of good-honest customer service, teagle continues to keep ‘british built’ agricultural machinery at the forefront of the industry.
