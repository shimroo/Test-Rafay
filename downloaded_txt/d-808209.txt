our story








we do housing differently
at vrs communities, we believe in making the impossible possible. since 1972 we have been advocating for persons with disabilities for higher standards of living and care. we believe every individual has the right to live in their community, regardless of age or ability, which is why we expanded our vision most recently to also serve seniors. with the recent expansion of 11 independent and assisted living communities, as well as ongoing new multi-generational developments, we continue to work for you, not shareholders. a non-profit with an invested business approach, we stand by our commitment to quality care, and looking for new ways forward to improve the lives of our clients.
