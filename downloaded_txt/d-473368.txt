the h-1b visa program allows american companies and universities to hire foreign scientists, engineers and programmers. unfortunately, h-1b law lacks adequate safeguards to protect us workers from being displaced and is abused to provide cheap labor.  although requirements say employers must pay the "prevailing wage," numerous loopholes mean there is little real-world wage protection for either us citizens or the h-1b guest workers.  moreover, employers almost never have to certify that no qualified u.s. workers are available before hiring an h-1b. certification is nearly an automatic rubber stamp.

congress needs to increase domestic worker safeguards, tell the department of labor to stop rubberstamping h-1b applications, and resist pressure from corporate lobbyists to double the annual h-1b visa limit.









immediate calls and faxes needed to help stop h-1b increase
posted sunday sept. 16, 2007


with press attention focusing on the iraq and the illegal alien amnesty, some senators are planning to sneak an h-1b cap increase into the defense appropriations bill this week.

this is a well planned attack.  earlier this month, 13 state governors sent a letter to congress asking for more h-1b visas.  additionally, skilled immigrant groups are scheduled to march on washington for more h-1bs and green cards this week.

take action on sunday

go to numbersusa.com and send these faxes:
tell congress to resist h-1b increases
your governor is pushing for major h-1b increases

take action on monday

telephone your senator and make these points:

1.) tell your senator no h-1b increase.  tell him that the h-1b has hurt your professional career with stagnant wages, job-loss and under-employment.

2.) ask your senator if he or she remembers the "jobless recovery" that lasted until march 2004.  that's just 3 years ago!  the same companies that are now asking for more h-1b workers were laying off thousands then.  remind him that the senate's huge h-1b increase in 2001 made a bad recession even worse.  let's not make the same mistake by increasing the h-1b count again.

3.) warn your senator that many economists now believe another recession is likely because of the mortgage crisis, and the job market may already be deteriorating.  in august 2007 the economy lost 4,000 jobs, yet 160,000 new jobs each month are needed just to keep up with new entrants to the job market.

	senator byrd (d-wv) led the fight against arlen spector's (r-pa) 2005 sneak attack on american workers hidden deep in the 2006 federal budget. unfortunately, in a disastrous sell-out, the senate rejected the byrd amendment 14-85.






















no immigrant bashing







							advocating a major reduction in the number of h-1b visas issued and enforcement of our labor laws shouldn't be construed as advocating hostility toward foreign workers. even those who've violated the terms of their visa should be treated with respect. ultimately, the excesses and abuses of the h-1b visa program are the fault of the congress which has bowed to the high-tech industry lobbyists.
