nova kool manufacturing ulc
off-power grid & mobile refrigeration




 











why buy a nova kool refrigerator?nova kool has been manufacturing mobile and off power grid units for over 30 years. we proudly produce our products in north america on the pacific west coast. while the trend in manufacturing seems to be designing high tech units that are difficult to diagnose and service, nova kool is committed to simplifying its product. we strive to use less moving parts so that components are field replaceable by the end user of the refrigerator. many of our units are used in remote areas of the world, so it is important that the units are simple and reliable. nova kool designs its units based on balancing components for maximum efficiency. while some manufacturers use a motor (compressor) that is larger than our motor - we go the other way. our philosophy is to match the components for maximum efficiency. the refrigerator is a simple machine. it moves the warm air from inside the refrigerator to the outside through a well-balanced efficient package of components. we do not produce a unit that will run on propane as the power source. these are called absorption refrigerators and they run on propane, dc, and ac power. we run on dc or ac power and while we do not offer propane, we run much more efficiently than an absorption unit that is operating on dc or ac power. nova kool markets its products through quality distribution partners and oem manufacturers. please view the tab distributors on our web page. if you have a question or a problem with our unit, just give us a call directly at 604-523-6515 and you will speak with live technical help. sorry to say, you will not have to deal with an endless computer voice and multiple buttons to get to a live person to answer your question! if you are concerned about after sales service and are looking at different brands of refrigeration, please give us a call as well as the other brands to determine the information you are looking for.nova kool manufactures refrigeration. that is our only business, we know it well. happy boating, rving, trucking or using your quiet home away from the grid!

 

green technologywe minimize (gdp) global warming potential with our efficient use of power. we recycle our plastic, cardboard, paper, steel, copper, and aluminum.













what powers you, powers us!our fridges and freezers will run on dc power produced by: hydro, wind, solar, and power stored in a battery.













whisper quiet - by designthe only sound coming from your refrigerator should be the sound of your favourite beverage when the top is popped off! 











 

feeling tipsy?our refrigerators and freezers are designed to run even while you are listed 30° off centre.













we are efficient most of our refrigerators consume less power than a 40 watt light bulb.













we fit where others wontour fridges have been designed to fit unique spaces. they are big on the inside and small on the outside.
