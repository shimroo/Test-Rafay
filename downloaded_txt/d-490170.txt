 the open grovethe open grove was a holistic internet radio program focused on well-being and health. claudia hosted the program from 2001-2006. the interview segments are short — 8 minutes or less — and the experts are wide reaching. the entire program lasts around an hour. we hope you enjoy listening!we are moving the program to a more sharable format. this means we are only able to share a few a month until all of the programs are available. thank you for your patience.
