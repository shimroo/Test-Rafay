a message from our new chairperson
i’d like to take a moment to introduce myself and express my gratitude for your continued support as i settle into the role of your new chairperson. my family and i moved to skagit county nearly ten years ago while i was serving in the navy and stationed at naval station everett. after retiring from 24 years of active duty in 2020, i became involved with the skagit county democrats, indivisible skagit, and the skagit county medical reserve corps.
i grew up in rural wisconsin in a family that faced its share of challenges. my father, who was disabled, worked a union factory job that helped us make ends meet, especially as we navigated life with my youngest brother, who was also disabled. now, as a parent of two—a young woman and a non-binary member of the lgbtq+ community—i am especially grateful to live in a state where our government actively protects their rights. however, we must remain vigilant and prepared to stand up for the rights of all marginalized communities, particularly in the face of potential threats at the federal level.
i want to take a moment to recognize lynn campbell for her incredible work as chair. she has significantly increased the diversity, participation, and effectiveness of our party, and i am deeply grateful for her mentorship and continued involvement in party leadership. thanks to her efforts, our party is in a strong position, and i see no need for major course corrections.
my vision is to build on the solid foundation we’ve established together. while the next four years may bring challenges, i am confident that by supporting one another, we can face them head-on. remember, all politics are local, and democracy is not a spectator sport. i encourage each of you to find ways to stay active in our community. whether you’re donating to a food bank or shelter, volunteering with a local charity, or attending school board or city council meetings, your actions make a difference.
in the coming weeks, we’ll be sharing updates about opportunities to get involved with the skagit county democrats as we reorganize our standing committees. please don’t hesitate to reach out with any questions, suggestions, or ideas for initiatives we should pursue.
thank you for your dedication and for being an integral part of this vibrant community. together, we can continue to make meaningful progress.
in solidarity,
roger phillip
