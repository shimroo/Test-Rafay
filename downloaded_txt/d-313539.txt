spring -
                              
                              plum blossom in my back garden. this is a 
	victoria
      plum and is always one of the earliest trees / shrubs to flower in the
      spring and looks magical against all the bare twigs at the time. it also
      worries me in case there's a frost which kills the flowers, it makes the
      difference between 6 plums or 60lbs of plums.


summer 
							- white lilies - an absolute summer favourite 
							and must-have. what's the point of having a garden, 
							or even just a window box, if you don't take the 
							opportunity to grow pure white wonderfully scented 
							blooms that are often up to 6 inches or more across? 
							plant them somewhere near the house so you can 
							easily see and smell them whenever you walk past.





fall -
		iris foetidissima ripe seed pods. "stinking gladwyn" is the other 
		name by which this iris goes. the flowers are fairly small and insignificant, 
		but it is later in the season that this plant excels, when the large seed 
		pods split open to reveal these jewel-like contents. it's also one of the 
		few plants that actually does pretty well in dry shade.



      winter - teasel seed heads
      against a winter sunset. st.ives (cambridgeshire) church spire can be just made out at
      the bottom right. many plants produce seed heads that if left, can add
      interest and structure to the garden in winter, they look particularly
      good with frost on them.
