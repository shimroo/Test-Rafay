                                        always very nice arrangements. thankful for the driver who decided to return to the shop vs leaving the arrangement in 95 degree stormy weather and returned the next day when the receiver was home, all of which was very appreciated.

                                        5 stars! i searched online specifically for a local harrisburg florist, not a national face-less one. i’m so happy that i found the garden path! the shop had already closed for the day when i started the process, so i ordered it all online with ease. i prefer to not choose a photo of one of the pre-designed arrangements every florist uses and instead choose an amount to spend and ask the florist/artist to design an arrangement to make the recipient smile. success!
