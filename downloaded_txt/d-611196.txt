welcome to vintage pattern flying for 
								all ages!

the senior pattern association was founded by 
								ama model aviation hall of fame member mickey 
								walker in 1991 on the guiding principles of his 
								original vision: simple and inexpensive vintage 
								pattern planes with the emphasis on fellowship, 
								camaraderie and fun. the atmosphere of relaxed 
								family-friendly fun, encouragement, laughter and 
								great flying is an experience that will leave 
								you hooked and very possibly turn you into a 
								really good pilot!

spa competition involves pre-turnaround one 
								maneuver per pass aerobatics flying vintage 
								pattern designs designed and flown prior to 
								12/31/1979. great fellowship and competition 
								combined with affordable, uncomplicated, classic 
								airplanes is a recipe for unmatched fun and 
								enjoyment!

specific rules governing approved aircraft and 
								current maneuver schedules can be found in the 
								competitors guide (link below). basically, 
								spa-legal planes are model airplanes designed 
								prior to 12/31/1979, powered by a maximum of a 
								.65 two stroke or .95 four stroke glow fuel engine, a .91 gasoline 
								engine, or 
								electric motors with specific restrictions. the 
								use of tuned pipes is not allowed, limiting the complication and 
								cost of the aircraft. retractable landing gear 
								is allowed. the simplicity and low 
								cost of early vintage models, in terms of 
								materials and equipment, means that a level 
								playing field is deliberately established, 
								making practice and skill the primary difference 
								between competitors.

here are some links to specific information 
								about the spa. explore the menu up top for much 
								more information.
