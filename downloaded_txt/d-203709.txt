a vintage danish brass table lamp produced by lyfa 1956 and designed by bent karlby. model b146. lyfa has recently reintroduced the model b146 ( governor) as it is considered a classic. the new version is very nice but does miss some of the natural patina and feel of an original.historylyfa was founded in 1903 and initially named kjøbenhavns lampe- og lysekronefabrik (copenhagen lamp and chandelier factory) with kllf as the abbreviated version. at the beginning of the 1930s, the company changed its name to lyfa. taking the ly from “lysekrone” and the fa from “fabrik” as a homage to the origin of the business and how it all began. since 1903, one of the founding principles of lyfa has been to create lighting designs for all occasions and to be the light in the daily life (‘lyspunkter itilværelsen’). during the life span of lyfa, the entire corporation has revolved around the concept of designing the good light in all its facets and shapes. lyfa crafts and explores lighting designs that build on decades of proud traditions within danish design.bent karlby is widely regarded today as one of denmark’s most productive and versatile lighting designers of the 20th century. he started his collaboration with lyfa in the 1940s, which was a partnership that would last nearly four decades. bent karlby is known for his soft light, organic shapes and hallmark peepholes. during his career, karlby moved more towards pure geometric shapes such as the cone, cylinder and arc along with playful colours. unlike many of his contemporaries, bent karlby never employed staff in his studio. he wanted things done his way and was known for his uncompromising work ethics. among his most famous works are the peanut, china, japan, mosaik, ninotchka, barcelona and pan pendants, the ergo table lamp as well as the peacock, quadrille, pan and gothic wall lamps.governor (model b146) is a classic mid-century lamp from 1956 that proved to carry an enduring appeal with design lovers around the world. karlby’s governor lamp radiates a certain international flair. it’s a confident and premium piece of lighting design that still has the power to impress.source: lyfa.com
