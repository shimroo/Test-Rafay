 book review

counterpunch: the story of
a world champion boxer 
by
chris shaw





reviewed
by k.c.
finn for readers' favorite
counterpunch:
the
story of a world champion boxer
is a work of fiction
in the sporting, interpersonal drama, and action sub-genres, and was
penned by
author chris shaw. written for mature reading audiences due to the
presence of
some scenes of violence, inside and outside of the boxing ring, this is
an
engaging and inspirational tale of keeping up the fight through a long
period
of history. we follow sam smith as he starts out his boxing career in
england
in the 1960s, through to his rise to world championship status and the
incredible life experiences and assistance which he gets from all sorts
of
unusual sources.

author chris shaw has crafted a tale that sports fans of all ages are
highly
likely to enjoy and get a lot of satisfaction from. boxers and fighters
will
especially enjoy the technical aspects of the work and the vibrant
atmosphere
of the piece, which really gets into protagonist sam’s head as he goes
through
the many different stages which make him an ultimate champion. the plot
progression has a few little surprises, but overall it builds in a very
logical
structure and gets more inspirational with every chapter. i really
loved the
supporting cast of characters who each contribute something to sam’s
journey,
and i felt they were diversely penned with plenty of variation and
character
quirks. overall, i would certainly recommend counterpunch: the story of
a world
champion boxer for fans of action-packed sports drama that really packs
a punch.
avaiable at
your favorite bookstore, the book depository for freight free, and on
amazon as a paperback or e-book  (see link below).
