we are now offering our inflatables in two weights of vinyl: 15 oz. and 18 oz. both are high grade commercial vinyls. strength for these vinyls is determined by their weave of inside mesh, which we've upgraded to stronger mesh. the difference in weight is created by the thickness of the durable outside rubber coating on these vinyls. both are equally strong and very durable, the 15 oz. vinyl makes a lighter weight bouncer that's easier to transport. the choice is yours!
