(written by our own director of operations when she went through the program back in 2004):hi dan,i’m writing to let you know that my voice-over career is going really well! i started out with a couple of local radio commercials in catskill, ny and then i landed a regional radio commercial for the new york state podiatric medical association, 400 radio stations all over new york state. this one is being done in my home studio and will most likely air next month. in addition to doing the voice-over work for that job, i’m doing the production and marketing end of it as well.i’ve also done an in-house recording for a local company and just recently i was contracted with ets (educational testing service) to do monthly voice-over narrations for their toefl exams. i’ve also made numerous contacts to other potential clients, some who have added me to their talent roster, some have requested hard copies of my demo and others said they will be contacting me in the future for voice-over work. i have also had many compliments on my voice-over demos.i want to thank you for everything such a voice has given to me – the training and all the advice that has followed. i hope this email finds you well. speak with you soon.
my voice-over career is going really well! ~heather costa


as a direct result of your instruction and guidance, i secured work on a 30-second television spot during the election campaign. the commercial aired over 300 times on television. i cannot recommend your course more highly.
i cannot recommend your course more highly! ~david lutkehaus


dear such a voice folks,thank you for helping me gather my resources to begin a new career. the advice, classes, consultations have been inspiring and keep whetting my appetite for my new adventure.the highlight for me has been the class heather taught us in person. it was great to be with other hopefuls, sharing and learning together. at the end of our class, we were presented with a list of our strengths and ideas for choosing the right paths. i have mine hanging up in my living room, across from my recliner.each time i look up and see it, a smile crosses my lips. because of health problems, i’m moving very slowly. but, i’m moving! and your help and the camaraderie of my fellow students is a big part of my success to come.thank you all for your emails, they are helpful reminders that i need and use to plan each step of the way.
the advice, classes, and consultations have been inspiring ~judy herrmann
