lb 34 enacted in the 2024 special session removed the school district property tax credit from the income tax returns effective january 1, 2024, and placed the credit directly on the property tax statements. the adjustment to line 2 of the 2024 form 2210n and form 2220n takes this income tax credit repeal into consideration in the calculation of penalty for underpayment of estimated tax. taxpayers will not need to file a request for abatement of penalty, form 21, if you make the adjustment on line 2 of the 2024 form 2210n or form 2220n as instructed.
