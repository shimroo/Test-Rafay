bct’s mask policybct’s mask policy for the 2022-2023 season will follow closely the recommendations set forth by the cdc based on covid-19 community levels. when jefferson county is at a high level of community spread, masks will be required of all patrons in the wee folks theatre and playspace as well as for participants in classes; and, masks will be highly encouraged in the mainstage theatre. we wish to avoid any outbreaks in the organization because a significant portion of our workforce, specifically our onstage artists, work without the benefit of masks. behind the scenes, we will continue to follow strict protocols to keep our shows on stage and to create a safe work environment for artists and staff.
