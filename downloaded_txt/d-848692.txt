selecting winners in horse racing isn't rocket science, 
						however it can be quite difficult, baffling and 
						perplexing all at the same time. picking winners in horse racing is known as 
		handicapping. it is the art of selecting winners, using all the 
		information and statistics available. it is more of an art or skill as 
		opposed to a science.

one thing is for sure, the people that win 
						more often, know what to look for when studying the 
						racing form. this only comes with know-how and 
						experience, of course a little luck is involved. anyone 
						who tells you that you don't need some luck when betting 
						on horse racing is simply being dishonest. 

we offer you 
						a detailed list of factors that in our opinion, will 
						help you select more winners, more often. with our 
						guide, you can 
						


learn what it 
						takes to pick a winner.





 







one of the first questions people ask me about horse 
						racing is how do i place a bet? it is relatively simple 
						to place a bet on a horse race, althought there are 
						many different types of bets available in today's 
						modern wagering game. the most simple forms of betting 
						are traditionally win, place and show bets. a 						win bet means that you are only betting on the horse 						that crosses the wire in first position. place means the 						horse can finish in 1st or 2nd position and a show bet 						allows you to finish in 1st, 2nd or 3rd place.










      horse racing has its own language, as do many other sports. people in the 
	  know or those who work the backstretch or gamble on horse races may speak 
	  a foreign language to you. here you can learn many of the terms that make 
	  horse racing the "sport of kings". these horse racing terms, often 
						permeate everyday language, especially during election 
						times. talk of a "dark horse" , "two horse race" and

handicap the races ahead of time for better 
	  results - serious handicappers all have one thing in common. 
	  they do their homework in advance. that way they have a good idea of what 
	  they want to bet on before they hit the racetrack. to seriously get into a 
	  racing program it takes me at least an hour of handicapping time. that way 
	  i can access each horses running lines, post positions, jockeys, trainers, 
	  etc.
handicapping should be fun, after all it is a 
	  hobby. hobbies are supposed to be fun. give yourself time to relax and 
	  enjoy the process of selecting winners. i like to get the form the night 
	  before and read it before i go to bed. its kind of like a bedtime story 
	  for me, hopefully one with a happy ending tomorrow afternoon.
