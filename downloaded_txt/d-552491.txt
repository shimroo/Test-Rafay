stop executions last night, february 13, 2025, texas executed richard tabler for killing mohamed-amine rahmouni and haitham zayed after a dispute in bell county in 2004. according to one of tabler’s teachers in the faith-based program on death row, he “worked relentlessly to confront his past, make amends, and seek redemption.” executing him did not promote justice or advance public safety but rather harmed another family.
