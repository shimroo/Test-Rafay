esther s.
google review





i’ve never experienced an accident where i was injured before i’ve never had to hire a lawyer so hiring a lawyer was very intimidating process for me. i appreciate everything gold , khourey and turak did for me. very thankful i had them through the entire process. i will be recommending them to all of my friends and family and i will use them again if i ever have to in the future.

i feel that gold, khourey, and turak have provided me with excellent legal assistance over a period of several years!  their guidance in regards to issues involving oil & gas leasing and pipeline easements have been extremely valuable to me and my family.  i highly recommend their services!!!









melissia g.
google review





when i received a large packet in the mail from a big time oil & gas company saying i had inherited a portion of property they were drilling on, i had no idea what to do, but i knew that i didn't fully understand what i needed to do. i then got in contact with gold, khourey & turak!
i worked closely with christian turak.  he negotiated an agreement on my behalf regarding my mineral rights which resulted in a much higher payment to sell my mineral rights.
