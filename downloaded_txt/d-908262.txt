jamaica new reggae sensation singer jah





with no futher delays avalanche sound introduce singer jah to the world. singer jah is the new reggae singing sensation from kingston jamaica. i have been playing this singer ever since he won magnum king of the dance hall and since that night there was no looking back for singer jah. in others words this singer bad and every dj must have this singer on there play list. so all dj's show your support. about singer jah:born on august 1, 1982, in montpelier, st. james, to parents jennifer taylor and valentine fraser, marconie “singer jah” fraser, later relocated to may pen clarendon at the age of 15, where he began his lifelong dream to become an entertainer. despite attending high school, where he successfully completed 5th form and came out successful with 4 subjects at the cxc level, singer jah’s first passion was always music.  growing up as the younger of two children, singer jah was not to be the only musical prodigy of the struggling, single mother run household. of course, growing up alongside older brother and reggae icon ginjah was not a deterrent, if anything it ignited and further fueled this passion.  listening to his brother singing and deejaying around the house as they went about their daily chores, singer jah often tried to emulate his sound, and most say this sibling bonding served as his main inspiration to try and take this passion to the next level.  after being encouraged by friends and family to take his passion more seriously, singer jah entered the 2006 rising stars contest. despite being unsuccessful, the announcement of another talent contest on the scene could not come soon enough. singer jah never hesitated and jumped at the opportunity to audition for the 2008 magnum king and queen of the dancehall competition.    from his very first audition, and throughout the competition, singer jah became famous for his powerful “waasskaa, waasskaa” chant, which not only shook the minds of male fans, but the hearts of his growing female fan base. with his raspy voice, inviting smile, his humble demeanor, and smooth, rhythmic melodies, singer jah captured the audience of jamaicans home and abroad that tuned in to view the show on 10 consecutive saturdays. on the final night, april 19, 2008, jamaica spoke, and singer jah was crowned the first “magnum king of the dancehall”.    since that night, singer jah has not looked back. with an album recorded  with producer skatta burrell under his belt, and several performances over the past year, including: beenie man’s summer sizzle, stone love 36th  anniversary show, general degree’s manchester fiesta, biker’s fest in montego bay and crystal spring family fun day & stage show in portland. in addition,   now under the management of pology productions, singer jah has not only put out a mixed tape under the same name, but has also been in the streets promoting his latest singles “right on time”  and “suffering” which are now under heavy rotation on several radio and television stations.  with the almighty by his side, and his ever faithful fans eagerly awaiting more releases, singer jah has no plans of turning back now. as a staunch believer in positive and uplifting music for the nation, and soft songs of adoration and affection for his “fluffy” ladies, he promises to continue delivering only the best.

good vibez presents rootz undeground in santa cruz





the revolution that is rootz underground began in 2000 when the band members, whose lives had crossed paths sometime or another from childhood, linked their individual musical talents in search of forming one solid unit. the rootz underground revolution emerged on the scene in a blaze of high-energy performances and conscious lyrics.individually, each had embarked on a road of truth, seeking musical and spiritual harmony, and when their paths inevitably forged to form rootz, they got together to offer up a striking and refreshing mix of conscious lyrics, and a harmonic alternative reggae sound that marries their intellectual, spiritual and creative energies.  this marriage has birthed music that is inspiring, energizing and real, progressive, unique, and with edge their reggae has a modern hip hop feel infused with slivers of jazz, rock and revolutionary dub.  collectively their union affirms an aim of bringing a jah-inspired message to the masses. it pulses with message, from social to love revolution, from the poignant 'rain' to the guttural and revolutionary 'how much longer', and the witty 'in the jungle'.though rootz underground has only just begun digging their 'rootz' in the industry, the band's old soul has already effortlessly enlisted a core of followers - some who already saw the world through like eyes and are glad to hear such sounds of social commentary and life/love lessons on stage; others, simply just converts. whatever it may be, rootz underground is one of few of jamaica's younger bands whose shows are almost always filled to capacity, whose fans will even cross the island to take in the positive vibrations.many more firsts smile at rootz underground from the horizon as their talent shines through and is increasingly recognized in the music business in jamaica and throughout the world. and the revolution continues..don't miss rootz underground @moe's thursday, july 30!

rototom sunsplash 2009 a success





rototom sunsplash 2009another world is possible"un'altro mondo è possible" - "another world is possible" was the motto at rototom sunsplash 2009 and once again, festival-goers, organizers and staff  proved that it is indeed. regardless of ethnicity, colour, or creed people can live together respectfully, in harmony, peace, tolerance, love and unity.having participated at last year's festival, i can happily attest to the harmonious atmosphere experienced - nothing but positivity and love present in the park. every year people come from all over europe and beyond, to see, hear and learn more about reggae, jamaica and its culture, as well as its influence on the music and culture of people around the world. this is indeed a peaceful gathering.although unable to attend the 16th annual european reggae festival this year, i was able to participate virtually. broadcast live over radio, television and live-streaming online, the festival's reggae-loving audience has expanded far beyond the borders of the parco del rivellino at the base of the alps.naturally, as a virtual participant, the energy and vibrations that one feels amongst the throngs of people in the park were sorely missing, but some of the performances were so powerfully brilliant that the vibrations were indeed carried through the ether and felt here in toronto. on night six, the energy of michael franti and spearhead on the main stage vibrated at such a high frequency that i danced, sang, and cheered, sharing love with them and the several thousands of joyous fans who did the same under a torrential downpour. at the close of the show, i was moved to tears as i watched a most gracious, loving franti step down off the stage to walk out amongst his drenched and devoted fans to thank them personally, embracing everyone he encountered as the rain continued unabated. this was an extraordinary and magnificent moment.i was also fortunate enough to participate in a history making moment when bunny wailer, took centre stage for the first time, in italy. the only living, original wailer had for years declined invitations to perform in italy because of its history of injustices in ethiopia. finally, he explained on stage, he changed his mind when he recognized that italians and ethiopians are now creating families together. he knew this was his time and rototom the place. the audience remained enthralled as bunny took us through the "history of reggae" including his classic blackheart man. bunny wailer, in his reconciliation with italy, also announced that he would donate a portion of his fees to the victims of the recent earthquake in the abruzzo region and the balance to organizations in shashamane ethiopia.other concert highlights included junior kelly, steel pulse, alborosie, lynton kwesi johnson, and horace andy among a whole slew of other stellar performers.from this side of the atlantic i was also able to enjoy sunsplash tv between main stage acts. sunsplash tv featured informative and entertaining interviews with performers, guests, organizers, and key personnel working to make this festival such a huge success. this year the broadcast also featured london town, a documentary by reggae historian, radio and sunsplash tv host, pier tosi. performances and debates can still be seen from the rototom website or on arcoiris.tv on the down side and much to the dismay of festival-goers, rototom president, filippo giunta announced, during the closing ceremonies, that as a result of police harassment tactics, next year's location and dates remain undetermined. over the course of the ten days, police and other inspectors conducted searches of merchants' stalls, people's tents and personal belongings for "no real reason connected to emergencies or public order". clearly, when masses of people come together in peace, love and unity, babylon is threatened and unleashes the dogs of hell. how appropriate therefore that anthony b closed this year's rototom festival with a fiery performance.mr. giunta went on to advise the audience that despite resistance, the festival will endure and will continue to grow in strength and numbers even if it must be relocated to another country. for the english   version of mr. giunta's speech visit rototom.com despite the distance and babylon interference, this edition of rototom sunsplash was an enormous success! congratulations to all the organizers, staff and participants. i look forward to next year's festival al vivo.alla prossima,(till next time)maria castelluccimadcast-fuji
