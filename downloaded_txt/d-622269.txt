the amazing power of co2



natural odor-fighter
co₂ naturally breaks down odor-causing bacteria, eliminating them forever.






safe for home
it’s non-toxic, so it’s completely fine to use around children and pets.






deeper clean, fewer chemicals
protein is the root of all pet and people stains, and since co₂ is a natural protein-buster, it has the unique ability to crack open stains, making them easier to clean without harsh chemicals.
