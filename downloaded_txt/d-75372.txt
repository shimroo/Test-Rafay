customer problem:
stranded in florida
				engine won't start & no power to the fuel solenoid.
customer email reply:

				hi terry

				sure glad i took your advice on everything you told me to do 
				before i installed your ecm.
				especially telling me that i needed a new ecm, cam sensor, fuel 
				solenoid & engine wiring harness.
				you were right on terry!
				we installed the complete engine harness, cam sensor, and ecm 
				and she fired right up.
				great ecm product and tech support!
				best money i ever spent on my truck, runs great, better than she 
				ever did before!
				i'll be spreading the word.
				thank you for the help!
jason




customer problem:
stranded in repãºblica 
				dominicana
				engine change over celect plus to celect engine
				engine won't plug up & wrong ecm.

				hi jose
				i see that your engine was manufactured in 1993 cpl 
				1669-l10-330hp
				now we need to make sure the ecm that's on it is a part# 3619037 
				or a 3618046
				this is very important and helps tell me what harness and ecm/ 
				calibration we might should use.
				this is important because the plug on the engine and harnesses 
				must be correct or everything is wrong if we guess wrong on this 
				one.
				that means the harnesses and ecm will not plug in to the oem 
				connector on the truck
				the 98 freightliner probably had a celectplus oem harness, being 
				a frl. 98 glider kit.
				so, did someone change the oem plug to fit the l10 engine 
				harness/ecm or di someone put a new celectplus engine harness in 
				place of the original l10 harness with a celectplus harness?
				this info will help clear up the mystery
				hi terry
we want you to put together a new ecm and the harnesses and 
				any other components we need?
thanks jose
 

				hi jose
i'm sending you the ecm, engine harness, cam sensor & fuel 
				solenoid.
 
hi terry
we got everything today and finished rewiring ecm supply and 
				put all your parts on like you said.
				just wanted to tell you that the truck fired up without no 
				problems!
 
hi jose
				i get lucky every once in awhile
				have a great day!
hi terry

				to me that wasnât lucky, it was a thorough research from your 
				part.
				we got everything you recommended, the ecm, the harness, the 
				sensors, the solenoid, just like you recommended. 

				so youâll know, since the day the ecm arrived first, we 
				installed it to try it and surely enough the fuel solenoid gave 
				out, so as soon as we got the one you sent us it worked like a 
				charm. you can expect recommendations from our behalf!
thanks again, your friend jose
