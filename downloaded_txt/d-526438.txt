milestones







twenty years in the lifestyle this month. i have been kinky longer than 20 years, but i found words for who i am 20 years ago. i remember doing a search online and stumbling upon an aol bulletin board for submissives. i read threads and nodded along to many things said. i decided shortly after i wanted to know more. i sought out everything i could - discussions groups, books and offline and online community. eventually i found many groups, but there was 2 groups i consider my home groups: smart which is still around in cleveland, ohio. it has grown so much.  i am really proud of them and all the amazing education they do and bringing community together.  the other group isn't around anymore, but they were called carpe diem and they were based out of akron. they were really good at making everyone feel so welcome and it did feel like home because it was so comfortable.

those groups as well as many other groups and events across the country - have helped me grow and learn in these last 20 years. i have met amazing people and learned so much about myself.

twenty years in and i am still as passionate about the lifestyle.  still passionate about being a slave. of course there has been ups and downs, but all these years it has still been a part of my being to be a slave and connect with other like minded kinky people. 

 

thirteen years of blogging about my life. the end of october, i passed 13 years of 
blogging about my life.  i have went through ups and downs. i have 
struggled to figure out who i was and come to a place of peace and 
acceptance being a his slave. i have posted emotional vomit, deep 
thoughts, drama filled, silly, 
bouncing all over, daily life, sex, sm, life as a slave, things that 
caught my eye, made me think, and amused me. but i wrote to keep growing
 and learning about myself and be true to me.

my
 posting habits have fluctuated over the years.  i used to post quite a
 lot - looking down at the archives on the sidebar - you can see a 
number behind each year/month.  in 2002, i had the highest number of 
posts - 420.  in 2010, i had 30.  early on in blogging, i was trying to 
figure out what i wanted and who i was because after breaking things off
 with kam i felt lost. now my life is in a place where i always wanted 
it, so i don't blog as much. it doesn't always occur to me write when i am living this life i dreamed about
 for years.

i have known from day one of putting things out on the internet - i would get negative comments and people who didn't agree with me and when you post on the internet you need to know that.  it helped me grow though hearing those other views. seeing things from a different point of view often helped me clarify my own even more. it has been a huge learning and growing experience for me and so glad i have kept up with it for 13 years here on blogger.

 

eleven years being owned by master on february 1st.  11 years ago master and i stood on a busy street in denver and he reached in his 
pocket, took out a heavy hardware chain and lock, 
slipped it around my neck, and locked it in place. no words were 
exchanged.  he lifted my chin to meet his eyes and the unspoken words 
claimed me as his property. there was no words asking me if i would be 
his slave. no words of asking for consent.  it was just a knowing of yes
 this is right for us and claiming me right there.

i remember i did not 
touch at first because i knew if i did i would start crying and we were 
about to be going into a store. so of course i did not want tears in 
there. later in the car master told me to touch it and the tears started
 flowing in the realization of it - the meaning of it and that i was 
really owned by him.  i had felt enslaved to him before that moment, but
 that moment made it real for me. no denying it.

eleven years later, i am still his just as i was that day. each year just seems better and stronger.  feeling incredibly blessed to serve and love him. i look forward to each day with him. i love how we explore our dreams and fantasies together all while keeping our feet grounded in reality. it has been an amazing journey and i look forward to seeing it unfold in the years to come.

 

ten years of withinreality.com. we are celebrating 10 years of having our website in march.  as of the 1st of february, i am moving my blog to our website. some of my writing from this blog will move over there, but some will stay here. i won't be deleting this blog. i will be posting highlights every so often so that you can come visit me over on withinreality.com.  master is also moving his blog over there.  eventually destiny might blog over there too. she is new to the lifestyle so i think it is a good perspective to add to our views.

i love my life. i am extremely passionate about the lifestyle and being a slave. writing is an outlet to express that passion. so i will hopefully be blogging about it many more years. i look forward to writing and sharing many of them. i am always changing and growing and my blog has helped me in that journey over the years and know it will continue to help me in that as i pass many more milestones.

please head over to withinreality.com to not only read our blog, but see essays on the lifestyle and learn more about us. we will also be doing some giveaways in 2014 to celebrate our website turning 10 years so please make sure to check out the blog in march for that announcement.

i want to thank everyone who has supported me here at this blog and hope you will follow me to the new blog on within reality.

end of 2013 and the start of 2014







life update in  bullet points...

* destiny - in october, master and i started seeing someone local.  her name is destiny.  master and i are both head over heels for her...as she is fabulous!  we are over 3 months in now and still have some of the honeymoon phase going on, but we all have settled into a normalcy that is really good. we connect as to her individually, but also all together.  she serves master and is his submissive.  she is my girlfriend. and together all 3 of us are a family. i will write more about her and how things are progressing at another time. but for now we are a family and we are all very happy.

* tied up - for the first time 10 years, i was touched by another man.  master has been the only man to touch in me in the 10 years i have been with him. a local group started a rope bite. you get together and practice rope bondage. i have always loved rope bondage and it isn't something master is overly fond of...he does it, but not his favorite type of bondage.  anyway, a good friend was going and master asked if he needed a rope bottom for it and lent me to our friend for the evening.  now it was totally over the clothes practicing rope, but to have a man touch me even over the clothes in such an intimate way - well again first time in 10 years.  let's just say i was nervous.  yep me who has been with a few men in my time was nervous. our friend was very kind and conscientious of my anxieties.  i really enjoyed myself.  he tied me in ways that made me hurt so good for days. i loved it and i am so very grateful to him for allowing me to be his bottom. i hope we are able do it again sometime.  he is an amazing man and i am so glad he moved to our community.

* holidays - we were out of town for almost 3 weeks straight after thanksgiving into december. so i didn't get the tree up until 8 days before christmas. i didn't get any cards or packages mailed out this year. i didn't get to do many of my usual things like bake. but i will tell you thanksgiving and christmas were absolutely fabulous! having destiny being a part our holidays just made it so special. our thanksgiving and christmas was just us 3.  it was lovely and fun. we watched polar express in the evening of thanksgiving.  we did other traditions with her such as going around and looking at lights and decorating the tree together. we create great memories.  our families are getting used to us talking about destiny and her being here with us as part of our family.  

* family - i haven't seen my bio family in over a year so 
missing them. my grandma also died just before christmas.  she was 97 
years old and been ready for quite some time.  i have been detached from
 it mostly, but at odd times having it hit me.  

* travel - we have had lots of little mini-trips around the state. we went to boulder. then right after christmas we went to denver. we did touristy things like going to the denver art museum.  we had a large hotel room where we were able to enjoy a king size bed as we only have a queen at home.  destiny and i dressed up slutty for master.  our night was hot and sexy - sex and sm late into the night - yums!

we did have a funny moment in target though earlier as we didn't pack condoms or lube - yeah i know what is up with that? anyway, i hadn't bought condoms in a while and neither had destiny so here it is her and i going into buy condoms.  we standing looking at all the condoms and trying to decide which ones we should get. finally we get a package, turn around, and there is a couple standing right behind us - waiting to look at condoms.  i am sure our conversation made them wonder what the heck is going on....2 women buying condoms like we never have....i am sure they thought we were 2 lesbians who picked up a man to try it out. lol  :)  anyway thank goodness we got the condoms, because oh they were used. destiny riding master is such a hot sight. oh yeah so sexy.  we are damn lucky to have such a sexy beautiful woman.  so grateful we met her.  

* friends -  i know in september, i said we were more active in the local community.  well we kind of dropped out of it again. one reason - we started seeing destiny. when i say seeing her -  i mean we see each other everyday for the last 3 month except when master and i have work/business out of town and she can't come with us.  we are living our dream life and it is hard to fit other things in. really we haven't even seen the kinky friends we are close to that often either.  we are missing them and hope to get together with everyone soon. unfortunately we are like that new couple that doesn't contact their friends when they are seeing someone new because they are so into each other...yeah we are all so into each other are kind of oblivious to others outside us. often we see stuff posted online and go hmm must of have missed what that is about because it doesn't even make sense to us as we are so outside it all right now and so into each other.  

* sharing - i did a little talk for a group of submissive on service. i remembered, although it makes me nervous, i do like sharing information and ideas. i am going to have that talk and some additional thoughts on service up on our website soon. 

* therapist - i came out to my therapist about bdsm.  now she knows everything.  it helped her put things in perspective a little differently. a few things made more sense to her.  and as always she was fabulous when i came out to her about it. she gets it so well. she sees where i struggle and why and in a bdsm context.  she loves destiny and thinks she is a positive force in my life as destiny has made me see myself slightly differently. i was on this course last year of really allowing some of the parts of me that i turned of to come back out and play and master has been great about it too, but destiny being a woman has helped me understand parts of myself better by seeing myself through her eyes.  not sure that is making sense, but i just know she has helped me and my therapist sees it too.

* art & photography - both are playing huge part in my life. it is something i do with a good group of friends as well as destiny too.  i know art and photography are going to continue to play a big part of my 2014.

really i am just so grateful that 2013 was a year filled with ups and downs, but overall joy and love which makes it a truly beautiful year. i look forward to 2014 as i know it is going to be fabulous!

peeking little girl





 




a couple months ago, master bought me some double chocolate malt balls.  i really am not sure why i had a craving for them as it is just not something that i crave ever, but i did.  when i popped one in my mouth and bit down, i had a strong memory flood to the surface. i didn't think about it until i tasted them and surprised i didn't have it come back when i started getting the craving.  but it took a bite to remember that i used to buy some at malley's candy store in cleveland for kam. they were one of his favorite things. 

kam was my dominant, master and daddy years ago.he and i had a pretty intense daddy/little 
girl relationship. some of it was me becoming a little girl with baby 
talk, dressed in pink with pigtails tied in ribbon, squishing my teddy bear tightly 
in my arms. some of it was more role-play - such as playing a catholic 
school girl being sent home with a bad report card and being punished by
 daddy.  some of it was me as an adult woman having that nurturing 
protective role of daddy there always for me.

kam was daddy from the first moment i met him.  it was like the little 4 year old girl had been waiting for him.  because of that i feel he helped me deal  with abuse from when i was that age. i see now how it was a way
 to heal that little girl inside me.

because of how intense and the role it played in the dynamic with kam, it has been hard to do age play with master. kam died 3 years ago and we had unresolved issues - so i have always assumed that was partly the reason i had trouble releasing that side of me. but i do wonder if i needed that side at that time with him to heal and maybe i don't need that anymore or i don't need it in the same way. i can feel that part bubble to the surface at times, but just little peeks. i guess i am not sure if it is a something that i don't need anymore or if it is just not the right time or if it needs to be different .....not sure what other reasons.  

master is daddy to me, but not as little girl - age play sense. it is more as an adult woman who 
likes the feeling he gives me - such as  feeling extremely safe and 
protected by him. i am extremely shy and having daddy there to help me 
navigate social settings is amazing. being able to hold his hand as he navigates us through a crowded room. or leads a conversation when he knows i am having problems are all things that make me feel nurtured and protected by him. he is daddy in that sense.

recently several instances have come up - the malt balls, a game and just someone said something that reminded me of kam.  it is making those feelings of desire for that side come up more.  it made me wonder if that part is getting ready to come back out.  i know for sure it has made me smile instead of having a sense of sadness. i guess time will tell if that part of me will do more than peek.

when is m/s right for you?







when i was 16, i was involved with a boy who tied me up and spanked me. we eventually had sex.  but i was kinky. i didn't know there was a 
word for it though until much later. i was 27 when i discovered words 
for who i was and what i liked. it was
 probably close to a year after that i actually got the nerve to go into
 barnes and noble and order different loving
 which had only been 
published a couple years prior (before the days of ordering things online as amazon wasn't around). i was with my husband at the time and 
trying to get him to be okay with naming the relationship i felt we had 
before i knew there were words for it.  when i came to the section on 
24/7 in different loving, i knew i wanted to be a slave.  i don't recall
 anything that was said, but i still remember how i felt. i 
knew reading it that i wanted to belong to someone 24/7 and be a slave.  

after 
my marriage ended, i knew i was going to seek a m/s dynamic. i bottomed
 and did a d/s relationship for a bit, but never felt totally fulfilled.
 i am glad i played and explored before jumping into m/s. not everyone is going to want m/s...i get that.  i also get that not everyone wants to be a bottom or do a d/s relationship.  these are not  the only options in kink world for relationships. i am saying, by exploring, i could gain life experience, self-awareness, and also find out what elements i wanted and needed from a kinky relationship. i am thankful i explored first to figure things out before jumping into a m/s relationship as it helped me 
identify what elements i wanted in a relationship - period - m/s, top/bottom, d/s, owner/puppy - or whatever type of relationship desired. 

why am i 
writing all this... what is my point..... well... i was asked recently 
if i felt it was okay to jump straight into a m/s dynamic when new to 
bdsm and my answer was no. but i realized i didn't explain why.  i think a person needs to have self-awareness, a good
realistic view of m/s and life experience to know if it is really the 
best path. but only you can decide that.  only the person wanting to walk this path can know if it is right for them.


i have been around people who were young in age, but had life experience and amazing levels of self-awareness and if they asked me if what i thought about them getting into m/s - i would probably say, "go for it."  i have known people in their 40's who lacked self-awareness and life experience and might tell them that maybe taking some times to really get to know themselves might be better before jumping into m/s. i have a very close friend in her late 30's recently ask me what i thought about her pursuing a m/s relationship although she is new-ish to bdsm and i told her i could see the slave in her and understand why she wants/needs it as her path. i 
think she knows enough about what she wants and needs in a relationship to know if m/s was right for her.  she was going to do it without my validation, but sometimes just hearing it helps that knowing inside shine brighter. 

although it might feel right and shine bright inside - there are still times you might question. you still might go is this really right for me even if most of the time it feels so right. you question because you are fighting against messages we have been told all our life - we question because it feels so different to actually be doing the thing we want as we often think it is not possible to have what we want - and we question because it is just our internal workings nature to question.  it is okay to want m/s and it is okay to go after it and it is okay to question.   

just know m/s doesn't happen over night. relationships build out of compatibilities. it takes time, energy, communication, and investment in each other to grow into it. but again the only person 
contemplating it can decide and know if they are ready and want to try.

break ups







first master and i are good.  i will say that again master and i are good. we are not breaking up. we have been together for 10 years - through good and bad and each year strengthens our relationship.

but breaking up is a part of  almost everyone's lives. most of us go through it at least one point in our lives.  it took many tries of finding that one before master claimed me as his. it takes a lot of time and energy to find the one and even more time when poly and looking.  the end of may master and i ended our relationship with teacup. it has been extremely hard on each of us. master and i have been there to help teacup in processing just as she has been here for us too. 

i know the dominants i have been with have felt it their responsibility 
to be there for the submissive because the dynamic ending impacts so 
many parts of daily life. i know in my past relationships it helped me 
to have the dominants support me while i processed and healed my heart. 
 i am thankful for having such caring and kind men in my life.  

my first dominant after my marriage was a long distance relationship. he broke things off with me because he knew i wanted m/s and he didn't and he also was wanting someone closer in distance to him. i am lucky he was a really nice gentleman as he kept in contact with me for a long time after our break up. because he had been my dominant and had control over my life one day and then the next didn't so he didn't want me to feel completely abandoned. he helped me process and work through the grief of the break up. eventually we lost touch with each of us moving.  but i am ever grateful for the contact he had in those months after the breakup.
  
my breakup with kam was extremely hard because it wasn't a true breakup. we ended the m/s, but continued the daddy/little girl and went to being boyfriend/girlfriend and still lived together.  it was hard because i had been enslaved so serving him all day every day for almost 3 years and then we changed that so it was hard not to just naturally do the things i had been doing - such as getting him a drink and the other acts of service that were my daily life. i did do some as his girlfriend and little girl, but it was hard to figure out the line and boundaries. he was very kind and supportive of me trying to process the end of the m/s. 

maintaining a connection even as friends/family i think is important after ending a d/s or m/s relationship.   the dynamic can be difficult to move on from because our worlds become so intertwined with these kind of relationships. when that dynamic ends, it can leave each party feeling lost, confused, and alone. so reaching out to one another to ensure each person is processing and moving forward safely - is just a good thing to do.  the people involved come to each other knowing each person is hurting, processing and dealing with grief differently, but not abandoning each other.
  
for some people it might be easier or just part of their personal coping from grief to not have that other person around. in the end you need to do what is best for you, but communicate that so the other knows to seek support elsewhere. 

when d/s protocols have been such a big part of each persons life, it can be hard to navigate the world without it in place. we each had responsibilities in the dynamic and just because the dynamic ends doesn't mean the connection stops. be kind to yourself and each other.

new to fetlife?





are you thinking of joining fetlife?  a little nervous and curious what you will find?  what to know some tips on helping your experience be more positive on fetlife?

fetlife is like facebook for kinky people.  it isn't geared towards finding a dominant, submissive or just sex partner - it's not a meat market. but i will say by participating you might find someone that captures your 
interest so it isn't out of the possibility to find a kinky partner.  

so tips:

fill out your profile. -  be honest, be yourself, be open, but no need to overshare or spill out your whole life's history on it.  if you feel your profile is going too long. make it a writing and link to it in your profile. (faq on how to link and other fetlife formating codes)
upload a photo.  men having just dick shots won't make people flock to you. make sure you have other photos uploaded please. i have to say the same for women - just tits and pussy shots don't do anything to help you find someone.  
fetishes - having a huge list of fetishes makes it harder to scroll through your profile. i suggest not listing every single one and listing those that are the most important and you feel define the type of dynamic you are in or seek. 

this is a social media platform so join groups, share photos 
and writings, comment, and jump in to get know people and make friends. i
 really wouldn't suggest one group over another as it really goes to 
what groups match your interests best.  such as if you are new to the kinky world - then novices and newbies might be good for you. interested in poly and kinky?  or are you kinky and geeky?  a submissive woman?  my suggestion is look at the groups your friends like. you can browse them on their profiles. i have friends with similar interests so have found good groups by finding groups my friends are a part of too. 
  
by participating 
in groups, posting blogs, commenting and just generally interacting with
 others on this type of internet platform - you will get people voicing 
all sorts of views - often in disagreement with your own. it is a public
 forum made for everyone to share opinions, thoughts, beliefs and silly 
stuff. so don't take anything too personally and view it as learning 
experience instead of an attack. we all want to be heard and connect 
with people and this type of platform can give us that - just not always
 in ways we expect.

last bit of advice - think before posting and be true to you.

fainted during play





this past weekend we were at a local event and i just briefly mentioned something that happened to me years ago.  i went to look in my blog to see if i could find mention of it and i couldn't find it. i thought it happened in 2001 with a play partner, but couldn't find it so thought i would share.  

i had been in the scene for about 7 years when this happened.  i had played before and not ate all day so really didn't think anything of doing it again. i mean i knew that it was a risk and had heard that you should eat, but i never had a bad reaction - except one time. 

my play partner put cuffs on me and attached me to a st. andrew's cross.  he was flogging me for a bit and then i started feeling clammy and dizzy.  i called to him and he came up to me and i said, "i think i am going to faint..." - and i fainted. i slumped and he grabbed me. luckily i was attached to the st. andrews because i could have fell on the hard floor near several pieces of equipment and possibly hit my head. he called a friend over and just as he was going to have her undo a cuff, i came right back.  he got me out the restraints and sat me down.

after we talked to try to figure out what it could have been - running down a list of usual suspects in these kind of cases - locking knees, meds, illness, fatigue, not eating and so on. i realized at that moment - i hadn't ate. we still don't know if that is the case, because as i said above i had played without eating all day before and never had a bad reaction.  but this time i did.  my play partner was fairly new to the scene so he actually was happy to have a learning experience from the situation. upset i fainted, but glad to see what happens and what to take away from it.  from that scene on -  i made sure i ate before hand so i learned too.  i have never fainted again.

i have a good friend that faints from playing quite often - just because her body goes into shock with pain play.  her body just doesn't know how to handle the assault of the sensations and goes into shock.  so she has to negotiate and really educate her top before playing.

my point of telling this story is....things happen. sometimes we can prepare for them. sometimes we can't. sometimes things happen and there is no explanation of why.  it is okay.  do your best to learn from it and move forward.

here are two links to learn more about illness and fainting during play:
facing sudden illness during play
assessment and treatment of "fainting" during bdsm play

service to enhance his life






i think a pitfall of  d/s and m/s relationships is thinking that you have to do x,y, z to actually be "doing it right."  but really there is no right way to do a d/s or m/s relationship.  do what works for you.  do what fits in your relationship naturally.  finding protocols, rules or service can only be figured out by the people in the dynamic because you live your lives day in and day out.  it doesn't need to be complicated.  you don't need page after page of rules or protocols.  start small and simple and build on it. 

it is easy to take things people say they do and make them work for you.  a protocol i have read is about the submissive walking on the right side and one step behind the dominant. now why people do that - i am not so sure.  but we have taken that rule and made it into a practical service i do for master. he
has me walk on his right side because he is hard of hearing and that is the side of his good ear. so i walk on the right side so he can hear me. he didn't create this rule because it is what "slaves should do" - he created it because it makes his life easier.   so figure out how to make rules, 
protocol and service that enhances daily life.   


here are some examples of service that i do in my dynamic that might help spark ideas for your dynamic...



chauffeur/driver - i do drive master very occasionally
domestic service - i clean, do laundry and cook 
secretary - i take notes for his business, do filing, manage household
 bills, sort mail, shred paper work and so on
personal care - give him massages, cut his toenails, give 
manicures, trim eye brows/pluck eye brows, trim his goatee, 
shave him, at times i will wash him and/or
 wash his hair, make sure he takes all his meds and vitamins daily, 
set out his clothes, take care of his clothes - such as buttons 
replaced, hems falling, boot-black/polish shoes, pack if we are
 traveling
yard work
general catch-all -  such as general household repairs - such as the sprayer on 
the sink wasn't working and so i replaced it or  maybe master needs 
something i can't do then i research or handle parts of it - if not all 
of it - such as we need to get a bush/tree pulled out of our backyard 
then i will be calling around to get prices and see what the process is 
like, cleaning the inside of the car, or shopping for gifts or making them if he wishes
companion - i often ride with master even if it is him going into a meeting for an hour and him just wanting me there when he gets out. he likes to snuggle up on the 
couch watching a movie or playing a game - he enjoys my company and 
wants me available to be able to relax with him. 


i am sure i am forgetting things, but this is just a starter list to get you thinking about areas of service. you also might want to read this post over on our website about the authority master has over my life. 

as always talk. i suggest if you are submissive reading this that before implementing any type of service - talk to your dominant.  see if he/she wants it  - because if he/she doesn't then it isn't really serving them.  to help figure out what areas will make the most sense in your dynamic -make lists of everything that the dominant does everyday for a couple of days to a week and then go through together and see if there are things the submissive can do to help serve the dominant.  be realistic and practical, but don't forget you can add some spice to things if you both desire mixing the things you fantasize about with real life.

blogoversary





i have been blogging 13 years today.  

here is my first blog entry....october 27, 2000


blogger here i come...



this is my first post to my blogger...woohoo lol

i created a new 
name for myself today and so with that step into a new direction...i 
decided to creat this blogger and start posting my thoughts, rants, 
raves and whisperings. 

i
 created a new name that fits me better then i think any other name has -
 danae.  there is a painting by gustav klimt titled danae.  i have been 
drawn to it for years.   here is a link to a picture of the painting: http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~dbi9m/klimt/pix/women/pdanae.jpg

i
 did a search trying to find out what the painting meant...who danae 
was....and i found out that she is the mother of perseus in greek 
mythology.  when doing a search on danae i came up with a site that told
 the meaning of names...and it had danae listed.  

it is what made me see that the name danae was meant for me....

here is what it read:
the name of danae gives you a clever, quick, analytical mind, but you 
suffer with a great deal of self-consciousness, lack of confidence, and 
much aloneness because of misunderstandings. your idealistic and 
sensitive nature gives you a deep appreciation for the finer things of 
life and a strong desire to be of service to humanity. there are times 
when you experience inner turbulence at your inability to say what you 
mean. it is far easier for you to express your deeper thoughts and 
feelings through writing than verbally. you find pleasure in literature,
 in poetry, and in your ideals and will turn to them when you feel you 
have been misunderstood. you are deeply moved by the beauties of life, 
especially nature. because your feelings run deep, you must guard 
against the ups and downs, being very inspired one minute, then moody, 
reserved, and depressed the next. your reactions to people vary 
according to how you feel. you tend to be secretive and noncommittal 
about private matters, yet at times you will talk effusively in order to
 hide your self-consciousness or to lead others away from personal 
subjects. you are inspired by encouragement from others, yet suspicious 
of their intent. you crave affection but seldom find anyone who 
understands your nature. physical weaknesses would show in your heart, 
lungs, or bronchial organs. 

those above words describe me almost too well.....

so today i created the name danae and start a new path....

good night...

peace & serenity,
danae

packing list....





we are going to a kinky gathering tomorrow.  i was checking my list of things to pack/bring....

pasta salad
spoon for salad
brownies
m&m's
plates, silverware, mugs
kettle
hot cocoa and tea
paper towels
towels 
ziplock bags 
bottled water
leash
gag
cuffs
ibuprofen, inhaler, allergy meds
garbage bags
blankets 
winter coats, earmuffs, gloves

this list amuses me....because of course it seems like a regular old list for people going on a picnic/camping. but right there in the middle you can see a few things that aren't regular camping items.looking forward to getting together with like minded people tomorrow.
