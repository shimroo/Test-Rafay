breast augmentation costs 


        	the cost of a breast augmentation procedure can depend on numerous factors, including the type of breast implant (saline, silicone), size of the implants, regional factors, and the rates of the plastic surgeon you select.



eyelid surgery costs 


            eyelid surgery, aka blepharoplasty, costs have generally been decreasing as this type of procedure has become increasingly in-demand over the years. 



face lift costs


            what you can expect to pay for a facelift will partially be determined by how dramatic your transformation is. mini facelifts, or minor surgical alterations, will clearly cost less than a major readjustment of the facial tissues.  



liposuction costs


            there are many different types of liposuction procedures (tumescent, laser-assisted, etc), and prices can vary by considerable margins, particularly depending on the extent of the fat removal required. 



rhinoplasty costs


            a rhinoplasty, or nose job, is among the most common forms of cosmetic surgery performed today. rhinoplasty costs also tend to be well within most budgets, even as surgeons continue to develop new, hi-tech methods for nasal alterations. 



tummy tuck costs


            the cost of a tummy tuck or abdominoplasty is typically most dependent on the size of the area being readjusted. mini tummy tucks may cost less than half of a full tummy tuck procedure.
