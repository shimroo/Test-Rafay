service line inventoryto protect our customers from lead in drinking water, we are working to identify and catalog all service lines, including those in homes. to limit cost and disruption to residents, we need your help identifying your home's service line, which connects your residence to the main water distribution pipes. there is no danger to the public - this survey is simply a way to eradicate any lead in the village's water system. please follow this link to complete the survey that will help to determine if your home contains lead service lines. this link shows the "unknown" service line inventory areas in the village of ottawa.  thank you for your help in completing the surveys!
