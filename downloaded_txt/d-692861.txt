myles cook
class of 2020
"as i reflect on the years that i spent at bayside academy, i truly can say i wouldn’t have wanted to spend my high school career any other way. i feel more than prepared academically and athletically to begin the next chapter of my life as i enter college. i will always remember and cherish memories of bayside whether it be with the cross country and track team, the closeness of our grade at pine mountain, or simply eating lunch on the bluff. bayside is truly special, and i am thankful to be able to say that i was a part of it for six years."

"my son scott (class of 2012) still talks about the impact that bayside had on his development:  academic, social, and ethical. largely because of mr. small's and mrs. dyson's passionate class presence, scott decided to enter the nursing field at uab. scott's work ethic, academic rigor, and time management skills, developed here at bayside, helped elevate him into the honors program at one of the best nursing programs in the country. he is currently working on his master's degree in clinical nursing. we credit bayside for so much of his success!"
