              2011 saw the beginning of the important collaboration with
              spyderco. the sr1 model is customised for this project by
              combining the universally recognisable lionsteel design with
              the spyderco logos and hole for single-handed opening.
              
              






pohl force: kilone foxtrot

              out with the foxtrot folding model to then
              include the fixed blade version - kiloone.

              hest folding knife. in 2011, another three fixed-blade knives
              were immediately added to this folding knife model.
              during 2012 the family of lionsteel-dpx products was further
              extended.

gino pauletta after half a century of experience
              in the world of cutlery undoubtedly has
              an enviable level of professionalism and
              experience. but only recently, after his sons
              daniele, gianni and massimo joined the
              company, he has been able to dedicate
              time to his main passion: creating unique
              pieces that are completely hand made.
and so, alongside the commercial brand
              with the lionsteel trademark, there has been
              for some years now an exclusive and artistic
              collection, completely hand worked and
              signed by the artist.
but there is more.
              gino pauletta decided to place his skills at your
              disposal and to turn your ideas into reality.
              in fact you can now have your projects turned
              into a real knife, custom – made just for you.
              contact us, the artist is waiting to hear from you.

            for perfect use and maintenance of your knife,
            please follow these simple instructions:
            keep you knife well sharpened.

            keep the locking area of the knife clean, dirt may
            cause the locking mechanism to malfunction.
            we suggest to use compressed air to clean this area.
            in many of our knifes there is steel
            with a high percentage of carbon, in
            order to keep them sharp longer.
            unfortunately carbon causes rust.
            therefore we suggest frequent cleaning and to
            put a light coat of protective oil on the blade.
