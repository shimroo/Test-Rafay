warren redlich





if you're looking for photos or images of warren redlich, we have the latest here. when warren is not working as a realtor or attorney, he's living life. here's a brief gallery.

 

warren redlich is a man on the move. in this case moving while he's supposed to be still for a photo. eventually we got it right and here's warren where he's supposed to be:

 

when he's not modeling, warren is either working or eating. sometimes they go together. here's warren redlich eating a hot dog with west boca news advertiser john (jack) rose at his hot dog stand in west boca raton, florida.

 

sometimes he gets to spend time with old friends. here's warren redlich with some of his old high school buddies. they met in myrtle beach for a golf and beach vacation. it was a great trip.



then there's training. here's warren with some florida friends including alex berry and marc tancer (the sad jets fan and owner of taggart trading) at a shooting range in okeechobee. those paper targets did not look healthy after this crew was done with them.




and then there's quality time with the wife, in this case at a breast cancer walk at mizner park in boca raton.

carmelo laquidara for rensselaer district attorney







the albany lawyer has been quite for a while. moving to florida will do that to a guy.

but today we learned that carmelo laquidara is running for district attorney of rensselaer county.

i've dealt with carm in his roles as a prosecutor, defense lawyer and judge. he's a class act, a real pleasure to work with, and someone who has common sense. i could not imagine a better person to become district attorney, anywhere.

go carm!

google canonical quirk?






how well does google handle the canonical  tag?

we just found a quirk that makes us wonder. here's what piqued our interest - we noticed some landing pages in our google analytics that were not consistent with our url structure. check the image below:




as you can see, two of our top landing pages appear twice under slightly different urls. one version includes a 4-digit number (the post id) at the end of the url and the other does not.

several days ago, before we published these articles, we changed to our current url structure where we added the post id to the end of each post url (in the hope of getting into google news). so it could make sense that some source of traffic might get the old urls. but we published these particular articles after the change, so they were never "published" to search engines under the old structure.

our facebook, twitter and google+ posts were all linked using the new url. and we do include the  tag in our posts, pointing to the url with the 4-digit number in it, as you can see below:




at first we weren't sure what source was sending users to the link without the post id. so we searched for the article title and sure enough, we saw that google was directing users to the old url:




we don't understand why, but the first search result has my authorship, and the link does not include the 4-digit code. the second and third results do include it, and the 2nd one is from before we changed our url structure.


is this important? it doesn't seem to be a huge deal. but it's an interesting quirk in google's search results
