	 whatever happened to the good old muscle car?
    



whatever happened to the good old muscle car?   by dave tishkowhatever happened to the good old muscle car? you know what happened to them, the imports took over! back years ago you could find what is now considered a classic on every street corner. these days when you stop at a red light you see a honda, toyota, or some sort of american made car that should say honda or toyota! people have sure changed, and for the most part it's not good for us hotrodders. young teenagers used to get excited about taking out dads camaro, mustang, or cuda, nowadays they're excited to take out the 4-door civic. in case you youngsters didn't know, a 4-door honda civic is not a fast muscle car, nor will it beat one in the ¼ mile. so what do they do to make their car "faster"? they put a 6" exhaust tip, and fiberglass hood on it and fly around making as much buzzing noise as they can!!! as if that were not bad enough, car manufacturers like gm discontinue cars like the camaro and firebird and come out with cars like the cobalt. did you know they sell the cobalt with factory "hop-ups" so you don't have to do the work of making it look and sound ridiculous? just look at the chevy impala, does that even resemble an impala? the only cars gm has that are even remotely quick are the over priced corvette and the gto, which is not too bad. i applaud ford for continuing to make mustangs, and dodge for bringing back the charger, but is that all you got? i'll never understand americans who continue to buy these "imports", and spend time working on them, just to make them uglier than they already are and probably slower. i don't intend to criticize anyone, but if i did too bad. about the authorlong time racing and muscle car enthusiast, machinist, welder, business owner of www.davesraceshop.com, and long time drag racer.please visit our corvette site...

	 why are custom cars popular?   by matt garrett
    


the flames from the silencer of the car burst out, as if the car would fly. the bright red spoiler adds to the glamour of the car. the blue light which throws itself beneath the car entices you to the top and the paint and stickers make you want that car. you probably would have imagined one of the best custom cars, by the time you read these lines. what do you think, why custom cars like these are so popular and people just can't stop making their cars like one of them? why every time a customized car passes by you, your heart skips a beat? think about it.well, the reason behind the popularity of custom cars can be many. but let us discuss some of the major reasons. one of the prominent and arguably the predominant reason behind custom cars is street car racing. the second reason behind the popularity of custom street cars is the craze and the love of people for their cars. they want to see their car and its performance in a completely new way and please click here to read more...more fast cars information....

girls like them fast and furious too! by sue defiorewhile today we have women racing in indy, nascar and a variety of different racing venues, years ago this wasn’t the case.in fact, during the era i grew up in women were looked upon in a very different light. if you deviated from the norm you were labeled as a "tomboy". however, there were many, like myself who loved to drive, work on cars and got a lot of satisfaction in doing so. just because we did however, didn’t mean we weren’t women, girls, ladies, whatever you wish to be called.many of us so called "tomboys" were the product of being first born girls with dads who wanted the prodigal son first, but got a daughter instead. my dad and i watched sports together, baseball, football, basketball. in fact, my dad was the neighborhood dad (those who grew up when i did will understand) and played with all the kids in the neighborhood. we would have touch football games, kickball, baseball, t-ball and even badminton and volleyball games.i developed an avid interest in cars, because my dad worked for rolls royce and was always bringing some great cars home. he brought home joe namath’s jaguar, a silver cloud rolls royce (owned by one of the builders in the area i grew up). in fact i got to drive it, which was a thrill to say the least.  read the complete article ... http://www.goarticles.com/cgi-bin/showa.cgi?c=53228more webwheel news...
