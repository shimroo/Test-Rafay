about the land use plan
the dehcho first nations interim measures agreement provides for the development of a land use plan for the dehcho territory. a land use plan outlines what types of activities should occur, where they should take place, and the terms and conditions necessary to guide land use decisions. the interim land use plan is intended to be legally binding within the regulatory system once approved and implemented.
the draft interim dehcho land use plan has been under development since 2002. the committee is completing revisions to the draft interim plan based on reviews of the parties to the committee, and engagement with other organizations.
