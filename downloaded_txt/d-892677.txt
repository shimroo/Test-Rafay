i know that it is not a good thing to talk of politics, yes i know this....i wish my mil knew this as well .i also know that there is no place like home=america the land of the free!this year i am a political junkie, yes you read correctly...i am addicted to politics! egads i never thought i would be this person.  if i am not perusing the papers, i am watching tv and when all else fails i am talking with those that understand and share my concerns.i walk the floors at night praying that my candidate wins and during the day i give thanks for my faith that the lord will prevail and put that person in office.so let the last debate roll and with god..... all things are possible!

life moves so fast here lately that i can barely keep up with the current.  as you all know hurricane ike came into to texas blowing down trees, fences and power lines...it was a mess. the hard part was living back in time, another era without electricity. there are good sides and bad side to that coin.  i know why people had short lifes then because it is hard!  a few weeks prior to the hurricane my favorite aunt was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.  i knew little about it, but quickly began my online education and was floored by the short time she would have.  she passed away 12 days after ike hit.  i still don't know what normal is and i think it is going to take all of us some time.  especially my granny losing her only daughter, it is very difficult for her and that makes me worry.i hang onto to memories and the hope that i will a better person....just half of what my aunt patsy was would be an improvement.i miss all of my blog reads!

my life is consumed with baseball. i know you thinking "well as much as you love it, why are you complaining?" well in case you failed to notice it is hot!  it is so hot here that the squirrells are using pot holders to gather their nuts! well, almost that hot.also this year is a little sad for my little twin christian, because he was not picked for allstars.  so this is the first time in history that only one of boys is playing and the other is on the sidelines watching a sport he loves to participate in.  this part of political baseball is aggravating!so every weekend we travel here and there and spend 9-11 hours on saturday and sunday playing in tournaments.  like i said it is hot! and then during the week we have 3 hour practices four times a week.....i am kind of hoping we lose (don't tell caleb) so that it will be over!plus factor in the fuel costs, last weekend it was 77 dollars in gas.it made me start looking at toyota prius hybrid.  so i emailed the toyota salesman i know and he informed me that there is a 16 week waiting period....well , forget that!while christian is sitting in the bleachers he thinks it is his duty to play coach to the batters on our team.  "hey alex is that the bat your dad paid $500 dollars for?"  "yeah" "well then why don't you put to good use and hit a ball this time?"?yeah he is funny and a tad bit outspoken!

we have all heard people whine and complain about their childhood or lack-of one. you hear others blame their mistakes on it, never taking ownership for their own choices. then you hear stories that truly break your heart into and makes you realize that you are truly blessed to have escaped the brutality of someone elses abuse.i don't know why i am rambling on about this, really. you know i don't delve too deep in private waters, especially on the bloog-ie. but i wonder if i am truly hard-wired for dysfunction?years ago i went to counseling and stopped. then started and stopped....you get the picture. really i don't think any of them can top a one-on-one relationship with god. the way i see it is if i need help, he is my salvation. most counselors want to give you a pill to help you through it or give you some mumble-jumble that confuses you more than you already are. i gave up on counseling over 17 years ago. and i turn a deaf ear to people that blame others.what i am trying to say is....i wonder if true dysfuntion is in the dna? you know that lack of trust of all human kind. that lack of ability to just smile and be happy. why does life seem like an uphill battle for some and just why am i the way i am? i like fences you know extreme boundaries with everyone. sometimes i just want to shut the world out and turn off the phone, but does it really make one happy? no! little things are huge to me. i just plain dont like it.i could go into my childhood and i can look at some extreme things that happened, but does it really matter? it would'nt change anything. i am who i am. but i would like a new improved model. i want an upgrade!
