the lk


from the time i was 9 years old all i ever dreamed about was opening a retail clothing store. after graduating from syracuse university cum laude in fashion design, i was fortunate to live that dream and open my first store at 25 years of age. it is so rewarding to curate stores that offer great style and a unique, pleasant shopping experience for the customer. having a store is fun but it is also a business that needs to be run properly from all aspects. now as a retail consultant with 25 years under my belt i am blessed to help others bring their visions to life.
