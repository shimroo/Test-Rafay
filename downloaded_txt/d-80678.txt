we were looking for a realtor and were introduced to colleen whitlock through a family connection. we immediately liked how she was realistic but also had a "can do" attitude. there were many ups and downs, in the end colleen got us exactly what we needed in a very short time frame. she understood the delaware county market perfectly.

							 i loved working with everyhome because of their honesty and expertise so much so i decided to join them in making people’s real estate dreams come true! in 2016 i got licensed as a realtor and went to work for them.  life is great and i am bringing more happy homeowner stories to life!

						after getting married in july 2021, alex and lauren began their home buying journey with everyhome agents greg and suzanne elwell.  after living in philadelphia for the last 5 years, their wish list included a suburban home in a top-rated school district with more space, a swimming pool, and a nicely-sized yard for their puppy, rocky.

						“i put an offer in that evening, and by the next morning i had word that the house was mine. my first evening in the house i was honestly worried how it would go, if i would feel regret or anxiety, but it just felt right. i went to sleep calm and happy, feeling like i was home. ”

						“we’d been steadily putting aside money for years and when a year end bonus hit in 2018, we knew the timing was right. we’d known brenda from church and her knowledge of the market and passion for finding the right house was extremely helpful. number one on the list was space - space to run outside, space to play, space for storage, space to build our family. this house provided all of them.”

						“finding kristen with everyhome was a happy accident. we used everyhome as our search engine to find homes we wanted to see in the area. when we found our now home we just filled out the online form to see the home and it happened to be directed to kristen. when meeting with kristen to see the home she was very kind and prepared. she had all the paperwork on the home as well as other possible homes for us to look at.”

							“i was very happy with everyhome realtors when i used them to sell and buy a home during a difficult season in my life. i had used other realtors before, but i am happy with the services and professionalism that they bring to the home buying experience. i also admire the personal touch and compassion they value while working with clients.”
