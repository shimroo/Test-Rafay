about the writer




emjae johnson


emjae has been a health researcher for over 25 years. although she was educated in healthy diet and lifestyle, in  1996, she was challenged to overcome her own state of illness that seemed to have came upon her almost overnight.
within a 10 year period she went from constant 24 hour pain -- from her jaws all the way down to her toes -- to being better than about 95% pain free. she feels that she has uncovered information that will be of tremendous benefit to thousands. it is this writer's desire that you will read with care what she has placed in this blog. she wishes that each and every reader will benefit from what she has already been through...which is the worst of all illness. if you or someone you know is struggling with chronic illness and dis-ease, it is her sincere hope that you not suffer one more day and the answers, she believes, can be found within the articles she has written and researched here. you are invited to ask questions through the "comments" link at the end of each article --- emjae does her best to respond to each within  24-48 hours.

cancer is a fungus according to the prominent italian oncologist, dr. tullio simoncini. take a few moments to watch part one of this video, cancer is fungus. dr. simoncini talks about cancer being a fungus and also explains how he is successfully treating cancer by raising the ph of the body. further investigation of dr. tullio simoncicni's method of treatment is successful with many cancers but he is still researching. click on link below to watch cancer is fungus cancer is fungus video - part 1 of 2dr simoncini takes us inside the body to examine different types of cancers and how they appear before treatment and after treatment of raising body ph to create an alkaline environment where cancer does not thrive.  he comments on the color of the actual cancer tumors and how that compares to the appearance of fungus.cancer is fungus video - part 2 of 2in part 2 of cancer is a fungus, dr. simoncini further explains his theory and reveals more of his research. this respected oncologist shares his heart with regard to many suffering children that he has watched die of cancer, needlessly. his heart was broken for these children and explains how god enabled him to perceive that cancer was fungus and could easily be treated through raising the ph of the body and he explains partially of what he does. his method, although to date has been very successful, is still being researched for all different types of cancers.related articles:the basics of cancer - advanced scientific health ( ash) read true success stories of those who have experienced advanced scientific health (ash)two great acid/ alkaline food charts - free!leading scientists state: low ph associated with over 250 diseaseshealing news: scientific research ignored by the medical industry still remains undisputedalkaline foods - raise your ph with brothwater raises ph: which type of water is best?nexus magazine review - is the cause of cancer a common fungus?disclaimer - the information on this weblog is provided for educational and informational purposes only. i am not a doctor and i am not attempting to prescribe, treat, or recommend and in no way is the information contained on this site intended to be a substitute for a health care provider's consultation. the contents is based upon opinions of each respective author. the reader is encouraged to make their own health care decisions that can be based upon research and then partnering with their own health care professional. if you are ill please consult a qualified physician or appropriate health care provider.                 ---end of article---by emjae johnson -cancer is fungus -  dr. tullio simoncini exposes his research about cancer being a fungus?

bill moyers interviews melody petersen - author of "our daily meds" about the marketing tactics of big pharma to the american people

i have very strong opinions here about pharmaceutical drugs and their potential dangers to the public, even under a doctor's care. they are chemicals and there is so little data on how these chemicals re-act with one another. every year over 100,000 people in america die from taking prescription medication that was prescribed to them by their doctor and was taken exactly as recommended. this should make a lot of the public question what they are taking into their body and the rest of you should be angry about why very little is being done about it. big pharma is more interested in the safety of herbs, which by comparison, has been the cause of a less than one percent of these same statistics. they want you to believe, through their most clever marketing efforts, that these drugs are based on scientific studies and are safe. it is good to know that amercians are waking up the truth and are now learning that the pharmaceutical industry is all about money first... saving lives is secondary at the very least.bill moyers recently interviewed author melody petersen about the drug industry. she is a jounalist and has been researching and writing about the marketing tactics (and more) of big pharma for about 8 years now. the transcript of this interview will open your eyes to what you are really seeing on t.v. when you watch a drug advertisement. america is the only company in the world that allows drugs to be marketed to the end user...the person who cannot even buy them directly--- so why is that? you'll find out why after reading the interview.read melody petersen's "our daily meds: how the pharmaceutical companies transformed themselves into slick marketing machines and hooked the nation on prescription drugs" --- available through amazon.comdisclaimer - the information on this weblog is provided for educational and informational purposes only. i am not a doctor and i am not attempting to prescribe, treat, or recommend and in no way is the information contained on this site intended to be a substitute for a health care provider's consultation. the contents is based upon opinions of each respective author. the reader is encouraged to make their own health care decisions that can be based upon research and then partnering with their own health care professional. if you are ill please consult a qualified physician or appropriate health care provider.                 ---end of article---by emjae johnson - bill moyers interviews melody petersen - author of "our daily meds" and the marketing tactics of big pharma to the american people









 




 














arthritis pain relief after release of cellular memories

i read a story this morning that brought tears to my eyes.  i could have written this story (because it is so similar to my own) and i thank jody ziegler nyquist, d.n.h. for taking the time to lovingly share what happened on her journey through her illness of osteoarthritis. any type of pain can be debilitating,  but the pain that keeps you from walking is one i am intimate with.i would have to say that there is a wider variety of successful alternative methods of healing for cancer, diabetes and heart disease than there is for arthritis. jody tells in her story something similar to this. she was lucky enough to discover that much of the pain that she was experiencing was coming from cellular memories from her past which was a wrong belief about herself. once she was able to recognize this, she was able to release it and her pain subsided.bruce lipton, phd. and author of the biology of belief: unleashing the power of consciousness, matter and miracles, has carefully researched and then detailed how our cells react to wrong belief. he shows through his research that genes and dna do not control our biology; that instead dna is controlled by signals from outside the cell, including the energetic messages emanating from our positive and negative thoughts. dr. lipton's profoundly hopeful synthesis of the latest and best research in cell biology and quantum physics is being hailed as a major breakthrough showing that our bodies can be changed as we retrain our thinking.read jody's compelling story "from braces to races"and realize that it may not just be the toxins from your foods or physical environment that are making you sick but that it could very well be the toxins that you are creating within yourself that is causing your illness.read "the biology of belief: unleashing the power of consciousness, matter and miracles" by bruce lipton, and your eyes will open wide to a truth that will very well change the way you think about yourself and medicine forever.disclaimer - the information on this weblog is provided for educational and informational purposes only. i am not a doctor and i am not attempting to prescribe, treat, or recommend and in no way is the information contained on this site intended to be a substitute for a health care provider's consultation. the contents is based upon opinions of each respective author. the reader is encouraged to make their own health care decisions that can be based upon research and then partnering with their own health care professional. if you are ill please consult a qualified physician or appropriate health care provider.                 ---end of article---by emjae johnson - arthritis pain relief after release of cellular memories

recently abc news covered a story on people who lowered their blood pressure with a simple chiropractic adjustment that was done on the "atlas vertebra" that is located at the base of the skull. not all chiropractors are skilled in making this adjustment and is better explained by visiting: nucca chiropractic: can a structural problem "mimic" dis-ease? .please listen to this video of a recent news telecast covered by sylvia perez about nucca and how medical doctors are now taking a closer look at nucca or upper cervical adjustments to lower blood pressure.http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/health&id=6033564preliminary tests show that it may be able to lower blood pressure as well as two combined blood pressure lowering medicines taken at the same time.if you are looking for a qualified nucca or upper cervical doctor in your area, please refer to the links at the bottom of the article at the page entitled: nucca chiropractic: can a structural problem "mimic" dis-ease?disclaimer - the information on this weblog is provided for educational and informational purposes only. i am not a doctor and i am not attempting to prescribe, treat, or recommend and in no way is the information contained on this site intended to be a substitute for a health care provider's consultation. the contents is based upon opinions of each respective author. the reader is encouraged to make their own health care decisions that can be based upon research and then partnering with their own health care professional. if you are ill please consult a qualified physician or appropriate health care provider.                 ---end of article---by emjae johnson - chiropractic adjustment to lower blood pressure in the news - nucca.org and uppercervical.org

it is impossible to naturally cleanse clogged arteries – true or false?answer: falsethere is absolutley a very simple and safe way to cleanse plaque from your arteries - without the risk of surgery --- for only pennies a day.are you wondering why you have not been told about this? the reason is because this research has been virtually hidden since at least the 1970's. initially, it was at that time exposed into the main stream media but very quickly the story was snuffed out by certain powers that bewho did their best attempt to damage the credibility of the most renown and honored nobel prize winning scientist who made the discovery.there are currently less than a few thousand people who have been privileged to have this hidden scientific research revealed to them in a simple and easy to understand format. so, why so few? because it is by invitation only and i am now inviting you to learn this eye opening information that just may prove to save a life - possibly you.  click here to find out more information about the basics of heart problems from ask insider doctors & scientists.free! hidden health secrets!disclaimer - the information on this weblog is provided for educational and informational purposes only. i am not a doctor and i am not attempting to prescribe, treat, or recommend and in no way is the information contained on this site intended to be a substitute for a health care provider's consultation. the contents is based upon opinions of each respective author. the reader is encouraged to make their own health care decisions that can be based upon research and then partnering with their own health care professional. if you are ill please consult a qualified physician or appropriate health care provider.                 ---end of article---by emjae johnson -it is impossible to cleanse clogged arteries –true or false?
