the kitchen: temporarily closed for renovations! 



as those of you who follow me on twitter already know, the kitchen is finally making the jump from this cot-awful blogger platform to wordpress and our own custom domain! it's been a good seven-plus years but probably at least two or three years too many on this archaic platform. seeing what you can do on wordpress, i realize how much of a bloody idiot i've been for sticking with blogger all this time, and not even the new version of blogger either - i had made too many tweaks and customizations on this creaky old site to want to start from scratch when blogger upgraded their platform so never made the switch. 2005 style, baby!

still seven years and almost 2½ million unique hits later, we've managed to catch some plaudits and props along the way even though we were looking amateur hour status as far  as the site's opitcs. mercifully, thanks to the homie, rafi kam at oh word and his generous offer, finally making hte jump to wordpress was not only easy & relatively painless but also cheap! the new site has been in development for the past few weeks and is pretty close to being ready to launch. there's still some tweaking of the format and porting of assets from this version of the kitchen to the new one to do but different kitchen 2.0 will be officially ready to launch with a fresh but still familiar feel within the next two weeks, possibly sooner, by my estimation.

i could keep posting here in the meantime 'cos, believe me, i got more than enough stuff to post, but frankly i'm kind of tired and i have a million other projects & opportunities i need to be working on anyway on so i'm gonna wrap up things here for now and concentrate on getting the new site ready to rock. to make up for the lack of posting i'll probably be more active on twitter though. 

so, to those of you who come here regularly looking for that ole' different or next sh-t, first off: thanks for the years of support but also walk with me and/or keep checking back here for an announcement of when different kitchen 2.0 will be ready to go. in the meantime, enjoy your weekend and see you on the other side.labels: admin

new mixtape: mickey factz - i'm better than you 



sounds pretty good but i woulda sequenced it slightly different. it starts off a bit flat but picks up pretty quickly a few tracks in or maybe you disagree:


   

just 'cos i know some of you more time-challenged (or lazy) readers don't check everything posted so this is the track that most bloggers are throwing up separately:


mickey factz - "paradise (remix)" feat. fat joe & bun b:
   

i like "we young" too - that could have been on the real album (maybe it is?) imho.....
