..... "incredible, amazing, breathtaking. the words simply fail to describe the job you and your staff did at our reception at the canfield casino.. receiving compliments from many of our guests regarding the food and service. a tough task, given the fact that most of our family and guest work in the restaurant business and are extremely critical....  rainer you truly added the magic to our special day" .....
