these documents and tools were created by me while i worked at verio as well as all the time since then.  as such, there are still some references to "customers" and maybe even some procedures we used while i worked there.  since the content is just fine, just a bit weird to read, i haven't updated these and am focusing more on adding new content rather than fixing these "bugs".
if you are interested in seeing more content added to the site, and particularly if you have any topics you would like to see covered, then please let me know.  i am interested in adding content/tools that will be read and used.  so, anytime i run across stuff that i think is useful, i add it.
