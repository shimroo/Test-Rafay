interior designfor all of his varied expertise, verdi is completely self-taught when it comes to interior design—an education that began on the floor of abc carpet and home in nyc. since then, robert has designed spaces big and small, for clients such as sandra bernhard, bobby flay, and cynthia rowley. the real secret to design success is "...not really about the period," robert says, “it ends up being about proportion. it’s about how usable the space is. that’s what people forget—that it’s really about function in the end, and that proportion is kind of the hallmark of good design."



entertainingrobert’s impeccable taste transcends not only fashion, but entertaining as well. as a highly-regarded entertaining and design authority, robert has shared his ideas on the today show and the view, and contributes event tips to people magazine and design insights to elle decor. unique invitations, unexpected place settings, whimsical decor and exceptional guest takeaways are a few of the things robert sees different than anyone else. robert hosts exclusive events throughout the year for world-renowned brands, top editors and celebrities. and robert’s parties during fashion week are a celebrated, can’t-miss ticket.
