reach tomorrow's leaders






























                        what will become of this generation?
                    

the students of gen z are coming of age during tumultuous times, yet everyday they are making decisions that will shape their lives. how will they be ready to be the leaders of tomorrow? college doesn’t have to be a time where students lose faith in jesus christ. it can be a time of incredible growth. at the cco, we’ve been inviting and equipping the church to reach college students since 1971. we’ve witnessed decades of lifelong transformation as people like you have invested in each new generation—as people like you have invested in hope.
today’s college students are tomorrow’s leaders. and you can reach them today. 




























                        today's college students are tomorrow's leaders
                    

the students on campus right now are at risk of falling away from jesus.please give to this movement and raise up the next generation of godly leaders!

                        we feel it, too
                    

we are with you. we feel the weight of more and more of the next generation becoming less and less affiliated with christianity. we see the latest statistics on mental health among young people. we know that today’s college students are tomorrow’s leaders— and yet we wonder what kind of leaders the next generation will be. this is why the cco partners with the church to reach the whole college campus—students, faculty, and staff—with the gospel.we disciple women and men with the vision that they will join god in his work to restore all things, sending them into society to renew all of life and culture. when lives are transformed by jesus christ—especially the lives of young people—the world is changed.
