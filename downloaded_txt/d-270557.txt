									gemini manor							











































for 48 years, i lived in a private hollywood house that i called my gemini manor art home. during those years, i rebuilt the house and added many decorative and custom features. thousands of people from all over the world came to the countless productions that i presented there. shows, celebrations, theme parties, concerts, weddings and many other events that inspired people. the home is gone but we want to have this website become a new place for people to gather, learn, appreciate, have fun and be inspired again.
we’ll be doing live interviews, showcase unusual videos and live stream many talented performers, artists, speakers and others that are part of our entertainment group.
we will create it. soon. your host, alexander lehr
