 the tar heel toast





here's to the land of the long leaf pine,
the summer land where the sun doth shine,
where the weak grow strong, and the strong grow great,
here's to "down home," the old north state!

here's to the land of the cotton bloom white,
where the scuppernong perfumes the breeze at night,
where the soft southern moss, and jessamine mate,
"neath the murmuring pines of the old north state!

here's to the land where the galax grows,
where the rhododendron's rosette glows,
where soars mount mitchell's summit great,
in the "land of the ske," in the old north state!

here's to the land where maidens are fair,
where friends are true, and cold hearts rare,
the near land, the dear land, whatever fate,
the blest land, the best land, the old north state!

the above was officially adopted as the state toast
of nc by: the general assembly of 1957 
(session laws, 1957,c.777)
