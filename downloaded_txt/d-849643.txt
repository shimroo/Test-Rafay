who we are the alabama animal adoption society is a nonprofit organization supported entirely by private donations and volunteer effort serving the greater birmingham, alabama area. along with our volunteers and caring, adoptive families, we're giving animals a chance to live.
since 1977, our mission has been to help strays and unwanted family pets find loving and responsible homes and to educate the public regarding the problem of pet overpopulation and the importance of spaying and neutering their pets.
