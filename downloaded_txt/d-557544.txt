sturgeon bay, wisconsin
known for its cherry and apple orchards, maritime history, and abundant opportunities for outdoor recreation, sturgeon bay is home to a busy and growing stantec office. the area attracts visitors year-round for fishing and hunting, aquatic sports including snorkeling for shipwrecks, and sightseeing at peninsula, potawatomi, and whitefish dunes state parks.
many of our team members in sturgeon bay have decades of experience working on engineering and environmental projects in the region. the many resorts and camps and other recreational facilities in the area provide a base of clients that our team has come to know well, delivering civil engineering, survey, stormwater, shoreline stabilization, and on-site wastewater solutions for clients.
we’re proud of our project history in sturgeon bay and we are committed to maintaining and improving the places where people live, work, and play in the wisconsin peninsular region.
