      porsche purists revel in performance, precision and panache, members of an exclusive society that's always pushing the envelope, eschewing compromise and insisting 
      that nothing less than the best will do.
      
      welcome to victor equipment, purveyors of custom light alloy wheels exclusively for porsche sports cars, luxury sedans and suvs. we, too, are porsche purists, and share 
      those same values. for us the porsche experience is almost a religion. and our pursuit is single minded: to produce perfect aftermarket porsche wheels that exceed 
      original equipment wheels in performance, appearance and exclusivity. to that end, we obsess over every specification, every technical detail, the purity of the alloys 
      we use, the innovation of our manufacturing methods, the perfection of our finishes, the coherence of our fit.
      
      there is nothing quite like a porsche. and there's nothing even close to a porsche upgraded with a set of victor equipment wheels.
