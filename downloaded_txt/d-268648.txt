the villa

montorio is a historic house, a former monastery dating back to the 14th century which was purchased by my family in 1996 and restored with passion and love. our intention is to share a place so unique and special for those who love traveling and are looking for a place to find authenticity, warmth, tranquility, simplicity and elegance.
