about us


the boran breed is the hardiest cattle breed to be found in continental africa. kenyan ranches have been developing superlative stud and commercial lines since 1953 in the very toughest conditions to ensure genuine durability and resilience.
ranches and farmers can join to become a boran cattle breeder’s society (bcbs) individual or corporate member.
