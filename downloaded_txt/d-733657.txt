how does laser hair removal work?
laser hair removal is a relatively new  procedural advance for removing unwanted hair from the body. laser hair removal patients include men and women alike moreover it can treat most parts of the  body where there is undesirable hair. laser hair removal is a harmless  procedure with little to none side effects. the laser light has been highly  developed in order to provide the successful removal of hair and in the course  of study it has been concluded that the direct result proves the laser light, once  it absorbs melanin or pigment in the hair follicle it actually diminishes hair  growth over a period of treatments. 











to understand exactly how laser hair removal works we must first understand how hair grows. there are three phases of hair growth: anagen, catagen and telogen.   in the anagen phase hair is “actively” growing and melanin levels are extremely  high which makes it the perfect time to increase the achievement with  optimistically lasering the hair follicle. in this “active” phase the goal is  to kill the follicle’s ability to begin “re- growth” as well as to remain  “active” by allowing the laser to destroy the pigment (hair color). in the  catagen phase, hair is notably in its “growth cycle” and it does not shed at  this point until we come to the telagen phase where the hair that lied dormant  begins to fall out making way for the process of anagen to take place again. in  the last two phases, you will learn become an unproductive occasion for the  laser treatment to in effect work, thus you will need to allow for some down time  in between actual treatments. remarkably, based on the examination of this  process it is safe to say, patients who follow the regimen recommended by their  laser hair removal specialist are experiencing very minimal to no re-growth. laser hair  removal is an innovative resolution to looking and feeling confident about your  body.
