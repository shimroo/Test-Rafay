release date: feb 14, 2025 



featured album
end of the middle
richard dawson
only dawson can make collapse sound so hauntingly beautiful i don't think i need to explain to y'all how shit is hitting the fan really hard right now, but what i can do is telling you to listen to one of the most relevant songwriters of our times: richard dawson. the end of the middle continues his streak of deeply conceptual folk albums, navigating the liminality of collapse - whether this collapse is societal, personal, or even musical. dawson...

                        horror 
                        
release date: feb 14, 2025

                        oh! the ocean 
                        
release date: feb 14, 2025 



featured album
oh! the ocean
the wombats
the liverpool trio prove there's (some) life after indie obscurity scroll through the wombats' spotify page, and you'll be recommended a range of their mid-2000s contemporaries that were cruelly dubbed 'landfill indie': the pigeon detectives, the kooks, scouting for girls, &c. as is the way of cultural trends, this particular wave sits at an awkward moment in which they're too recent to feel retro, yet too dated to seem relevant. give it another...
