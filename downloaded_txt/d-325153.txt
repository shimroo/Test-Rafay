yfu advances intercultural understanding, life-long learning, global competencies, mutual respect, and social responsibility through transformational educational exchanges for generations of youth, families, and communities, supported by dedicated volunteers and professional staff.
the global yfu network, consisting of member organizations in more than 45 different countries, is united by the belief that full cultural immersion is the most effective means to gain the skills needed to thrive in an increasingly multicultural, interconnected and competitive global society. youth for understanding - yfu has remained a trusted leader of intercultural student exchange programs for more than 70 years because of its commitment to safety, reputation for quality, and exceptional support services.
