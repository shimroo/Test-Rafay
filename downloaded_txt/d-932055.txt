astrology tips
when it comes to astrology, we've been there, done that, now serving 300 tips in 20 categories ranging from 12 zodiac signs to your child and astrology.











											at the moment i can't even locate moon in taurus. it's doesn't yield any search answers.
									 	

about the moon in taurus
having the moon in the zodiacal realm of taurus when you are born tends to give you a very stable and methodical approach to your emotions. the moon represents the realm of emotions and feelings as well as defining the cyclic nature of your life. do not confuse "emotions" with "romance", though - love lives are the domain of venus. 
with your birth moon in taurus, your emotions will tend towards stable, familiar, and uncomplicated ground. it will be difficult to make choices that change your current emotional standing (such as attachment to a job or relationship), although dire circumstance or overwhelming evidence can be presented to help you through those choices. likewise, when change comes upon you even with reasonable warning, you can experience a sense of loss and despondency when your emotional world changes. 
at the same time, taurus will create an expectation for a sense of "magic" and connection in your emotional interactions. an example of this would be finding yourself drawn to someone simply because they (in your mind's eye) "sparkle", or having a difficult time finding interest in someone that would logically be a good match but doesn't have that j'ne sais quois. 
when it comes to having your moon in taurus, you know what you know about your emotions, and this can make adjusting your feelings for someone else a little difficult. surprises are not your favorite thing - unless you know they're coming. flexibility can seem scary, but allowing yourself gentle progress and persistence will make having relationships (romantic and otherwise) easier as time goes on. 
there is another connotation to the statement "moon in taurus", and that is the monthly progression of the moon through the house of taurus. it lends a general feeling of stable footing in the realm of feelings, but it can also extend unnecessary squabbles by promoting stubbornness. it often provides a nice little break between the fiery impulsiveness of the aries moon and the airy changeability of the gemini moon. there are many good programs and sites available to track the current condition of the moon's phase and zodiacal position.

											can you determine the likelyhood of marriage in one`s chart?
									 	

can you determine the likelihood of marriage in one's chart?
in predictive astrology, one can determine if a cycle in your chart is good for relationships and marriage, as well as when it is to occur. depending on the planets occupying the house of marriage, it can also indicate how successful these relationships may be. more information can also be obtained by having a potential mate's chart done, as it can also impact on yours.

											i`m a scorpio and i`m trying to find out what scorpio is.
									 	

scorpio - the sign of the scorpion
scorpios, born october 23-november 21, are very serious learners. they tend to be very black and white people, concerned with beginnings and endings, and unafraid of both. they are very curious, making them adept investigators. 
represented by the scorpion, scorpios have the same kinds of regenerative powers their symbol does; they can bounce back and reinvent themselves very well, much like a scorpion can regrow its own tail. they are passionate and focused, making them good executives. they work hard so they can eventually be satisfied with the fruits of their labor. 
scorpios can be very secretive, and very complex, making them not overly forthcoming with answers about themselves. they are very resourceful as well.

											what does my sign mean? i`m a pisces and whenever i try to find out what my sign means it jsut comes up with my daily horoscope.
									 	

pisces - the sign of the fish
pisces, born feb 20-mar 20, is symbolized by two fish. it is considered a water sign, and ruled by the planet neptune. 
pisces people are usually very emotional, sensitive, good listeners, compassionate, and social. sometimes they find it hard to make descisions, because they are excellent at seeing all sides to a question or problem. for the same reason, they can be riddled with worry. pisces usually see only the good in other people, and are artistic, charitable, and merciful. 
because pisces are good at looking at all parts of an issue, they can be procrastinators and often feel pulled in two directions. they can also be somewhat lazy and self-absorbed. because they are so giving, they can be taken advantage of.

synastry overview
the art of astrological synastry, the comparisons of two or more charts, is something that astrologers are often asked to do. most people are curious about their compatibility quotient with someone who might play a significant role in their life. it begins by studying the traits most likely to manifest according to the planets in signs in a chart. the astrologer looks for compatibility with respect to attitudes towards areas of life such as love, spending money, raising children, in-laws, etc.a synastry or relationship reading can reveal potential problems and thus give advice about how to handle differences. it can also point out the balance of positive and negative factors between two charts.any two charts may be compared. lovers, parent and child, family members, and coworkers to name a few.

											what is the difference between astrology and horoscopes?
									 	

astrology vs. horoscopes
both of these terms are used to describe the study of the effects of the planets and other cosmic bodies on the lives of people.the term horoscope means chart (scope) of the hour (horo). the term horoscope is generally widely associated with the daily, weekly or monthly sun sign horoscopes found in newspapers and on the internet. in fact, it is a perfectly legitimate astrological term which describes a map of the solar system at the exact time and place of birth; usually shown as a 360 degree wheel divided into 12 houses with the planets placed therein.astrology means star (astro) study (logy).it is the science of the interrelationships between the parts of the cosmos as a whole. it is also the art of interpreting the effects of these relationships on people.
