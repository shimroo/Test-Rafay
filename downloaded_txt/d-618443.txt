							i have had the pleasure of using natural difference since 1998. i first started using it when i worked at an ent medical office. 
when i became a certified aesthetician i continued to use their wonderful products. i’m proud to say that i now i’m able to carry a full line of they’re incredible products. 
i have been able to use their products on clients that could never use anything else because they were too sensitive or sensitized. 
and has been unbelievably wonderful and i love all of their products and look forward to many many years of being able to offer my clients a line of skincare made here in america that is so incredible. thank you so much for coming up with this beautiful line of wonderful skin care.
