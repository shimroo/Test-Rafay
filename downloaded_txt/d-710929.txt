** important notice for licensees  regarding ce credit **

those licensees who were awarded online ce credit from january 1, 2022,  through march 31, 2022, were allowed under a previous waiver to accrue up  to 10 hours of online credit.  as with the current waiver, those licensees  with 10 hours of online credit awarded during this time period may apply five  [5] hours to the 2023 renewal cycle and roll over the remaining 5 hours to the  2024 renewal cycle.

beginning january 1, 2023, and continuing through march 31, 2023,  licensees may accrue up to 10 hours of online ce credit.  the board may  consider whether or not to continue the waiver for online credit hours after  march 31, 2023, by approving a new waiver.
