a message from christine horner, md 







 







owner, board-certified physician, preventative health expert, certified clinical thermographer, thermographic interpreter 



welcome and thanks so much for coming here to find out more about how i and my staff can help you achieve extraordinary health with the help of thermography! i’m dr. christine horner, a former surgeon, now an expert in natural and preventative health and the owner of dr. christine horner’s medical thermography group of southern californiajust a few years after starting my surgical practice, i became alarmed as the breast cancer patients walking through my door became younger and younger. finally, i started seeing women in their 20’s with this disease and that changed the course of my life forever. i knew there had to be ways that women could prevent getting breast cancer, and i wanted to find out how. so, i went through the medical literature—over 20 years ago now— and found thousands of studies that showed exactly why we have a breast cancer epidemic, and prostate and colon cancer epidemics and ill health in general. the major cause is simply poor choices in diet and lifestyle. that’s the good news, because the state of your health is mostly under your own control! 















shortly thereafter, i was introduced the ancient holistic system of medicine called ayurveda. ayurveda literally means the “knowledge or science of life.” this 5,000-year-old system of medicine has a very sophisticated understanding about how to create and maintain good health—sadly, something i never learned in medical school or my surgical training. after becoming certified in ayurveda, i wanted people to know about its simple techniques, which have such profound health benefits. so, i pitched the television stations in cincinnati, ohio where i was in practice, to have me be their on-air doctor hosting a segment about complementary and alternative medicine. they said yes! from 1999 to 2002, i created and hosted segments in the newscasts for the local abc and the nbc tv affiliate stations. it was the first-ever syndicated television segment in a newscast in the country focused on complementary and alternative medicine.to pull off continuing my surgical practice and creating the television news segments, i worked 14 hours a day, 7 days a week. as you can imagine after 3 years of this schedule, i woke up one morning and realized that i couldn’t do this anymore. i loved teaching people about how to become and stay health naturally—and avoid the knife. so, i jumped off the cliff and left my lucrative practice to dedicate myself full time to my passion.for the past 20 years, i’ve been spreading the word through television, radio, and magazines and have written two award-winning books, waking the warrior goddess: dr. christine horner’s program to protect against and fight breast cancer (now in its third edition) and radiant health, ageless beauty: dr. christine horner’s 30-day program to extraordinary health beauty and longevity.in 2003, i was first introduced to the amazing technology of thermography. i was super excited to discover that it could pick up physiological changes, which can be strong predictors of an increased future risk of breast cancer. however, with simple diet and lifestyle improvements, which i discuss in my book waking the warrior goddess, these physiological changes easily and rapidly reverse! therefore, thermography is a valuable tool to help to not only monitor your breast health, but also your overall health. it will let you know when your body is showing signs of inflammation and stress and it is time to make your health a priority—before a significant disease has had the time to develop. when you clean up your diet and lifestyle, thermography will reveal your physiological improvements. most people report that when they can “see” the thermal images showing that all their hard work is paying off, it serves as a powerful motivator to keep them on their program for good health.because i found this technology so valuable, i decided to become a physician interpreter of thermography in 2016. i researched all the thermal imaging companies, and found that med-hot with its total vision software, was clearly the best—by far. since then, i have been working for physicians insight—the interpretation arm of the company.fast forward to today, life has continued with its twists and turns. covid stopped all in-studio tv interviews, as well as the media contracts. there was no doubt that my career path was ready for another major turn. because of my passion for thermography and preventative health, i knew in my heart and soul that it was time to start my own thermal imaging business. i’m thrilled to offer you my thermal imaging services! with my background and experiences as a physician, former breast surgeon, natural health expert, and interpreter of thermographic images, i am uniquely qualified to provide the best quality and most comprehensive thermographic services possible. not only can i or one of my thermographers take your images, but because i am the interpreter of your images, you will be able to get your reports within days, have the best consistency of the reporting on your follow up studies, and if you would like, i also offer telephone consultations for a more detailed explanation of your results, along with health coaching to help you achieve your best health.i so look forward to meeting you soon and helping you to experience improved health, energy, vitality, and joy.
