welcome to the national wind institute
three pillars of nwi
the national wind institute (nwi) has evolved from its traditional singular focus
                        on wind hazards to three main research pillars of energy systems, atmospheric measurement
                        & simulation, and wind engineering. though all three of these pillars focus on distinct
                        issues, they also maintain common ground via cross cutting themes. all research seeks
                        to benefit communities at micro and macro scales.
