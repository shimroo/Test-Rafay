an introduction
by 
          passenger 58 

welcome.
after 
            several years now, our site remains the unique stop for martial arts 
            film buffs who take things a tad more seriously.
our 
            mission remains the same: review hong kong/taiwan/mainland china-produced 
            kung fu and action films from all eras, and attempt to analyze them 
            for the quality and quantity of martial arts content.
where 
            possible, i identify the styles used, and try to distinguish between 
            flashy fight stuntwork, and "the real stuff". this is extremely 
            tough. in all but the rarest cases, movie fighting is a mishmash of 
            choreography designed strictly to entertain. remember, we are not 
            watching instructional videos here.
many 
            of you might be wondering, who is this opinionated guy, and what are 
            his qualifications? i grew up watching and studying kung fu films, 
            and have seen literally hundreds of them. i performed in a little 
            one when i was much, much younger (so, regardless of any of my criticisms 
            here, i have immense respect for anyone who's performed in front of 
            or behind camera). the movies, and my training in martial arts, have 
            been lifelong passions for over 25 years.
have 
            insights or different opinions? see errors? feel free to drop us a 
            line, we welcome your feedback. 
note: 
            this site has not been updated on regular basis, and will not be. 
            some of the opinions no longer reflect the views of the editor (although 
            the majority still do).
this 
            web site is dedicated to my father, who introduced me to martial arts 
            films as a child, and shared all my subsequent martial arts cinema 
            adventures with me.

0- 
                  no martial arts in the film
                  1- obviously poor martial arts; at times unintentionally funny.
                  2- sloppy or below-average martial arts
                  3- average skill; watchable
                  4- above-average martial arts; solid performance
                  5- high martial arts skill; worth watching in slo-mo
