what is the difference between allergies and hayfever?


an allergy is where a person reacts to substances (allergens)in the environment that are harmless to most other people. the term ‘allergies’ covers a broad range of reactions to various allergens such as dust mites, pets, pollen, insects as well as some foods and medications.
hayfever (seasonal allergic rhinitis) is the common name for a form of allergic rhinitis and is a specific type of allergic reaction caused by pollen and other seasonal allergens.





can you use nasal spray with cold and flu tablets?


there are lots of different cold and flu medicines readily available from your local pharmacy or supermarket.1a these medicines are designed to help relieve your cold and flu symptoms and can contain more than one active ingredient, such as a decongestant for a blocked nose and a pain reliever.
there are also different kinds of nasal sprays, so it’s important to know which one you’re using. for example, there are non-medicated saline nasal sprays and medicated sprays (such as those containing a decongestant, steroid or antihistamine).
always check with your pharmacist or doctor before taking any medication as some products may not be suitable to be taken together.
always read the label and follow directions for use





how long is a cold contagious?


when you have a cold, you will generally be contagious for up to 2 weeks. this includes a few days before any of the symptoms appear, right up until they all go.
you’re most likely to spread a cold during the first 2 to 3 days when your symptoms are at their worst.
