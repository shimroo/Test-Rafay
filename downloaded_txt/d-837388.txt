01


devout: the sewanee rule of life


christian ministry requires leaders who are sensitive to the presence of god in their own lives, and in the lives of those with whom they are called to serve. it is a high priority for us to encourage one another’s capacity to pray, to pray more deeply, and to develop the discipline to pray more faithfully. through daily worship, prayer, study, spiritual direction, and quiet days, the school of theology develops in its students such a pattern of life and a deep awareness of the presence of god. whatever the context of one’s ministry, a reliable, disciplined prayer life is critical to survival and is the foundation of thriving in ministry. seminary is the time to get this discipline well in place.















rule of life
a rule of life is a pattern that is consciously adopted to support one’s commitment to live as god calls us. rather than a burdensome obligation, it is a means of creating balance and harmony in one’s life, establishing practices that nurture one’s life in christ. all seminarians will develop a rule of life at the beginning of each year.
groups
under the guidance of their advisor, every student meets biweekly in a group format to discuss their rule of life, what’s working (and what needs some work!). these groups provide guidance,  accountability, and stability in the spiritual life of all students—especially as they develop the habits of the heart necessary for a deeper discipleship. 
spiritual direction
if the primary purpose of seminary is reorienting one’s life around prayer, study, and service, then by definition  there is a period of being “disoriented.” every seminarian is provided, at no cost to them, a spiritual director to support personal and spiritual development. 
quiet days
twice a year the school of theology community—students, faculty, and staff—gather for a quiet day to pray and reflect on topics facilitated by an invited guest.
chapel
the book of common prayer is the center of our common life here, and the rhythm of our day is structured around the rhythm of the chapel bell. a typical week in the chapel looks a lot like this:

church music
music can shape and nurture the soul in a powerful and profound way, and the school of theology has a commitment to church music that is second to none. students will have access to a variety of courses, the chapel choir, weekly choral evensong sung by the seminary chamber ensemble, as well as various offerings from the music department at the college of arts and sciences.

learned: an episcopal university


founded, owned, and governed by twenty-seven dioceses of the episcopal church, for more than 150 years, the university of the south, familiarly known as sewanee, has had a distinct and historic legacy of being a leader in education within the church. through the college of arts & sciences and the seminary, the university is committed to preparing the people of the church for serving their communities and the world. 















the school of theology is first and foremost, a residential graduate school with a rigorous academic focus. lectures and seminars are important, but it’s the way that one engages with one’s coursework that really counts. we bring together bright minds and a wide range of views from across the episcopal church, and the anglican communion, for deep theological conversation and reflection. you will be moving through the curriculum— bible, history, theology, spirituality, ethics, liturgics, and homiletics in an environment where deep listening, vulnerable sharing, careful discourse, and personal and spiritual growth can all flourish. 










degrees & certificates






alternative clergy training at sewanee

master of divinity



the master of divinity curriculum is designed to form devout, learned, and useful leaders for the episcopal church. to this end, the curriculum includes study of scripture, the christian tradition, ministerial skills, and modern cultural contexts, with a view to the reasoned practice of the ministry of word and sacrament in both its historical context and its contemporary setting.

christian leadership is servant leadership, and it’s important to us that we foster a sense of humility and service in our students. when we explore our beliefs in the classroom and come to a place of conviction, we must then examine the consequences of those beliefs and put them into practice by taking action in the world around us. after all, one can’t learn ministry without doing ministry. here are just a few ways students can be involved in serving the church and the world while in sewanee.
















creation care committee
it’s our theological conviction that caring for creation is essential to our humanity, our covenant with god, and our mission as christians. the creation care committee seeks to magnify environmental and sustainability ministry opportunities at the school of theology by collaborating with existing institutions, including the master of arts in religion and the environment program, the center for religion & the environment, the corners & edges seminary garden as well as the environmental sustainability programs at the college of arts and sciences. the committee facilitates hands-on environmental ministry experiences and ideas with an aim to inspire future clergy and lay church leaders for the work of environmental stewardship in the parishes and communities they will serve. it also provides educational programming and encourages discussions of sustainability, environmental justice, ecotheology, and green ministry in all aspects of life at the school of theology.
diversity and reconciliation committee
the diversity and reconciliation committee leads the seminary community—including students, faculty, and staff— in discussions around a range of critical social issues, such as race and racism and discrimination based on gender, age, class, sexual orientation, ethnicity, and disability. listening sessions during the advent semester will determine the direction of the committee's work in the coming year. in the context of god’s creation and reconciliation of humankind, the committee seeks to:

develop and implement ways to foster a change of mind and heart in and beyond this community;
widen the presence and participation of underrepresented groups throughout the school of theology;
promote changes to our structures and culture so that we may be a more adequate sign and instrument of god’s reign.

mission committee
this mission committee plans, coordinates, and executes service events through which members of the seminary community can witness to, and live out, their call to proclaim the good news and to share their resources of time, money, and talent with persons in need. projects are in response to local, national, and international communities.
pastoral care committee
the pastoral care committee supports the life of the seminary through a holistic, multilevel approach addressing the spiritual, emotional, and physical needs of the community. common prayer requests of students, faculty, and staff brings awareness to the concerns of the community while offering pastoral support to those who need it. the pastoral care committee is actively engaged in both traditional and innovative methods for addressing the pastoral needs of the entire seminary community.
