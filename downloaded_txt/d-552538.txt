the labin august 2002, il laboratorio del gelato was born.  the idea was a simple one – imagining a ‘lab’ where flavor creation and recipe development take center stage; where classic flavors could be perfected, and pure ingredients honored; and where nyc area chefs would be encouraged to work with us to develop unique flavors for their menus. over the years, we have grown to become nyc’s leading restaurant wholesaler [and retailer] for hand-crafted gelato.  even with a flavor list approaching 300, we are still continually challenged by discerning chefs and a dedicated retail clientele.

 




 


“il laboratorio del gelato is the best ice cream and sorbet maker around. the variety, quality, and seasonality are superbly managed and maintained.”

—  bill yosses, former white house pastry chef
