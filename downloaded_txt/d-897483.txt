as most of you already know, the “milk parlor” suffered a devastating fire in february and a few things will take time to get back to normal. please be sure to double check the time blocks for pickup/deliveries as sometimes these may change slightly. also i will only have milk available for awhile but will add back other products if and when they become available again. thank you all for your continued patience and loyalty!
