 bill c21 - your voice is critical





		
		sep 19, 2022 - 8:07 pm - by keegant









asic, fsaq, aabc, retailers, communities, importers, and manufacturers are all getting the attention of decision-makers, but we need your help. you have to call you mp and tell them why airsoft is worth saving. you have to magnify the voices of people trying to save your sport.

airsoft lives or dies in two weeks, so we need to move fast.

asic has a guide here on how to help, don't sit, act now!

 forum updates - software updated to newest version!!





		
		dec 11, 2018 - 12:31 pm - by bloodsport





		
		hi, everyone

some of you may have noticed, but asc underwent some upgrades a few weeks ago quietly, we found a few bugs since doing so and have fixed them and so far everything else is running stable that we can see. 

we are now currently running the newest version of vbulletin 3.8.11 available, huge upgrade from the old 1.something we were on.  

hopefully this with the newest versions of anti spam also upgraded we should see a lot less issues and some new features available for usage.   

i know as an admin i am loving some of the new controls we have, including instant ip bans for spam accounts that do happen to make it past the bots.

 multiple accounts





		
		nov 29, 2018 - 6:37 pm - by bloodsport





		
		it is kind of messed up that we need to post this. 

as per our forum rules at no time is it acceptable to have multiple accounts here.  when we do find out about multiple accounts, all but the original one will be banned, if the user is a multiple account abuser multiple times, they all will be banned and quite often so will the ip address.  

at the same time if you have an account and lost your av status for being stupid, making a new account and trying to get re verified will not work.  if for some weird reason it slips through we will eventually find out and all accounts will be banned. 

so once again 1 account = okay, making multiple accounts = not okay.

 recent spam





		
		may 28, 2018 - 4:57 pm - by bloodsport





		
		hey everyone we are aware of a recent spam blast on the forms both via general posts, and as seen this past weekend via pm's.   


the owners of acs are aware of it, and are updating the spam software and implementing some new new member steps which will hopefully fix it.   it sounds like many forums got his hard this weekend from the reports they are reading from other site owners.

 clarification to buy/sell rules





		
		sep 25, 2017 - 5:21 pm - by bloodsport





		
		sad that we have had to add a line to the buy/sell rules for clarification but recently a situation came up where it was required. 

as a seller, when you advertise a gun that "is in working condition, but recently started making a noise i think its a motor" and the only other details you provide is that there is a minor section of damage to the barrel, and that is all the photos show and sell the gun cheaply because you do not have the time or skill to fix the possible issue.  do not be surprised when the person who buys it receives it, finds out it is missing a bunch of parts and has quite a few other pieces of damage not mentioned or shown in any of the photos posted, is upset and leaves you a negative feedback. 

do not leave them retaliatory feedback calling them a whiner because you sold it to them super cheap.   

not disclosing that you have pilfered quite a few parts from the gun, not mentioned a fair amount of other damages as well in your cheap gun ad is dishonest.   

due to the amount of the gun in this case being super low, we did not remove the av tags of the seller this time (he did get a 3 month ban for being a douche though).   we did remove the retaliatory feedback he left and if he does so again it will end up in a perma ban.   

so the new rule is about disclosure, providing the proper information regarding what you are selling to others.  if you state it is in working condition with a suspected motor issue, do not sell it if you fail to mention you removed parts from the gearbox to fix one of your other guns first.  if you say the body is in good shape other then 1 small spot (and your photos only show this), and it is received with cracks and other damages you did not disclose this violates said rules.   

honesty people, this sport is based upon it and honour.  show this in your sales as well, or you will lose the privilege of selling here.
