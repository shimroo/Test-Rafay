 what they are saying










“we are committed to pursuing social justice and providing a safe place to explore faith no matter your ethnicity, sexuality, gender or political leanings.”






“a warm, prayerful community who strive to be god’s love to the world.”






“home!”






“sapc is a community of thoughtful, spiritual, smart, diverse people who enjoy experiencing how the spirit works personally and in community. it is a beautiful, creative space to enjoy the experience of the divine. it is questioning, traveling, seeking together.”






“sapc is for truth seekers, who want to understand more about themselves and the world. the community is also very supportive and welcomes those from any background. the worship services including the sermons and wonderful music program are also highlights. come and try!”






“…wildly diverse yet radically inclusive, just like god’s love.”






“a wonderful, welcoming open community. the services last a little over hour, start at 10:00 a.m. and is filled with good music and a small yet amazing choir. what a sweet spot in the ever changing sf landscape.”
