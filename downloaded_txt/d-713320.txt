 the village of farmingdale
covering approximately 
		one square mile, the village of farmingdale is proud of its "village 
		green". located adjacent to historical village hall, the village green 
		provides a park like landscape where you can bring your lawn chair, 
		relax and enjoy the music by the village pops performing summer evenings 
		or bring the family to enjoy a classic movie "on the green". you can 
		enjoy old fashioned, freshly popped popcorn, ice cream and juice, 
		free... just because were glad you came!! and dont forget just five 
		minutes away is the home of the black course at bethpage state park that 
		was home to many pga championships including the us open.

centrally located along 
		the nassau/suffolk line, farmingdale village is rich in ethnic culture 
		and entertainment unveiling a tasty assortment of fine restaurants that 
		will satisfy the world traveler. 


		as the seasons change, so does farmingdale. our columbus day festivities 
		watch main street become a walkway for crafts, artists, rides and 
		amusement for the entire family ending by lighting up the evening sky 
		with its fireworks display that climax a perfect weekend.

winter brings long nights awaiting the holidays. we begin with 
		our annual holiday parade that welcomes the arrival of santa, only to be 
		followed by our tree lighting festivities.

farmingdale village is a community established in 1691. take an 
		historical village walk that preserves its rich past or drive up the 
		street and visit the historical aviation museum. farmingdale respects 
		its past. an historical village walk unveils the assortment of "arts and 
		crafts" architecture still prevalent on its main street. a community 
		that blends the feelings of its people while supporting its growth as it 
		evolves into a village to explore. explore it for its unique qualities 
		that satisfy family and indulge in the excitement of something 
		different.

looking for a place to open a business...

looking for a place to raise a family...

looking for a place to enjoy the good food, good entertainment 
		with good people...

farmingdale - weve got it!!!

		 




important notice: 

				on monday march 6th, 2023 the village will begin a 
				major project on main street in farmingdale. the project will 
				remove the utility poles and wires including psegli, verizon and 
				altice/optimum from main street and put all utilities 
				underground between prospect street and conklin street (ny 24). 
				main street will also be widened by approximately 18 inches on 
				the east side of the street in the same area. new street 
				lighting will be installed along with new sidewalks resulting in 
				a new look and continuing the improvement to our downtown. the 
				project cost is approximately $1.4 million, substantially paid 
				for by the state of new york and the federal government. traffic 
				disruptions may occur in this area, please use caution, and 
				follow instructions of construction personnel during the 
				construction period. anticipated completion of this project is 
				early summer 2023.
