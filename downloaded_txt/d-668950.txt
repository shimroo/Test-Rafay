 we believe children learn by doing

 











investigatewe inspire children to learn by creating an environment full of opportunities. children explore, investigate, create and discover. we believe that when children are treasured by the people they spend their time with and are excited by the activities available to them, they will reach for the stars.













createour goal is to bring forth the curiosity already within each child by introducing ideas and concepts that inspire. our bright, airy classrooms are packed with materials to engage. we draw from the experts in the field including montessori, reggio, waldorf, and more. we don’t adhere rigidly to any single system.













discoverat little school each child’s initiative is recognized, celebrated, and supported. children have the opportunity to try out a number of structured activities and materials that emphasize the use of all senses as they learn about the world around them.

our storylittle school was founded in 2005. after many years focused on supporting children and teens in the nonprofit field, holly gold pursued her dream of opening a school. she believes that children thrive when they are surrounded by adults who care for them and who are able to take the time to know them as individuals.the team at little school strives to create an environment where children and their parents feel inspired. the program draws from many pedagogies with the premise that children learn by doing.the school has been able to support community families by expanding to 2 neighborhood preschools in rockridge and one very special school in berkeley. we invite you to be a part of our story!
