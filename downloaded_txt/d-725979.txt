friend, god's last-day people
will return to the ten commandment law of god and obey him to the fullest, including his
seventh-day sabbath.  this web site is dedicated to promoting the biblical
truth on this topic.  through traditions, man has drifted from the plain
"thus saith the lord," and has forgotten to keep the one commandment
that begins with "remember."


"remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 
six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the
sabbath of the lord your god.  in it you shall do no work; you, nor your
son, nor your daughter, nor your manservant, nor your maidservant, nor your
cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates.  for in six days the
lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and
rested the seventh day.  therefore the lord blessed the sabbath day and
hallowed it."  exodus 20:8-11 (fourth commandment)
"they allege the sabbath 
changed into sunday, the lord's day, contrary to the decalogue, as it appear, 
neither is there any example more boasted of than the changing of the sabbath 
day.  great, they say, is the power and authority of the church, since it 
dispensed with one of the ten commandments."  
martin 
luther, augsburg confession of faith, art. 28.
