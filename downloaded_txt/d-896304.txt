microsoft says terms of service mandate arbitration for xbox controller suit
february 16th, 2021, 23:47 posted by: wraggstermicrosoft has asked a us district court judge to force plaintiffs in a lawsuit over defective xbox controllers to go to individual arbitration, saying they had agreed to terms of service specifying that form of dispute resolution.
microsoft argued that the microsoft services agreement mandates that all disputes (except for intellectual property claims) be resolved individually through arbitration, and that any argument about whether or not an issue can be taken to arbitration must also be resolved by an arbitrator.
additionally, microsoft is claiming that the controllers' warranty agreements also compel individual arbitration for dispute resolution and waive rights to pursue a class-action suit. while the details of the agreement are on a brochure inside the box, microsoft said consumers who disagreed could have returned the opened controllers instead of using them, and a url on the box linking to the full warranty agreement also counted as "robust notice" of the terms.

xbox series s/x was the no.1 console of january
february 16th, 2021, 23:30 posted by: wraggsterconsole sales in the uk jumped 148% in january compared to the year before.  
charts specialist gfk reveals that over 150,000 games machines were sold during the last month. the xbox series machines sold best for the first time, followed by nintendo switch. nintendo switch sales were up 21% over the same period the year before. ps5 is narrowly behind in third place, though it should be noted that the machine was almost entirely out of stock during the first two weeks of the year.  
indeed, ps5 and xbox series s and x are severely supply constrained, and their sales performance is largely decided by how many units are released at retail during any given period.  
the more expensive ps5 and xbox series machines means that the revenue from games consoles rose 251% over the year before.  
in terms of the games themselves, 941,672 boxed games were sold in the uk during january, which is an increase of 7% over the same period the year before. over â£30m was generated by the physical software market in january, which is up 16% over january 2020.
it was animal crossing: new horizons that was the best-selling game of the month, ahead of mario kart 8 deluxe at no.2 and grand theft auto 5 at no.3. the best-selling new release was hitman 3 at no.12. nintendo was the top publisher once again, while nintendo switch accounted for more than half of all the boxed games sold last month.

mp proposes bill to make console scalping illegal amid ps5 and xbox series shortages
february 16th, 2021, 23:08 posted by: wraggsterscottish national party mp douglas chapman continues his campaign against console scalpers, bringing forward a private member's bill to ban the practice.
sky news reports the bill is titled the gaming hardware (automated purchase and resale) bill 2019-21, and would operate in a similar fashion to a ban on ticket touting implemented a few years ago.
chapman acknowledged that the bill is unlikely to become law, but said it was one of the only actions he could take to force the government to "take responsibility" on the issue.
the bill follows ongoing reports of scalpers using bots to snap up stock of playstation 5 and xbox series x|s as soon as it becomes available via online retailers.
back in november, shortly after the ps5 launch, one group claimed to have acquired nearly 3,500 units in the space of a few weeks -- consoles that were then resold for an inflated price.
chapman proposed an early day motion back in december asking for legislation that would prohibit the resale of consoles at prices "greatly above manufacturer's recommended retail price."
sky news reports this has since gained support from mps in labour, plaid cymru, the dup and chapman's fellow snp members.
when asked for an update on the motion, caroline dinenage -- the minister of state for digital and culture -- said: "officials are discussing this issue with the trade association for the video games industry.

ampere: ps5 and xbox series x|s sales in line with, not ahead of, previous gen
february 16th, 2021, 22:27 posted by: wraggstera new report suggests supply constraints have prevented the next-generation playstation and xbox consoles from significantly outselling their forebears.
data from ampere analysis suggests that xbox series x|s has sold 2.8 million units since launching in november -- lagging a little behind the xbox one during the same post-launch timeframe at 2.9 million units.
meanwhile, ps5 has matched the performance of ps4, which shifted 4.2 million units in its first few months after launching in november 2013.
it's also worth noting the ps4 achieved this without its home market of japan, where it did not launch until q1 2014. ps5, meanwhile, launched simultaneously worldwide.
last week, sony's financials reported ps5 has sold 4.5 million units -- confirming it as the most successful playstation, and by extension the most successful home console, of all time.
however, sony's figures usually represent sales to retail or shipments, while ampere claims its data focuses on sell-through -- sales directly to consumers.
the pandemic is undeniably a factor here, with both platform holders suffering constraints and likely to face fierce competition for key components throughout 2021.
ampere believes ps5 would likely have sold more than five million units thus far had availability been less of an issue.

xbox u-turns on gold subscription price hike after fan backlash
january 24th, 2021, 22:45 posted by: wraggsterless than 18 hours after it was announced, xbox has scrapped its plans to raise the price of its xbox live gold subscription service.
the firm had previously announced that its gold membership scheme, which is what gamers need to be able to play xbox games online, would be increasing by $1 for a one-month subscription, or $5 for three months. that would be $10.99 for a month, $29.99 for three months and $59.99 for six months. that six-month price is what xbox had been charging for a 12-month subscription.,
however, some fans were angry at the increase. analysts suggested this was an aggressive effort from microsoft to convince its gold user base to upgrade to xbox game pass ultimate, which combines gold with the firm's game pass offering (where players can download hundreds of games on xbox and pc). other fans took to social media to criticise the move taking place so soon after the launch of the new xbox consoles, and during the current uncertain economic situation caused by covid-19.
microsoft reacted quickly, however, and has reversed its decision. the firm has also announced that free-to-play games on xbox will no-longer require gold membership at all. this comes ahead of the launch of halo: infinite later this year, which will feature a free-to-play multiplayer mode.

cd projekt faces a second class-action lawsuit over cyberpunk 2077
january 19th, 2021, 21:30 posted by: wraggstercd projekt has confirmed receipt of another class-action lawsuit from a law firm representing its own investors.
the polish studio previously confirmed it was facing legal action from the new york-based rosen law firm, which claims the company misled investors over cyberpunk 2077 -- in particular, the state of the game on xbox one and playstation 4.
now a regulatory notice reveals a second lawsuit has been filed in the us district court for the central district of california.
cd projekt says the "content of the claim, including its subject and scope, is the same" as the aforementioned class action.
as with the other case, cd projekt notes the complaint "does not specify the quantity of damages sought" and adds that it will "undertake vigourous action to defend itself against any such claims."

us environmental organisation warns against xbox series x, ps5 energy consumption
january 18th, 2021, 22:52 posted by: wraggsterthe playstation 5 and the xbox series x each draw 160 to 200+ watts of electricity when used, which is higher than their predecessors and more power than a 60-inch tv.
that's according to the us' natural resources defense council, an environmental nonprofit organisation that measured the energy consumed by next-gen consoles and today published a lengthy report on the topic.
the report recognised the platform holders efforts to reduce power consumption when the consoles are in rest mode, only drawing one watt or lower when that's the case, but also highlighted the impact of features such as xbox's instant-on mode, which is enabled by default when the console ships.
"based on modeling nrdc performed through 2025, this one seemingly inconsequential decision by microsoft could result in the equivalent of one large (500 mw) coal-burning power plant's worth of annual electricity generation and cost new us xbox owners roughly $1 billion on their electricity bills," wrote senior scientist at the nrdc noah horowitz.
"given that there is very minimal user benefit from instant-on, it's surprising that microsoft -- which publicly announced that 'by 2030 microsoft will be carbon negative... and launch an initiative around the world to help their suppliers and customers reduce their carbon footprints' -- does not ship its consoles with the energy savings option enabled by default (and perhaps remove the 'instant on' choice during the initial set-up). such a change could happen almost overnight with just a few lines of new code."

microsoft calls for xbox drift lawsuit to be handled by arbitration
january 4th, 2021, 18:21 posted by: wraggstermicrosoft is urging the washington court to move the class-action lawsuit over xbox controller drift to independent arbitration.
the lawsuit was originally filed in april last year and claims microsoft failed to disclose an issue with its various xbox one controllers -- including the high-end elite model -- that causes them to register movements incorrectly.
now vgc reports microsoft has filed a new motion calling to take the case out of courtrooms and into arbitration. this would see individual disputes handled by an impartial adjudicator, who would make final and binding decisions.
the company claims that simply by using the controllers and xbox live, each plaintiff is beholden to the microsoft services agreement, which compels them to use arbitration.
"plaintiffs repeatedly agreed not to bring a lawsuit like this in court," microsoft's motion states.
"instead, they assented to the microsoft services agreement and to warranty agreements in which they promised they would arbitrate disputes on an individual basis using a consumer-friendly process before the american arbitration association. the federal arbitration act requires enforcing these agreements."
back in october, the lawsuit was amended to include the xbox elite series 1 and 2 controllers..

games of the year 2020 | xbox game pass
december 24th, 2020, 23:43 posted by: wraggsterat some point over the last decade, subscription services completely changed the way i discover and listen to music.
i couldn't tell you exactly when the shift happened. it occurred slowly, steadily; regular purchases gave way to monthly payments, and my love of the album was rivalled and eventually subsumed by playlists and individual tracks. i was one kind of music enthusiast in 2010, and somewhere in the time since, i became another.
while it is perhaps too early to know for sure, it feels like the shift i find so difficult to pinpoint with music happened to me with video games in the course of the last 12 months. while i played many games i loved in 2020, the single product that mattered most to my playing habits was a subscription service: xbox game pass.
the reasons for this are manifold, but there are two that stand apart from the others -- the first and most obvious being value. when spotify launched, the cost of music was already much lower than games, with purchases starting at 99p a song and rarely exceeding â£15 for an album. some games are free to start and some are only 99p, i grant you, but the products i most frequently buy fall between â£10 and â£60. gaming has always been the most expensive of my many cultural obsessions.

kotaku says it has obtained an internal memo directing gamestop employees to accept cyberpunk 2077 returns on playstation 4 and xbox one, even if the game is already opened -- where typically policy is only to accept unopened copies.
returned games are to be labeled as "defective" and sent back to the gamestop warehouse.
