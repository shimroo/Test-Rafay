february 2025 meeting minutes

greater norwalk amateur radio club (gnarc)meeting minutes 02/13/2025
present (8): hugo aa1xv, toy k1wyq, steve k1rf, pete kc1pwh, rusty k4saa, jon ai1v, david n1dpd, steve w1sms
meeting opened 7:00 by aa1xvjan minutes approved.
department reports:
finance: checking and savings both good. however, we have had only 32 paid renewals so far this year which is running behind last year at this time. please don’t forget to renew.
communications: no communications of note.
board: no board actions.
technical committee: steve w1sms continues to work on getting the new repeater and new antenna ready for the hospital site. once the hospital site has been upgraded we will then address the strawberry hill site.
public service: no items of note this month. nothing in the immediate future.
education committee: nothing new.
other old business: we still need to deal with the trailer at the firehouse since we are going to have to move it. we either need a place for the trailer itself or at least a place for the equipment in the trailer.
new business:
we are doing a survey of what club members want out of the club. the survey has been put on-line and a link has been sent by email to everyone on the reflector mailing list.  please respond to the survey so that the board can better plan club activities and meetings.
we will try a hybrid meeting next month – both in-person and on-line. apparently there are a number of club members who prefer to not be driving at night, especially given rush hour traffic in lower fairfield county.
we discussed field day 2025. hugo aa1xv would prefer a more traditional field day than going to the westport astronomical society, but so far has not found a suitable place. while vets park is probably available, it is a tough place given the lack of trees for antennas and lack of shade. rusty k4saa suggested that we look at waveny park. hugo has also suggested that if we cannot find a place of our own that we consider combining with another club such as stamford.
we also discussed the desirability of a remote hf operation. we do have an icom 7300 that was set up for remote operation but was not used very often. it was suggested that we talk to the norwalk senior center to see if we can get room in there as a permanent shack and also for a permanent remote hf operation, perhaps with a 40-10 hf vertical which would probably be more practical to implement, especially if we’re going to be someplace like the senior center. it was pointed out that as good as the 7300 is for remote operations, it’s a lot easier to set up a flex radio for remote operations.
we also talked about re-implementing the formal member database that was allowed to get out of date over the past year or so.
the meeting was closed at 9:00 pm.
next meeting is expected to be wednesday march 12.

gnarc meeting minutes,  january 8, 2025
location: westport library, conference room 216
attending:  officer members –hugo aa1xv, president; marty k1mgd, vice president; dave n1dpd treasurer; tom kb1fbx, secretary
other members in attendance: toy k1wyq; steve w1sms ; steve k1rf; rusty k4saa; mark n1mg; jeff kb1c; pete kc1pwh and chuck k1cwt   
minutes:  meeting called to order at 7:30 pm by president hugo
election of new officers for 2025:
nominating committee: toy k1wyq and  paul w1ppl (who was not present) reviewed their slate of candidates:
current officers – president hugo aa1xv, vice president marty k1mgd, treasurer dave n1dpd, and jeff kb1c for secretary. nominations from the floor were sought by toy: mark n1mg nominated steve w1sms for vice president, which was duly seconded and who was elected by majority vote of attending members. remaining officers and candidates in the proposed slate were also elected by majority vote.
treasurer’s report: 
treasurer dave n1dpd reported 25 attended the holiday party in december, which after costs were subtracted from expenses was a net cost of $569. a financial statement form 2024 was presented which showed income from club dues, donations and sale of equipment against expenses related to taxes, form 990 filing,ups mailbox,  picnic supplies, holiday party, website, insurance, and new repeater and antenna at a cost of $2800, which overall meant( a net loss of $1553 for the year). 
so far in 2025, 3 members have paid annual $35 dues. members are asked to please pay using paypal, via the link on the club website:  http://gnarc.org/join/.  
dues can be mailed to: greater norwalk amateur radio club, 304 main avenue #115, norwalk, ct 06851
overall the club is in good shape financially.
there was some discussion of moving the club po mailing address to someone’s private residence which would save $300 per year. currently we are paid through march. disadvantages of this would be the need to change mailing addresses registered to the club in lots of places, and this would need to change whenever the hosting member required us to change it (i.e., moved, quit the club, etc.) we would also need to retain both addresses for a one year overlap. advantage of keeping things as they are is that the address remains permanent, no conclusions were reached. 
old business:
steve w1sms reported the new repeater is working and will undergo a bit more testing. there was some discussion of antennas located at norwalk hospital and fox radio station. the current tower on strawberry hill ave is still in use though the site has been sold twice and we have had no contact with the present owners. we should wait until the new antenna is in place and has been tested before removing anything from anywhere.
our trailer, which currently stores field day equipment, is currently located behind fire station #4 and we must find a new home for it within the next 6 months. there may also be some club “stuff” still stored in a closet there, and some antennas, which must be removed.  we are seeking a volunteer or someone with contacts who can assist with this. rusty k4saa and marty k1mgd may be able to help with this. (update: on 1/9 we received an email from marty k1mgd relating that there is in fact nothing in that room.). the trailer itself needs to be power washed and unusable “junk” inside remove, a possible springtime club project. 
new business:
hugo aa1xv related a conversation he’s had with steve n1cm, president of sara about possibly connecting gnarc more with the stamford club. sara has their own way of doing field day, and so far we have not found common ground. the idea of trying other joint activities was explored but needs further research, gnarc and sara did join forces to work at  last summer’s “bloomin metric” bike race, which was successful in some ways but had some technology glitches. the question was raised: could we pair with sara on other (non field day) activities, maybe contests?
a more general discussion followed revolving around the question posed by steve w1sms: what do gnarc members want? the idea of a survey of membership asking for thoughts/ideas/reactions was advanced. 
more specifically, some discussion of exploring moving our field day back into vets park, but perhaps not as extensively as we’ve done it in the past. a lot of discussion and volunteering of antennas that would be simple to erect and give us good coverage of the band we need, perhaps making setup easier. no conclusions were reached; hugo will survey the membership before the next club meeting. we have 4 meetings before fd to discuss and plan. 
next meeting: wednesday, february 12, at the westport library, room location tba   
meeting adjourned 8:55 pm
jeff kb1c, secretary

monthly members meetingjune 12, 2024 – meeting minutes
this month we were unable to secure a room at the comstock center of wilton.  a virtual meeting was held.
called to order by the president, hugo aa1xv, at 1930 hours.
attending:  officer members – hugo aa1xv, president; dave n1dpd, treasurer.  other members and guests in attendance: pete, kc1pwh;  paul, w1ppl; jon, ai1v; toy, k1wyq; steve, w1sms; dan (callsign?); jim, kc1fb; steve, k1rf; johnny,w1dyn; andre,w2art.
treasurer’s report:  our club is solvent. no changes since last meeting. no new paid members nor new expenses.
committee reports:a committee previously appointed on the matter of club assets, credentials, and technological evaluation of the repeaters and gnarc licenses and coordination, integrated by steve w1sms, paul w1ppl, and peter kc1pwh, presented a report on the current state of gnarc’s repeaters. this is a first step towards ensuring continuous availability of vhf communication by creating enough redundancy to address power loss, hardware failure, site inaccessibility, or any other unforeseen situation.
peter kc1pwh put forward a motion for the board of directors (b.o.d.) to consider, and if adopted, authorize the expenditure of funds to cover the purchase of a new yaesu fusion repeater, a new collinear antenna, and other necessary hardware complemented with donated material to be installed at the norwalk hospital.
subsequent steps for the broader scope of this committee will include:

installing an echolink node
securing access to the current 2-meter repeater site
creating necessary maintenance documentation
ensuring rights to access the locations of the equipment
assuring the club’s rights over these locations.

old business:
johnny, w1dyn, and dave, w1dpd, provided a brief overview of the bloomin metric bike race held this past month. firstly, there were no injuries or accidents among the participants. however, it was noted that some areas on the route do not have reliable cell phone coverage, highlighting the convenience and reliability of radio communications to support the event.
new business:
toy, k1wyq, expressed concern about the gnarc.org website. his concerns included outdated information and the vulnerability of membership email addresses to spam and exploitation by malicious actors. in this vein, i’d like to ask again for help: we’d like to have a permanent webmaster or someone willing to take care of our webpage on a more permanent basis.” jon, ai1v, stepped in to help when paul, w1ip, stepped down as webmaster after many years of dedicated service, for which we are very grateful. we are looking for volunteers who can dedicate a few hours a month to keep the website current and secure. if you are interested, please step forward and let us know.
announcements:
this june 22 and 23 is the annual arrl field day. gnarc will not participate as a club, but some members will join the event at the westport astronomical society, collaborating with two other clubs. setup will be on friday, june 21st. if you want to reserve an operation slot, please visit: field day signup form.
the meeting was adjourned at 2100 hours.
