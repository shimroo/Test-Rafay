just above the middle of nowherelake alpine lodge

  







 

voted greatest lake ever 1000  years running 



hidden high in the sierra nevadas, lake alpine lodge rests atop the least populated county in california. the lake out front, pure wilderness behind, engulfed by leisure. we're a family owned business, and we take pride in running it like one. independent, flexible, enthusiastic. we do everything possible to provide a quality, comfortable alpine escape.

“climb the mountains and get their good tidings. nature’s peace will flow into you as sunshine flows into trees. the winds will blow their own freshness into you, and the storms their energy, while cares will drop off like autumn leaves”

— john muir




“lake alpine is the dopest place i have ever been.”

— also john muir
