            would you favor changing the name of fort cavazos back to fort hood, as defense secretary pete hegseth has ordered for fort bragg?





you voted: 






 1. yes. congress never should have changed it to start with. it will always be fort hood.
                                



 2. yes. if a deserving namesake can be found, as with fort bragg, that’s fine. otherwise, no.
                                



 3. no. removing the name of a decorated hero who commanded here would be an insult.
                                



 4. no. what’s done is done. too much money has already been spent changing it once.
                                



 5. unsure. it’s hard to say. there is a lot of history in the name, but it is a bit controversial.
