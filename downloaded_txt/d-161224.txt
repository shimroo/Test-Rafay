want to get started?
we find that this hobby has a great appeal to those who enjoy working with animals, to those who

                appreciate athleticism, to those who like friendly, wholesome competition. if you find yourself in one

                or more of these descriptions....be careful, you may discover that the allure of these amazingly
                athletic birds is overpowering.
you can seek out your own comfort level with the birds. if you desire a lower-key approach, with only a
                handful of

                homing pigeons for the family to enjoy, that's certainly an attractive approach for many. the spectrum
                also includes those who are

                deeply committed to racing. races range in distance from 100 miles to 600 miles, with 300 miles being
                among the most popular distances.



















the au or arpu as some call us, has approximately 700 affiliated clubs around the country.

              it is the friends and mentors you'll find in the local club that can enrich the hobby for you, no matter
              what level you choose to participate. sound interesting?

              like more information? we would love to provide
              you with some basic information on homing pigeons.
            
if you were to enroll in homing pigeons 101, you would find that there are basics to be considered. whether
              strictly as a light hobby or

              with a more sporting approach, whether for yourself or as a family activity, you will find that you are on
              a bit of a learning curve. remember,

              these birds are very different, in nearly every way, from anything you have ever thought of when you
              thought, "pigeon."
the registered homing pigeon -

              the athlete - will be a source of great enjoyment. as we continue to construct this web site, we will add
              some " how-to" information. for now, basic

              topics that you will need basic information on include: the birds - the loft - nutrition - general care &
              management - training - health - breeding - clubs - competition.
for those of you who are experienced pigeon enthusiasts, we will try to bring you timely updates
              regarding the arpu convention,

              major race results, products available from the national office, etc.

beginner guide
the help-a-beginner program is made up of volunteers who want to help
                              beginners (2nd year flyers) with advice & possibly some birds. many good flyers & breeders
                              across america donate their time and birds to help improve a beginner's chances of winning
                              diplomas

membership information
whether you are looking for a hobby for yourself or the entire family,
                              you'll want to check out these membership opportunities.

                              we even have memberships for folks that don't or can't keep birds, but that do appreciate
                              animals and specifically these feathered, pedigreed athletes.

ewinspeed
the original winspeed was a pc software program. ewinspeed is a new
                              internet based program and offers race secretaries greater ease of use and has many more
                              features than the previous software.
