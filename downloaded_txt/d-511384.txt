"awesome experience with ultimate hikes walking the milford track. the guides were amazing!  highly recommend this company - from the very first contact we had with them, the proactive communications, always responding to our emails and especially for caring for the environment in many of your processes. the lodge staff were also incredibly positive and welcoming especially after a long day of walking - thank you all the team for making this a great time away!"
