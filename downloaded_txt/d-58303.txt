william womack born ca 1610-1620





                william
                womack, born ca. 1610-1620, believed to be the patriarch of most
                womack's in the united states today. personally i have never
                found any documentation or proof that he actually existed other
                than traditions past down from generation to generation. most
                records that have been used to show proof, i believe refer to
                his son william. whoever our patriarch was william or a richard,
                as some believe based on the 1672 land patent, we do have
                records of his children. 
   
                oscar womack
                editor, womack
                genealogy newsletter,  january
                1957, said "we should try to prove our lineage as in a
                court   of
                law", however i know there are times when that piece of
                paper is just not there and all we have is family traditions. as
                sam womack another womack researcher has said many times,
                "i'm not calling my ggrandma a liar". proof is very
                important and we should make every effort to find it whenever
                possible.

                genealogy network :
although the website is no longer active at this
                        time, there is still a lot of womack information
                        archived there.
 a must for womack researchers.
