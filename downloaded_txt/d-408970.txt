we quite often discover one of our puppies out on the web in various places. recently came across this pic in facebook of sylvia martinez' little puppy "moose" with his best friend. dame is sophie sired by buddy born 06.14.07 
 


we have moved and are building a new home and kennel for our chocolate lab puppies. construction is a bit slow still a year or more to completion as we are doing the work ourselves. for the time being we're not planning new litters, just not enough time to devote to a mama and new puppies.














we love to see how our puppies are doing. check out more on our owners feedback pages, meet some of our puppies and please feel free to talk with their owners. some examples below.

 








i accept 8 deposits, 4 males, 4 females until puppies are born and i have an actual count. it is not unusual for all 8 deposits to be taken by the time they are born. if you want a puppy you should first email or call me 949-485-9361 to make sure it is still available and then send your deposit via paypal. full info is found on the reserve a puppy page.



read stargate kennels history to see where we started and why we do what we do here. have a look at my new puppy care menu (scroll to bottom of any page to access) for good tips on puppy feeding, housebreaking, crate training, exercise, veterinarian selection, pet insurance, puppy proofing (including poisons and hazards to avoid), worming and what to have on hand when you bring your puppy home for the first time. see what some current owners have to say about their puppies. (sorry for the big pages!) for folks who have our chocolate labs and want to research old photos, or for anyone who likes puppy pictures i have started an archive section, nothing fancy, just lots of puppy pictures. some are better than others, reflecting my slow improvement as a puppy photographer, i guess.
black, brown or yellow? one of the best explanations of color genetics in labs that i have seen can be found here http://users.tpg.com.au/choclab/cci/cci.htm
