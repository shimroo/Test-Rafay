 the stress free differencehi, i’m linda....












i've got your back.
when negotiating with lenders, i fight hard to secure the best mortgages for my clients.
i love educating my clients.

get the most out of your mortgage
clients benefit from my long-time relationships with 50+ lenders and their wealth of options.


















“i had so many questions. linda and her team were so calming and informative throughout the entire process. linda worked directly with the lender to refinance the mortgage on my behalf. i can’t say enough good things about them - my experience was truly stress free.”

“my name is glenn morshower. i have been a professional actor for thirty eight years, and have been blessed to work with many of the industry’s best. i also travel extensively as a motivational speaker.  when my friend and fellow speaker, craig duswalt, gave me linda fleischmann’s book how to have a stress free mortgage, i felt better informed about what people need to do before they decide to buy. i became aware of so many things that i never knew were important. i highly recommend that anyone thinking about buying a home, or needing to refinance their existing home, read “how to have a stress free mortgage.” if you want to have that stress free experience that few people are able to have when getting a home loan, be sure to read linda fleischmann’s book first”
