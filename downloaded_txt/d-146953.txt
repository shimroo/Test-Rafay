because there are only two satellite internet providers in  the u.s., you may want to compare hughesnet vs. viasat satellite internet  plans. as you make the comparison between viasat and hughesnet, you will need  to find out what internet plans each company offers at your address. in  addition to looking at internet plan prices, pay close attention to download  speeds and data thresholds to determine if the cheapest plan will deliver  internet service that meets the needs of your home or business. 

viasat offers internet plans with a range of download speeds  from 12 mbps to 100 mbps while all hughesnet plans come with 25 mbps download speeds.  viasat internet plans typically come with much higher data thresholds than  hughesnet plans, and this is where the big difference in unlimited satellite  internet plans really shows up. 

with a viasat plan, should you reach your data threshold,  you will have your traffic deprioritized behind the traffic of viasat customers  who still have priority data available. during peak internet traffic periods, you  can expect to see reduced internet speeds, but during slower times, your speed  may be close to normal. 

when you reach your monthly data cap with a hughesnet  internet plan, your internet speed is throttled to 1-3 mbps until a new month  begins. with 1-3 mbps speeds, you can check email and stream netflix, but you  will notice the slowdown! you have the option of buying data tokens to return  your hughesnet account to full speed, but the cost adds up quickly.

as you shop for the cheapest unlimited satellite internet,  be sure to factor your internet usage into the equation. this will ensure you  get the best value in unlimited satellite internet plans that meet the needs of  your home or office.
