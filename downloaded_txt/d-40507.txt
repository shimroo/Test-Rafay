ironworks
                  live streaming 3d city!
i have been streaming my long awaited 3d city for use in my comic book like of durty bug and intruders on earth. come to my official youtube channel, ironworks gaming! click the link here!. remember to subscribe (free) and click the bell icon to get alerts when i go live, (which is in high res 1440p (2k mode) for crisp livestreams. or watch it anytime afterwards, as they are all archived. i have over 500 videos--many or them are from gaming, but i have a playlist just for 3d modeling too!!

                    ironworks
                  forum up!
i fixed it! took
                  the cpu off, cleaned the pins, and swapped some ram out and
                  boom! booted up fine! whew.... saved myself a lot of money.
                  lol. all is back to normal!
two
                  comics being released!
i've been quite
                  busy working on three websites at once, as well as finishing
                  up work on three durty bug comics
                  (two of which will be released next month (may 2015). the
                  third will come in aug. these are not 'scanned
                  in, and digitally colored.. no. these are completely redrawn
                  with my latest skills in comic design, using all the latest
                  adobe photoshop 2015 special effects and features! it looks
                  amazing compared to the originals.. (i must say.. lol). so
                  stay tuned!.

                  (also, this entire site is nearly ready to be updated
                  completely and will finally show off my new 3d model
                  selections, and not those old 1990's sci-fi models. i am
                  designing a complete 3d city in hd detail. why? it'll
                  be the backdrop for the new comics of durty bug and another
                  comic called 'intruders on earth'. based loosely on the tv
                  series 'war of the worlds, but much better. :) 

                  new
                  web design in june 2013!
it will incorporate
                  all the updated and current 3d models and artwork i have done
                  (with an an updated web design), as well as a few all new
                  areas for the comic line i'm about to release! dūrty
                  bug is coming...

construction
                  almost done
i am almost done
                  with the new tge web design, and it should be uploaded this
                  coming week! the design is much the same, but i built upon the
                  current look, keeping it simple to navigate and adding many
                  new features. every area will also be updated, some areas will
                  have new content, and new 3d models will be ready to go in a
                  few weeks too!

dropping
                  truespace webring
                  i no longer use truespace for any project, so there is no
                  reason to keep my site in the webring. the nav button on the
                  lefthand side will be removed when the new design is launched.


                  new design
                  underway
                  this design you see was created in 1998. it was so ahead of
                  its time in design, and html, that it really stood the test of
                  time and current design styles. i still get emails on
                  it. 

                  the new design is underway now,
                  and will build upon this design, yet bring forth much better
                  navigation design, complete ssi integration, and flash.
                  i won't clutter the design up--i like to keep it simple, and i
                  think you guys want to get around the site as efficiently as
                  possible.

also, build into this front page
                  will be a 'virtual' web cam.
                  this will show the latest renderings of 3d models i am
                  working on, and will most of the time, released freely to the
                  public. you can watch, as each day as a model progresses!
                  it'll be updated every update daily. email me if you like the
                  idea!

starfleet 
					missions update
it has been on hold for 3 years due to 
					many real life things. another is a change 
					from using truespace to 3ds max for 3d work. and now, 
					i have learned max, and have imported all the starfleet 
					missions 'sets'. i have also been remaking most of the 
					models that needed it--i will first work on the sfm episode 
					1. it will have added scenes as well, as well as music and 
					more, using windows media video. production is underway, 
					and i have turnaround on making shots is so much faster, so 
					it will be completed much faster.


					making models for neverwinter nights!
after a year in 
					development, the hakpak for the rpg neverwinter nights 
					will be released in a few weeks, and then, all the 3d 
					models here (sci-fi) and such will finally get a total 
					remake, and i no longer use truespace3d. i have moved 
					to 3d studio max. 3ds max is a sophisticated high-end 3d 
					modeling software package that has been used in many 
					hollywood blockbuster movies, and animated movies like toy 
					story.


                  hurricane images of our area!
i live in florida, and as many of you may 
                  know, we were hit with 4 hurricanes this summer, 
                  and 3 of them hit over our city, lakeland. our home lost only 
                  2 shingles and mostly tree branches (some large though).

                  i have put up an 

                  image gallery here so you can see what the last one 
                  did -- hurricane jeanne. it was a scary storm, and i like 
                  storms, but this one was scary. 90+ mph sustained winds is no 
                  joke. 4 of our neighbors lost 50% of their roofs and siding, 
                  so we were very lucky.

                  starfleet missions clip released!

                  this is a short clip of a starfleet hopper shuttle attacking a 
                  larger starfleet starship. it's using windows media format, 
                  and is 3.5mb
                  you can watch it

                  more 
                  on the way!
 

over the past five months, we 
                  have been working on the remake of the first starfleet 
                  missions movie. originally released in 1994, the graphics are 
                  very out-dated. we are working for a release date of july 
                  2004. 

the original was done in 
                  deluxe paint animation, and the remake will be done in 
                  truespace 6.5 with full music score, and voice and sound 
                  effects.

                  what about starfleet missions ii you ask? well, production on 
                  that was halted until this is released, and it is mostly 
                  complete, and we will need people to do voice-overs, so if you 
                  have a good speaking voice, and can maybe do more than one 
                  voice, 

email me with a sample!

the official forums are back!

it's been 
                  some time since our forums have been up, but i have created a 
                  brand new 'tgeweb' forum for anyone to post your artwork pic's 
                  as well as see 
upcoming 
                  artwork 
                  from the many projects i am working on! the forums are located 
                  at ironworks forum--which is another site i own and have been 
                  running since 1999. everyone is welcome!!!

                  release
                  our first official compu-comic release will be in june 
                  2003! this comic is based loosely on the tv series "war of 
                  the worlds" --not to be confused with the movie of the 
                  same name.

                  we will also be selling them in paper format for a small 
                  price, but the digital format is free.

                  each comic's locations, people and 'sets' were all done in 
                  truespace5 (a 3d modeling program) and with added effects 
                  which look amazing!

update on starfleet 
                  missions ii
i 
                  have had many emails asking when sfme2 would be released, 
                  since i started the project in 1999. since then, many things 
                  have happened in my life--my mom passed, and we had to deal 
                  with a few other things as well. needless to say, i am still 
                  working on it, and it's about 50% complete. i already have the 
                  soundtrack ready, so that will help speed the release a lot! 
                  stay tuned for a short clip of sfme2 early next year!i have been very
                  busy with many different projects for a few months, and will
                  be releasing 2 new models soon. one is the the transport
                  rings
                  from stargate
                  sg1,
                  and another is the ss
                  enterprise nx-1
                  (as seen in the new startrek series 'enterprise').
                  it looks much like the akira
                  class starship.

                  also-- i have been reworking the forums. i have upgraded
                  the forum software, and right now i am testing it out, and
                  working on the artwork layouts for it. it will be ready for
                  use in a week or so.

the
                  first in a series of 30 second 'previews' of the sets that are
                  used in   starfleet missions ii  are being uploaded, the 1st one
                  is online now!

                  their is one 'hiccup' in this avi (a camera error, but it only
                  lasts 3 frames)
                  this avi requires the div-x codec, which can be downloaded here. 

                  this 30 second animation is a walk-around in starfleet academy
                  grounds (west wing complex). the avi is 3.7mb
