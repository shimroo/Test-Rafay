fbvfd is still here






 


trying times     25mar20

fort blackmore vol. fire dept. would like to take a moment to remember the nation's, and scott county's first responders -- fire, rescue, law enforcement, and dispatchers - and keep them lifted up to the lord jesus. we pray for their safety and good health in these upcoming "trysome" days. "the angel of the lord watch over you and keep you safe." and, "surely goodness and mercy shall follow you all the days of your life... and that you dwell in the house of the lord forever." thank you for scott county's first responders, and y'all keep up the good work.

as a reminder, training is still the 1st and 3rd monday nights. scott co. e-911 is providing 1000 bio-hazard gloves to be handed out to responders, two or three pairs at a time, in our department.  keep them in your turnouts, and maybe a pair for your vehicle. keep your families safe from harm. this "noisome pestilence" wont last forever. also, we are always looking for able men and women 18 years of age or older to help mitigate fire in our district.  new drivers are also needed: 21 year olds or older.  there is a whole range of jobs to be had at the fire department. also, if you don't live in fbvfd's district, there are six more fire departments in scott county that would be glad to have you!

training nights ==> 1st and 3rd monday nights @ 1900 hrs.

we are always looking for new firefighters.
