                                    updated 1/26/2020
                                    - chapters are starting to get back up, still lots of work to do on it. addventures
                                    
                                    update 12/2
                                - some back end stuff such as reorganize the data so fewer weird codes issue and tighter permission
                                - cleaned up some 174,000 bad user accounts for spammers slowing down the database, increasing speed by getting rid of them
                                - more steps to make sure bad stuff never gets in to clear things up
                                - sorry for not doing more  (still hope to get the wall up before the new year)

                                login/logout at the login page
                                    adding captcha to prevent spammers
                                got the text editor to try and use, but need to make sure i get it configured correctly so it won't hack the server.
                                i am going slow, but hope to take off around thanksgiving and get a good version of addvetnure up then, but hope to have the wall up by early novemeber.
