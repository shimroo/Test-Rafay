like a long, lost friend. 





it's still here. the blog. yay! 

it's been a big week around here, what with the yard watering, business growing and requiring new decisions... it's scary and exhilarating and, well. awesome. i know, i know... that word is overused, but it really has been an inspired week. amongst other things, we started developing new products. see those? ombre batts and yarn  available here :)








there is another one finished in a white to blue gradient- spun boucle style (from the above batt).

what.... else? oh! we have begun offering what we think is one of the best mini skein buys on the market! they are 100% washable, approximately 75% commercial yarns and 25% hand painted, by yours truly. we have had great reviews thus far and are thrilled to find offer them. plus it gives me a great excuse to troll ebay looking for yarn, something i find rather mindless and soothing whether we buy or not. even with our commercial accounts, it's not always easy making available a wide variety of minis for the pound bag, but it is always fun :)

we have pretty much moved away from keeping regular studio/store hours for all kinds of reasons, but the biggest is that we're so much more productive this way. that said, i am thinking hard about a once a month class. maybe. some day. *scratches head*

damn artists... ;)

wow, its' december!





it's time!!! bring your fiber projects and get on over here for some good company, good food, coffee and uninterrupted fun!

saturday, december 10 from 2:00pm until 4:30pm

    i should mention that we have a new gallery cat (kitten!!!) in case that is an issue for you. she's very funny and friendly and seems to add a great deal to people's enjoyment of the gallery--but we know that is not the case for everyone.

    btw... hannah giere volunteered to cook for us and we thank her profusely!! 

in brief, so i can get back to the holiday rush...  :d

*** for those of you who were waiting, your needle felting pen tools are in! i only have the ones you asked me to hold for you and two more left, they sell so fast! and, yes i have already ordered more :d

*** by request, we now have seam clips, point protectors, magnetic bag clasps, stitch holders, counters and yarn sleeves. 


*** i'm still looking around for the best deal on sock blockers.

*** next week, we're getting in a large, new assortment of dyed corriedale and merino fibers for felting and spinning. i can't keep up with the demand as late(yay!), so i ordered from louet. we have bumps of new zealand wool in stock. it's very soft for spinning yet, because it is so inexpensive, it also makes a great core wool for felting.

*** next week, we're getting in about 300 hundred cookie cutters. yep. i said three hundred! we'll keep adding to our selection if you like them. they are great for cooking (obvious, yes?), mineral and polymer clay, and ... you knew it was coming... needle felting! 

phew! i better get back  to the studio. santa has us hopping these days :d

well, well.. here we are!





good day!   we've been so very busy preparing for the holidays, we haven't had the chance to write much in awhile! (dontcha hate it when a blog starts out that way ;) we have several events planned, so i'll start there. 

stitch & bitch  
    it’s time to launch our official “stitch & bitch” for the winter months! our first one will be this saturday, november 5 from 2-5pm. several of you have asked for it, so be it--we're looking forward to having everyone! bring any project that you want to work on, be it knitting, spinning, crochet, sewing and spend the afternoon in good company. who knows what you’ll learn! the first one just happens to be on my birthday, november 5, so we will have coffee, tea, sparkling cider, wine and… cake of some kind! i do so love cake  :d  mom taught me to be generous, so to celebrate,  i'll host some kind of drawing/give away for people that attend.

crochet class
november 12, from 2-5. leeann cisneros of alamosa and heaven scents will host a crochet class for those of you that want to learn. personally, i find it very handy and creative to be able to do both, so i expect to see some you hard-core knitters along for the ride!  there is no charge for the class itself, just the cost of your supplies-and we’ll give you 10% off of those that day.   

phat fiber
what else… we’ve begun participating in the phat fiber sampler box again. this month’s theme is “wine country”. our colorway is inspired by the foods that are classic accompaniments to good wine and clara peters’ “"breakfast still-life with bread, cheese and cherries", 17th century. many of you know that i teach women’s art history and i have long loved this painting, so it seemed like the natural choice.  if you’re unfamiliar with the phat fiber sampler program, check it out here: www.phatfiber.com/index.htm . there is much to get excited about there!

new stuffs... 
what’s new? 
--dichroic buttons for your projects
--christmas ornaments and lots of them.
--a shipment of brown sheep yarn
--fibers, fibers, and more fibers!
--new angelina colors
--hand dyed silk bells by wonderland fibers
--books!
--windchimes
--needlefelting tools
--knitting, crochet notions-including magnet closure for bags
--handmade bags by vickie marquez 
--hand dyed cashmere sock, dk and worsted yarns

that’s good for today, yes? keep in touch. we miss you when you’re gone.

summer fun





music festivals, fiber festivals, parade floats... these are my summer realities. it's great fun, but i must admit i miss camping and gardening too.we thought we'd make that happen this summer, but with galleries opening and a dog in her last days (though she seems good today!), well... there has not been much leaving of home except to do these other things.what else? i haven't used my loom(s), but i have filled my store more than it ever has been. i even have stock not yet listed. i am trying to get a good stock built up for august-usually one of the better sales months--and for fall when we open the gallery. i have yet to settle on a name for the place. i keep waiting for the "right" answer to dawn on me.i have a table loom that is ready and warped -- and i have actually settled on yarn! i should just get to it. i know that the work will usually carry me forward, but then i want to do another freeform piece as well.as problems go, mine are gifts.

new loom!





 i know little about  it except that it was made in berea, ky (shoutout to steven and gin!) we were given a great deal on it-especially important during the summer when i am not working at the college. it's gorgeous and fits nicely in the living room, making it much likely that i will use it. 

i look forward to weaving all matter of stuff with it-including, but not limited to, paper!

what to do...





it's 5am and i woke up painting.not literally, of course, but the images were flooding in as my unconscious gave way to the conscious. the conscious mind saw them and said, "this is good".then my conscience woke up too. it reminded me of the grading i had left to do, the unwritten classes and upcoming show deadlines for work already started.so the battle begins anew...

student expectations seen as causing grade disputes





student expectations seen as causing grade disputes - nytimes.comi see this all the time. it seems that our students come to me without having learned that sometimes what we see as our efforts are simply not good enough. all the  effort in the world is in vain if it still leaves a job undone,  in "real" life, people, employers, tell us no all the time. it's painful, but it's also an opportunity to stretch, to learn.
