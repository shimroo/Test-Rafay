handmade shaker furniture, mission  furniture, custom furniture & windsor chairs 
 i operate a small woodworking shop in putney, vermont and have been designing and building handmade furniture one piece at a time since 1982. over the years i have developed a line of shaker furniture, mission furniture and windsor chairs. in addition to my line of shaker and mission furniture i also do a considerable amount of custom furniture and built-ins ranging from minor customization of standard pieces to designing and building completely new designs. i hope you will take the time to explore my web site and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments. also, the next time you're in vermont please stop in and visit my workshop and showroom.
thoughtfully designed, handmade, solid hardwood furniture
 i put a great deal of thought into my furniture to make sure that each piece is intelligently designed to fullfil it's function, is well proportioned with simple, clean, crisp details and is constructed with the best materials and joinery. while doing all of this i also keep in mind that most people don't have an unlimited budget for furniture. shaker and mission inspired designs are ideal for building furniture that is functional and beautiful yet still affordable. in addition, i sell my furniture only directly to consumers through this website and my showroom in putney, vt. this eliminates gallery or retailer mark ups which are considerable. while my furniture isn't inexpensive it is priced very fairly and is an excellent value. 

using this site 
i've tried to include as much information on my website as you would get if you visited my shop and showroom to see my furniture and talked with me personally. here are my suggestions on how to proceed from here:

browse my online furniture catalog (see menu above) and find the piece you want. if you can't find what you're looking for go to the custom furniture page to see a large selection of custom pieces we've made over the years. we regularly customize standard pieces but also design and build completely custom designs. 
learn how my furniture is designed and built: read about my design philosophy and my policy on use of sustainably harvested lumber, view construction details, and read testimonals from customers in the craftsmanship section.
read about the ordering process, lead time, lifetime guarantee and shipping options in the ordering information section.
if you still have questions please don't hesitate to call or email me with them.
place your order with confidence either online using the shopping cart or by phone (802-387-4416).

what's new?
you can keep up with what we're doing on a daily basis by following us on facebook, viewing a live streaming video of what's happening in the workshop or reading my occasional blog posts.
