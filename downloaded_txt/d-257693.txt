acknowledgement of country 


















port augusta secondary school acknowledges the barngarla people as the traditional owners of the country on which our school is located, and on which we meet. we recognise the ancient and continuing connections to lands and culture of all first nations custodians, and acknowledge their contribution to our school community. we pay our respects to elders of the past and the present, and look forward to a reconciled australia, which listens to aboriginal voices, and ensures respect and equity for all.
