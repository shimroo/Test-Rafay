mandi's world

































call me mandi.  i am a teacher, a writer, and a christian.  oh, and i am transgendered.  i love sci-fi,
                                             mystery, and literary fiction, and i write articles on transgender topics for my support group's newsletter.
 
to read some of my fiction, go to mandi's writing.com portfolio.
 
the image to the right is ranma 1/2, a character who is male at times, and female at times (like me!).

what's new?



this website is, like life, a work in progress.  it is
                                             a showcase for my essays, and a tool for education about transgender issues.  it is also about me.
