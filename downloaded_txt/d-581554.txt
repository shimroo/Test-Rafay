success story











with snom, caritas warendorf is switching to modern telecommunications.
how do you connect 40 different centres at 60 locations with completely different communication requirements? the caritas association in warendorf was faced with exactly this challenge. and since caritas has a lot of personal data on the people it cares for, the association wanted a solution that complied with the german data protection act (dsgvo). in this context, the reliability of the selected manufacturers was all the more relevant.

"snom was immediately on hand when caritas needed numerous samples for testing purposes, constantly accompanied us in all evaluation phases and provided the customer with comprehensive training. we missed this presence with the competition - christoph noppeney, managing director of isp-euronet".

cost savings through desk phones and wireless phones for the car glass specialist "carglass"
the monthly overhead costs should be reduced and the telephone bills shrink! and that is exactly what was achieved. another bonus: when the lockdown caused by the covid19 crisis swept the country and home offices became the norm, carglass' employees were able to flexibly network with each other with up-to-date systems in their native language (dutch).
cor ter braake of carglass sums up:
"we at carglass are very satisfied with our new telephone system. the change to voice over ip went smoothly and the effect is greater than we had hoped for. the new system is very flexible and our telephone bills have reduced dramatically. the audio quality is also much better, not to mention the user interfaces in dutch thanks to snom's hardware."

improved mobility and internal communication between the sites with first-class customer service for the vehicle manufacturer "eurocar italia".
a new communication system was needed for eurocar italia, so that the many operating sites are ideally networked and customer requests can be fulfilled more efficiently than ever before. a speciality of snom products!

"the snom phones meet the requirements of a company with many sites like eurocar so well that numerous new installations are planned for 2022." - roberto vagata

snom beacon solution for the metal processor "stengel"
the snom beacon solution (location gateway) has been developed for tracking factory-owned vehicles.
the first successful pilot project of the snom beacon solution took place at stengel gmbh in ellwangen (germany), a specialist in metal design. tracking using the products snom m900, snom m9b and snom m9t and some wireless phones (dect) should make visible where individual forklift trucks are currently located and therefore also where loads are currently being picked up or unloaded - for the perfect overview. .
