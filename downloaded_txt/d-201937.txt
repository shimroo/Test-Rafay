                                                      our network of anna chaplains offers spiritual care in later life, in a wide range of contexts. we accompany older people in reflecting on their life and their relationship with god, breaking down generational barriers and offering friendship and community. because we believe we’re never too old to embrace faith and enrich our lives.

                                                      we’ve been resourcing people’s spiritual journeys for over 100 years, providing comfort in hard times, enrichment in good times and challenge and inspiration at any time. through books, bible reading notes, events and blogs, we’re constantly exploring faith in new ways, because with the right support, anyone and everyone can build a lifelong relationship with god.

                                                      it’s church, but not as you know it. every month thousands of people of all ages come together to discover jesus, including those who’ve never been to church before. in over 30 countries around the world, we eat, play and worship together. expect activities, songs and prayers and an entirely new way to express your faith.
