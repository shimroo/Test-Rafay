biography
stephen
                furst has starred in many motion pictures and television series.
                beginning with the smash hit comedy classic, national
                lampoons animal house, where he starred as the lovable yet
                bumbling fraternity freshman, flounder. stephen did a series of
                other motion pictures including silent rage, up the creek, and
                the day after. he also starred as the semi-speechless mental
                patient in the dream team, along with michael keaton and
                christopher lloyd. stephen starred in the highly acclaimed
                medical drama show, st. elsewhere, as dr. elliot axlerod. he
                then hung up his doctor scrubs and donned a special hair-do,
                eyebrows, and teeth to play the character of vir, in the warner
                bros. science fiction hit babylon 5.

                furst described his character as a very dedicated ambassadors
                assistant. "he got pushed around a lot by his boss londo,
                but he did have a limit and would answer londo back, if only
                within his own mind. " i loved doing babylon 5; furst goes
                on to say. "i always love to play different types of
                characters and that one was out of this world."

                now that babylon 5 has come to an end, stephen has expanded on
                his directing and acting skills directing the feature film, baby
                huey's great easter adventure and providing character voices for
                the little mermaid ii, the: return to the sea, and buzz
                lightyear of star command: the adventure begins.

stephen is also a spokesman for the american diabetes
                foundation and donates his photo sales to this charity.
                stephen and actor stuart pankin have put together a humorous,
                sarcastic, slapstick "guy" comedy video based on his
                life. the video teaches valuable lessons about proper diabetes
                care. stephen narrates as stuart pankin mimics his buddy's
                former life as a 320-pound couch potato. simple, hilarious
                vignettes recreated from films like mission impossible, psycho,
                austin powers and other popular flicks parody stephen's evil
                ways and demonstrate the point of good diabetes management in an
                exaggerated way. a must-see, "two thumbs up" video.
