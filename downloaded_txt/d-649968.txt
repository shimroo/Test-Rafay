 treating more than an urgent care 
 less expensive than a hospital erwhen you’re sick or injured, you need affordable, quality care without the long wait. the problem is, emergency care is confusing and expensive. if you don’t need an ambulance, it’s hard to pick the right place to go—should you see your doctor, go to the urgent care, or visit the hospital er? 
 the vitalpoint difference:â	little or no wait time	â	most testing done on site	â	caring and attentive staff	â	understand your diagnosis & treatment	â	follow up with your primary care doctor  
 tired of the typical er experience?are you getting bounced from one doctor to the next? having to endure long and painful waiting room stays? experiencing rushed care that leaves you wondering what happened and what to do next? end the madness. 
the last thing you want is to get bounced from one facility to the next, wondering how much it will cost to feel better. at vitalpoint er specialists, we believe getting good care during an emergency shouldn’t be stressful. if you are suffering from an illness or injury, come straight to vitalpoint er specialists. walk-ins are welcome.
