protect your home, car, business, solar panels from emp,
								our biggest threat:


clear and present dangers: both the sun and nuclear weapons can produce emps â electro-magnetic pulse. these are major threats to people everywhere around the globe. holly and i installed an emp shield in our home to protect the electronics and to prevent a fire at the breaker box when the next emp hits. we suggest people who have back-up generators to protect them as well so they will have power for electrical devices and vehicles. it could make your home a vital hub for news and reconstruction in the neighborhood.

2 new sources for emp threats recently discovered: variations in the intensity of the solar wind can cause explosive disruptions to the earth's magnetic field which can cause localized emps. it's known that emps can be caused nuclear blasts overhead, as well as cmes and solar flares on the sun, but recently it was discovered such disruptions can be caused by sudden increases in the velocity of the solar wind. these 'disruptions' are called re-connection events in the earth's magnetic field. they can produce smaller, localized emps on the earth â even on the side facing away from the sun. see coronal mass ejections and their increasing threat moving forward and violent solar storms are happening closer to earth than anyone thought was possible.

on nov. 22, 2017, our emp shield received accreditation from keystone compliance llc (pittsburg), which is an officially recognized testing lab for the dept. of defense. 2018 and 2019 test results are available here. the emp shield is easy to install. download simple 2-page instructions here. if you're unfamiliar with the emp threat, watch stan's video. he is co-inventor of the emp shield. email stan standeyo@standeyo.com or phone him 719-547-9100 with any questions.
