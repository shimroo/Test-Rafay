the applied crypto group is a part of the 
security lab in the 
computer science department
at stanford university. 
research projects in the group focus
on various aspects of network and computer security. in particular the group
focuses on applications of cryptography to real-world security problems. for
more information follow the links below.  






lattices in cryptography

integer lattices have found many applications in cryptography: 
in proofs of security, 
in attacks, and 
in constructing cryptosystems.







privacy

can multi-user services operate without sending all user data to the 
cloud in the clear?  some examples include 
private location-based services, 
private computation of aggregate statistics, 
private recommendation systems, 
private queries to a database, and
anonymous messaging.







blockchain technologies

we are developing cryptographic tools with applications to blockchains.
we are also teaching a course on the topic, 
cs251.







pairings-based cryptography

cryptographic pairings have
numerous applications 
to cryptography, including everything from  
identity-based encryption and 
short digital signatures to
broadcast encryption and
search-friendly encryption.







computer and web security

computer security research explores architectures that improve software security
and enhances our understanding of attack strategies. 
our research covers 
ssl and tls,
web security,
and areas of 
operating systems security.




projects

bulletproofs: short proofs for confidential transactions and more
prio: private, robust, and scalable computation of aggregate statistics
order-revealing encryption
balloon hashing: memory-hard password hashing
powerspy: location tracking using mobile device power analysis
riposte: an anonymous messaging system handling millions of users
gyrophone: recognizing speech from gyroscope signals
portia: managing sensitive information in a wired world
location privacy
identity based encryption email system (ibe secure email)
the
ittc project: intrusion tolerance via threshold
cryptography 





export control warning: the us government regulates the physical export or
transmission of cryptographic source and corresponding object code outside the
borders of the us and within the us when the recipient is an embassy or an
affiliate of a foreign government. posting encrypted code to the internet and
making it publicly available is considered an export and may entail us
government notification requirements. please see stanford's 
export control encryption page 
if you have a need to take, transfer or transmit
stanford-generated encryption code outside of the us or to share it with
us-based representatives of foreign governments.
