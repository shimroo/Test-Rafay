we were so attached to this ol' blog that we refused to leave it.


so we uprooted it for a new adventure.

so float over yourselves. there's room for everyone in the spacious new blog (now with oscar charts, top ten lists, screening log, galleries and new film bitch awards all in the same spot. it's the whole works!
