as from 5th april, 2024 i have decided to close phoenix antique arms (2021) and cease trading.  
i would like to thank all my customers for their support following peters death in 2021.i have missed the enthusiasm and knowledge he put into phoenix and i realise its time for me to call it a day.peter and i met so many lovely people over the years, at auctions, arms fairs and through the website.
thank you all, it has been a privilege to know you.
best wishes for the future,
susan
