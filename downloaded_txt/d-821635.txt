                                                                                                familial thrombocythemia is an ultra-rare inherited syndrome that is characterized by elevated platelet counts (>450x109/l). while the jak2 v617f mutation has been extensively studied in the context of sporadic myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpn), understanding of germline jak2 mutations is less advanced. meggendorfer and colleagues present jak2 f556v, a new germline jak2 mutation, in a large family with thrombocythemia.

                                                                                                ocular chronic graft-versus-host disease (cgvhd) is present in more than 50% of patients with cgvhd; however, current clinical therapies provide only limited benefit. cheng and colleagues conducted a trial in patients with ocular cgvhd using human amniotic epithelial stem cells (haesc). they demonstrated that haesc eye drops are a safe, non-invasive, and efficient therapy for patients with ocular cgvhd.

                                                                                                bromodomain and extraterminal domain (bet) proteins are epigenetic readers that bind to acetylated histones in active enhancer and promoter regions, likely with a role in oncogenic enhancers of cancer. gómez-echarte and colleagues hypothesized that the use of bet inhibitors (beti) in multiple myeloma (mm) could contribute to the elimination of abnormal plasma cells. through rna-sequencing analysis following 72 hours of treatment of mm-derived cell lines with the beti jq1, they demonstrated the potential of beti to modify gene expression through regulation of de novo active chromatin regions.
