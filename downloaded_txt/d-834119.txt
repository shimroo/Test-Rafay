school threat update
september 18, 2024
the north schuylkill school district (nssd) and the butler township police department (btpd) have learned of school threats made on social media on monday, september 16, 2024, and tuesday, september 17, 2024. these threats were deemed not credible; however, the nature of the incidents has led to an increase in security measures at our schools on tuesday and wednesday.
two students were identified as the creators of  various posts.   the students involved will be charged to the fullest extent of the law.  we will not publicly identify them as they are juveniles.  through investigation and searches in the building, no weapons or ammunition were discovered.  we take all threats very seriously and want to remind our students that such actions carry real and lasting consequences.
in light of this situation, nssd and btpd will continue to collaborate closely with the schuylkill county sheriffâs department, ashland and frackville police departments and the frackville pennsylvania state police. together, we are committed to monitoring school environments to ensure the safety and security of our students, faculty and staff.  we would like to extend our gratitude to all law enforcement agencies for their presence and support at the nssd campus during this time.
we urge anyone who encounters or receives a threatening post to refrain from forwarding or reposting it, as this can lead to unnecessary fear and widespread panic. if you receive such information, please screen-save the content and alert law enforcement, the school district, or the safe2say system immediately.
we appreciate the understanding and cooperation of our community as we work together to maintain a safe learning environment for all.
thank you for your support.

at metz culinary management, we understand the importance of proper nutrition training to the health and well-being of school-age children, so we place special emphasis on nutrition education in every school we serve. we have created our live well program, a combination of educational programs that work in conjunction with our menu to help students develop healthy eating habits that will last a lifetime.
live well wellness friends focuses on making nutrition education and healthy eating an interesting experience through the use of age-appropriate educational programs and monthly promotions. nutritious friends introduces different fruits and vegetables each month in menu items and special promotions.

new cell phone policy meeting
july 25, 2023
at north schuylkill jr./sr. high school, we pride ourselves on providing our students with a high-quality education that is second to none in schuylkill county. our administration and faculty consistently reflect on best practices in education and look to implement strategies to promote growth and remove roadblocks to student achievement. four years ago, when the district decided to invest further in our students by purchasing each child a chromebook, we also began to reflect on the use of cell phones as an academic tool. based on research, discussion as an administrative team, and input collected from our faculty, we plan to place restrictions on the use of cell phones during school hours. we are now seeking input from the north schuylkill community. a meeting with stakeholders is scheduled for monday, july 31, at 6 p.m. in the high school auditorium. parents/guardians and students are encouraged to attend as the high school administration will present the revised cell phone procedures and listen to stakeholder feedback. links to a memorandum outlining the new procedures and a parent/guardian letter about the new procedures can be found below.
