welcome to stories that matteradmin2024-05-13t19:04:12+00:00

we are no longer taking submissions for the stories that matter project. if you are interested in sharing your experiences, we encourage you to reach out to the colorado health foundation program officer who works in your community.
who doesn’t love a good story? stories have the power to teach us and guide us. they paint a picture for others to see, one that was once only held in our mind’s eye. sometimes we forget how far we’ve come or we lose sight of where we want to go because we haven’t written it down or documented it. 
the colorado health foundation worked with ross strategic and community driven initiatives to gather stories about community impact and share them with the communities you live in. we worked in the city of pueblo, east colfax corridor, alamosa, morgan, eagle, montrose, rio grande, crowley and otero counties to collect stories in the following subject areas: 

food access
outdoor recreation
housing
youth empowerment
immigrant/refugee experience
civic engagement equity in access to services 
behavioral health
early childhood
