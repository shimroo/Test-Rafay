campus life






 bloomsburg


northeast pennsylvania
large campus
huskies


in northeastern pennsylvania, on the northern bank of the susquehanna river and nestled amid the susquehanna valley, you'll find bloomsburg. our campus is built on a hill and rises above the only town in pa, where you have plenty of places to find a new point of view or simply see things from a different perspective.






 lock haven


central pennsylvania
midsize campus
bald eagles


campus is alive, filled with the hustle and bustle of a new school year — trolleys rolling by, the bell tower faithfully marking the hour, and students in cadence between classes beginning their college journey while others are taking their final lap. there’s a vibe to the haven that’s hard not to notice.






 mansfield


northern pennsylvania
small campus
mountaineers


mansfield's scenic rural setting easily calls out to one’s adventurous side — fly fishing, skiing, hunting, biking, and of course camping. there’s nothing like the smell of campfire … or maybe the sound of a rolling stream … or possibly the rustle of leaves from the neighboring forest? guess we’ll let you decide.






 clearfield


central pennsylvania
intimate campus
bald eagles


everyone has a story to tell ... and preparing for life and a career is part of that story. that's what we do here at clearfield. over the years, we have helped to shape the lives and potential of many people by delivering an exceptional educational experience in a focused learning environment.
