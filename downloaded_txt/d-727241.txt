iscc affiliated imams issue important fatwa
attack on canada and the united
  states is attack on muslims
over 10 million muslims live in north america
 
calgary)  twenty imams affiliated with the islamic
  supreme council of canada have issued a fatwa today declaring the attacks on canada and the united
   states by any extremist will be the attack on 10
  million muslims living in north america.
  this is the first fatwa by the muslim clergy declaring attacks on canada and the united states as attack on
  muslims. following is the text of the fatwa.
 
fatwa (religious edict)
in the name of
  allah, the most beneficent, the most merciful
 
we,
  the undersigned imams, are issuing the following fatwa in order to guide the
  muslims of north america regarding the attacks on canada
  and the united states
  by the terrorists and the extremists. in our view, these attacks are evil and
  islam requires from muslims to stand up against this evil. in the holy quran
  almighty allah orders muslims,
"let there among you be a group that summon to all
  that is beneficial commands what is proper and forbids what is improper; they
  are the ones who will prosper." (3:104)
"believing men and believing
  women are protecting friends of one another; they enjoin what is right and
  forbid what is wrong; they perform salat and give
  zakat..." (9:71)
"those who, if we establish them in the land (with
  authority), establish regular prayers and practice regular charity and enjoin
  the right and forbid the wrong..." (22:41)
our beloved prophet muhammad (peace be upon him) said
  in a hadith;
"when people see a wrong-doer and do nothing to
  stop him, they may well be visited by god with a punishment."
therefore, it is an obligation upon us (imams) to
  inform all muslims around the world that muslims in canada and the united states have complete freedom
  to practice islam.  there is no single
  city in canada and the united states
  where masajids (mosques) are not built. 
  in all major cities islamic schools provide education to muslim
  children about quran and the islamic traditions.  thousands of muslims perform hajj every
  year and travel to saudi
    arabia with complete freedom and
  respect.  in the month of ramadan, both
  canadian and the united
    states governments recognize the occasion
  and greet all muslim citizens.  muslims
  pray five daily prayers in mosques without any fear or restrictions. muslims
  have complete freedom to pay zakat (poor due) to the charity or a person of
  their choice.  muslims have complete
  freedom to celebrate their festivals openly, publicly and islamically.  muslims enjoy freedom of religion just like
  christians, jews and others.  no one
  stops us from obeying allah and his messenger (peace be upon him). no one
  stops us from preaching islam and practicing islam. in many cases, muslims
  have more freedom to practice islam here in canada
  and the united states
  than many muslim countries. 
in fact, the constitutions of the united states and canada are very close to the
  islamic guiding principles of human rights and freedom. there is no conflict
  between the islamic values of freedom and justice and the canadian /us values
  of freedom and justice.
therefore,
  any attack on canada and
  the united states
  is an attack on the freedom of canadian and american muslims.  any attack on canada
  and the united states is
  an attack on thousands of mosques across north america.
  it is a duty of every canadian and american muslim to safeguard canada and the usa. they must expose any person,
  muslim or non-muslim, who would cause harm to fellow canadians or americans.
  we, canadian and american muslims, must condemn and stand up against these
  attacks on canada and the united states.
  
 
may
  allah save canada, the united states
  and the entire world from the evil of wrong doers. ameen.
