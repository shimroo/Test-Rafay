five elements vinyasa




the yoga synergy sequences were named in honour of the pancha mahabhuta (5 great elements) of hinduism and ayurveda that are believed to make up all of creation, including the human body – which, upon death, dissolves into these five elements of nature, thereby balancing the cycle of nature set in motion by the creative force of the universe.
