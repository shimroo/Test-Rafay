islamislam is the world's fastest
growing, yet most misunderstood religion. why ?
islam is professed by about one-fifth of
humanity. people from all walks of life, seeking truth and wholeness, are 
converting to islam in significant numbers. in a few years, islam
will be the religion with the largest number of followers on earth, superseding
christianity. despite these facts, there exist a number of false yet widespread ideas
about islam. often, these ideas are the result of ignorance, prejudice, orientalist bias,
missionary polemics or just plain, good old-fashioned propaganda. 
a person who is unfamiliar with islamic teachings
might be surprised to hear that islam does not rely upon blind faith to make its case, but
rather, encourages us to use our minds. for example, the qur'an invites us to ponder upon
the wonders of creation, and challenges us with intellectual arguments.
further study of the qur'an demonstrates that sound reasoning and scientific knowledge
confirm rather than contradict authentic revelation. indeed, one of the many unique
aspects of islam is its ability to satisfy the intellect whilst bringing peace to the
soul.
islam is an arabic word which means 'submission
to the will of god'. a muslim therefore, is one who submits to the will of god.
islam is based upon two basic principles. the first principle is that there is none worthy
of worship except god, who is absolutely unique and transcendent. the second principle is
that muhammad(p) is the final messenger of god, who was sent to all of mankind.
these two principles are mentioned in the testimony of faith - the first pillar of islam: there
is none worthy of worship but god - muhammad is the messenger of god. this simple
yet profound truth is the foundation of a perfect, comprehensive and beautiful way of
life. 
islam is not new religion, but a continuation of
the simple and powerful message of pure monotheism revealed by god throughout history.
islam is the one true religion, preached by all the messengers and
prophets of god, including adam, noah, abraham, moses and jesus - peace be upon them all.
with the revelation of the qur'an to god's final and greatest messenger muhammad(p), the pinnacle of this divinely revealed religion was reached, and the message of
god to mankind completed and perfected. embracing islam is the sole means to
fulfilling the purpose of our existence, which in turns leads to the attainment of true
inner peace and eternal salvation.
to provide the reader with an overview of
islamic beliefs, culture, and civilization, this section presents a
collection
of introductory material on pertinent topics. some common myths about
islam and muslims are also thoroughly debunked. core beliefs introduced in this section
are expanded upon in other sections of this site.
