"blessed be the god and father of our
                      lord jesus christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual
                      blessing in the heavenly places in christ, 4just
                      as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world,
                      that we should be holy and blameless before him. in love 5he
                      predestined us to adoption as sons through jesus christ to
                      himself, according to the kind intention of his will, 6to
                      the praise of the glory of his grace, which he freely
                      bestowed on us in the beloved,"
                       (eph. 1:3-6, nasb)







                     




                                  calvinism, also known as 
                            reformed theology, is a system of biblical 
                            interpretation that focuses on the supreme 
                            sovereignty of god, his majesty, his holiness, etc.  
                            it relates this to man's fallen, sinful nature.  
                            because of the great chasm between god and man and 
                            because of man's sinfulness, god must predestine 
                            people into salvation...or none would be saved.  
                            therefore, salvation is the work of god and we are 
                            the recipients of his gracious election.
     to god be the glory.
