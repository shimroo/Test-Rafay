bridal shower history: the bridal shower (aka bachelorette party) started as an alternative to the dowry. in the 1890's, friends and family put small gifts in parasols that were opened over the bride's head. years ago, as the story goes, there lived a young dutch girl who loved a young dutch miller. the miller was so generous to the poor that he could never save a fortune for himself.  more about the history of the bridal shower.
