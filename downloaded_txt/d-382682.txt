american.made.



now more than ever we believe in the quality and integrity of american-made goods. and we love making packs, especially the ones with cute puppy dog ears and piggy tails and the characters that are your personal favorites. so we did the only thing we could think of to keep the sewing machines humming and the packs coming your way…

we’ve gone micro. we’ve gone back to the sewing machine. we’ve brought it all in-house. literally. selling direct to consumers like you allows us to continue to produce little packrats accessories here in the usa and sell them to you with a little bit left over to pay for milo’s dog food and some college tuition. (oh, yeah, those “little packrats” that inspired our backpack-making venture grew up and want to be engineers.)

the stuffof life.



a burden or an opportunity

i always thought my twin boys were the original packrats. one day, while making my way through the trail of their scattered possessions, i realized they come from a long line of collectors. so, armed with a degree in art, countless years of sewing experience, and inspiration from two kids with bulging pockets, little packrats was born.

from the get-go, i have applied fashion-forward design to everyday backpacks, lunch totes and accessories. i love my business because it gives me a way to help others balance the burden of lugging life’s stuff around. it may sound philosophical, but it is practical. plus if i can do anything to make someone else’s day a little easier and a lot brighter, than i’ve really accomplished something that makes my mother and my kid’s grandmother proud.
