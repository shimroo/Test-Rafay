(note: plan before you register, $40 deposit is non refundable and once the class starts, no refund is available).  typically our classes are five weeks in length, meeting once a week for five consecutive weeks. please plan your training and work schedule accordingly so you don't miss a class as there are no make-up classes available. if you have a prolonged unforeseen incident or event, ie: accident, sickness, injured dog etc., we can make arrangements to move you to another class.  all our class prices are for the entire five week course. our intermediate obedience class is purchased in a block of  10 lessons for the price listed and must be used within six months. all puppy and beginner level classes must have a minimum of 6 dogs registered for class in order for them to take place. if you register for a class on our website, your charge receipt is your confirmation. no additional response or class reminders will be sent unless there is a problem. 			    if you have further questions, the quickest way to reach us is by email at info@trdogs.com.  voicemails will take longer. if you decide to register for a class, make sure to add our email address  to your address book so you don't miss important messages we may send you, such as class changes, cancellations due to weather, or other unforeseen issues. children under 12 years must be supervised by an adult not in training and must stay seated and observe the class.  our 14,000 square foot facility is available for event rental, too. it's heated, air conditioned and includes kitchen facilities. any type of training you need (except hunting dog training)--we've got you covered. we encourage you to stop by and tour our facilities! our schedule varies depending on classes in session, most are monday through thursday in the morning 9 to noon and then early evening 5 to 9 depending on the classes in session. puppy and beginner class may have an "off" week between finish of one and start of another.              total recall school for dogs        17285 forest blvd. north (hwy 61)        hugo, mn 55038        651-464-1799        email: info@trdogs.com       © 2012	    template by andreas viklund	    web design: wendy schuh
