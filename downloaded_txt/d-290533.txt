bill's banjos





welcome to

 


 
          
this website is dedicated to photos and 
descriptions of the many banjos in my collection, along with a few other vintage 
instruments i have picked up over the years.  i have authored this site in 
the hope that other collectors might follow suit and share photos and 
information on their banjos with others in the collecting community.  since my 
interest in banjos stems in part from my interest in the technological 
development of the instrument over the years, my collection spans the period 
from the 1840s to the 1920s.  as my collection evolves, banjos presented 
on the home page of this site may be removed and added to a "banjos 
i previously owned" page.  banjos in my current collection are listed 
alphabetically by 
manufacturer or brand name.  i have recently added a page on
fairbanks/vega engraved inlay evolution for 
those interested in how this particular art form developed over the years and 
through the transition from fairbanks to vega ownership. for those interested in the 
genealogy of banjo manufacturers, i have included a page summarizing some 
important relationships between manufacturers, but much better information is 
available elsewhere (see, for example, america's instrument, the banjo in the 
nineteenth century, by gura anad bollman, university of north carolina 
press, 1999).  for those interested in finding out more about
buying vintage banjos and other vintage stringed 
instruments, i have included a page on that as well.  i have also 
included a page on identifying 
unmarked banjos, for those who have an instrument of unknown origin.  
for those wondering where i put all of these instruments, i have added a page on
living with vintage instruments.  
this should be particularly helpful to those collectors trying to convince 
dubious spouses that they don't already have too many banjos.  finally, i have 
added a page dealing with

maintaining and restoring vintage banjos 
and other vintage stringed instruments.  also, click
here for an example of how one can go too far to 
restore a banjo. for questions and comments, please contact me (bill destler) at bill.destler"at"rit.edu.(substitute @ for "at").
