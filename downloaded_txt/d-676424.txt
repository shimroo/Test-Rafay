be happy!





today was my last day at pixar. it was so sad saying goodbye but so beautiful. all i felt today was love, nothing but beautiful, incredible love. nothing can ever replace the experience or the wonderful, beautiful talented people who i was so blessed and fortunate to work with there.  may you all be happy and do what you love and love what you do. as for me, i'm about to start a new adventure and it's going to be amazing:)
