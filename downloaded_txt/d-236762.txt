      "everybody told me it 
      was wrong" - 
      allan waters


this site is a tribute 
      to allan waters, the waters family and everyone who worked at 1050 chum as 
      a music station from 1957 until the music era ended in 2009.

      mr. waters (everyone called him mr. waters) bought chum in december of 
      1954 and on may 27, 1957 launched canada's first full-time rock and roll 
      radio station. on this site you'll find bios of chum personalities, plus 
      photos, airchecks, memorabilia and every chum chart (front/back/inside) in 
      pristine condition.

      a very special thanks to jim waters for his unwavering support of all 
      things chum. enjoy chumbugs!
