welcome back everyone!  weather update for nor cal ‚Äì raining.  february is typically our wettest month of the year.  it has been known to rain all 28 days of february.  while that won‚Äôt be the case this year, we are getting enough rain to cause flooding north of san francisco.  i am not sure why anyone ever moves up there, because it happens every rainy season.  i am sure it is gorgeous the rest of the year though.  enough about nor cal weather and lets check in on my stitchy projects for this past week.
