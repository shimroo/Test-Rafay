about us

vanishing species was founded in 1998 as an education program 
                    to inform children of all ages about the natural world around 
                    them. as word of our interactive, hands-on programs has spread, 
                    we have grown into a multifaceted organization serving the 
                    public in many ways: 






wildlife education outreach 
                            programs
wildlife sanctuary services
nuisance animal relocation
animal socialization
animal boarding
palmdale wildlife tours and more
community volunteer 
                            program




vanishing species serves as home to over 300 animals including 
                    tigers, lions, leopards, cougars, servals, bobcats, bears, 
                    wolves, alligators, snakes, monkeys, and more. please browse 
                    our website, help us if you can, and take our founding principle 
                    to heart:
"in the end we will all conserve only 
                    what we love,
                    love only what we understand, and we will
                    only understand what we are taught."
