 alyssa & chris 

superior was easy to work with, willing to answer all our questions and, most important, helped us save money.
read alyssa & chris's full testimonial

with the recent reduction in interest rates, we inquired to see if we could qualify for a better mortgage rate with superior. we applied online to inquire about refinancing and were contacted within a day by alisha at superior.
she provided us with plenty of information, answered all our questions and was great to work with. we qualified for a better interest rate which ultimately led to a reduction on our minimum principal and interest payment. this gave us the ability to reduce
    the time to pay off our mortgage by making the same monthly payment as we were with our previous lender. superior was easy to work with, willing to answer all our questions and, most important, helped us save money.

what members say about us





                    as first-time homebuyers, superior made it easy. we applied for or home loan online and heard back with our pre-approval within a couple of days! alisha reaman was super helpful and informative. she answered all of our questions and explained all the steps during our home buying process. we are extremely thankful for alisha and the rest of the superior staff, even more thankful for being chosen to receive the first-time homebuyers grant through superior! we highly recommend superior for first-time homebuyers!

                    a year ago, we refinanced our home with superior credit union and kelly dattilo. she was so incredibly helpful that when we recently bought a new home in tucson, az, we called her immediately to ask for 
   her help again! kelly is very knowledgeable and professional and we highly recommend her for any kind of mortgage assistance. she’s readily available and very patient when i have questions and makes sure 
     that i understand the answers which i really appreciate. again, we highly recommend her – she’s the best!!

                    kelly dattilo was absolutely amazing to work with. she went above and beyond trying to find what would work best for me. she was very open and honest, which as a first-time buyer made everything easier. you can tell she genuinely cares about those she is working with.

                    as a first-time homebuyer, i had the best experience with kelly dattilo at superior. her patience and kindness to explain all of the process and the different options made the entire experience seamless and exciting! the superiorfirst grant helped me so much throughout my process of homebuying and financing! i can’t thank kelly enough for helping me secure my first home with the advantage of using the first-time homebuyers grant!

                    without the superiorfirst grant funds and help of superior credit union, homeownership would not have been possible. the process from pre-approval to closing was very easy.

                    todd and the rest of the amazing superior staff made my vehicle purchase smooth and convenient for me. they truly went above and beyond to provide the most fantastic customer service, well past their closing hours so i could pick up my vehicle on time. i cannot thank them enough, from our personal accounts, business account, mortgage and now two auto loans - superior is our number one choice!
