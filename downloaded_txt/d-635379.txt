congratulations guy! mega electronics, inc. is about to enter year 11 of mana membership.manufacturers tell me that access to mana’s database of elite manufacturers’ representatives is a big reason that they belong to mana. a close runner up is mana’s member-only educational resources and agency sales magazine that helps hone their skills at thriving with a manufacturers’ representative sales force.but mana manufacturer members often tell me that neither of those are the most important reason they belong to mana. working successfully with manufacturers’ representatives is a mix of both art and science. managers who have mastered those skills join the ranks of a select, exclusive group who have earned the right to express their justifiable pride through membership in the world’s most prestigious association of manufacturers and representatives.
