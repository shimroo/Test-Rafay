 what our customers are saying 











reenascott 




              	good fit. excellent results.

bill




              	at 6'8" with a 37" inseam i'm not an easy person to find items that fit well. i used the fit recomendations option here and have been very pleased with the results. the compression is good, and they fit very well. at first i had issues with the top rolling over, but i found by not stretching the stocking and letting them sit just a little lower on my thing that has eliminated that issue.

darrell




              	the weave is different than earlier versions, they're easier to get on and off, yet give better compression.  i  love em!

steve e.




              	using the sizing/measurement chart, i ordered the size socks recommended.  the fit was perfect.  the socks do not fall and are very comfortable.  while i have been wearing compression socks for only a few weeks, i would definitely purchase these again.  this. rand was also recommended by my doctor as well.

meg




              	these socks are one of very few i've found that don't cut into my foot at the bend of my ankle.  they are also very comfortable and do not pinch at the top. the only problem is they started to pill a bit after a few wears, but that has happened with a lot of the socks i've tried.  i also really appreciate that discount surgical offers free returns. compression socks are so expensive, and since i've newly been prescribed them and don't know what fits yet, i really need the flexibility of free returns. other companies who charge for the return label or have a restocking fee have lost my business.

karen




              	first time using this vendor and they made it easy and enjoyable. i had some questions so called and actually got a person call me back within a few hours! it was easy to measure my legs, fill in the order form and received my order within a short period of time. the stockings fit perfectly and i have already ordered more.

nanic




              	since i will be needing to order arm sleeves over and over, it's a relief to know where to find them. also pleasant to have them arrive quickly.
