            novice
          










generally women just starting their hockey experience or interested in a slower, less competitive game.  players may not be able to skate backwards, have limited stick handling skills or be unable to raise the puck.  coaches are provided for each team to help players improve their game. women that are wach d players.teams will be drafted by the board and depending on registration, full season roster sizes will be 10-13 players to help curb teams not having enough players for playoffs. when subs are needed, the dwhl will do its best to fill benches to 13 players. 








            intermediate
          










more experienced skaters, ready for a faster, slightly more competitive game.  they typically understand positioning and basic plays but cannot always execute them. women that are high wach d or wach c players. teams will be drafted by the board and depending on registration, full season roster sizes will be 10-13 players to help curb teams not having enough players for playoffs. however, when subs are needed, the dwhl will only fill benches to 10 players. 








            advanced
          










most experienced skaters. everyone knows the game, are good skaters, have good stick-handling and shooting skills. these games are the fastest games of all three divisions. women that are wach a and b players. they often also play higher level coed teams.  new this summer! advanced players will have the opportunity to submit a pod of 5-7 players they want to play with and then the board will match pods together to build teams. goalies are both welcomed & encouraged in your pod of 5-7 players. however, a goalie is not required to be in your pod. pod directionseach pod is to select a pod captain that is to submit pod team member names to info@dwhl.org no later than may 20, 2024. this will allow us to build the teams appropriately and prevent rogue players from joining a pod. if you do not have a pod, you can register as a free agent and the board will ensure you are drafted to a team. depending on registration, full season roster sizes will be 10-13 players to help curb teams not having enough players for playoffs. however, when subs are needed, the dwhl will only fill benches to 10 players.the board is responsible for assigning registered subs to teams. in other words, you cannot invite another player to unofficially replace you should you have to miss a game.
