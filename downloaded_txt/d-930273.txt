hakea is starting off the new year by trying something a little new. we're writing some techno songs. dirty, hard, loud techno. taking a short detour from being introspective, and workingon perhaps shaking some asses out there.hope your year is filled with candy cane wishes and synthesizer dreams.

last night we played at seesound for the tuesday weekly event. it was the first show we've played in awhile. also, it consisted largely of new material...that we hadn't practiced much. it went well, and both of us decided that we were happy with the songs. however, we know what needs to be done with them now.we were offered some shows last night as well. jeffery from the climax golden twins is going to have us play at the wall of sound monthly, and obelus is going to have us come down to play with them in pdx in feb. different venues, which is always nice.we're going to be playing a show in dec at the lower level on 19th with skiks, bookmobile and son of rose. it should be a fantastic time.cameron (son of rose) has been tossing an idea around with us about locking ourselves in his studio space for a prolonged period of time to do some group recording. i hope this pans out. experimenting with various people on some musical endeavors sounds like a great thing right now. this weekend we'll be going up to bayside studios for a couple days to record grin and outbears. these will replace the current recordings of grin and inbears on our 4 song cd when we repress it soon.

[music
|sex with sun ra - coil - black antlers]tonight we will be playing our last show for awhile. it's time to dig back into the house and get the studio back and running. in the last couple months, a collection of iranian stringed instruments, a korg ms10, microphones, live 4.0 and an impressive collection of virtual instruments and effects have been placed in our hands...though, we haven't had a chance to use them to their full potential. we're very excited to get moving in new musical directions. last night we had a great rehearsal that included fine tuning some small transitions. i'm starting to think back to the days when i was heavily involved in theater, and how hours would be spent on the tiniest moments. next thing you know, hakea will be doing vocal warmups before their shows. so, tonight...scarykoala will be providing visuals. she did an amazing job on sunday at the lower level, and we're proud to have her take over the visual element. we're playing two sets. the first is our standard set we've been doing for awhile, while the 2nd is one very old reworked piece, and a brand new long and very intense track. we're hoping the volume will be maxed out as much as possible.tuesoct 26seesound loungewith segue115 blanchard st,10 pm-2 am,21+,free.
