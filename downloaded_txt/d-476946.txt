what our customers say











what an incredibly positive experience when dealing with heritage homes. the care that the team provide is excellent and they are always just a phone call away. the homes are immaculate and are of such an incredibly quality and finish. the plot and grounds are immaculate, considering the ongoing works on site, and such beautifully maintained access and visual appearance of the entire site. would highly recommend and heritage home.
d. doll | the green




after our first night at the bungalow, my wife woke up, walked around and said she couldn't quite believe it was now our home and that it felt more like a luxurious villa in the mediterranean. i think that pretty much sums up both of our feelings. well done heritage for delivering something pretty special.
martin and sarah | berkeley park




our new home is everything we could have hoped for and more. heritage made the whole experience a pleasure and we are loving our new home. 
sam and jo | the green




we moved into our house at the green in december. since then it has been a joy to get to know the site as work progresses and the season moves forward. and particularly in the past couple of weeks, as i am now recuperating after a hip replacement op and have to do a lot of walking. so i find myself appreciating the houses at different times of the day and in varying lighting. sunny days and blue skies seem of course the best, when the white walls are at high contrast with rich brick and wood and the architectural shapes stand out so well against the saturated sky. i rather feel that i am doing my prescribed walking in le corbusier's personal lego set! thanks for designing such super houses.
h. croad | the green




a short note to say how delighted i am to have bought this house, which has truly exceeded all my expectations. i had such confidence in the quality, that i did not attend a pre-handover inspection. my judgement was not incorrect. every detail is quite immaculate, down to the mastic and the turf. thank you once again for being a developer who really understands quality in its widest sense.
