     the focus of so 
				cal german shepherds is to produce quality puppies from multiple 
				generations of healthy parents that have the necessary 
				certifications for breeding. producing healthy, beautiful and 
				intelligent german shepherd puppies, with strong nerves and 
				courageous temperaments. our dogs do not just need 
				to meet the german standards of workability and conformation, 
				but also the american familyâs needs for a well-rounded 
				companion. the result of this breeding is a puppy which is 
				wonderful with the children, confident and stable when in 
				public, and ready to protect its family when at home.




     
				our gsds are not "just dogs"; they have shown and placed well in 
				both national and international german conformation shows, 
				including multiple times at the bszs world sieger show in 
				germany. however, they remain as participating members of our 
				family and enjoy trail riding with the horses, taking trips 
				to the beach, going camping and lounging in the living room. 
				from working with the live stock to standing out in the show 
				ring, our german shepherds are truly a versatile breed.
