how you can help






























































how does buf help the community?
for many years, buf was an alternative funding source for non-profits organizations that had little capacity to approach traditional funding sources. today, buf impacts the community through partnerships that serve underrepresented, underserved youth by exposing them to opportunities and improving their skills. through partnerships, buf has been able to expand and enhance services to those in the community most in need.
