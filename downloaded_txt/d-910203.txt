about the nabsr...

this registry is dedicated to the preservation of a 
       unique genetic resource - the
        barbados blackbelly hair sheep. the herdbook of the nabsr will 
       remain permanently open to any individual sheep which passes 
       inspection and has adequately demonstrated its ability to reproduce 
       in kind.

 

how can i join the organization?
the registry is open to any individual who wishes 
       to register their qualified blackbelly sheep. there are no dues and 
       no "membership" is required to register sheep. fees and 
       procedures for registration are detailed on these
        pages.

 

how can i obtain a listing of barbados 
       blackbelly breeders?

please check the breeder's
        listing here at this website; as it 
       is the most up-to-date listing the organization maintains. all 
       breeders with registered sheep may, at their option, have their name 
       added to this list.
 

 only
        breeders with registered stock who indicate a desire to be included 
       will be listed here. please let us 
       know if you find any listings are out-of-date.
