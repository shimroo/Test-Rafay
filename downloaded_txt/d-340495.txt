	 confusion over changing names
	 



the big clean-up : all those names changesby derek humphrysome years ago i was sitting in the high court of appeals in london listening to a euthanasia case. part of the evidence was that the man had paid a call at the office of the voluntary euthanasia society, in chelsea.  all he got there was information, certainly not assisted death.   the defendant's lawyer argued that surely this was not sufficient  this grounds  to support a conviction of his client? to which the judge replied:  "when i want fish, i go to a fish supplier.  when i want euthanasia i go to a euthanasia office. " the appeal was denied.this court cameo occurred to me when i surveyed all the name changes in the world right-to-die movement recently.    there is a rush to make their organization's names more palatable, more acceptable to politicians and governments.but is it doing any good?  in the last three years, the following have euphemized their names.   to what benefit remains to be seen. it has certainly confused a lot of the rank and file supporters of the 'right-to-die' movement.   i know from experience that it has caused many to abandon their memberships, although not their philosophy of choices in dying.1.   hemlock society usa changed  name to end-of-life choices.  (considered more palatable name.)2.   end-of-life choices changed name to compassion in dying (upon merger)3.   compassion in dying changed name to compasion and choices (to complete merger.)4. voluntary euthanasia society of victoria (australia) changed name to dying with dignity - victoria.5.  voluntary euthanasia society (london) changed name to dignity in dying.  (considered more acceptable name)6.  n v v e (netherlands) changed name to right to die nl (because euthanasia has been legalized)and now the re-named london group (dignity in dying) is getting protests from palliative care groups, and others (mostly opposed to euthanasia anyway) that because  the new name indicates the same compasionate philosophy as theirs, thus it could cause confusion among patients.   the protesters are asking the uk government not to allow the new name to be officially registered.most people don't even think about 'euthanasia' (a generic term for all hastened deaths) until they or a loved one has a life-threatening illness.   and now they must search around the lists of various organizations with 'dignity' in their titles and find out which is the one they feel they need to know about.   not, i think, a recipe for popularity.why not, as the old saw goes, 'call a spade a spade' ?------------derek humphry.  his opinion.     23 january 2006derek humphrywww.finalexit.orgwww.assistedsuicide.org

	 definitions of 'euthanasia'
	 



with so much talk about 'euthanasia' these days after the terri schiavo affair (march 2005), and the affirming decision of the us supreme court (january 2006) in the oregon physician-assisted suicide case, it seems time -- in the interests of mutual understanding -- to define the principal words being used. thus.............assisted suicide: helping a person to end his or her life by request in order to end suffering.. (rarely prosecuted and only lawful in switzerland where the reasons must be altruistic.)physician-assisted suicide:   medical doctor helping patient to die by prescribing a lethal overdose.  patient can chose whether to drink it.    (lawful only in oregon, switzerland, netherlands and belgium.)euthanasia:  a broad, generic term meaning 'help with a good death.'voluntary euthanasia:  death by lethal injection by doctor when requested by patient.  (only lawful in belgium and the netherlands for the terminally or hopelessly ill.)non-voluntary euthanasia:  using powerful drugs, doctor ends life of suffering, dying patient who is comatose.  illegal, but happens all the time, discreetly, in the interest of compassion.terminal sedation:  upon patient request, doctor puts patient  into deep sleep with medications, during which time the patient dies either of the underlying illness or starvation/dehydration.  widely practiced and generally accepted as ethical and lawful.mercy killing:   taking the life of another person in the belief that this is a compassionate act because the ill person is unable to do so.   unlawful.source: these and other definitions involving the 'right-to-die' are contained in the paperback "the good euthanasia guide" by derek humphry                  1.19.06derek humphrywww.finalexit.orgwww.assistedsuicide.org

	 legislation takes so long
	 



the view of the 'final exit network' usa :finally, after more than four years under assault, the supreme court upheld oregon’s physician assisted suicide law, rejecting attorney general john ashcroft’s use of the drug enforcement administration (dea) to conduct an assault on doctors who prescribe lethal doses to end the suffering of individuals who are terminally ill. the battle is far from over, however. this ruling merely preserves the status quo, and only in one state. and the stringent oregon law only applies only to individuals who have less than six months to live. since 1998 estimates are that slightly fewer than 250 individuals have found the peace and dignity they deserve under the oregon law. meanwhile, in the other 49 states, no such law exists. that’s why we formed final exit network. since final exit network’s launch in september, 2004, 28 individuals in many states have exercised their last human right © with the support of a network exit guide. right now, with the network’s help, at least 45 individuals are actively setting the stage for their own peaceful, dignified deaths. we support the valiant efforts of the oregon attorney general’s office defending this important law. we also applaud the efforts of our colleagues in the death-with-dignity movement to change the laws. however, we feel that legislative change will not come soon enough for the many people who need help now and in the interim! even if physician-aid-in-dying laws are passed in other states, will the justice department assault them as well? it is telling that new chief justice john roberts cast a dissenting vote in this 6 – 3 decision. if candidate alito is appointed to replace justice o’connor, would he vote to uphold or overturn this crucial right? we can’t afford to wait to find out. as derek humphry says, ‘until laws protect the right of every adult to a peaceful, dignified death, final exit network will be there to support those who need relief from their suffering today!’ted goodwinpresident, final exit network www.finalexitnetwork.org--

	 influence of court decision
	 



regardless that yesterday's us supreme court decision turned on a legal technicality  -- what court case doesn't? -- the positive oregon decision is very heartening to people who would like to see genuine, nonpartisan law reform everywhere on medical assisted suicide for the terminally and hopelessly ill competent adult.the next danger is that the bush regime will go to a congress whereit has power and gut the oregon law, at the same time banning physician-assisted suicide everywhere in america.  that will take a lot of undoing when the climate changes and the people are ready to enact compassionate laws on the right-to-die.thus we must do everything in our power to protect the ultimate civil liberty -- the right to choose to die.  let the evangelicals and the rest of the religious right die in whatever fashion theychoose, and the remainder  of us (60-70 percent) in ours.derek humphrywww.finalexit.orgwww.assistedsuicide.org

	 victory for common sense
	 



the us supreme court today (17 jan 06) upheld oregon's physician-assisted law which the bush government has been trying for years to repeal.justice anthony kennedy, writing for the majority, said the federal government does, indeed, have the authority to go after drug dealers and pass rules for health and safety.but oregon's law covers only extremely sick people -- those with incurable diseases, whom at least two doctors agree have six months or less to live and are of sound mind.{this is a victory for common sense and democracy.   after all,the citizens of oregon twice voted for the death with dignity act.derek humphrywww.finalexit.orgwww.assistedsuicide.org

	 versions of 'final exit'
	 



i am getting international inquiries currently as to which languages the book 'final exit' is now available.   when it was a national bestseller in l991-92 it appeared in 12 languages but today it is confined to three (all paperbacks):1.  english.  random house, "final exit new york. delta trade paperback. $15. title: "final exit: the practicalities of self-deliverance and assisted suicide for the dying"  isbn 0385336535.  (2002 3rd edition, with addendum 2005 available from ergo)2.  italian. eleuthera, milan.  title:  "eutanasia: uscita di sicurezza,istruzioni per l'uso"     isbn 8885861253.  (new edition 2005)3.  spanish.  tusquets, barcelona.  "el ultimo recurso: cuestiones practicas sobre autoliberacion y suicidio asistido para moribundos."   isbn 8472235009.these books may not be on all bookstore shelves, but they can be ordered from any bookstore in the world.  ergo is unable to sell directly to customers the italian and spanish editions.when 'final exit' appeared in a french translation as "exit final" it was immediately banned by government order, and remains so.   on its appearance in australia and new zealand in l992 it was immediately banned by the censorship boards in those countries.  but on appeal they relented and allowed it to be sold publicly.there is now a dvd video based on the book. dvd title, "final exit on dvd: the art of self-deliverance from a terminal illness"  us$20. from ergo store; not yet in bookstores.   isbn 9780976828303.derek humphrywww.finalexit.orgwww.assistedsuicide.org

	 our thoughts about dying
	 



*the number of people saying they have a living will has more than doubled, from just 12 percent in l990 to 29 percent today.*the public is deeply divided over legalizing physician-assisted suicide; 46 percent approve of laws permitting doctors to help patients to end their lives, while about as many are opposed (45 percent).*a solid majority of americans (60 percent) believe a person has a moral right to end their life if they are suffering great pain and have no hope of improvement.*nearly as many (53 percent) believe a person has a moral right to end their life if suffering from an incurable disease.source:pew research center survey, conducted nov 9-27, 2005, among 1,500 american adults.

	 the law and 'mercy killing'
	 



there can be understanding shown by judges in cases of 'mercy killing' as this case  from tasmania shows:a launceston [australia] nurse who tried to kill her mother and helped in the  suicide of her father is free after receiving a wholly suspended  sentence.catherine ann pryor, 42, had admitted helping her father kill  himself but had denied the charge of attempting to murder  her mother.  earlier this month the jury found her guilty of that  charge.in the criminal court, acting justice michael hill  said it was clear pryor had a caring relationship with her mother and was not  acting out of self-interest.pryor was sentenced to 18 months in jail  for the attempted murder and 12 months for the assisted suicide. both  sentences were wholly suspended.more info on this subject at www.finalexit.org
