	 why we need overrides
	 
    




on tuesday, january 20th, milton residents will
vote for the 7th time on a proposition 2 ½ override for its
operational budget. here is the history of prior votes.

 


vote date                   amount                   
yes vote                no vote


4/1/89--------------    
 $596,228-------------- 4415-----------------
3024


 


4/1/90-----------------$1,997,140--------------4112-----------------3836


 


6/12/95----------------- $260,000--------------3343-----------------
2852


----------------------------$1,113,219------------3152------------------3030


 


6/26/01-----------------$1,423,191-------------4237-----------------3002


----------------------------$721,019---------------5119-----------------2882


 


6/13/06-----------------$2,411,083-------------4768-----------------3712


 


6/8/09------------------$3,420,189--------------4546-----------------3948

 


as we approach election day, opponents of the override are
making the following arguments (arguments made whenever there is an override in
the offing). 


1.      
 why can’t
the town live within the 2 ½% increase in revenue it gets each year? after all,
the inflation rate is less than that.


2.      
why don’t we fix the spending problem?


3.      
 we
wouldn’t need overrides if it weren’t for the schools, which are top heavy and
weighted down with administration costs.


in addressing these arguments i will use data from the
massachusetts department of revenue for a list of towns comparable to milton.
for the selection criteria of comparable towns:


http://miltonview.blogspot.com/2009/02/comparable-communities-financial-data.html


 why can’t the town live with a 2 ½ % increase?


the short answer is because certain costs municipalities
incur rise faster than the inflation rate or the 2 1/2 % increase allowed under
proposition 2 1/2.


the government’s consumer price index measures the price
trend of a collection of goods and services purchased by households. municipal
costs such as health insurance, mandated costs of special education, and
certain capital goods rise substantially faster than a loaf of bread or a quart
of milk.


the state department of revenue tracks revenue increases by
community with a measure called municipal revenue growth factor. the state wide
average is currently around 4% per year. 
because the number can vary from year to year, i’ve computed a five year
average for the years 2011-2015. here’s what it shows for milton and the
comparable communities.


town--------------------------mrgf avg  annual % increase/2011-2015


 


needham------------------------------------4.54


 


westford-------------------------------------4.50


 


westborough-------------------------------4.49


 


hingham-------------------------------------3.80


 


walpole--------------------------------------3.63


 


sharon----------------------------------------3.50


 


westwood-----------------------------------3.46


 


belmont--------------------------------------3.27


 


north andover----------------------------- 3.24


 


holliston----------------------------------- --3.19


 


scituate---------------------------------------2.90


 


milton-----------------------------------------2.65


 


reading---------------------------------------2.61 


during this period there were no overrides and milton
ranked 12th out of 13 comparable communities in its annual revenue
growth. our growth rate was nearly one full percentage point below the group
average of 3.52%. over just a few years, this difference creates substantial
pressure on efforts to preserve the level of services we desire.


 


why don’t we fix
the spending problem? 


an interesting formulation that assumes its truthfulness.
does milton have a spending problem? or is our spending at exactly the level
town residents have selected on a number of occasions to preserve services they
find important?


i suppose one could assume past overrides have pushed us
into the category of high spending communities. let’s look at department of
revenue data for expenditures on a per capita basis for the comparable
communities.


 


town--------------------------------------------exp. per
capita 


 


westwood----------------------------------------$4544


 


westborough------------------------------------$4383


 


westford------------------------------------------$3889


 


needham------------------------------------------$3856


 


hingham-------------------------------------------$3640


 


holliston-------------------------------------------$3552


 


sharon---------------------------------------------$3521


 


scituate--------------------------------------------$3250


 


reading--------------------------------------------$3085


 


milton----------------------------------------------$3053


 


belmont--------------------------------------------$3000


 


walpole--------------------------------------------$2980


 


north
andover-----------------------------------$2471  


this is 2014 data. milton ranks 10th out of 13
towns.  the comparable group average is
$3479 per capita, or $426 per capita higher than milton’s expenditures. in
order to reach the group average, milton would have to increase spending by
$11,502,000.


milton does not have a spending problem. we have a
systemic revenue problem that can only be addressed through periodic overrides.
 


schools cause
overrides and have high administrative costs. 


overrides occur because the warrant committee, the town
meeting and the board of selectmen conclude that slow revenue growth will
result in a substantial loss of services for the town, and that the voters
should be given the opportunity to weigh in on the matter.


overrides involve all town departments, not just the
schools. this year, more than 50% of the revenue from a successful override
will go to non-school departments.


on the charge about administrative costs, here is
department of education data for the group of comparable towns.
 


town--------------------------------------------admin
costs/pupil


 


needham---------------------------------------------$660


 


scituate-----------------------------------------------$625


 


westwood--------------------------------------------$493


 


sharon-----------------------------------------------$463


 


milton-----------------------------------------------$461


 


holliston--------------------------------------------$373


 


belmont---------------------------------------------$354


 


westborough---------------------------------------$346


 


reading---------------------------------------------$346


 


north andover------------------------------------ $335


 


hingham--------------------------------------------$327


 


walpole---------------------------------------------$321


 


westford--------------------------------------------$307


 


milton ranks 5th
out of 13 towns and spends slightly more than the group average of $416 per
pupil on administrative costs. the state-wide average is $500 per pupil.  

 


surviving for 8
years without an override is an under-appreciated accomplishment, and credit
goes to town leadership.

 


-         
shortly after the last override, the town treasurer was
able to collect over $1 million of unpaid real estate taxes, easing financial
pressure for a year


-         
the town adopted a local option meals tax that today
produces just under $200,000 in annual revenue, much of it from non-milton
residents


-         
 some years ago town
unions agreed to increase their share of health insurance costs by 5 percentage
points, saving the town hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in costs


-         
a labor contract spearheaded by then school committee
chair mike zullas and adopted by all town unions in 2016 further increased the
share of insurance payments by town employers, saving additional hundreds of
thousands of dollars per year.

-         
 


of course, in
addition to this, positions have been cut over the 8 years, or vacant positions
have been left vacant because of lack of money. 
some of these will be restored or filled if the override passes, and
substantial new cuts in service that would otherwise occur will be avoided with
a successful override. if you value the services of a top notch community, you
should support the override on tuesday, june 20th.

support a five member board of selectmen

 

tuesday is election day. 
in addition to the races for various offices, there is a ballot question
which requires your attention.


it appears at the bottom of the ballot and is called
question 1. it asks whether you support an increase in the size of the board of
selectmen from 3 members to 5 members. the recommendation for this change came
from the town government study committee, of which i’m a member.   it was supported at the time by the board of
selectmen and passed rather handily at town meeting. 


the town government study committee (tgsc) spent over a year
studying this issue after the massachusetts department of revenue recommended
it in a fiscal management review published in september of 2013.


fellow tgsc member leroy walker and i led the research
effort to provide the entire committee with the information necessary for
informed discussion and decision making. phase i involved talking with former
milton selectmen and selectmen in other communities similar to milton. a
variety of views were expressed, but it became apparent that merely tapping the
experience of people who had only real world experience in one type of board
would not provide us with the best comparison of 3 and 5 member boards.


phase ii of the research attempted to target this concern
by:


        focusing
on communities who had made the switch from a 3 to a 5 member board


        further
narrowing the target to communities who switched recently (last ten years)


by talking to towns who had made the switch recently we could
expect to find strong institutional memory about why the size of the board was
increased; how the change was implemented; and how the results of the change
lived up to expectations.  we identified
a number of such towns with the help of the massachusetts municipal association
and conducted extensive conversations with them. the results revealed very
strong support of the switch with a number of benefits for those communities.


 


•     
better distribution of selectmen workload – a
larger number of selectmen allows for greater opportunity to assign
executive-level work (long-term planning, policy development, oversight of
implementation of policies, programs, initiatives and organization structure
changes). this should also allow for more work to be completed and faster
decision-making in a shorter amount of time.


•     
better selectmen accessibility (for
residents) – should allow for residents to have greater success
in reaching a selectmen more quickly with issues of concern or feedback on
pending matters.


•     
greater efficiency/opportunity for offline
discussions between selectmen – the resolution of many of the
executive-level decisions that selectmen are asked to make requires significant
analysis and discussion. allowing some of this analysis and discussion to be
completed and discussed by two selectmen between meetings could produce more
efficient and effective decision-making and increase the likelihood of more
quickly achieving consensus.


•     
more flexibility/opportunity for selectmen
subcommittees – a larger number of selectmen would allow for the
organization of two- person subcommittees. such subcommittees could work in
between regular selectmen meetings to organize, delegate and complete required
work. 


•     
ease of operation on
difficult/controversial issues – bringing a larger number of
selectmen perspectives to bear on difficult or controversial issues increases
the likelihood that at least three members could agree and successfully address
such issues.


•     
broader diversity of views/skill sets –
increasing the number of selectmen also increases the likelihood that there
would be a greater number of perspectives on any given issue. 


 


phase iii of the research looked at the distribution of board
sizes state-wide overall and by population size.


there are 298 communities with a town meeting and a board of
selectmen. overall they are fairly evenly split between 3 and 5 member boards.


·       
157 (53%) have 3 member boards


·       
140 (47%) have 5 member boards


·       
1 town has a 7 member board (wakefield)


 when you look at the split by population size however, you
discover that 3 member boards are overwhelmingly a small town phenomenon.





for communities with populations over 20,000, only 11% still
employ a 3 member board.  including
milton, that is 5 communities of this size out of 44 total communities.


this
overwhelming propensity for towns with larger populations (20,000+), larger
budgets and greater complexity to have 5 member bos is undoubtedly what led the
massachusetts department of revenue to recommend:


“…expanding
resident representation on the board of selectmen by increasing its membership
from three to five. the current three-member board is conducive to small town
governance in which the selectmen play a stronger role in daily municipal
affairs. in a town with a population over 27,000, a budget approaching $98
million, and a wide range of town administrative functions, the role of the
selectmen shifts. an expanded number of selectmen creates greater oversight of
the town administrator position and broadens resident representation on the board.
the board will therefore have greater capacity to explore issues by allocating
responsibilities to more members and decisions will be more thorough because
two additional perspectives are present. also, because winning a majority of
three, versus two votes, is more difficult, the prospects increase for greater
collaboration; and with no more than two members elected each year, the board
will experience greater stability and continuity. one possible downside is that
meetings could be longer.” 


the following
tgsc’s conclusions were presented to the town meeting.


1.     
the tgsc research indicates significant differences in
terms of the advantages offered by a five-member board of selectmen vs. a
three-member board of selectmen.


2.     
the management challenges for the bos presented by a
$100 million town budget are dramatically greater than when the budget was a
quarter or half that size.


3.     
the five-member board model offers many more advantages
and fewer disadvantages and is the best model for milton and the
recently-approved strong town administrator model.


4.     
it also represents a more appropriate size for a “board
of directors” overseeing a day to day executive of the town. 


during conversations with the chairmen of the board of
selectmen from sudbury, he put it more directly.


more brains


more educational backgrounds


more work capacity


more areas of expertise and
skillsets


more perspectives on problems


more representation for citizens.


what’s not to like!


i hope you’ll support question 1 on tuesday.  just as milton residents agreed decades ago
to switch from an open town meeting to a representative town meeting, we must
once again adapt to ensure that the town meeting form of government continues to
serve the needs of our town.

	 an advocate for milton
	 
    




tomorrow is primary election day. 


for the first time in 18 years milton will have a new
representative in the massachusetts house. the opportunity created a large
field of candidates – five from milton and two from randolph.


despite the large number of candidates, i think one
candidate stands apart from the others – based on his experience,
accomplishments and the key issues he’s chosen to focus on. and that candidate
is mike zullas.


experience


·        
mike is the only milton candidate who has spent
most of the past decade working for town government


·        
he is the only milton candidate to be elected
and serve in a town-wide position


·        
he is the only milton candidate to serve a three
year term on the warrant committee


so mike understands what the key issues are for milton, both
from listening to voters going door to door in two campaigns now, and in
serving in both elected and appointed office; he knows how our children are
being educated and what the state could do to help communities in this very
important task; and he understands municipal finance, specifically milton finance.


accomplishments


·        
on the school committee he worked with other
members to provide funds for “advancement budgets” to target the closing of
achievement gaps, improve early childhood literacy and raise student outcomes
in stem. the investments have shown progress.


·        
as chairman of the school committee he lead
negotiations with the milton teachers union. the result was a win/win, with the
town agreeing to not change the health plans and the teachers agreeing to pay a
larger share of their premiums. this compromise was taken to the selectmen who
proposed it to the town’s non-school unions and it was accepted. the savings to
milton will be over $250,000 in annual health insurance costs beginning in year
three.


·        
as chairmen of the town/schools consolidation
committee mike lead the committee to three important recommendations (1) the
town should institute a paperless payroll system, and convert to a bi-weekly
pay period. this creates modest savings in dollars, and significantly increases
the efficiency of all the employees involved in this process.  the town has implemented this.  (2) the committee recommended that the town
purchase new financial software to permit electronic purchasing orders and
superior functionality in areas of budgeting and financial forecasting. the
town agreed and the first half has been purchased. (3) the committee
recommended the creation of a chief procurement officer to ensure the town was
getting the best pricing on millions of dollars of purchases, and to ensure
compliance with state purchasing laws. 


·        
as both a member of the warrant committee and
the school committee, mike played an important role in preserving crucial
services throughout the town for the last seven years without the need for an
override.


key issues


·        
mike was raised in brockton and attended their
public schools. he went to a fine liberal arts college and then to law school.
he believes that education remains the great leveler when it comes to providing
all children equal opportunity. he will focus on educational issues like early
childhood literacy and funding for chapter 70, as well as more equity in the
chapter 70 formula which today penalizes communities like randolph


·        
mike’s father was a police officer, and later a
detective for the massachusetts state police. 
he understands that without adequate public safety, it is very difficult
for a community to accomplish all its other goals. 


i suppose there are many reasons people can use to select a
candidate. but if you think experience, competence, proven ability and a focus
on the right issues are important, than mike zullas is the best advocate for
milton
