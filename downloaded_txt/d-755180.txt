endorsement by dr. bill rees



"we live in the post-truth era, an unstable historical interlude in which facts about the human predicament give way to happy-clappy fictions springing from giddy emotion, gossamer beliefs and mass delusion, all born aloft on fairy dust. the solid truth is that our system is broken; the machinations of growth-addicted industrial capitalism have propelled humanity into a state of ecological overshoot. there are too many people consuming and polluting too much. humans are shredding the biophysical basis of their own existence and extinguishing thousands of other species in the process. those seeking a solid understanding of the innate and social behaviors that perpetuate this crisis of excess, and the science needed to fashion a life-affirming alternative, could do no better than subscribe to the work of the good folks at population balance." - dr. william e. rees, professor emeritus, university of british columbia and originator of the ecological footprint concept
