our research focuses on the role of sensing and mechanical design in motor control, 
		in both robots and humans. this work draws upon diverse disciplines, including biomechanics, 
		systems analysis, and neurophysiology. the main approach is experimental, although analysis and simulation 
		play important parts. in conjunction with industrial partners, we are developing applications of this research 
		in biomedical instrumentation, teleoperated robots, and intelligent sensors.
