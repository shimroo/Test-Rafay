spot-on sundials
 - contemporary, 
              scientifically accurate* sundials













 the original brass spot-on 
        sundial was designed by piers nicholson and introduced to the market in 
        2001. since then, many customers all over the world have bought them as 
        presents for big occasions or simply for their own pleasure. 

the brass horizontal spot-on 
        sundials are made in 3 different sizes, either on square baseplates measuring 
        17, 27 or 34 cms., or on round baseplates measuring 15, 25 or 32 cm. diameter. 
        

 the main feature of the spot-on 
        sundial is the divided gnomon* constructed of two parallel plates with 
        a small air gap. this permits a ray of sunshine to pass through for a 
        few minutes at solar noon.

we offer you the option to 
        make your sundial completely personal by having your own message engraved 
        on the side of the gnomon.

*the spot-on sundial can 
        be read to within a minute or two 
        (it is marked in 5 minute intervals). unlike many sundials, the spot-on 
        sundial is scientifically accurate and, if set up accurately, will display 
        true time with complete accuracy - see explanation below centre.
spot-on-sundials is now divided 
        nto two separate unconected businesses: brass sundials are sold by ethan 
        reeve sundials of  5 crusoe mews, london n16 0bq and can be ordered here 
         stainless steel sundials are sold by piers nicholson sundials  and can 
        be ordered here

what makes us special

 
the big innovation with spot-on 
        sundials is the slit in the gnomon (which casts the shadow) when the sun 
        is at its highest, a shaft of sunlight shines through this slit and across 
        the noon circle on the dialplate. this enables you, the customer, to set 
        up the sundial with great accuracy so that you can read it to the nearest 
        minute or two.

the spot-on sundial combines 
        modern functional design with unrivalled accuracy. 

we offer multiple models and 
        sizes of the spot-on sundial to suit all situations from small urban gardens 
        to large open spaces and public areas.

all models can have an engraved 
        message on the side of the gnomon to give a unique gift for an anniversary, 
        birthday, wedding, or special event.

 




custom-made stainless steel 
        spot-on sundials 

an interesting dial which gives 
        excellent reflections in the mirror-finished stainless steel, and, with 
        the contrasting matt circle on which the hour lines are shown, gives the 
        appearance of "floating on air" 

these stainless steel dials 
        are individually designed for their precise location and incorporate engraving 
        text, logos, or drawings agreed with the client.

stainless steel spot-on sundials 
        incorporate the "line of light" feature shown in the picture (left); this 
        enables them to be set up with great accuracy. they also give interesting 
        reflections of trees, clouds and buildings. the surface is mirror-polished 
        apart from the shot-blasted matt circle which gives a strong shadow for 
        the hour lines.

the custom-made dials (24 cm. 
        and larger) are individually designed for the exact latitude of their 
        location, and the engraving can be simple or elaborate to suit the needs 
        of the customer.

 the brass polar sundial (right) 
        is so-called because the dial plate is in the same plane as the gnomon, 
        which points to true north on the earth, and the north celestial pole 
        in the sky. this dial is a domestic version of the much larger tylers 
        and bricklayers millennium sundial near the millennium footbridge in central 
        london.

  

 the shadow of the oxhead gnomon 
        in the middle just skims the left-hand upright at 6 in the morning, and 
        then advances as a paralllel line along the dial plate. at noon, the shadow 
        is immediately under the gnomon and the line of light appears, as shown 
        in the picture. the shadow continues across the right hand side of the 
        dialplate and finishes on the edge of the right-hand upright at 6 pm




 


the sundial that can travel 
        the world with you!

our new universal polar sundial 
        is adjustable, and so can be set exactly for any latitude between the 
        equator and the arctic circle. and, if you move house, you can just reset 
        it to your new latitude! 

the universal polar sundial 
        is available in two models, one with a large baseplate which can be engraved 
        with a substantial message, and the other with a small baseplate. it will 
        shortly be available in a southern hemisphre version with the hours increasing 
        from right to left.

the universal polar sundials 
        also feature the split gnomon, which gives the line of light shown in 
        the right hand picture

note from the designer

people often ask what is so special 
      about the spot-on sundial and how it came to be designed. if you too are 
      interested in this, here is the full story!




setting up

detailed instructions are provided 
        for brass and stainless 
        steel sundials, advanced set up for super 
        accuracy, indoor set up.
 
the spot-on sundial is easy 
        to read

the shadow of the top slanting 
        edge of the gnomon travels round the sundial in a clockwise direction 
        (for our northern hemisphere models). this shows the shadow falling exactly 
        on an hour line . the time is 8 am winter time (indicated by the viii 
        roman numerals) or 9 am in summer time/daylight saving time, more...

choosing the correct model 
        for your location 

horizontal sundials need to 
        have the angle between the gnomon (which casts the shadow) and the dialplate 
        appropriate to the latitude where they are to be used. the original 17 
        cm. square spot-on sundial is made in seven models suitable for most of 
        the northern hemisphere, and there is also one southern hemisphere model 
        - use this page to help you decided which is 
        the correct model for you. if you want the gnomon angle to be exactly 
        right for your latitude, you can use our advanced 
        setup, but this is not necessary for most practical purposes unless 
        you can be certain that the base is accurately horizontal to better than 
        a half of one degree.
        three of our larger models (two in stainless steel and one in brass) are 
        custom-made for the latitude where they will be placed.
