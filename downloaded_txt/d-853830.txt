hello

october 1, 2022 - if you want to read and experience my 4 trips to salem, mass, here's the link! of course, all blogs start with the most current day so if you can get to the first page, that would work. i still have one more page to add at the end and i will get it up in a few days. all the photos were taken by me and all the craziness was accidentally caused by me! my experiences and photos should make for a wonderful halloween celebration if you can't go to salem this year. talk soon. janet 
my salem happenings blog 
april 7, 2019 - well, this one is quite unsettling! i saw something that at first glance quite frightened me. i am not easily frightened as you all know, after all i am the creator of all the madness seen and heard here at halloween's unseen, but this photo taken in a haunted cemetery in texas? shocking at first glance! is it an illusion? you be the judge and let me know what you think. 

 
march 26, 2019 - good evening, dear dark ones! i have news that i think will please you. firstly, i have seen that all my loyal ones from around the world are still visiting my crypt and this thrills me more than you can know! i am so grateful to each and everyone of you! i am now finding myself with a lot of time on my hands just like i used to have in our halloween's unseen early days. do you remember those days? i was updating and thinking about this site 24 hours a day. my creativity was over the moon and i was loving it! but alas, the pursuit of money to live took over my life for many years and my poor halloween's unseen was sorely neglected. i did, however, continue to make my payments to keep this site living. it was important to me no matter how little attention i could pay to it. i knew halloween's unseen was always there and i knew my loyal compatriots would be there too. so i have kept the crypt open for all to see and enjoy all these years. oh, i was here, somebody was paying for it! and now i get such a thrill thinking of those days so long ago! well, now they're back! i have so many ideas swimming around in my mind for the site. i promise not to change it's look. that is such an important thing with this site i think. i will be adding to the navigation but it won't change the look. you will just see some changes here and there like new text navigation. the old will stay and the new will look better and that is all. i will be adding a new section that will showcase my salem, massachusetts blog and all that went on there. the photos i took are wonderful and i know you will love them and, of course, my dark humor! ok, i'm out but please keep checking back. i am starting a mailing list so that i can notify everyone when there is an update or news. please drop me an email and let me know that you would like to be added to the mailing list. i will love you for it! i can't do it all without you! you can contact me here at janet@halloweensunseen.com. now i got to go warm up my html. halloween's unseen was written in the old days (1998) but i will remedy that and fix only what is broken! love you each and every one, janet 

we miss you scott sanders and you will always be with us! this site is dedicated to your memory. we love you!
march 31, 2018 - i have an update! hello to all my monsters! long time, no scare! so here's how it goes. i went to new york about 6 months ago and oh my god, i love that city. my purpose was to stay as close as i could to the dakota where our john lennon lived. it truly is a beautiful building and i've taken so many photos (which is always my purpose when i travel). but here's the reason i'm here right now. in my travels around the internet, i found the video below. remember the good ol' orbs that grace so many of the pages here, well, look at the fantastic orbs that showed up in a photo! that is right where john lennon crossed over. i just can't bring myself to say the "d" word. i am going back to new york next week and i hope (and pray) that i can be so lucky! i'll meet you at heaven's gate, love janet. 
 
february 7, 2017 - brace yourselves, creepies! halloween's unseen is coming back from the dead! stay spooky-tooned! oh, by the way, this is a photo i took of stephen king in spooky new orleans, louisiana. we had a fine time we did! 

 
june 28, 2016 - hello freakies! i'm actually beginning some work here finally. i noticed an issue with the music i have on each page. as you know, halloween's unseen is an old web site and in order for it to scare you, old tools are required. if you make windows media player your default player while you are here, you will be able to hear the ghastly music i have selected for each page. as you know, halloween's unseen without music is a very unpleasant event indeed. so please make sure you are hearing all that can be heard! halloween's unseen is just not halloween's unseen without the creepy sounds! it will scare you, guaranteed! luvs, janet 
october 4, 2012 - well we've done it, creepsters .... over 3 million hits! halloween's unseen has had 3,064,173 hits and counting! happy halloween to all my halloween's unseen patriots! 
update june 24, 2012!! - yes, you've seen that right, i've done an update! it's about the lovely, haunted ashton villa in galveston, texas. here's the link: ashton villa 
june 24, 2012 - halloween's unseen has officially had 2,970,552 hits as of today! oh my gawd dear ones, that means that 2,970,552 of you have stopped by my crypt for a visit! i shall wake up the dead, this calls for a celebration! we've almost hit 3 million!!! thank you, thank you! love to you all, janet 
october 31, 2011 - boo! screeeeeech! happy halloween from janet and halloween's unseen! 
october 12, 2011 - oh, and before i fly away, as i suppose you all know, i love shopping for halloween costumes and such and i've found a really cool spooky shop that i'd like y'all to check out at halloween costumes and halloween costume. just follow the banner below to: 
 
october 12, 2011 - well, i seem to have done it again. i knew there was something about october 12 and i was yet again compelled to write on my dear halloween's unseen. when i got home and checked my celebrity death calendar, there it was! one of our favorite residents in the crypt died on october 12, 1978. do you know who it was? well, i'll tell you. it was nancy spungen who died on this day having been stabbed to death and later found in the bathroom by her better half, sid vicious. how sweet that they have gone on to punk rock heaven! doesn't that make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside? okay, i'll stop. hey, happy halloween, freakies! you thought i forgot didn't you? ha! it's halloween for me all the year through so i'm always prepared! but do have a lovely halloween season, dear ones, and i love you all! janet 
august 29, 2011 - okay, do not fricking freak, i've done a small update on one of our finest members of the celebrity morgue - gg allin! and no, i did not realize that today would have been his 55th birthday. wow, i get kind of nervous when i do that! and, a little off topic, since i've not been here in a while, how the hell is everybody? well, i'm still here and i still love you all to death! and you'll find the link to gg below, just follow the foul odor! janet 
october 27, 2009 - well would you look at that! it's 3 days until halloween, kiddies! and i, your very excited web witch, am on my way to salem, massachusetts first thing in the morning. i have so looked forward to this trip and the time is finally here! and yes, i will be spending my halloween in salem attending the annual halloween ball at the ever haunted hawthorne hotel - my home away from home. i have so many things planned and i have included each one of you in my activities! i will be blogging from salem each evening keeping each of you up to date on my days and nights in salem. i, of course, will have complete coverage of the salem witch trials filming from the very locations that this tragedy took place. i will be attending spooky night ghost and cemetery tours so be prepared for that! and i will attend a very scary tour in boston consisting of a cemetery tour and ending with a visit to a real haunted house! this one is a trolley tour as well so i'll get to see the scariest parts of boston up close and personal! i even heard whisperings about the boston strangler. holy crap creepies, hold onto yourselves! so, my dear ones, please check in on halloween's unseen each evening as i share my passion for anything spooky with each of you! happy halloween! janet 
october 20, 2009 - well alrighty then, leave it to our so-called "guest of honor" to be late arriving at the morgue. but don't fret, creepies, he has arrived and is getting all tucked in as we speak! just between you and me, i really don't like this guy but his story just screams to be included in our morgue and so it is. the funny thing is that no one in the morgue wants to bunk with him and i can see why! i had to find a little space in the lower level all to himself. that should calm things down a bit. hee! there is a caution with this one! beware dear sensitive ones or those that are young and undeveloped. this dude is triple xxx rated as reflected by the content i have included! you have been warned and i'm not kidding! now trot your little spooky asses on down to the links in the middle of this page and it's the first link. i know, i promise i'll get the links brought up more to the top. yes, i know it's a pain but do it for me, okay? luv ya and happy halloween! janet

november 3, 2008 - only 361 days left until halloween!!!!! well, shit. anyway, i know i'm a couple of days late, but happy halloween! i hope everyone's halloween was frighteningly fiendish! i know mine was! i've been so busy putting up all my new things. it's mainly in the cemetery pictures, cemetery flowers, miscellaneous and, well, just everywhere! i've added a few new pages to my collection of halloween graves as well. it's all there, just browse around. everything will be so much easier to find once i get the blog operational. it will be ready sooner than you think! i'm just so happy to have new stuff for everyone to look at. i am loving my new camera so be prepared because i'll be digging up lots of wonderous stuff for you to look at. and too, my ghost tracker has written to me wanting to know why i'm not sending pictures to him. ya just got to love him! i'm so glad he's back with me. i'm rather proud of him myself because he works with the taps guys and i am so impressed with taps. i love watching their investigations, especially the sharon tate investigation at david oman's house which is just a hop, skip and jump from where the tate murders happened. bet you sleep real well in that house! anyway, moving on. i've done something a little different this year and i'm sure you will like it. i roamed around the streets of downtown houston on halloween looking for, well, halloween! the layout turned out pretty well i think. it's such a treat for trick or treat! oh and just one more thing! i've about got sid vicious and his girlfriend, nancy spungen, all moved into the morgue. these two will drive you buggy with all their complaints but we still love them right? i'll just be glad to get them settled so that i can get on with my life! sid, dude, remember you are dead! he just wants everything to be just so!!!! it ain't my fault there's rats and bats living in the morgue! it's a frickin' morgue! anyway, must run now. wish me a happy birthday! tomorrow is my birthday. crapola! see, you never knew i could speak spanish! ok, i'm done. here's the link to my houston halloween crawl for 2008 and there's more links below! luvs and birthday cake and pretty expensive presents, janet 
houston halloween crawl 2008 

 
october 27, 2008 - lookie where i've been creepsters! it is halloween week and i will be bombarding you with all my new halloween cemetery photos that i took this weekend. they turned out so well and should help you celebrate this wonderous season. the photo that you see is but a small taste of what i found at the creepy old cemetery i visited. seems odd to decorate a child's grave with a rat and spiders but there you see it. and now, dear dark ones, i must return to my crypt. i have much work to do to make your halloween festive! luvs and spooky toys! janet 
october 4, 2008 - yeeeee hawwwwwww, creepies, it's october! it is our time to howl! i do hope everyone is as gleeful as i that it's finally that time of year. and yes, i have been working in my crypt and i've got kurt cobain all tucked in, poor thing. he's now all comfy cozy and loves his place here in our celebrity morgue. we are getting quite a long line of celebrities wishing access to the morgue and i'm working my fingers to the bones trying to get them all in. but get them in i will! i want to take a moment to thank all of you, my halloween's unseen cohorts, who have written to me, sent me photos, joined my myspace craziness and just in general been there for me. life is all askew isn't it? i have no family to speak of now and i should be making tons of money off the "ghost thing" but someone who shall remain nameless (brainless) is an idiot. anyway, moving on. halloween's unseen is not a place to air my losses or is it? anyhoo, next!? i'm flying off to stir up some more shit in the morgue. sid vicious keeps bothering me to get in so i guess i'll move him ahead of keith moon and brian jones. yeah, ok, i know, the british invasion of the dead. so what of it?! anyway, off i am and don't forget to visit kurt. you can find him in the links below! luvies, janet 
july 12, 2008 - oh my gawd! i found this video at you tube and it scared the crap out of me and that's hard to do! the music is bad enough; the music would scare me all by itself but the video! this poor soccer player! they are saying that he was killed by the angel of death right there on the field. i don't know about you, but i've never seen someone contort like this guy for no reason. if you watch him closely at the beginning, it appears that something just knocks him off his feet as soon as he gets up and he seems to be trying to fight something off. one of the articles says that he had been having trouble during the game trying to fight this thing off and of course, you can't see it because it's invisible. anyway, here's the video. it's titled "saudi arabian soccer player killed by angel of death." don't plan on sleeping tonight! luvies and sweet dreams, janet 
 
october 31, 2007 - happy halloween sweet ones! halloween has finally arrived. just flying by to wish you a hauntingly haunting halloween! i am busy playing with my spooky toys and i'll have up my enchanting halloween grave photos in a bit. these photos are from both this year and 2006! i've a lot to show you so find a cozy spot in my crypt and ponder my latest collection. these photos will touch you as they did me. these families and friends who decorate these graves are most loving of their dear ones and i'm proud to display the photos here. and a special surprise for halloween, i'm putting up my new orleans layout as well! oh ghostly rapture! so, keep checking the links below for your latest halloween offerings! love to you all on our special day! janet 
october 28, 2007 - okay, freddie mercury has joined the celebrity morgue and what a thrill this is! it was a long time coming believe me. it took me literally weeks to write up freddie mercury and now he has taken his rightful place in our morgue. also, i updated jayne mansfield's page with a fab video about her death and her mortician speaks. amen! just fly on down to the links for all the fun! luvs and another one bites the dust! janet 
october 27, 2007 - on my way to our halloween's unseen creepy crawl 2007! back soon with my lovely photos! happy halloween sweet ones! 
october 4, 2007 - hello luvies! it is your ghost goddess coming to you to begin our october festivities here at halloween's unseen. i think a good place to start is with my latest ghostly capture of my dear unseen friend who seems to follow me wherever i happen to venture. this latest event occurs here where i now reside up on the 22nd floor of this midtown high rise apartment building. it is beautiful up here, especially at night! and my ghostly friend, apparently undaunted by the height up here, has made another appearance yet again! as those of you who know me, you are familiar with my unseen friend who appears in pictures of my bedroom and in any hotel that i might be visiting, alas, any where i am sleeping. well, here it is again in my new bedroom. love this! have a happy halloween season and keep a vigil here as i add new updates to entertain you or perchance, even frighten you! luvs and and the ghost that loves me, janet 

 
june 23, 2007 - meet my newest little angel! this lovely child has appeared to lead you to more of my eerie and heartfelt updates here at my halloween's unseen world. the little angel is just one of my many finds! the links to the updates will be placed below. welcome to my crypt! luvies and the littlest of angels, janet 

 
october 31, 2006 - happy halloween! it's just past midnight as i write this and it is halloween. i do hope everyone will have a lovely halloween day and an even better halloween night! i just wanted to write a small note to announce that i will be extending the halloween season this year. yes, i am that powerful! i will not let the season end until i get all my updates to all of you, my dear angels! i have many photos that i have taken of halloween graves and i so want you to see them! i went on 2 different days and still could not get them all! they are all wonderous and you will love them! they most certainly will touch your heart and a few may even give you the creeps! i also have other photos that many of my loyals have sent and they must be seen also! and too, jason has taken some truly odd photos and you must see those as well! i guess you are asking right about now, why have i fallen so behind? i am in the process of moving and my computer with all my spooky toys is about 15 miles from where i am now! oh horrors! i hope to have the move complete this next weekend and i will get down to work and finally get my yearly halloween offering to all of you. so please, bear with me and do keep coming back. it will be worth the wait, i promise! luvs and whole-hearted spookfulness, janet 
october 20, 2006 - okay, freakies, i have a real treat ........ or trick waiting for you! this is a very strange update, a very strange update indeed! to me, these photos seem like a sort of surreal version of the blair witch legend. have all of you seen the blair witch? oh, how i love that movie! well, you must see it to appreciate this update ....... and be sure to turn up the volume! anyway, these photos are fabulous and chock full of trickery and so perfect for the halloween season! we don't know from where the photos came and who the lucky, or shall we say, possibly unlucky photographer might be but it looks like he or she might have met the same fate as the poor, poor students in the blair witch story. anyway, do proceed to the mystery link below and see the spooky photos that we know absolutely nothing about! is it a trick??? and a year later, the footage was found. happy halloween! janet 
october 13, 2006 - and the feeling's right! my first update for the halloween 2006 season and how apt that i have made it on friday the 13th in the midst of our halloween celebrations! this ghostly update is so amazing that i just had to do it first ahead all the others that are so patiently waiting in the crypt. this is quite wonderous and i believe you will love it as much as i. and for that extra special touch, my ghost whisperer has put his stamp of approval on this beautiful native american ghost. she is so lovely! ghost whisperer? did someone say ghost whisperer? well, the owners of the native american ghost have christened adam, my ghost tracker, as my official ghost whisperer and that is as it should be. he will be my ghost whisperer from now until forever and i am so thrilled with that turn of events. but please do carry on and go see our beautiful native american ghost in all her glory by following the link below. and bless her for joining us during this holiday season! luvs and feathers and lace and a blanket or two, janet 
july 9, 2006 - hello to all my groovy ghoulies! i've done an update and it's, how should i say it ....delicately .... ok .... it's a really, really shitty update and you will love it ..... or not. gg allin has taken his place in the celebrity morgue and please, for your own good, don't get too close to him. firstly, he bites, well, gnaws at you, and he smells just gawd-awful but all that aside, gg has requested a natural presentation and i always see to the wishes of my dead. after all, that's why we are here, correct? so trot your little asses right on down to the links and you will be shown the path to poor, dead gg allin, the god of rock(?). oh, too, i've added a little something to the black dahlia crypt. i just can't tear myself away from her plight and i've added another peek at the carnage that she suffered. we will pray for her peace and so on. i've also put a tiny piece of new information on the jayne mansfield page thanks to our new ghoulfiend, beth. and i almost forgot, but we will take a trip down memory lane so be prepared to remember what really scares you and it will pop up when you are least expecting it. sort of a halloween's unseen fun house. so carry on sweet ones and watch out for those sewers! signed, pennywise 
june 23, 2006 - hello dear ones! my it's been a long time since i've updated hasn't it? and since we have only 129 days until halloween, well, i must get busy. i have so many updates and ideas that it will be a massive job just pulling everything together but, of course, you know i would do anything for all my loyal creepsters. so with that being said, i will begin with a little hint on what is to be. i fear that everyone will have to haul out their barf bags when you see our latest resident in the celebrity morgue. gg allin has made his presence known in the morgue and what a presence it is! let's just say he gives the word "shit" a whole new meaning! i have a few more celebrities that i want to tell you about including isadora duncan, sam (hell, go ahead and yell) kennison, freddie mercury, fatty arbuckle and others that you will adore. i've also done a layout on my bedroom, yes, you heard me right, my bedroom, which will tie to a couple of hotel rooms and john lennon (well, who else did you expect(?!)). oh, and i musn't forget, i have ghost pictures, cemetery crawls, disaster news and a very special layout by jason who has done it again and captured some truly haunting photos. i also have many pictures and emails that some of you have so graciously sent and i have been remiss at answering your emails. i apologize to each of you and i will be contacting you within the next few days when i begin work on halloween's unseen. please don't be mad at me for not contacting all of you sooner! i've completed my school work for the summer and i promise i'll make it all up to all of you! so, stay spooky tuned! luvs and shit for brains, janet 
december 24, 2005 - i just wanted to do a fly by here and say hello to all my angels. i hope everyone is warm, safe, happy and planning a spirit-filled christmas. as i sit here, it is christmas eve morning! such a wonderous and blessed time. so what about the updates you say? yes, dear ones, i have updates and i just know they are here somewhere! i am in the process of remodeling my home and i can hardly find anything. all the rooms are stacked to the ceiling and the only space i can find to work on halloween's unseen is right here in the middle of my waterbed! it's a good thing that santa brought me a laptop for christmas! now if i don't drown, i will commence with the updates. i've got some very spookful things planned as always and a dear friend of mine has taken a ghost tour right here in and around downtown houston. you will be thrilled just like i was because her pictures turned out fabulous! haven't seen this much activity in years! interestingly, we have other pictures up already that show this very same type of ghostly occurrence in 2 completely different parts of houston. i think there's something going on in our beautiful city, spookies ..... and that's a good thing! well, i must go for the sun is coming up and i mustn't be caught in the light of day, as you well know! love and merry christmas to you all! janet 
december 4, 2005 - well, greetings to all my pretties! be forewarned because for some reason i am in rare form on this night! i am working furiously on my hurricane katrina update and i dare say that it is over the top - even for me! hurricane katrina and all that is involved really upset me and i'm afraid i've let off steam in my layout. it is a huge layout (4 pages) - and it is gruesome - terrifying. i am sorry to anyone who is sensitive to this layout but it must be done and so it is. be prepared, it is not for the squeamish .... but the truth never is, is it! i have gathered all these katrina photos from the internet, mostly from the news sites. i've left logos where they are in hopes of thanking those sites that unknowingly donated to this hurricane katrina effort. and lastly, i apologize to all of you that are disappointed with my attitude on this particular piece. i spoke from my heart, angry though it may be! i promise i'll do better next time! and just to show you, all my beloveds, that i am still the same, i was perusing halloween's unseen this evening and realized that it now has 80 pages! and while i was strolling through the pages i came across the beautiful dead page and was so taken aback by jim morrison yet again that i felt compelled to repost the link to the page once again in the links section below. so there, never fear, all's well here and perfectly normal. i'm still in love with my dead rock stars! luvs and the rising tide, janet 
november 25, 2005 - okay spookies, i have been shown the error of my ways. i have been a very, very bad web witch and i wish to set things straight! my most loyal friends over at haunted america tours have pointed out to me that they have had my link up on their site since 2004 ....... 2004!!!!!!!! and i, alas, have failed to return the favour to them by putting their link here at halloween's unseen. i apologize. believe me, it was not intentional. so anyway, showing me now that they are truly forgiving of my misdeeds, they have kept my link up and i, your remorseful web mistress, have the link to haunted america tours in its proper place in the links section in the lower part of this page. thanks guys for extending your hand of friendship! i honor you and your ghostly endeavours! now, come little ones, we fly! janet 
october 31, 2005 - the ghostliest ghosts and witches of green, i hope, dear dark ones, you've had a happy halloween! oh, i guess i'm feeling a little poetic on this wonderful night! halloween! we have waited the whole year through and it's finally here. did you have a fiendishly friendly halloween? the night was perfect for us here - it stormed and it rained and the lightning and thunder was so dear! geez, why do i keep rhyming everything? what a fool am i! i guess it's because i am inspired, so much so that i have a beautiful update for you. i've gone hunting again for halloween graves and i found so many! i've given you 2 full pages of photos of my adventure for your earthly pleasures. and as always, i have added the link below these few paragraphs. so, please in an orderly fashion, make your way down to the links below. i hope you have a hauntingly beautiful experience with my halloween offering! luvs and little trinkets, janet 
october 9, 2005 - good evening, sweet ones. i hope you are having a hauntingly cheerful halloween season. a promise to you! i will be updating as much as my new job allows! yes, i have changed my employment to something bigger and better so i'm trying to do a good job there and yet i am compelled to celebrate the holiday as well! in addition to the updates that i have planned, i will go on a couple of picture taking jaunts as i do each halloween/autumn season and bring my results straight to you. i have also done a horrifying update to the black dahlia page. the more i read about that awful event, the worse it gets! such depravity. such horror! i guess it fits right in around here! happy halloween, janet 
october 1, 2005 - okay, dear dark ones, gather 'round and we'll see what our magic spell book has in store for you on this frightful night! it is the season that we all long for and anticipate the whole year through and i, yes, your slightly off-center web mistress have been updating like mad! this first update to start off our spookful celebration is about christmas! yes, our snowy christmas of 2004 in our beloved galveston, texas and to kick off the festivities is my friend, the surf bum extraordinaire, bryant parson, who has so generously gave me the use of not only a quaint little movie that he directed and filmed but also his lovely pictures that he took of galveston in the snow. it is lovely, dear fiends, and with my tweaking and magic touch, it has become quite a hauntingly beautiful experience. i am proud of this update and hope all of you who chance upon it will love it as much as i. now i must go for i am working on a hurricane katrina layout and alas, a hurricane rita layout as well. it has been hell here on the gulf coast and i pray that these are the only two hurricane layouts that i will ever feel compelled to do. oh, one more thing, i'm also working on 2 new orleans layouts, one when i was there last halloween 2004 and another when i was there christmas 2004. thank god i was able to enjoy new orleans when i did. i have beautiful memories now and fabulous pictures to share with all my creepsters! so, you know the drill, fly right on down the page to the links to all my new stuff. okay, i'm outta here. luvs and mittens, janet 
august 13, 2005 - oh-my-gawd! the layout i just did gave even me, your weird webmistress, the creeps. i've just wrapped up the black dahlia layout in the celebrity morgue and let's just say, she's a righteous addition to the morgue and will remain one of our finest members. please do slither on down and click on her link below. she's just dying for you to read it - and ponder it - in your dreams! love you in bi-sections, janet 
august 3, 2005 - hello spooksters! well, dorothy stratten has moved into our celebrity morgue and i think you will find her story most interesting - tragic but yet compelling. i've added her link below so get your arses down there! now, on to the next! luvs and sleaze bags, janet 
july 11, 2005 - another new page lovlies! yes, i've done my cemetery flowers thing again and it's, well, beautiful! please do scamper right on down to the links and check out my latest cemetery crawl for lovely flowers! luvs and flower buds, janet 
june 30, 2005 - hello beloveds! well, my jayne mansfield layout is finally finished and the link is below. man, that one was hard on me! if there is one thing that does frighten me, and yes, there is one thing that frightens me ..... and that's car accidents. i'm terrified at the very thought of them and i've always been haunted by jayne mansfield's accident. the really creepy thing is when i was typing the layout up, i kept typing janet instead of jayne - oh well, it's been nice knowing you guys. i've always thought i'd go out in a car accident - maybe this is it! i hope i can hold onto my head though! ohhhhh bad, i know but i've got to lighten the mood somehow right? if the truth be known, spookies, i'm not afraid to die, i'm afraid to live! this is a very scary place we live in and i ain't talkin' about ghosts either! anyway, the layout is done and pink. jayne loved pink just like me. oh my gawd, not that too!!! somebody shoot me! no, not yet, my next layout is going to scare the sh*t out of you, i know it does me - more than jayne mansfield. this one will be about the black dahlia. oh i get tremors just thinking about that one. the celebrity morgue is sure growing! now, i've got to go work on the utmb face pictures. somebody is trying to steal them from me and you know what happens to people that steal stuff from me ...... off with their heads! oh gawd, sorry!!!!!!!!!!!!! janet 
june 27, 2005 - hello to all you dear ones who have come to visit me! i have commenced with the updates here at halloween's unseen and i do hope you will go with me firstly on a trip to eerie, arizona that i took in march. now, mind you, it wasn't called eerie, arizona but as all of you who know me know, everything to my eyes is eerie, a little dark and so completely different than what the rest of the world sees . . . . . . . and my camera always captures it! oh rapture! and, and .... that is the very reason that halloween's unseen exists! but let's do get back to arizona because it seems . . . . . . well, why don't you just go find out for yourselves about the trip and my little ghostly companion(!) by following the link down there below. i don't want to give everything away right here on the first page - that's just not how it's done around here! anyway, please do enjoy this ghostly trip and i am now officially updating with every possible minute i can steal from my pesky life so do check back, i think you'll get a thrill! luvs and spooky hotels, janet 
october 31, 2008 - below you will find my most current links to my newest pages and updates to older pages for this joyous night of frightful festivities! see you in your nightmares! janet
