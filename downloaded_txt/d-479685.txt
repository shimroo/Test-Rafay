where vision meets tradition
where vision meets tradition. at florida east coast industries (feci), much has changed since henry flagler established our predecessor company in 1892. but our approach to business still reflects his vision. in the tradition of henry and those who have led feci in the decades since, we continue to embrace our long track record of success as the parent company of successful operations in real estate, transportation, and infrastructure. at the same time, we are laying the foundation for an exciting and bright future. we’re feci. where vision meets tradition.
