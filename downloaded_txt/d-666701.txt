the zig zag dance factory was established in 1994 by the internationally famous dance partnership & award-winners warren bullock and jane phillips. in 1997 they retired from professional competitions to primarily concentrate on teaching, which today, is still their first love and priority.
they are greatly in demand coaches and for adjudicating and lecturing. their cruise & dance holidays continue to attract dancers from all over the world where warren and jane host fabulous workshops on world class cruise ships.
