           storyboard: faith witness transformation
episode 52 living black history every day


storyboard: faith witness transformation is a podcast highlighting  ministries across the east ohio conference of the united methodist church that  are transforming lives locally, nationally, and globally. produced  twice-a-month by eoc communications, each podcast episode focuses on one of the core  values of the #beumc campaign: disciple making; belonging & inclusion;  influence, connection & impact; and experience of god through the united  methodist church. 
episode 52 “living black  history every day” features a conversation with clergy from the east ohio and  west ohio conferences of the united methodist church discussing the importance  of learning from our history while creating a legacy for future generations.
“there is a biblical  narrative as well as a social narrative that is in the black experience that is  important for all churches to see and to uplift and to spotlight not just in  black history month but throughout the calendar year,” said rev. gerald  cameron, of celebration umc in euclid.
“black history to me is not  just a month, it’s my existence. it goes from january 1 to december 31,” said  rev. leo cunningham, of st. paul umc in toledo. “it’s an opportunity to look at  where we have been to understand where we’re going but in the climate we are  living in right now we are making black history, we’re in black history. one  hundred years from now they’re going to ask, ‘what were black people doing  during this time in american history?’”

	      black history month week 3 focus: black methodists for church renewal (bmcr)



black methodists for church renewal (bmcr)  was established in response to the merger of the methodist church and the  evangelical united brethren church in 1968. while the newly formed umc  abolished the racially segregated central jurisdiction, many black methodists  feared that their voice and leadership would be diluted within the new  denominational structure. bmcr was created to ensure that black clergy and laity  had a platform for advocacy, leadership development, and racial justice work  within the church.
the mission of bmcr is to “raise up prophetic  and spiritual leaders who will be advocates for the unique needs of black  people in the united methodist church.” in fulfilling its mission, bmcr will  live into its vision of “a renewed, transformed, unified body of christ on a  mission in the world.”
since its founding, bmcr has been at the  forefront of advocating for black leadership, empowerment, and justice within  the united methodist church. formed during a time of civil rights activism and  denominational restructuring, bmcr emerged as a prophetic voice calling for  full inclusion, equity, and representation of black methodists in the life of  the church.
as one of several recognized racial ethnic caucuses,  bmcr plays an important role in the church today.â  in october, the north central jurisdiction  bmcr hosted its annual meeting in east ohio along with workshops to resource  and equip the black church. all are invited to participate in events hosted throughout the year by the east ohio conference chapter of black methodists for church renewal.
