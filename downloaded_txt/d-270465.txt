accommodation cape town
looking for a select range of accommodation in cape town? cape-venues.co.za makes your search to find a place to stay for your holiday or business travel in the cape easy. the website provides accommodation options to suit every budget and style of travel, from luxury 5-star hotels and lodges, to guesthouses, b&bs and self-catering options. you make your bookings directly with the cape town accommodation providers, with accompanying guest reviews, and accommodation rates and special offers to guide your choice.
cape town, called the mother city by those who live in the shadow of table mountain, is a vibrant cosmopolitan city. a stay in the city is to come alive amidst a melting pot of cultures in a city with a rich historical and cultural heritage. the mountain and the city's vitality alone are reason to visit the western cape, but add to this heady mix the incredible beaches that sweep either side of the peninsula, and the reason so many tourists stay in cape town becomes obvious.
because this is the city of choice for so many visitors to south africa, there is excellent accommodation throughout the city. hotels, guest houses, lodges, bed and breakfast establishments and holiday apartments in cape town provide you with a wonderful base from which to explore, soak up the sun, drink in the views and mingle with the locals.
the atlantic seaboard, with beaches like camps bay and clifton, might be the place to be seen, but just as memorable are the villages of kommetjie and scarborough or the false bay villages of simon's town, st james and kalk bay.
the constantia and durbanville wine routes and a further vast selection of wine estates and routes within an hour's drive of your western cape accommodation, in the well-known towns of paarl, franschhoek, and stellenbosch, offer endless opportunities for wine tasting.
the western cape has many draw cards for the visitor: the west coast, where time has stood still in a series of fishing villages like paternoster, elands bay, and hondeklip bay; the whale season on the shores of cape town, hermanus and gansbaai welcomes the giants of the deep; the garden route  captivates, and the beautiful overberg villages like swellendam, stanford and arniston draw visitors for their country-town allure, while towns like mcgregor, are a haven for craftspeople.
