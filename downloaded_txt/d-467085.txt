we’ve seen it all and survived it all. whatever it is,
we've got  you  covered.the right job the right candidate the right fit 






“krissy (executive search consultant accounting & finance) is the absolute best recruiter i have worked with! her commitment and follow-through are above and beyond the norm, and her ability to match the experience/skills of potential candidates with appropriate openings/companies secured a successful opportunity for me. as the number of mobile users continues to outpace the number of desktop users, it should go without saying that designers, now more than ever, have to design with a mobile-first mentality.” 
										
angela jamison  
										controller - adams constructions co. 
										 


“prime legal provided a boutique experience. francie,  (senior vice president, attorney search practice leader, prime legal) worked discretely and effectively to match my skills with the best employer. i could not be happier with my experience!” 
										
jennifer szakaly 
										prime legal candidate  
										 


"zach, (vp, chemical technologies) was a pleasure to work with during my active job search. zach was able to find both a solid professional and cultural fit in my next position and company. he communicated well and ensured i was prepared. i believe he truly works in the best interest of all parties involved." 
										
ben caudill 
										operations plant manager 
 afton chemical corp 
										 


“alan chamberlin, peoplesolutions president, is top-notch at his craft. i was lucky enough to have alan reach out to me and get me introduced to a new position which when receiving an offer i accepted. throughout the course of the interviewing process, alan was very communicative and helped to make the situation easy and stress-free for all parties. i would highly recommend alan as a recruiter!” 
										
sean mulqueen 
										vp, sales hivewatch 
										 


"it was a real pleasure to work with shawn, (life sciences)  he really did an outstanding job from start to finish. shawn really started strong by matching me with the role - the company's needs were quite unique and my background was a perfect fit. then shawn helped prepare me all along the way and helped to move things quickly so i didn't get grabbed by another role that might have been less of a fit. lastly, where shawn really excelled was in closing the deal. shawn really drove both sides to compromise and we ended up at a point where the location, salary, and benefits were a really great compromise with both sides meeting in the middle." 
										
alex marchut 
										director -  wellstat therapeutics corporation 
										 


"joe young, growth practice president, was an outstanding recruiter. from our first opportunity to work together, joe made it clear he was working to find me the perfect role for my career development. joe even went out of his way to recommend me other companies to work for until we found the right role. joe made the recruitment process easy and i would love to work together again in the future." 
										
weldon lovely, mba 
										global supply chain operations,  senior manager at corning incorporated 
										 


"bruce peacock, manufacturing president,  is a delight to work with! he is professional, thorough, and knows exactly the right questions to ask in order to find the perfect role for his clients. in addition, bruce is personable and has the ability to put you at ease as he gains a true understanding of your skills and strengths. with his expertise, bruce ended my four-month job search with a position that was truly like 'finding a needle in a hay stack'!" 
										
traci robinson 
										hr generalist at unified brands 
										 


"when you reach a certain stage in your career, the next opportunity will probably not be advertised, and the knowledge and confidentiality of a third party will be required to find it; or for it to find you. without question, justin hubbard and the richmond group usa have the experience and contacts to help find that next great opportunity.” 
										
jay courtney 
										sales manager, mccann industries 
										 

don’t just take our word for it.
