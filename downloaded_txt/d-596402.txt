welcome...

					      ...to "the biggest-best selection" in the u.s. or
						canada. located between rochester and niagara falls, ny via route 104 in waterport, ny. (home office and warehouse) 
						
						    try-before-you-buy! see the biggest unique and unusual selection
						of canoes and kayaks ever assembled in one location. talk to sales people that know their craft.
						receive polite positive assistance on all your needs.  rack installations available for yakima racks. (yes,
						we carry some other no-name brands - but we only install yakima because of their simplicity of operation.)						
						 
						    huge indoor showrooms - open year 'round. you owe it to yourself; get the most for
						your dollar, the best boat for your needs and continuing service and advice
						long after the sale. don't settle for just anything hanging from a box store or

						a seasonal outlet's ceiling.
						the box store can only compete by price. they can't match our selection and service.
						obviously, located amidst a "sea" of asphalt, the box stores don't have "try before
						you buy." a selection from them could be a three to four-hundred dollar mistake! -
						not a bargain!
						 
					       we stand behind everything we sell and offer honest,
						experienced advice. no "asphalt" operation here. we demo six days a week on our
						own water. we have a good selection of used canoes and kayaks too. we take the
						time to present and explain the right selection. narrowing the choices to a
						couple, we then demo. the choice is much clearer to you at this time. plan on
						spending a couple of hours with us - bring a lunch, the kids, the (friendly)
						family pet, and have a great day at our park-like facilities.
						    see hundreds of new and used canoes, kayaks and sups in stock every day. 
						we offer lessons, rentals and even canoe/kayak repairs for our loyal customers. 
						we sell, recommend and install yakima racks for any car or truck, even those without raingutters! 
						we manufacture many of our own brand of racks and accessories.




							  we're worth thedrive fromwherever you are!
							

							  we have hundreds of canoes & kayaks & paddle boards in stock.so we can have one that's just perfect for you!

promo price when buying the boat plus a qualifying accessory purchase.
our regular price includes shipping from the manufacturer to our store;  our sale price is good for in-stock models.

oak orchard's multi-purpose stainless steel j-cradles - on sale!





	  when should i carry my kayaks on their sides?  when should i carry my kayaks right-side-up?
    can i carry my kayak up-side-down?   -we have the answers.








	 answer:	 
	 1. to carry more than one kayak on short, factory installed cross bars.
	 (yes, we can recommend a yakima rack to fit onto your factory rack to facilitate a wider bar
         for a kayak "flat", right side up, push on from the rear, easy load. see oak orchard's
			"gull wing" kayak saddles.)
			-please read on!
	 
	 2. the sides of kayaks are very strong - unlikely to dent.	 
	 3. only oak orchard's multi-purpose stainless steel j-cradles carry kayaks, remove easily
	 and double as kayak wall storage with optional wall clips.	 
	 4. only oak orchard's multi-purpose stainless steel j-cradles can lay down flat when empty on yakima bars.
	 	 
	 5. hd stainless steel, deluxe rubber padded, 23" high, so they aren't hidden behind your boat like competitors!
	 	 
	 6. new patented 2 piece "upside-down" tie down straps. tie down in 30 seconds - 
	 no step stool required!
