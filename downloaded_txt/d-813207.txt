1999 vernon spinning coin the spirit cut, here you have something that is of interest to token coin collectors as this was a special minting of a vernon spinner coin with small changes and also of interest as a very nice magical effect. the effect is of an ordinary deck of cards (not supplied) having a selection made and returned to the deck. then the deck is placed carefully atop the coin and slowly turned so it will spin on the coin and in an eerie manner the deck is seen to cut itself and you guessed it, to the selected card! (vernon smiles.) this was issued as the millennium memorial vernon spinning coin. includes 4 pages of instructions and information also an additional special something and it is not invisible thread.  for more about this visit our auction page.
























c.m. bedford radar pencil, a spectator shuffles and ordinary deck of cards (not supplied) and then cuts the deck into two or three piles, he selects a card from any pile and places it under any pile he chooses. he now assembles the deck and performer without touching the deck locates the selected card! the radar pencil reveals cards that are hidden in a deck that is not touched or handled by performer. this is an early style pencil with protective cap for the point to give you an idea of its vintage.   for more about this visit our auction page.
