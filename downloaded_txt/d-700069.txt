i can no longer travel, can't meet with strangers, can't sign books but will sign labels with sase, can't write by request, and can't answer letters. i've got to read and concentrate. why? beats me.
please don't use wikipedia. it is unreliable; anyone can post anything, no matter how wrong. for example, an article by mary cantwell misquotes me wildly. the teacher in me says, "the way to learn about a writer is to read the text. or texts."
here is some information for scholars. (i’ve posted this web-page in defense; a crook bought the name and printed dirty pictures, then offered to sell it to me. i bit. in the course of that i learned the web is full of misinformation. this is a corrective.)
