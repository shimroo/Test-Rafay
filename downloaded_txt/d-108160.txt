rest assured, your deposits are safe!                    

when it comes to your hard-earned money, you deserve a bank that will guarantee its safety. all deposits at bluestone bank are 100% insured. this is made possible through the federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic), which insures up to $250,000 of deposits, as well as through our membership with the depositors insurance fund (dif), which insures all additional deposits above $250,000. no depositor has ever lost money in a bank insured by both the fdic and dif.  










bank local.                     

meeting your unique financial needs requires a tailored approach. no matter where you are in your financial journey, we get to know you and customize financial solutions to fit your specific banking needs—even if that means thinking outside the box.
