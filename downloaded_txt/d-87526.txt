top notch customer service
 rating: 5 out of 5 stars
we had our community center's event of 300 + people at this resort. the smaller the crowd the better the service; the bigger the crowd the more difficult it is to receive service. however, the general manager and his staff went above and beyond in every avenue of customer service. the staff kept every room keys ready according to our requirements. all the elderly on first floor, family on the second floor, and youth on the third floor. our guests found all the rooms and the conference halls were vacuumed, cleaned, and smelled nice. the kitchen was cleaned too. the gm and his staff were good listeners and understanding to any odd requests. they made sure to be absolutely as supportive to all our guests as possible.
