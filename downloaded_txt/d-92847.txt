just the facts



1


at mountaire farms, 100% of our broiler chickens are raised on family-owned farms.
throughout the industry, that number is approximately 95 percent.


antibiotics are not present in any chicken sold in a grocery store.
it is an animal welfare concern to not administer medicine to a sick chicken, but federal regulations require a withdrawal period before an animal is allowed to re-enter the food supply chain.


it has been illegal since the 1950s to administer hormones or steroids to chickens. 
no chicken you buy contains added hormones or steroids, regardless of whether or not this is called out on the label.


there are said to be more than 25 billion chickens on the planet
which makes them the most abundant bird in the world.


a chicken egg takes approximately 21 days to incubate.


there are around 30 distinct vocalizations that chickens make as their form of communication.



throughout the industry, that number is approximately 95 percent.
