700





this is the 700th and final posting to this site. i thought it was fitting to end it there . for more of what many consider to be nutbag stuff go to my new site. just click on the link below for the latest articles. of course the truly nutbag stuff i may post on the web is in another site i will not divulge to the average surfer. to find that you will have to spend a lot of time searching millions of possible websites or be a hacker.i f i were a hacker i would think  'it's a trap' , cause it is. hahahahahaha (had to get that in there one last time)!!!!! of course there are those who by there overconfidence  would try anyway but you know it really is not that important, and if i am right then it will all be moot in a few years anyway because the world will be in the midst of the tribulation and i will have been killed along with a couple three billion others. if you want to know some more of what i have said about this go a couple of posts down to my archive links and surf around. as strange or arrogant or nutty or whatever you may think,  it is still new and cutting edge. some of it is ordinary ,the grammer isn't perfect, the spelling is off(which i like to make fun of here and there) but my goal was to get  what i was thinking in there, not try to impress people with my skills in writing.

vanity it is all vanity.





from the king james versiondan 11:27 and both these kings' hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.here is something prophetic that the mob is not going to like. mankind will never be succesful in knocking down all borders and creating a one world government. never.

aaand now to destroy another crap idea!!!





i have often heard it said that: "the best argument for christianity is christians and the worst argument for christianity is christians." wrong!the greatest argument for christianity is jesus christ!  the greatest argument against christianity is preachers preaching for perfection, and since no one can be perfect why witness! i say the greatest problem today in christianity is not the trooper christians, it is the don quixote morons we got for preachers.

what we did on our vacation





finally for the first time in my life i actually took a real vacation. no relatives to visit no projects to complete just rest and relaxation.from the newest entries to my journalwednesday, october 11, 2006:we finally got going at 10 am. got lost twice going cross country in georgia. it cost us 80 miles and two hours. by the time we got to the best western it was night fall we went out get dinner, shrimp and salad at a local resturaunt with some character. there was a storm north of us (you know, the one that dumped 22"in buffalo) and the wind off the gulf was 20-30 knots. from our room on the 5th floor beach side the waves were a positive roar, awsome.just fantastic.thursday october 8th,got up at 8 am, made some coffee.....wow....great coffee. leroy hill you should be absolutely famous. it was .5oz packets of 100% aribica best gormet coffee, www.leroyhillcofee.com. went out on to the balcony and just relaxed. the air was super fresh with a little chill and what a view..... what a view. it truly is the emerald coast with water so clear.....i sat there for a while: me and the wife, we took it all in, 30 minutes later i got up to get me another cup of this great coffee when i heard the wife's excited voice say, "dolphins!! where are the binoculars? look 2 of them. no no it's a mom and her baby." "wow there must be 7 or 8 of them out there", just off shore, maybe 40 feet in between the sand bars fishing. we watched them until 10 o'clock or so, i thought to get out the sport cam i had brought along and get out there and get some underwater pictures but by the time i thought of it and got ready to go they had moved on. i plan trying to get some another day. that should be exciting.spent the rest of the day on a pure titanium white beach. the water just the right temp for cooling off in. took a walk a mile up the shore to a eat in a place called the angler. karen had a hankerin for taco salad and we ate it on the pier. the dolphins were a couple of hundred yards out cavorting around.....very pleasent.back up in the room we're hanging out plannin our next move, staring out over the sea. the sun is just right and the azure blue water is sparkling like a billion diamonds. fantastic, beautiful, awsome. makes a man feel good to be alive. i couldn't help but contemplate the unsurpassable god whom created this magnificent site.friday 13th,sunset last night over the water. there are no words i can use to completely describe it's beauty. no-not one would be worthy. we left our folding love seat on the beach and when the appointed moment arrived we went down to the shore and watched one of the great sights men can see. sundown over the ocean. very mesmerizing.we wanted to get up this morning to watch the sun rise but got to bed way to late for that.....i saw something right up against the sand. i ran to the beach camera in hand. woah! stingrays! four of them 1 big one and 3 smaller. simple, i ain't gettin in the water with them. they are reputed to be gentle calm creatures but i still ain't gettin in there with them.i fancy myself a mentally tough guy but crazy????? i don't feel like testing my toughness against the possibility of passing out from the mind numbing sting i imagine them capable of.6:20 am, dolphins!!!!saturday the 14thup at 5am, caught the sunrise finally. it's 46 degrees and i froze my ...... beautiful.10 am:karen; "ron come here and look at this! what is that?" i grabbed the binoc's. whatever it is it's about 10 feet off the shore."it's the momma and her baby." i grabbed the camera, ran down 5 floors across the beach and out into the gulf , dang it! no way i am going to get close enough for a good shot.later on we identified those funny looking brown patches of what i thought were dead sea weed. they were far from dead." jellyfish", man this water is just positively teaming with life. from the microscopic that the stingray's were scooping up to the dolphins and everything in between except sharks. dolphins and sharks don't get along, i knew that watchin all those animal shows would come in handy. by the way i ain't gettin near the jelly fish either. i would live but i would like for my vacation to be as painless as possible. i already have a punky stomach with sea food and salad gas.our tan's are evening out. i used to have the ol t-shirt tan from work. got some pic's of a wedding on the beach.time to start packing a little to get ready to go tommorow. sure hope we don't get lost like we did on our way in.all in all it's turned out like i hoped it would.what's the one thing i think i would like for my vacation to be like? this one has lived up to it's hopes because of god.  i wish it would never have to end. perfect just perfect.

which sin gives anyone the right to preach the word of god.





none.if it were not for the grace of god no man or women on earth would be perfect enough to preach his word. none are worthy to even speak his name.only by a devil would a preacher ever tell a congregation they should not talk about jesus even when they are sinning. it is not our sin that saves us but the grace of god.one of the greatest evangelical preachers of the late 1800's yet died in his sleep of alcohol poisoning with a bottle still clutched in his hand. if the holy spirit will work through an alcoholic what moron of a preacher but one full of a devil would preach a sermon against mentioning jesus name or preaching the gospel. jesus warned against pharasees and saducees who increased the burdens of the people blocking the door but wouldn't enter in to the kingdom themselves.get it right you stupid overeducated muckers or get out from behind the pulpit.

life





from my journal:i was in the midst of being divorced by my 2nd wife and going through what so many other people go through with the added revelation that there is a god and he does love me. awesome!!!there was more written on this day prior to 6 pm but i really wanted to get this part of the day in here.11/14/96 6:17 pmthat first day i remember was pretty bad.i just turned on the oven and threw in a frozen pizza.i'm lucky to have the dishwasher it simplifies my life but running it reminds me of michele and me in our first apt.-no that was 9 months later. right now i just want something to eat and i don't feel like hand washing the dishes. it's incredible to write with the lord guiding my hand.the emotions are powerful, i find myself crying but not from sadness of my situation but the joy of walking so close to a god that i wasn't sure existed. i know now that he does and he is real.i feel a change. it's the same change in the spirit i get when i am on the move. only i am not moving. i wonder if she is?there is an excitement that i get, going somewhere new. i believe she has a new steady partner. for a time she didn't. i don't know for scientifically sure because i have no communications with her. just a feeling.i bet she's cooking again. she is a good cook! pizza's done.old memories are coming back as i sit here in this empty apartment chewing on overdone food and the sting of burning in the palm of my hand as i took it out of the oven just intensifies my sorrow. i'll probably burn the roof of my mouth, i wonder if i'll ever amount to anything.....ouch! like i said i would probably burn the roof of my mouth. old memories.......old memories.jan 11 1991,ring! ring! ring! "hello! desk clerk" mr. err..kkilla,how do you pronounce your name? me, "that's about right, just call me ron it's simpler that way.desk clerk, "oh ! ok well listen, you have a phone call. it's your wife.""oh uh yeah go ahead and put her through, thankyou." "is this the young lady that checked me in?".... desk clerk,"i don't know. i don't remember." me, yeah i suppose you check in a lot of people."desk clerk,"yes." me,"well thanks i just wanted to let you know i talked to billeting today and they said it is still going to be two weeks so i told them that if it wasn't a problem and they sounded busy that they could take me off of the list because i had settled in and was feeling better about staying off base. i'll be down to pay for the other 2 weeks in a few minutes after i talk to my wife."desk clerk,"ok here's your wife." me,"thanks; hello?, hi deb how are you? i'm fine i guess pretty bored. huh? nah i just stay in the room and read, i have cable t.v.. saturday i went to the gym and worked out and swim in the pool before i go to work. yeah it's kind-a-cool lookin around the pool. they have palm trees and stuff. it's been 95 degrees and 95% humidity every day. it's sort of monsoonal. rains everyday at 4pm like clockwork. real hard for a little while and then it quits. huh? oh i keep some milk and breakfast drink around. it lasts about 4 days. it's quick and convenient. all i have to do is fill up the cooler with ice everyday which under the circumstances is no big deal. it's boring, boring, boring. no i haven't gotten to know anybody yet. how are the kids? do they miss me? yeah i guess so. i'm glad they are making friends. is jason bothering jez still. i pray about it and it makes me nervous to be here. i worry about it you know. they're on vacation? good that makes me feel better. well i love you! let me talk to the kids.hi jez how ya doing? family is on vacation? good. i'm glad. did you see him around before they left? well you stay away from him! he's headed for a lot of trouble in his life and i don't want you getting caught up in that b.s.you hear? are you playing ball still. how did you do? you hit an inside the park home run, cool...... well i'll call next saturday. talk to you then, love ya. let me talk to janell.hi janell, how are you. that's good. have you made any new friends lately. well that's ok, you will meet some. you're pretty smart and nice and people will like you. well let me talk to your mom, ok, i love you and miss you."7:42pmthat's it for a minute i'm crying so hard i can barely see the page. what the ____ did i do. i walked away from the only reason i was in that house and barely shed a tear over it. i missed 5 years of my kids life, and now thinking of my daughters sweet 9 year old voice on the phone......9:51pm 1996just got off the phone with janell. we talked generalities, i admonished her for not writing more. she told me step dad al is taking an attitude with debbie. he got rude to janell on the phone. i told him in short terse words she was talking with me and he could hang up. i feel the stresses building up in their marriage. i pray for their marriage. maybe not to sincerely though.whoa! jim erickson-the name just whizzed through my head. then michele's.debbie quit proex and perkins and took a job at byerly's.1991ring! ring! desk clerk,"hi there, how can i help you?" me,"hi,i'm sorry it took so long. i was talking to my kids. i miss them.i'm ron. rm 209." desk clerk,"that's ok i was kind of busyso your timing is good. me," how much do i owe for the rest of the month? $172.00? ok thank you. i'm sorry to have been such a bother but things appear to have settled down and it's just as well. i don't like moving after i have kind of gotten used to the place and all. it seems like i've moved so much in my life."........desk clerk,"there you are sir . enjoy your stay with us."(i don't think i should be trying so hard, i'm married) me,"thank you, have a nice day". desk clerk,"you too". me,"i'm sorry i don't remember your name?desk clerk,"michele.""oh ok,... you are being very patient with me. and i appreciate it."i'll ....i'll probably be down from time to time and i prefer dealing with the same person whose familiar with the situation....bye."desk clerk,"bye"

notice they make no reference 2 us women! we r free 2 b wise in this world and beyond!:ostarbender | homepage | 02.11.06 - 7:18 am | # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i wish that wisdom was a truly generic product that everyone could have but it is not so. in the bible wo-man are included and since jesus and because of him are given the freedom to also live as they see fit. i am in full agreement with this yet so many people will choose foolishness.and you are correct yet all of mankind has been given the power to overcome their mistakes.ron | homepage | 02.12.06 - 11:47 am | #

another old article i want up front





sunday, august 15, 2004the voice of godthis is my comment to those people that hear a voice in their head they credit as god's.not!the apostle peter warns us to test the spirits whether they be of god or not and that no spirit that is not of god can admit that jesus is the messiah unless they are of god.exo 19:18 and mount sinai was altogether on a smoke, because, the lord descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.when god makes his presence known to men it becomes obvious, things begin to shake, quake, lite up or burn.exo 3:2 and the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst, of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.1ki 19:11 and he said, go forth, and stand upon the mount before the lord. and, behold, the lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before the lord; but the lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the lord was not in the earthquake:luk 2:9 and, lo, the angel of the lord came upon them, and the glory of the lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.mat 28:2 and, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.joh 12:28 father, glorify thy name. then came there a voice from heaven, saying, i have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.joh 12:29 the people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, an angel spake to him.joh 12:30 jesus answered and said, this voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.though god makes his presence known to men in other ways by his spirit that works in us and about us using circumstance and by prayer fulfilling our prescient prayers, and prescient words, we have not necessarily heard the direct voice of god because something that came to us in a secret voice came true.i will not discount that everything that men consider voices external to themselves yet secret to others as not messengers but do not count that these voices are messengers of the most high god. the most high god would send messengers to have us do good unto men not evil. to deliver messages of repentance and warnings of destruction both small and great for not repenting, that is to change ones mind concerning doing evil.also remember that in the end all things will have begun and ended with god hence the reason that jesus told john in the vision of revelations to let them that are righteous be righteous still and those that are evil let them be evil still. that also does not relinquish jesus command to preach repentance, nor to the old testament writings concerning our responsibility to warn the wicked to repent of their ways and sin no more lest they die in thier sin and then thier blood would be required of us.

think not that god would not kill





do not be confused in the difference between a natural disaster and men who murder.god kills with out mercy.2ki 19:35 and it came to pass that night, that the angel of the lord went out, and smote in the camp of the assyrians a hundred fourscore and five thousand:and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.not a pleasent thought for those who are spiritual but dwell 'in this world' is it? the day is coming and it is not far off in fact it is easily measured by men today in less than years

religion is not necessary





jesus came so that you and i would not have to go through religion to be near the father any more. no rituals, no rites of passage, no need for acceptance. only simply believe and say "jesus save me, forgive me of my sins". and voila. you have instant access to the only one who really loves you. 'god'.you don't have to go to church or work for it, it's free.

conundrums





i don't come with the apparatus the apparatus comes with me. i don't own the apparatus someone else does but the apparatus doesn't own me. i am not a slave to the apparatus, the apparatus is a slave for me.if you own the apparatus and it is symbiont to me then it can not live with out me. the apparatus does not direct my life but i direct it's life.if you bought the apparatus then you payed to be my slave.surprised? not me.i am not in the mob but the devil wants you to think i am and he wishes i was.answer: if you don't want to become my slave then don't try to enslave me.i always win.

about me





ron


rev 8:8  and the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood; 
rev 8:9  and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.
