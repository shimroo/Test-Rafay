about norma canner










a time to dance

this intimate documentary profiles norma canner, a pioneer in dance movement therapy, who found in dance a way to help those discarded by society. the film traces the evolution of norma's career from broadway actress in the '40s, through her ground-breaking work with children in the â60s, using creative movement to reach those who were who were blind, deaf, physically impaired, developmentally delayed, and autistic at a time when these populations were often ignored or given up on by society. her therapeutic work with adults in â80s and â90s, as well as her contribution as a teacher and mentor to her students and others in the field continues to be felt today.
utilizing art, music, drama, and dance in the context of therapy, her methods proved extraordinarily beneficial for handicapped individuals, as well as providing cathartic healing experiences for those with deep emotional scars. and her pioneering work became a model for practitioners worldwide. this film is an inspiring tale of a woman who followed her own heart and in the process helped others to heal themselves.
