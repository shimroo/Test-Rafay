timebomb2000

here we discuss in great variety what once was, what is now, what may be to come, and the many ways we're devising to remember, endure, and understand our experiences. and perhaps in some way to ready ourselves and our children for the future.

take it outside

a free-for-all sig. little or no moderating. pretty much anything goes in here, except: threats of harm to a member, pure, unadulterated trolling, obvious pornography, or ongoing bashing of the tb2k site or staff. come in here at your own risk! threads that start degenerating on the main board get moved here. someone wants to bitch/rant at someone/something? please, take it here!

alternative (misc) topics

things that aren't "news and prep" and don't fit in the main room (or any other room for that matter) go here including gross, horrific or sensational "news" stories that would not typically be on page 1 of your hometown newspaper.




private










all things political

here is where we will be discussing political topics leading up to general elections. pretty much anything goes in terms of topics, but please try to keep it civil.
