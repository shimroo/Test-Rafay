our story
as a former public school educator, i founded gateways to better education because fear and confusion over the "separation of church and state" often led to unnecessary censorship of religion in schools.too often, my fellow christians responded to educators with hostility and aggression. both educators and parents needed clarity and a better way! thus, gateways to better education was born.click the about us tab for information about how we do what we do.eric buehrer, founder & president
