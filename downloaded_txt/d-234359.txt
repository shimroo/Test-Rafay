03 





preparing your employer 



									if you are thinking about surgery, or you have been told you may need surgery, one of the most common concerns after you get over the fear of surgery is how are you going to tell your employer.								









 









04 





mentally preparing for surgery 



									mentally preparing for a surgical procedure has so many angles and variations because preparation also has
so many variations.								









 









05 





preventing infections 



									our goal is to return you to your normal activities and reduce your pain while “doing no harm.” every interaction with a medical provider has its risks and benefits and we want more benefits than risks.
