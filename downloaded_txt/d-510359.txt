what happens when we can never go offline, and never wake up?blackout 2024 is an experimental web-comic chronicling bleak isolation, gonzo excess, and android dreams. locked away in the cell of their digital shadow, nameless nomads awaken in the stillborn days following lilith's disappearance, following white rabbits that lead nowhere — a past that cannot be revised, a future that never quite arrives.  





























methods used: collage-style illustrations incorporating a combination of rotoscope style digital painting, procedural generation, photography, and filtering with physical media and palimpsest. additional illustrations by a rotating cast of collaborating artists. produced 2017-2018, available here for free. written by james curcio and equanimous rex
