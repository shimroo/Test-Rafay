"i have been to one of your courses before and it was one of the most valuable things i did in my role. yesterday was equally good - thanks for making it so interesting and fun."
participant on legal update for voluntary organisations course
i have been a freelance governance trainer, consultant and author working exclusively in the voluntary/not-for-profit sector for more than 40 years, specialising primarily in legal aspects of voluntary sector governance and management, and helping boards become more effective. i am now semi-retired, but occasionally do in-house governance reviews, constitution reviews (articles of association etc), board training and mentoring. contact me as below if you are interested.

	i can also sometimes respond to queries by providing basic information or signposting.

	this site contains information about my background, publications and services for individual organisations. 

	the site formerly included a very detailed legal update section, but when i no longer had time to maintain it, it became a legal out-of-date section and had to be removed.
