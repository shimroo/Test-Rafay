shuffledock: made in croatia!





shufflehacks continues its trek around the world. reader aleksandar sent his shuffledock mod all the way from croatia.hi, i am aleksandar plavsic from croatia, i googled for shuffle hacks and came to your blog, so i decided to make my own shuffle dock. i was inspired by royal baking soda portuguese ipod dock. i used some old nescaffe can, put some self-adhesive black glossy wallpaper on it, and that apple sticker which was bundled with my shuffle :) this is 1.0 version, in 2.0 i plan to put some foam in it and make travel case of it, so it could be multi purpose dock :)) sorry on my english :)) keep up the great work aleksandar and i can't wait for version 2.0!

make (re)discovers shufflephones





 make threw up a post on the phenomenon of shufflephones.  they call out 2nd gen shuffles which in my opinion are much easier to turn into shufflephones but the more shufflephones the merrier!  every time apple releases a tiny music player, someone makes their own diy headphone project with the ipod built in, here's the latest one with the shuffle ii from adam... [via] - link. if you look at the links at the bottom you'll see a link to my shufflephones 1.0! ahh memories.. how long has it been?! blogged with flock

ipod shufflebud usb adapter for 2nd gen ipod shuffle





     tuaw brings word of this little usb adapter for the 2nd gen shuffles. for many people, the appeal of the original ipod shuffle was that ithad the form and function of a plain old usb thumbdrive, aside frombeing an awesome mp3 player. the 2nd generation ipod shuffle is an evenmore awesome mp3 player, and has an even better form factor, but lostit's ability to function as a usb thumbdrive without having to use thenew dock.  the shufflebud, by incipio(which we think rhymes with c3po), solves that problem, and it does itfor only $5.99 usd. the shufflebud is what apple should have justtossed in the box to begin with, although i am starting to think thatapple deliberately omits certain features in order to keep themulti-billion dollar ipod accessory market thriving, which isn't such abad thing.   shufflebud is just a small (5.6 grams, 47mm x 16mm)usb to 3.5mm adapter that enables you to plug your 2g shuffle directlyinto an available usb port without having to use the ipod shuffle dock,making it much more convenient to shove in your pocket or clip to yourbag with the included lanyard loop for those who are always on the goand don't need more gear in their bag. seems like a nifty little thingie for those of you who have moved into the 2nd gen.blogged with flock

2nd gen ipod shuffle phones v2.0 (quick and dirty edition)





that was fast. just yesterday we brought you 2nd gen ipod shuffle phones and today we're up to version 2.0 which was sent in by reader douglass scott. he made an adjustment to alow the shuffle to fit on larger headphones but i'll let him talk.saw alexander micek's 2g shuffle hack and thought i would try my own.  the shuffle won't clip directly onto my sony noise canceling headphones (mdr-nc50), so i needed to create a bracket to do the job.  the end product works okay; the ipod is a little loose on the bracket, but it's good enough for long flights.  this was a quick and dirty job, but my local hardware store has some thin stainless steel bands that might clean this hack up.  enjoy, ds great job douglass and i'm anxious for your next hack!link (flickr)

2nd gen ipod shuffle phones





alexander micek decided to create his own version of the shufflephones using a 2nd generation shuffle. i used my trusty sennheiser hd 212 pros, which as you may have noticed from the specs, have an unusually long cord.  10 feet, to be precise.  i had to wrap ten feet of cord (should i say it again?) to make this work … ideally, i’ll be able to source a shorter y-cable.  that said, the “startlingly bassy” hd212’s silver color matches the ipod’s anodized aluminum quite well, and the clip holds the ipod on with reasonable security.  this wouldn’t be good for exercise, but it’s quite usable for studying and similar activities.link (tumbledry.org)

ipod shuffle cover from travel band-aid box





csmnotes - ipod shuffle cover from travel band-aid box  reader chaz sent in this awesome band-aid shuffle cover hack! first off, credit to derek who posted the idea way back in august '05.i found a ridiculous deal on 1g ipod shuffles at brand smart back in november '05 (more than 35% off list; apparently they figured out they were losing money becuase they now price them at market.)i couldn't justify (still can't) the cost of a bigger digital music player, but at the price i found them, and with this home-made cover and a cassette deck adapter, both my better-half and i have music in our pockets (and when i find some decent water-proof headphones, music to take into the pool for work-outs) and in the car for less than the price of the cheapest hard-drive based player (not including any accesories.) by the time these cases wear out, i'll have saved-up for two water-proof otterbox covers (part of taking them swimming.)parts needed - an ipod shuffle, some travel-size band-aid cases, a small piece of anti-static foam (0.25"/o.65 mm thick), some scissors, and a small drill or other augering tool. check out the full instructions and along with pictures here. blogged with flock
