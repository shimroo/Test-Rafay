we are the solids

 

"what started as a college rock band in 1996 at wesleyan university, the solids have continued to craft hooky, melody-driven rock songs in various iterations across the years.  after playing through our 20’s in new york we spread to the four corners for careers, families and to live our early years of the middle ages.  two of us moved to la to produce the show “how i met your mother” (and used a solids tune as the show’s theme song). one of us spent the decade cooking up various schemes in the tech world and the other went deep cover as a corporate banker then took early retirement to be a stay at home dad.  twenty years after graduating wes, we all found ourselves back in new york, wanting to rock now more than ever.  we found an extraordinary lead guitarist and the next chapter begins…." carter bays / vocals, guitarcraig thomas / drumspat butler / all things keysjosh suniewick / bassdoug derryberry / lead guitar
