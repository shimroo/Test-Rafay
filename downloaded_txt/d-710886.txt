probably the best tv series about vietnam was "china beach" from 1988 to 1992. 
the entire series is now for sale on disc. see

superb talent and writing gave millions of americans their first positive look 
at my war by viewing dedicated u.s. army medical personnel treating horrible 
casualties. army veteran harold russell who lost both arms during world war ii 
won an academy award for his disabled veteran role in "the best years of our 
lives" in 1947. russell, much older in the 1990's, played the same role in 
"china beach". my favorite scene was nurse lieutenant mcmurphy (dana delany) at 
a stateside va hospital in a skimpy hospital gown awaiting treatment sitting 
next to an old world war ii veteran patient (also in a skimpy gown) who whispers 
to her, "they treat us all this way".

 

december 5, 2014: would a regional office lie about not receiving a veteran's 
appeal in certified mail?

speech after the greenville, nc veteran's day parade on the town commons. the 
main speaker was unable to attend and i was a last minute choice. see
