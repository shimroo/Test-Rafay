famous american inventorsamerican ingenuity leads to the development of important everyday inventions







with the signing of the declaration of independence in 1776, a new nation was invented where anyone – with enough hard work and determination – could attain their dreams. this promise of opportunity not only brought in a stream of immigrants seeking a better life, but also led to the development of countless new inventions designed to make everyday living easier.perhaps no two famous american inventors personify this spirit of ingenuity better than benjamin franklin and thomas edison.benjamin franklin, one of the founding fathers of the united states, helped to invent the idea of an american nation. along with his work as a politician, author and scientist, franklin also was a famous american inventor responsible for a variety of different inventions – including the lightning rod, franklin stove, bifocal glasses and the flexible urinary catheter.nearly a century later, thomas edison emerged as another prominent american inventor. holding over 1,000 patents in his name, edison's inventions include the phonograph and the long-lasting light bulb. he also was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production to the invention process.while most people are aware of famous american inventors like benjamin franklin and thomas edison, this site by inventhelp also recognizes other, less-prominent american innovators and their accomplishments. spanning from the birth of our nation to the present day, we'll take a look at inventors whose inventions and new ideas have shaped and changed the united states and the lives of its people.
