super

        feeder®?

it is extremely durable, simple and

            safe.  most importantly, its dependable operation will astonish

            you! standard system uses 120 vac with a low voltage power adapter for 
			safe and dependable operation.  a battery only system is also 
			available if you must have it.  

			feeder's operating voltage range is 9 to 24 volt ac or dc.
our super feeders® are

              translucent smoke color and

            come with frosted clear hopper extensions for food level visibility.  
			a 1.5 gallon stackable hopper is also available.
each feed cycle is 
			adjustable to dispense from a very small portion  to several 
			cups per day.  super feeders can feed up to 72 times per day or 
			more depending on external timer used!
extremely versatile.  
			its use is not limited by a typical built-in programmable timer!! power and

            "trigger" it with any 120v timer via its supplied adapter.  use any remote

            control switch to manually feed your pets...an x-10 or other home automation system is

            a perfect match. you can even activate your feeder by phone with our
			
wi-fi socket 
			from your office or vacation spot! you could even do away with 
			its internal electronic components to run it from your own timing 
			device.  several super feeders® could be 
			simultaneously operated from one timing device. 

connect your super feeder® to your 

			existing aquarium light timing device, and trigger it when your light comes on. 

powerful gear drive coupled to unique food

            extraction system cannot and will not bind up on pellets or other foods! 

for aquarium use, due to 
			internal motion, flakes will 
			not clump up together . when 
			installed as directed, our innovative 
			patented food distribution system is not affected by common moisture associated with

            most aquariums, and will also vastly reduce water pollution. no auger--no binding!  
startling performance 
			with  flake

            food!     
extremely sturdy acrylic 
			and polycarbonate

              body, durable  polypropylene internal parts, and stainless steel hardware.

              weatherproof outdoor models available.  and, all super feeders® are fully 
			self

              serviceable...just snap new parts in, if ever needed
