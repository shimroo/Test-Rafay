today, i am starting fresh with coding and decided to learn go lang . so, i went on the web to search for ways to learn on my own. found this site  and got started right away.  so far, it has been a great experience, but i will have to be patient as there may be some delays in getting feedback from the mentors. this is not really, what i wanted to talk about today. i am shocked at the way adds are rendered in web pages, from `random` sites. can you find a pattern with my recent browsing - i am going to pages that i found in my search result while testing some new apis in go. in the past days,  i have been considering tacking this online course  to refresh my ml knowledge i have started to use this api -  https://www.producthunt.com/posts/covid-19-news-api  (hosted on  https://rapidapi.com/ ) where is the value in those adds which are cluttering my browsing experience without much value to me?  i am wondering if this training is worth the money now...

 as recommended by cheuk chau  on medium, i read ' how to develop a daily writing habit ’ - i’ll try to put it in practice here with my second advise - should have been my #1 advise:     run a local copy of your application first, before to test it on your cloud instance.     while it’s simple to run directly on the cloud, and we have a lot of samples available to get started, working local first is the best way to get ready when trouble come your way.     samples are available from:   your own cloud instance sdk : https://javatrialxxxx-usoracletrialxxxx.java.us2.oraclecloudapps.com/doc/index.html  another instance of the sdk documentation, hosted for you :  https://javas2-jcscdc.java.us2.oraclecloudapps.com/doc/index.html  the cloud documentation books :  https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/javacs_gs/index.html  otn samples :  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/indexes/samplecode/cloud-samples-2203466.html  same samples, hosted on github :  https://github.com/o...

i had a conversation  with  +david haimes  on twitter the other day about blogging, and realized i have not been blogging for a long long time.   while i can find information about almost everything with google or stack overflow, i realized that it's sometime hard to find the one piece of information which is relevant for you, in your current context.   it usually ends up being a compilation of multiple blog posts or answers; it's the curated content which brings most of the $$$ value.   as i go through the process to discover how to use the oracle public cloud , i am going to blog about the learning process, here.   the first advise i'll share is this one:    for any sample you are using, start with git   here is why:    once you have a working version, commit and push to the remote. it give you the following benefits: easy to share with your peers - you have a backup for 'free' - in case the next set of changes break something in a bad way, rolling back is a breez...

after oracle's news about the changes at the helm, i was offered to follow a new user on twitter. which may be relevant for me -  @ markvhurd   my first click from twitter, on my mobile phone, was to look at is web site :  markhurd.com   here is what i saw over 3 days, and 3 visits - the screen are compiled in one animated gif - days 1, 2 and 3 are available as still images  on my g+ page too ;)      the pros: the web master is busy improving the site every day.  the cons: they do not seams to get what mobile friendly really means... here is the same site in desktop view.    here again, you can see that the web master was busy - there is a new anchor:    mark hurd is chief executive officer of oracle corporation  and a member of the board of directors    as a geek, you tale a look at the browser title (or at the source):    property =" og:title " content =" mark hurd | oracle president and board of directors member " />    the question i am left with: does th...

high res only - one version of the resource to serve

with the new hardware and fast internet connection, is it the norm to only keep images in one high-res version, regardless of the way the content is utilized in the article?   today's example is this article on forbes;  why i left the wall street journal to join oracle     from the article, here are two images :    siloette - 924x519 used in a region of 170 x 113 http://blogs-images.forbes.com/oracle/files/2014/07/siloette.jpg  lighbulb - 1700x1129 in a region of 808 x 454 http://blogs-images.forbes.com/oracle/files/2014/07/lightbulb.jpg          looks like a style of publishing where a subset of a full publication is injected on the left pane of another article to cross reference articles. if you continue reading on the site, then you start to benefit from this as you already have the resource in your local cache.       is this the new trend or one off?      the other new trend i am seeing is to use flouted images on ios, as background image in linkedin connect for ios.      ...

looks like i cannot go without a g+ profile if i want to continue to use my blogger account ...    as i cannot go on fesse book to notify my friends i am no longer there, i have to use alternate routes ;-)     most likely, i am going to create a marketing account on mailchimp for 'les amis d'eric' so that i can continue to push update about my remodeling project and my new diets.     this is still work in progress, so stay tuned.     -eric

with all those services that are using face book as identity, i am starting to get suspicious about the value they get from it.  here is the claim (in french):    what is advertised by the site   and here is the disclaimer from face book:    what face book is sharing    who should i trust - i do not care about my public profile, all the information i put on face book is public and may not be accurate, so it's ok to have this shared with other for their use.     my list of friends - no way / i do not want them to get spam. what is of interest to me may not be of interest to them.     @facebook, i do not mind sharing my face book email, but that's about it.
