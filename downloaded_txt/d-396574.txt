mono hot springs is known for spectacular sierra nevada hiking opportunities deep in the ansel adams and john muir wildernesses. when people first drive into the mono hot springs basin they are awed and often a little startled by the area’s shear expanse of the rugged glacially made granite scenery.
this california high sierra wilderness between yosemite and kings canyon national parks is known as the range of light.  it is one of the nation’s most amazingly beautiful landscapes with no roads cutting through this wilderness to the east.  here you find peace, not crowds, in one of the most remote parts of the sierra nevada – a perfect vacation alternative to yosemite.
beautiful doris lake is an easy one mile hike from mono hot springs that is well suited for families with young children. if you can pull yourself away from the lake’s beauty and wonderful swimming, tule lake is another three quarters of a mile with scenic devil’s table a more difficult trek along the way.
a fairly steep three mile hike to corbett, givens and cunningham lakes, just a 5 minute drive to the trailhead, takes you quickly to a high elevation spectacular view full of eastern brook trout.
a short 4-wheel drive to bear lake diversion dam takes you to the bear creek trail where a three mile hike puts you in the most beautiful of the area’s scenery with golden trout fishing.
florence lake is a 25 minute drive from mono that is located in a spectacular granite basin reflecting 11,000 ft. pyramid shaped mt. shinn. at the florence lake store a ferry service can take you across the 5 mile lake where you can hike along the san joaquin river to beautiful blayney meadows and beyond to the muir trail ranch, hot springs, the john muir trail and the pacific crest trail.
a more moderately challenging 7 mile round trip hike from a florence lake parking area trailhead takes you to dutch, hidden and scenic crater lakes. the large jackass meadows below florence lake provides easy and pleasing hiking and camping along the river. ward lake is a wonderful surprise you will pass on the way to florence lake tucked in a steep walled granite grotto that also offers excellent california kayak fishing, boating and camping.
about a 20 minute drive to edison lake takes you to vermilion valley resort with a ferry service shuttling people 7 miles across edison lake to within a mile of the famous john muir/pacific crest trail. mono creek is a wonderfully serene creek and several alpine lakes are within a day’s hiking range. there are numerous small streams and lakes all around the edison lake area with great trout fishing. the high sierra pack station has horseback day rides to back country wilderness lakes like the devil’s bathtub.
we will help plan your desired hiking opportunities from easy to more difficult. trout fly fishing guided instruction by sierra fly fishers is available. make sure you fill up with gas at either shaver lake or huntington lake. from shaver lake it’s about a one and a half hour drive – and from huntington lake about an hour drive to mono – one of northern california’s most beautiful and remote hot springs resorts in the high sierras.
mono hot springs has tent cabins, historic cabins, fs campground reservations in the sierra mountains south of yosemite california! please call us at 559 325 1710 for more information on mono hot springs northern california resorts.
“why it’s cozy: pine ringed natural hot springs for al fresco soaking, an on-site spa, and the river rock fireplaces, and cabins made of native cobblestone and local wood”…sunset magazineread the full article here.
here's what people say:"one of the first things i do after clearing kaiser pass – the 9,100 ft. pass that’s one of north america’s highest passes on the way to mono hot springs – is to open the door, get out of my car and just drink in the peace and silence! about three miles over the pass incredible views of yosemite, the range of light, and the high sierras above the tree line open up and you realize that all of the background noise and static from the rest of california is suddenly blocked by a ridge - and i’m always so struck by how much tension we carry that we don’t even realize until we lose it!at this moment beholding such natural beauty and looking down into the mono basin that’s one of the most amazing geothermal areas on the planet that’s what made this part of the high sierras the tallest and most inspiring, i’ve just felt some of the happiest i’ve ever been to be alive!as i begin the decent, i usually put on joni mitchel’s “woodstock” as the words just seem so poignant for the drive in.  “we are stardust. we are golden.  but we’re caught in the devil’s bargain – and we’ve got to get back to the garden!” mono hot springs is the garden for me! i’ve found greater peace here soaking in these natural hot springs, hiking, enjoying the great people i meet in these pools, and eating better fresh trout, elk and buffalo at their restaurant than i do at home in the flatlands!  i’ve spent seven months out of the last three years up here and i’ll be right back in june as soon as the snow melts.  it’s painful to tear myself off the mountain each fall when the snows come!

   magazine's andrew rice says:
"this private hot springs resort on the edge of the ansel adams wilderness might just be the ultimate tonic for city-induced stress syndrome.  with hot mineral baths, massage, rustic cabins (reasonably priced), and good food, you'll decompress in no time.  and nobody can beat mono hot springs for location.  hiking into the john muir wilderness from here is extraordinary".


 fishing licenses are not sold at the resort
