 i will definitely buy another southland trailer in the future!christie ftichar03:35 26 jan 25i love a southland trailer!!!lethbridge avp03:34 26 jan 25annie bialek03:13 26 jan 25we love zackchantelle dunne03:13 26 jan 25we love zack!!noel whitehead03:10 26 jan 25we love ashton and zach!!!dan nugent19:43 13 nov 24in 2004, i bought a 2003 7' x 14' royal cargo trailer in southern alberta. used it in edmonton for a number of years then moved to vancouver island. it was loved but not well treated by my crew in the renovation business. it took a beating and kept on looking darn fine. alas, this year it was in an accident and forcing replacement. but it had many more years left in her if not for the accident. such a well built, quality product in my mind-i don't think that many of their competitors products would have stood up. southland went all out to assist me, doing what they could. they are a great company to deal with by really looking after their customers. such a high level of integrity and after sales service although, i only was in contact at the end as there were no issues with the trailer.i dealt with nanaimo trailers by the nanaimo airport-again a wonderful experience! highly recommend them both!damion grant00:00 19 oct 24fantastic products and a great place to workjamie schlossberger22:58 29 sep 24brett schlossberger19:48 29 sep 24dustin ledsham05:58 29 sep 24matt gibb19:07 15 sep 24first time meeting their team was very pleasant!

even in the wind we have in southern alberta the trailer doors were held securely open while loading and unloading my materials and tools.carter allen15:37 30 nov 22i recently bought a southland dump trailer and i love it. it needed a small adjustment that required some touch-up paint. the dealer i bought the trailer from wasn't the most helpful so i've been working directly with james salter and he's been awesome. he's really gone out of his way to make sure i as a customer i've been taken care of. great customer service.carrington ewers16:18 10 nov 22southland trailers/ royal cargo make an awesome product and go above a beyond on their engineering and building process. i have been picking up and delivering their trailers for years. the employees are always great to work with and very friendly.zach p. in the yard is one of the best and friendliest employees to work with.  he will go above and beyond his responsibilities to make sure the driver is happy and ready to hit the road.  i hope to continue to work with him and the company in the future.thanksjames brooks18:42 25 jun 22they are solid trailers. i have a 16 foot car hauler that is always being used and it is just fantastic. southland also has good customer service and warranty repairs if needed.mimilanie evangelista05:37 15 may 22great people to deal with.😍 very professional and accommodating!
