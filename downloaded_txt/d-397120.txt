         my face might be different
         
         but my feelings the same
         
         i laugh and i cry
         
         and i take pride in my gains
         
         i was sent here among you
         
         to teach you to love
         
         as god in the heavens
         
         looks down from above
         
         to him i'm no different
         
         his love knows no bounds
         
         it's those here among you
         
         in cities and towns
         
         that judge me by standards
         
         that man has imparted
         
         but this family i've chosen
         
         will help me get started
         
         for i'm one of the children
         
         so special and few
         
         that came here to learn
         
         the same lessons as you
         
         that love is acceptance
         
         it must come from the heart
         
         we all have the same purpose
         
         though not the same start
         
         the lord gave me life
         
         to live and embrace
         
         and i'll do as you do
         
         but at my own pace.
