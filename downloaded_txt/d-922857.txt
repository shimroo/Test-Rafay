a history of genealogy


september 22, 2023
/



genealogy, the study of families, family history, and the tracing of lineages, is a practice rooted deep within human history. from the ancestral tales recited around ancient fires to the modern databases of the digital age, genealogy has long held a significant place in human culture.
ancient beginnings
the practice of recording lineage dates back to ancient civilizations. the old testament of the bible includes numerous genealogical lists, serving religious, legal, and social purposes. similarly, ancient greek and roman cultures placed significant emphasis on lineage, often to affirm the status of their rulers.
middle ages and early modern period
in the middle ages, pedigrees became particularly important among european nobility, where lineage was often tied to rights of succession and land ownership. genealogical records, like the domesday book commissioned by william the conqueror in 1086, were created to establish and confirm these rights.
during the early modern period, heraldry (the use of armorial bearings) became closely tied to genealogy. coats of arms and family crests were used to represent families or lineages, and the rules of heraldry required a solid understanding of one’s ancestry.
genealogy in the colonial and revolutionary era
in colonial america, genealogical records were mainly kept by churches, detailing births, deaths, and marriages. the revolutionary war further underscored the importance of genealogy as individuals were required to prove their familial relationships to claim pensions or inheritances.
the modern discipline emerges
the late 19th and early 20th centuries saw genealogy evolve into a more systematic and scholarly discipline. in 1844, the new england historic genealogical society, the first organization of its kind in america, was established. by the end of the 19th century, many more genealogical societies had been formed, focusing on the collection, preservation, and publication of genealogical records.
the digital revolution
the advent of the internet and digitization in the late 20th century brought a seismic shift in genealogy. suddenly, vast databases of records became accessible from home computers, and genealogists could connect with each other to exchange information. websites like ancestry.com, launched in 1996, and familysearch, in 1999, revolutionized the accessibility and scope of genealogical research.
dna and genealogy
the 21st century brought another breakthrough: genetic genealogy. dna testing services like 23andme and ancestrydna allow individuals to discover their genetic ancestry, helping them trace their lineage in ways not possible with traditional records alone.
conclusion
from ancient civilizations to the digital era, genealogy has been a constant thread woven into the fabric of human history. the practice reflects our innate curiosity about our ancestors and where we come from, offering not only a personal connection to the past but also a broader understanding of historical and societal changes. with advancements in technology and the growing accessibility of records, the future of genealogy promises to be as exciting as its past.

the importance of land records and boundary surveys


august 8, 2023
/



strolling through our neighborhoods, we often marvel at the grandeur of some houses, the cozy charm of others, or the intricate designs of decks and outbuildings. but have you ever stopped to consider the history etched in these architectural features? behind each structure lies a wealth of information hidden in land records and boundary surveys, each serving as an historical ‘blueprint’.
unveiling architectural evolution
land records are a rich source of information for historians, architects, and curious homeowners seeking to understand the architectural evolution of their properties. these documents often reveal when buildings were erected, expanded, or remodeled. the addition of outbuildings, such as stables or sheds, can reflect changes in lifestyle or economic status. the construction of decks might indicate evolving leisure trends or improvements in living standards.
decoding community history
on a larger scale, land records and boundary surveys provide a unique lens to understand how communities have grown and changed over time. a series of records showing a sudden increase in building activity might indicate a period of economic boom. conversely, a lull could hint at economic downturns or natural disasters.
boundary surveys
a boundary survey is a process carried out by a professional land surveyor to determine the geographical location of property lines and corners on a parcel of land. the primary purpose of a boundary survey is to locate, on the ground, the boundaries of a piece of property.
here are the main components involved in a boundary survey:
research: the surveyor starts with research, examining the property’s history, previous surveys, deeds, and records related to the property.
fieldwork: the surveyor then visits the property to gather measurements. they locate and verify any existing boundary markers (like iron rods or concrete markers buried in the ground), and they measure angles and distances between these points.
analysis and map creation: the surveyor takes the gathered information back to their office to compare their findings with the researched data. they then create a map, also called a plat, of the surveyed land showing its boundaries, any easements or encroachments, and the location of structures on the property.
setting markers: in some cases, a surveyor might set new boundary markers, often metal rods driven into the ground, at the property corners or along the boundary lines.
boundary surveys are essential in various circumstances, including when buying or selling property, resolving property disputes, planning construction or development, or for regulatory compliance. they provide a clear understanding of what is owned, helping to avoid future disputes or issues related to property rights.
boundary surveys, often a critical part of land records, provide further historical insights. the shifting of property lines can reveal historical disputes, local ordinances, or changes in land use. they may also indicate periods of significant land division, as larger estates were subdivided into smaller lots, reflecting urban growth or shifts in land ownership patterns.
tracing heritage and conservation
for older buildings of historical or cultural significance, land records can assist in heritage conservation efforts. they offer a means to establish the age of a structure, its original layout, or any alterations over time, helping to ensure accurate restorations.
resolving modern disputes
besides their historical significance, land records and boundary surveys also have practical applications. they often come into play in modern disputes over property lines or building permits. having access to these records can provide clarity and resolution, preventing costly legal battles. a dallas deck builder recently got stuck in the middle of a dispute between two feuding neighbors. the issue between the two neighbors was a disagreement over where the property line started and ended. neighbor a was hoping to build a deck that extended onto what neighbor b had assumed was his property. the feud was settled using land records, a new boundary survey, and other historical documents showing the original plat of the subdivision. this feud could have spiraled out of control if not for the documents that the real estate attorneys were able to unearth.
summary
from the humblest deck to the grandest house, every structure tells a story. land records and boundary surveys are keys to unlocking these stories, offering a deeper understanding of our built environment and the historical forces that shaped it. next time you admire a building, spare a thought for the wealth of history its walls may hold. remember that each structure is not just a physical entity, but a tangible testament to the ebb and flow of human lives and societies.

the importance of land records for genealogists

genealogical research is like a compelling detective story, where each piece of evidence offers a tantalizing clue about the past. among the myriad sources available, one is often overlooked despite its rich potential: land records. these historical documents, which provide information about land ownership and transactions, offer a wealth of insights that can help bring our ancestors’ stories to life.
a wealth of information
land records encompass an array of document types: deeds, land grants, tax rolls, plat maps, homestead applications, and more. within these pages, genealogists can find detailed information about an ancestor’s financial situation, their relationships with neighbors, and even clues about their origin or migration patterns.
for instance, land grants or homestead applications can provide insights about when and why an ancestor moved to a new area. deeds, on the other hand, often include detailed descriptions of properties, shedding light on an ancestor’s lifestyle and economic status.
land records: an enduring trail
unlike many other types of records, land transactions usually leave a durable paper trail. fires, floods, or bureaucratic errors may have led to the loss of vital records like birth, marriage, and death certificates. in contrast, land records were often duplicated for legal purposes and stored in multiple locations, increasing their chances of survival.
filling the gaps
one of the main challenges in genealogical research is the inevitable occurrence of ‘brick walls’ or dead ends. this is particularly true when trying to trace female ancestors or families of lower economic status. land records, however, can often provide unexpected breakthroughs.
in many cases, property was passed down through generations or sold between family members. consequently, a deed might list a mother’s maiden name or the names of a widow’s heirs. tax rolls can reveal when a property changed hands due to a death in the family, helping to estimate dates of death when no official record exists.
cultural and historical context
land records also offer a broader historical and cultural context. they can reveal information about historical land use, community growth, migration patterns, and local events that affected your ancestors. through these records, you can gain insights into the larger forces that shaped your ancestors’ lives.
conclusion:
the search for our ancestors is more than a mere collection of names and dates; it’s a quest to understand the lives they led. land records, in their intricate detail and historical context, offer a unique window into our past. they transform genealogy from a hobby into an exploration of history, enriching our understanding of where we come from and, ultimately, who we are.
whether you’re a seasoned genealogist or a beginner just starting to trace your family roots, don’t overlook the treasure trove that is land records. they may just hold the key to unlocking your family’s past.

using land records to discover historically significant events


may 5, 2023

land records, often seen as mere legal documents detailing the purchase, sale, or transfer of property, are underutilized treasure troves of historical information. unbeknownst to many, they hold the power to uncover historically significant events that may have been lost in the annals of time. this article will guide you on how to use land records as a lens to peer into the past.
uncovering the past
land records, which include deeds, land grants, tax records, homestead applications, and more, provide much more than just details of land ownership. they are also indirect sources of historical events and changes at both local and national levels.
for example, a sudden spike in land sales may indicate a local disaster or economic downturn that forced people to sell their properties. conversely, an increase in land purchases could reflect a gold rush or the discovery of a new agricultural opportunity that attracted settlers.
linking to large-scale events
land records can also provide insight into broader historical movements and events. for example, the homestead act of 1862 in the united states led to a significant migration of families seeking new opportunities in the west. examining the homestead applications from this time can give us insights into this significant migration event.
similarly, records of land grants or sales can shed light on periods of colonial expansion, the displacement of indigenous peoples, or the distribution of land following wars or treaties.
understanding social and economic changes
tax records, a subset of land records, are particularly revealing of economic conditions. changes in tax values or frequency of unpaid taxes can hint at economic depressions, while an influx of paid taxes might suggest a period of prosperity or economic growth. the occupations listed in these records can also tell us about shifts in industry and employment over time.
piecing together local history
on a local level, plat maps and deeds can reveal the development of a town or city over time. they can show the expansion of a town, the establishment of civic buildings, roads, and railway lines. by looking at these changes, one can glean information about significant periods of growth or decline and the events that may have caused them.
land records and genealogy
from a genealogical perspective, land records can offer clues about family history in the context of historical events. for instance, if an ancestor suddenly sold a lot of land, it could indicate a reaction to a historical event, such as an economic depression or war.
conclusion
land records provide an unexpected yet invaluable pathway into the past, enabling us to discover historical events, societal changes, and economic shifts. as a primary source of historical data, they offer a unique perspective, turning faceless events into stories of real people and communities.
as you delve into the world of land records, remember that patience and a keen eye are essential. not all records will yield significant historical insights, but those that do will offer a rich and rewarding view of the past. in the end, these historical breadcrumbs can illuminate the broader canvas of our shared history, connecting the past with the present in a tangible and meaningful way.

the importance of local libraries for historical documents and information


april 3, 2023

the modern library is a hub of community learning, hosting everything from children’s story times to computer literacy classes. however, tucked away among their various roles, local libraries often safeguard a less-heralded treasure: a wealth of historical documents and information. this article explores the crucial role local libraries play in preserving and providing access to our collective past.
preservation of local history
at the heart of their communities, local libraries often take on the role of preserving regional history. they house historical documents, including personal papers, maps, photographs, newspapers, and municipal records. these locally relevant materials might not make their way into national archives or bigger libraries, yet they hold the keys to understanding the unique history and development of the community.
accessible records for all
one of the most significant roles of local libraries is providing public access to historical information. from students working on local history projects to genealogists tracing family roots, libraries offer resources that are both physical and digital. by digitizing their collections, libraries make historical records available to people worldwide, breaking down geographical barriers and expanding the reach of local history.
the genealogy goldmine
for genealogists and family historians, local libraries are invaluable. beyond books, they offer access to census records, city directories, cemetery records, and local newspapers, which often contain obituaries and other personal announcements. libraries may also have access to genealogical databases like ancestry.com or myheritage, providing patrons with resources that would be expensive to access individually.
educational programs and assistance
libraries are more than just repositories of information. they’re also centers for learning and research assistance. librarians, with their expert knowledge and research skills, guide visitors in their historical investigations. additionally, libraries often host workshops or lectures, inviting local historians or genealogy experts to share their knowledge with the community.
partnering with local historical societies
many local libraries collaborate with historical societies or similar organizations, sharing resources or co-hosting events. these partnerships result in a more comprehensive understanding of local history, encouraging community involvement and education.
a look into the future
in preserving the past, libraries also contribute to the future. by keeping historical documents safe and accessible, they ensure future generations can learn from the past. this continuity is essential for communities to understand their histories and identities.
conclusion
local libraries are unsung heroes in the preservation and dissemination of historical information. their collections offer unique, place-specific insights that are irreplaceable for researchers, genealogists, historians, and curious community members. next time you pass by your local library, remember: it’s more than a house of books; it’s a vault of historical treasures, a goldmine of local knowledge, and a key to understanding our shared past.
