i walked around with a "hillary in '96" button on my backpack when i was a student at uc davis. i mostly liked it because people would notice it and want to talk about it.  i thought it was a nice pipe dream.so here we are over a decade later and i am loving that i get emails from hillary, bill and their democratic buddies.  for example, in my inbox today i see,"dear erica,today i went back to college, and i remembered what inspired me to change the world.for me it was vietnam and the fight for civil rights. today's younger generation faces a new set of challenges: a mismanaged war in iraq, a growing national debt, a war on science, global warming -- and i see that same desire for change that i saw back when i was in school...."etcetera and so forth.i stopped reading at "a war on science".geez, do we really need to claim there is a war on or against science?  i understand fear is often a motivating factor for many people, but not me.  it turns more off...tunes me out.  i might have to go back and re-consider obama as my candidate for the primary.

	 good advice
	 
    


i have a friend that eats extremely healthy, but not in that annoying "i only shop at whole foods and eat organic and free-trade foods that will make my yuppie friends think i am cool" sort-of way.  nope. her taste buds simply prefer the good stuff...well, at least most of the time.she was watching oprah recently and wrote down a list of "super foods" they evn, oprah evangelized.  the lists are pretty good minus the four-legged animal guideline.  i like meat no matter how much i try to convince myself i shouldn't.  carnitas and carne asada are like water - a necessity.eat every week:1.  garlic2.  tomatoes (sauce)3.  olive oil4.  spinach5.  raw nuts (almonds)6.  pomegranategood oils are liquid at room temperature:1.  olive2.  sesame seed3.  canola4.  flax seed5.  grape seedfirst 5 ingredients of packaged foods should not be:1.  sugar2.  high fructose corn syrup3.  enriched white flour4.  saturated fats (four-legged animal)5.  partially hydrogenated oils6.  trans fatlabels: my_story

	 twitter has made me a lazy blogger
	 
    


i can't deny it to myself any longer.  twitter has made me a lazy blogger.  i rarely, if ever, invested much time in drafting blog posts.  i generally sat down and slammed out whatever was at the forefront of my mind (which is what i am doing now).  15 minutes after i sit down i can press a publish button and be done with it.  happy that i purged a bit of my knowledge into the black hole of the web.however, 30 seconds of my thumbs tapping at my cel phone keypad gives me a twitter of 140 character or less post - straight to the web and my friends cel phones.  i love the sound-byte quality of twitter, but am beginning to miss the depth blogging brings.i won't be giving up twitter any time soon, but i've made a tentative deal with myself to blog more often.  i guess we'll see what happens.labels: blogging, twittering
