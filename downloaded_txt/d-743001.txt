kenya photographed for website kjc
kenya was photographed in the studio for her online consulting website and this was a design mockup to see what the site could look like.




frank marini  vice president and chief information officer of tucson medical center standing at the south east entrance to tmc. the large saguaro cactus behind him in the photos is over 75 years old, the saguaro is the logo for tmc as you can see in the pin on his lapel in some of the close up shots. the uniqe single story design of tmc is spead out over the 120 acre site with native cactus gardens around the perimeter. "the idea is to have a nearly paperless health-care system at tmc, said frank marini, vice president and chief information officer. tmc's main campus is at 5301 e. grant road, near north craycroft road. retouched for imperfections. the publication was located back east and they really wanted the saguaro cactus to be in the background of the photos.




rob paulus associates employee photograph updates
rob paulus and randi dorman wanted me to shoot new head-shots for the rob paulus associates website and also a new shot of rob and randi who work together developing and renovating new projects around town. we shot on the second floor of the soon to be illegal pete's in the old landmark clothing building on university square. the staircase was not installed yet, so all the gear had to be hauled up a ladder even randi scaled the ladder in a shorter pair of high heeled shoes, rob and kenneth managed to get the chair up to the second floor as well. the lighting was a combination of sunlight mixed with strobes in a soft box and a large reflective panel to balance the light. these came out great considering we were shooting in an active construction site. if you would like me to photograph your staff or employees to update your office website contact me today.




susan dancing through life ceremonies
susan's business portrait was shot cropped off on one side as we knew thats how the website was going to be designed. the layouts on the left show design progression of the website which are laid out in photoshop so that we can finalize the design stage before we even begin building the site. when you have a personal one on one relationship with your clients like susan's business you want to have a really great photograph to personalize your site. sure you could take a photo with your phone but would it look this good?
 
what can we create for you?




mathematics professor bill mccallum at the university of arizona.  the hardest thing about shooting this photo was getting the blackboard behind him really clean, there was a lot of chalk residue to deal with and he had some fun placing some nice clean graphic back on the board i'm not sure what it all means but it was a fun portrait to take.




erick boomer is a nationally known kayaker who was heading down to mexico from canada. i was hired by mccleans magazine in canada to intercept him on the freeway so that i could shoot a photo of him before the sun set.  it was one of those lost communication things where his cell phone was dying and i was supposed to spot his truck on the freeway headed in the opposite direction about 80 miles west of here. it all worked out and i was able to shoot the images in a field out off of interstate 8 by casa grande with 15 minutes of sunlight. just enough for the shot.




this shot was created for a client who makes drill attachment that drills through glass. to create this photo we started with one inch thick glass plate and shot a real photo of the tool actually in action. we spent some time working on setting up dramatic lighting that would feature the product and its specialty. the glass was really expensive so we wanted to have it all figured out before we began. this is the main image on the front page of the products web site. the drill is turning, the water is flowing and we only had to drill one hole to get it right!




vintage neon swimmer sign on south 6th ave for the american planning association
after making several trips out to this sign it finally all came together on new years eve. the photo was for created for a story on the historic sign zoning rules and how they were changed so that these old signs could be rebuilt and updated but still preserve their original designs. when i originally arrived on site the sign timer was set too late for the ideal sky light and the light that illuminates the iconic swimmer had rotated in the wrong direction. i had the sign company come out and fix the light and the timer was reset to come on at the perfect time. i ended up shooting this image new years eve and was able to get the image to the client just in time for their deadline. cooks neon sign company worked on the  restoration of the sign.

september 26th 2015, 5:50 am on the north kaibab trail, north rim of the grand canyon
descending down the north rim of the grand canyon on the north kaibab trail. we started at at 4:10 am it was about 37 degrees at the trail head and this shot is 1/2 hour before sunrise. this photograph is shot at 25,000 asa at 1/30th of a second at f1.8 almost completely dark. while it looks light enough to see without a light it was not but just enough light to make the canyon walls show up. from lead to back, clariza her father lorrell, leanne, danielle, and geoff and i was around the bend on the other side at the end. it was my first time hiking in the grand canyon and my first time back there since 1987.




noam chomsky having a conversation with a red leather chair march 15th 2015
noam chomsky came to tucson to speak at the university of arizona centennial hall as part of the tucson festival of books. sponsored by the nation magazine and ua college of social and behavioral sciences. the talk was great and i had a good position to shoot the stage from my place in the audience. although one persons head in the crowd stuck up in the photo blocking the part of the carpet and chair. so when the performance was over i made sure i shot a photo of the empty chair and carpet so i would have the file i could use to fix the others. when i started fixing the file i realized i could put the empty red leather chair from copenhagen in place of interviewer john nichols, there by making it look like noam is having a conversation with an empty chair.
i like it! its a conceptual image of a brilliant guy, which could be used in a multitude of different stories about how chomsky thinks.

vintage nikon s4 camera w nippon kogaku 50mm 1.4 nikkor s lens.
this vintage nikon s4 camera was marked ep making it one of the rarest s4 cameras made. the s4 was made for the japanese market and only 5500 were in produced, the ep marked cameras were sold at u.s. military bases in japan and the the distance scale was marked in feet instead of meters. it was certainly a rare and beautiful rangefinder camera. it was sold on ebay and went back to japan.

a severe thunderstorm moves over thimble peak and blackettâs ridge trail above the sabino canyon recreation area. the most severe lightning storm we have seen in 10 years in tucson arizona. this image was just featured in an article in the arizona daily star newspaper. fine art photographic prints of this image are available in the storms lightning ii  section on the fine art page.




this was an advertisement for moca tucson in art forum magazine. olivier who's not really big on having his photo taken brought these painters in from out of town and they painted the car in the back of his studio. the finished car was in a show at moca titled "the artist as the collector". this advertisement, designed by david huffman ran a full page.  see the published work section for other publications.




susan wink is the artist who created this stop for the modern street car in front of time market. she hired me to shoot a series of images of the stop and i was actually able to time out a shot with the street car zooming through the image. this was the first time i had seen the street car in action as it was still in its testing phase. i have photographed other public art for tucson artists, see these  other images in commercial work.

double page ad in sports illustrated for the chicago white sox. i photographed all the players for this white sox ad campaign for energy bbdo chicago. we shot players against a plain backdrop and they held up blank white signs. i was only able to shoot each player for about three minutes so we had to everything ready to go and work really quickly. they composited this whole image from the individual my player photographs. these were used in many different ads, from the sides of buses to the ad space above your head in the elevated train.




i photographed the start of the new york city marathon from atop the verrazano narrows bridge when i lived in new york city in 1985. this photograph at the start of the marathon shows 30,000 runners who completely cover the bridge, the longest span of any bridge in america. if you have ever run in this marathon you know how dramatic the start of the race can be there are just so many runners on the bridge, some want to win some only want to cross the finish line before they collapse. this dramatic view from atop the staten island tower is 500 feet above the runners and 700 feet above the water. there is a safety railing around the top of the tower although to shoot this image i climbed over the railing and laid flat on the edge of the tower so that i could get an un obstructed view of the runners below. with luck on my side this was an unusually clear morning for the nyc marathon start it is usually foggy, rainy or hazy. this image is available for editorial and advertising publication.  i just scanned and printed my best work from the 1980s archive for a recent show at the wee gallery and now you can order these fine art photographic prints straight from my web site. look in the fine art section click on 1980âs archive color.




kore press' big read tucson, new articulations dance theatre
i really like this shot they created such a beautiful moment on stage. i shot this during rehearsal and did not even know it was going to happen. it was shot through a giant transparent screen this letter was projected upon and the dancer is lit from the side by very low light. the dancer tammy rosen is frozen in air and it was such  marginal light image it was almost impossible to capture anything. it was a beautiful performance and i really wish more of my friends had gotten a chance to see this performance. the performance featured original musical compositions by vicki brown (on violin and pedals) and new choreography by visiting artist katherine ferrier and new art choreographers kimi eisele, erika farkvam, lisa-marie mcfarlane, moriah mason, tammy rosen, and katie rutterer. costumes designed and made by barbara seyda, lighting design by don fox.
