sharing the gospel





what we do
programs
sharing the gospel






	the foundation of our ministry is sharing the good news of jesus christ through specific programs focused on evangelistic efforts.  our goal is to plant the word of god like a seed into the hearts and minds of children, hoping that we will see growth in not only their understanding of who god is but also the amazing plan that he has for their life.


	because of our generous supporters, our sunday school and summer camp programs are dynamic, energized, gospel-driven programs designed to help children develop vibrant, life-changing and personal relationships with god.



	urban outreach programs








summer camp
at summer camp, we get to take the children out of their environment, rebuild their hope, minister to their lives, and have a life-changing impact.

sunday school
every year we run multiple sunday school semesters all across the globe with around 300,000 children in attendance.  these fun and exciting programs are evangelistic outreaches in all of the different communities that we serve; from street corners in new york to school assemblies in kenya.  for many of our children, along with the message of the gospel, sunday school is the highlight of their week, providing a positive alternative to many of the negative influences that constantly surround them.
