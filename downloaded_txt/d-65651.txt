what is a national wildlife refuge?


you might be surprised to learn that national wildlife refuges are different than national parks. the national wildlife refuge system is the only system of federal lands devoted specifically to wildlife. while national wildlife refuges provide recreational opportunities for people, they also provide habitat for more than 700 species of birds, 220 species of mammals, 250 reptile and amphibian species, and more than 1,000 species of fish.  more than 380 threatened or endangered plants or animals are protected on wildlife refuges. each year, millions of migrating birds use refuges as stepping stones while they fly thousands of miles between their summer and winter homes. learn more about america's national wildlife refuge system at fws.gov/refuges.
