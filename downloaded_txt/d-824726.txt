	 u.s. troops land at normandy
	 
    


perhaps at no other time is theamerican flag recognized as aninspiring symbol of freedomthan in war.since the revolution, old glory hasproudly flown in battle, instillingcourage and pride in the heartsof american troops who haverisked their lives for their country.one of the most horrific battles everfaced by u.s. armed forces happenedduring world war ii when alliedforces invaded normandy.on june 6,1944-d-day-some 5,000ships carrying over 150,000 alliedtroops steamed across theblustery english channel toward theforbidding beaches of normandy.invasion forces included thebritish-canadian sector on gold,juno and sword beaches,and the american sector on utahand omaha beaches.by dawn, u.s. infantrymen were wadingthrough chest-high water and cloudsof artillery smoke.on utah beach, american troopswere accompanied by 33-ton shermantanks that were floated ashore ininflatable canvas covers.to the relief of the allies, there wasvery little german opposition.but on omaha beach, the u.s. v corpscame up against the battle-hardenedgerman 352nd infantry division.most of the american tanks and artillerynever made it to the beach, sinkingin the choppy water.using only light weapons, infantrymenwere required to carry out a frontalassault on heavily fortifiedgerman positions.by the end of the day,despite the high number of casualties,the americans held a precariousbeachhead six miles long and lessthan two miles deep a holdthey would not relinquish.to honor the brave men who gavetheir lives on that fateful day,old glory proudly waves acrossamerica every year onjune 6 in their memory.happy stamping.

	 is it right
	 
    


let me ask you this do you think it is rightthat they post office sells every stampthey get in of a issue to one person?budrow@highland.netand if that ant bad enough it wasnot just at one post office this person,we will call them wilsonwent to every post office in our countyand the next county and bought everysheet they had of the birthday stampsthat was issued on june 23.so in order for wilson to do thatthey had to visit every post officein just two day'sso by the 26th there was nobirthday stamps to be found.every post office i and others went toor called they all told me the samething that wilson had came in andbought every one they had.so me and a couple of other collectorswas not able to get the stamps till july13th and then we had to make a trip totennessee to get the only five sheetsthat the robbins post office had left.i guess you are wondering why this hasupset me so well for any one that doesthere own first day cover knows thatyou only have 30 day to mail yourstamped covers to the postmaster inthe city where the stamps was released. they do look at the post marks to see whenit was put in to the mail system if the postmark is 31 or 32 after the stamp was issuedthere is these big chance that you will getthe covers back not severest.i feel like that any body that is going to buythat many stamps of a single issuedthe postmaster should order them for theperson is stead of giving all of the firstshipment he gets of a stamp to themi kind of think he is not think about thecollects in his community when he didthat know go and well that they collectorswould be in asking for them.i would like to know what you think aboutthis should the postmaster think aboutthe collectors or should it be first comefirst severed even if you are buying everysheet he has got on hand and it will leavenot for collectors or any one else that wantsthe stamps to use on there mailings.budrow@highland.netto sum it up i feel like the postmastershould have ordered the stamps for wilsonand let collectors and other have a chanceto get a sheet for there self.happy stamping.not to happy when you have todeal with things like this.it sure would be nice if we had abig city post office here in themountains.you know one of those that havea philatelic window where onecan buy all kinds of stuff.

collection of stamps depictingthe story of football in all its charm and glory,especially the world cup, was released here today.kerala minister for fisheries s sarma,released the book at a function

by playing video games,predicting match winnersberlin: everything seems to have gone digital,even trading stamps at the world cup.what was once a children's hobby of collectingand pasting stamps in a book can now be doneelectronically in a computer only this is free,without the glue, and it's brought to you bythe same company best known for the pastime.coca-cola's world cup web site,www.coca-cola.com/footballfeatures a virtual panini sticker album,where registrants can earn stamps with players'pictures, stats and biographical detail,trade them, and watch their collection grow.i have singed up to collect my."we have a good mixture of youthexperiencing panini sticker albumsfor the first or second time," said coke's global marketingspokesman philipp bodentza."i'm 38, and i remember my panini collection.it's fun to see all pictures fromthe previous tournaments, as well."the album is a collaboration of coke,an official world cup sponsor;panini, the italy-headquartered company thathas been producing soccer sticker albumssince 1961 and world cup versions since 1970;and white plains, n.y.-based tokenzone, inc.,which developed the software to allowfans to collect and trade stamps in 11 languages."one of the nice things, with 11 different languages,is it interfaces with the different languages,so you can trade with someone, say, in japan," tokenzone president isaac arias said.after registering, visitors to the site earnstamps by various methods.they get three stamps every four hours,provided they log in again; get stamps forplaying video games on the site,both against the computer and against other players;for watching tv commercials for coke's"rivalidades" world cup ad campaign;downloading screen savers and wallpaper;answering trivia questions; inviting others to join;and predicting the winners of matches.some players' stickers are rarer than others,and collectors get duplicates.these can be exchanged in the trading roomwith other collectors from around the world.there are about 600 players in the virtual album,but collectors need only accumulate100 designated players to automaticallyget the whole set.one-to-five players per team are designated,and once the handful of players per teamare collected, the remainder of theentire team is downloaded.italy's gianluigi buffon and alessandro nesta,and france's zinedine zidane and fabien barthezare among the designated players.there's bad news for fans of the u.s. team,which is the only one of the 32 world cup sides not included; panini's couldn't securethe rights to american
