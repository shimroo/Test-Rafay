heuristics

kahneman and tversky originally identified three general purpose heuristics: availability, representativeness and anchoring and adjustment.


the following taxonomy is derived from:
page 17 of "introduction - heristics and biases: then and now", written by thomas gilovich and dale griffin
in: heuristics and biases: the psychology of intuitive judgment, edited by thomas gilovich, dale griffin and daniel kahneman, 2002.


general purpose heuristics:

affect
availability
causality
fluency
similarity
surprise


special purpose heuristics:

attribution substitution
outrage
prototype
recognition
choosing by liking
choosing by default




old (now superseded) heuristics:

representativeness (replaced by attribution-substitution (prototype heuristic and similarity heuristic)
anchoring and adjustment (replaced by the affect heuristic)
