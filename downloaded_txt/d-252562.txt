"bob is amazing—he does a large volume of sales in the area and has years of expertise (this is very obvious as he has a wealth of knowledge about real estate transactions).   my san leandro home received multiple offers, all above asking price, and we closed escrow in less than a month, with a sale price over what we had listed it at. overall, bob and his team did a fantastic job and i would not hesitate in contacting him again for any future sale or purchase of real estate."stephan lee
