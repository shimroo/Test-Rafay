why promotional products?
every small business wrestles with getting their brand noticed in the crowded, noisy commercial environment we find ourselves in.
we get it.
but, we have a secret weapon!
a well-chosen promotional product creates brand identity, builds a relationship with your tribe, and generates goodwill for years to come. and does it for a fraction of the cost of other advertising.
sound crazy? 
i was given a branded, high-quality 10' metal tape measure by a vendor when i was a product development engineer, more than 30 years ago. i used it every day; it became one of my favorite tools. it went missing in a move years ago and i'm still bummed. but, to this day i have great warmth toward the company it came from and would go there first if i was looking for their type of products. 
well-targeted promotional products aren't just advertisements that flicker across a screen. they become part of our lives. 
if you want your brand to become part of the lives of your clients, donors, conference attendees or prospective customers, let us help you find the perfect product for your message!
