clippings and content

*we have discovered 2 problems in our clippings and content section that we are working on to rectify:
some of our listings are more than 1 page and are not priced per page, but just a flat rate price. those items will be filled as 1 page unless arrangements are made to purchase the additional pages. we will contact you via email to let you know if something you ordered is more than 1 page. 
we also have images on our website for purchase. unfortunately, we are currently not able to locate all of the originals and many are online with a watermark on them, which is our only copy.
please contact us via email at dodgejeffersongensoc@gmail.com if you would like to purchase a picture or have any questions for us. we are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause you.
