 a child is missing, inc., operates as a 501(c)(3) non-profit assisting law enforcement agencies in florida and across the nation with cases of missing children, the elderly, the disabled, and other vulnerable individuals. while amber alert focuses on abducted children, specially trained technicians of a child is missing activate alert calls and alert texts in the area where the missing person was last seen with personalized and specific details. we initiate 1,000+ calls to homes and businesses nearby with information of the missing person that concludes with instructions on how to reach the law enforcement agency with any information or sightings. in our 27 years of service, this unique alert program has been invaluable to law enforcement agencies, assisting in over 70,000 missing person cases. the state of florida discontinued our funding for this “essential service” to florida law enforcement agencies. and with law enforcement funding also in jeopardy, not all agencies have been able to make a financial contribution toward continuing our operation; still, many have committed to support our mission and given us funds out of their own dwindling budgets. a child is missing, inc., wishes to continue this vital, “essential tool” to law enforcement and our communities; but we need your help! we are in a time when the officers and deputies need a reliable resource, such as ours, more than ever. if you can help support or would like more information on our a child is missing alert program, call us at (954) 763-1288, to discuss how we can work together to continue to assist law enforcement in the search and recovery of our missing children, the elderly, and other vulnerable individuals. donate on our website: www.achildismissing.org or call us today!

our mission and goals










a child is missing, inc. (acim) is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization. a child is missing alert program and recovery center assists law enforcement agenicies nationwide in the early search and recovery of missing children (often with autism, down syndrome), the elderly (often with alzheimer’s disease, dementia), disabled persons, on-campus college students and other vulnerable populations, in the first hours of their disappearance.  acim has no jurisdictional restraints.  our alert program is available to law enforcement 24/7, 365 days a year. pursuant to our mission in safeguarding communities through our alert program, the staff of a child is missing, inc. developed our c.s.e.p. (child safety education programs), which provide vital education to children and adolescents who otherwise might not receive this personal safety, awareness of bullying, internet dangers, and effective communication instruction. our experienced teachers deliver these programs to children ages 5 through 17, in collaboration with existing parks and recreation departments, public, private and alternative schools, social services agencies and the department of juvenile justice. as law enforcement calls to acim for assistance in locating the missing increase, so too do new forms of danger to children and adolescents increase. in the past “stranger danger” was an effective way to teach children to be safe, but now we know significant harm can be done to children by people with whom they are familiar.  strangers no longer exist only on the outside, they can now enter our homes, anytime  day or night, through the internet.  these facts, and so many more, have resulted in the need to update current information and construct new, more effective safety and prevention information in its place.  this is the goal of our c.s.e.p. programs.every year, millions of children and adolescents in the united states are impacted upon by abuse, exploitation, neglect and violence in their homes, schools and communities.  they are often placed in dangerous situations or place themselves in danger; they are often not safe and do not know how to keep themselves safe.  just a few examples… ·         nearly 800,000 children younger than 18 (797,500) were reported missing in a one-year period of time, resulting in an average of 2,185 children being reported missing each day.·         1 in 3 girls and 1 in 5 boys will be sexually abused before their 18th birthday.·         90% of children with a disability will be sexually assaulted in their lifetime and only 1-3% of those cases will ever be brought to light. ·         approximately 1 in 7 youth online (ages 10 to 17) will receive a sexual solicitation/approach over the internet.·         approximately 5,000 runaway youth die due to assault, illness or suicide each year. ·         82% of suspected incidents of human trafficking in the u.s constituted sex trafficking; 40% of these incidents contained allegations of prostitution/sexual exploitation of a child.·         nearly 1 in 3 students is involved in bullying.·         while school violence as a whole is declining, bullying behaviors have increased by 5%, with 86% of public schools reporting one or more incidents of violence or theft due to intimidation/bullying. how much better served will our most vulnerable citizens be if we are able to prevent, or at the very least minimize, their exposure to abuse, neglect and violence through open channels of communication provided by the a child is missing child safety education programs?  will they then be better equipped to learn, to live and to grow into thriving, productive adults?  a child is missing believes so.  our commitment to public safety and support of law enforcement continues through our educational awareness and prevention programs; and, we continue to strive to diminish the public’s exposure to violence and help ensure their safety in potentially dangerous situations.so, how do we keep our children and adolescents safe?  a child is missing, inc. believes that educational and prevention programs that enhance community awareness and community involvement will help ensure their safe-keeping.  but, we must also give these vulnerable youth the skill-sets they need to help ensure their own safety.  we must couple adult awareness with self-empowerment tools for children and adolescents.
