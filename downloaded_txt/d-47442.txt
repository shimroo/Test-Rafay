gloria estefan joins andy garcia in father of the bride remake movie!




a resounding yes was my answer to the invitation to join my good friend, the incredibly talented andy garcia, for this new and wonderfully warm and funny incarnation of the classic, "father of the bride"! i've been a fan of director, gaz alazraki, since i saw his record breaking comedy, "nosotros los nobles" and can't wait to experience how he brings this amazing script by matt lopez to life.

mi respuesta fue un "si" contundente al recibir la invitaci√≥n para acompa√±ar a mi buen amigo, el talentoso andy garc√≠a, en una nueva encarnaci√≥n, llena de humor, coraz√≥n y mucho sabor, de la pel√≠cula cl√°sica, "father of the bride"! admiro mucho al director, gaz alazraki desde que vi su comedia que rompi√≥ records, "nosotros los nobles" y estoy muy entusiasmada de participar y ver c√≥mo el le da vida a este guion fenomenal de matt l√≥pez.

lin-manuel miranda's animated musical movie 'vivo' moves to netflix!

i am thrilled to be part of this heartwarming film!! can't wait for everyone to see it!

meet vivo, a musically-gifted kinkajou who embarks from havana to miami on a quest to deliver a love song! coming soon to @netflixfilm

"inspired by the words and music of lin-manuel, quiara and alex, hundreds of artists at sony pictures animation worked through uncharted and difficult times, bringing passion and beauty to every frame of the film. and as a musical, vivo is a love letter to latin music and this movie couldn't exist without the heartfelt work of our vocal talent, including gloria estefan, juan de marcos, zoe saldana, brian tyree henry, ynairaly simo and many others. i speak for everyone who helped make vivo when i say we couldn't be happier that our film can soon be enjoyed safely by millions of families on netflix." - kirk demicco, director
