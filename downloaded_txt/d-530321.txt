the scientific focus of the comprehensive alcohol-hiv/aids research center (carc)
                        at the lsu health sciences center in new orleans is to conduct cutting edge basic
                        research on the impact of unhealthy alcohol use and hiv disease pathogenesis and risk
                        of comorbidities.  our goal is to use a bidirectional translational approach to accelerate
                        the translation of key basic and applied research findings on alcohol and hiv to clinical
                        practice. the carc provides an integrated scientific and administrative research infrastructure
                        for interdisciplinary collaboration in the design and conduct of studies at the cutting
                        edge of alcohol and hiv/aids science and in training of biomedical researchers focused
                        on alcohol and associated comorbidities.
