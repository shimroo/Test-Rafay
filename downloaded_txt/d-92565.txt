hi, i’m polly singer and i am here to help you.





a little about the hats…
my hats bring joy to those who wear them. each hat is unique and tells a story.  clients tell me they feel fabulous and beautiful in my hats.  much to my great joy, i was selected as “america’s best couture hat designer”.




my love of tea inspired me…
one loyal fan calls my tea “happiness in a cup”.  i have had a lifelong passion for tea.  my love of travel inspired many blends such as audrey’s french beret and earl grey’s top hat.  our teas have been featured in “tea time”, “southern lady” and “kentucky monthly”.




attend one of our events!
combining hats and tea creates fabulous events!  ladies love dressing up and attending my etiquette teas.  i have presented on a variety of topics for corporate groups, tea shops, nonprofit and fundraising galas.  we also coordinate teas in private homes for bridal showers, holidays and birthdays.
