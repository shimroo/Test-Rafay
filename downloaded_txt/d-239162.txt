bf's quick guide to nailing big fish on the keys bridges
lesson 1
snook and tarpon fishing on the keys bridges at night on live shrimp
rod of choice 7 foot custom but a penn slammer or something of that nature works well.
reel of choice spinning reel, shemano bait runner 6500 spooled with 15lb test or 20lb line, i prefer 15lb. 
other reels penn 650 or anything of this size.
leader 40 or 50 lb test mono, i use 40lb test
live shrimp is good for tarpon and snook at night, freelined, with a split shot on out going tide produces the most fish.
cast out into the bay "gulf side and allow current to bring back and go under bridge, bite will happen either just before or at bridge straight down, if it happens under bridge good chance it's a nice eating size mangrove 2lbs or more, i believe others will concur "always wanted to use that word"lol.

quick guide to running with the fall migratory run
the big fish, at this time, are out for the hunger and sport of it with the water just filled with food. at times i have seen so many mullet for so far you could see the swells came in with hundreds of little heads and tails swishing around. as a big fish would creep up from below they would all at once move like the wave in a stadium.
watching at night with shoreline light it is quite a sight to see huge silver sides enveloping waves of white from all the mullet splashing up as far as you could see with the darkness of the night sky in the back ground and the sounds of the fish remarkable and unforgetable.

when fishing at this time it comes in bursts and i always have a back up rigged rod so if i get cut or something i am ready because it can be fast and furious. there is more follow this link

august 2020 broward county south florida boatless fishing report forecast 
happy independence day, july is here and the kids are loose -schools out- time to keep our kids busy. this month is great for early morning fishing trips to the beach, pier or jetty and finish the morning off with swimming time.



best bait for the shallow areas is fresh pieces of shrimp or live ones on smaller hooks, size 4 or 6 on a chicken rig this is a great rig for kids rods and you will find roaming those areas sand perch, lane snapper, small jack crevalle, blue runners these should make them happy if they are biting.



more and more tarpon are passing heading north everyday now and should peak out this month. most should be busy catching mangrove and lane snapper off our piers this month they will increase in numbers as the summer bait builds up through the month, mutton snapper have started to be caught with a little more consistency around the piers with hard bottom or reef.



this is a great month to target barracuda they stack up in the clear water along the shadow lines and on the sandy bottoms, a steel leader and using a live bait will get them fired up, i also like tube lures aka cuda killers cast out and retrieve in fast while jigging in and if they are hungry you are on.



baits this month in our water should be pilchards, greenies thread herring small ballyhoo, goggle eye, maybe some resident mullet moving.
