hello to my a’ area peoples,
so ya it’s almost valentine’s day, and we know it’s cliche hallmark holiday and all that but let’s try not to get totally jaded by a celebration of love. cause, imho, love is simply the greatest. cultivating, expressing, receiving, giving, growing love is probably the greatest thing you’ll do in your life time.
amiright?  our party saturday is for cultivating some lovely, playful, sexy vibes, and besides the inherent fun in that endeavor, i’m in a community =’s sanity mode, so i’m very much looking forward to seeing you awesome party peeps looking and feeling fine.  please join us at deep red. we’re gonna make it look and feel like a warm inviting space and obvi the sights and sounds will be on point.
