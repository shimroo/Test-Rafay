"we
                                      use these screws in my research lab here
                                      at stanford university. our research field
                                      involves manipulating single atoms and
                                      molecules. but the connection with your
                                      rack mount thumb screws is that we use
                                      racks full of commercial and custom built
                                      electronics for our control systems, and
                                      we are constantly reconfiguring equipment
                                      to adapt to new experiments and to test
                                      new strategies. these screws have been
                                      fantastic in keeping things running
                                      smoothly in the lab on a day-to-day basis,
                                      and also quite helpful when we have to
                                      install and move around heavier pieces of
                                      rack-mount equipment."

" 
							my position at cisco requires that i move many 
							pieces of equipment almost every day. the rack 
							release system allows me the freedom of mobility as 
							well as the convenience of rack mounting equipment 
							that is not in use. the design of the mounting 
							screws as well as the ease of assembly allow for 
							quick installation and tear down (often with nothing 
							more than my fingers). you have made my job much 
							easier. thanks for a great product!"
