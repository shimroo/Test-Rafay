next torah portion







						summary					


in this torah portion, moses details many of god’s laws to the israelites. these include laws about worshiping other gods, kashrut, business ethics and treatment of animals. god outlines the details of three holidays: passover, shavuot and sukkot. god provides an angel to protect the israelites from their enemies and warns the israelites not to worship other gods. moses ascends mount sinai to meet with god for 40 days and 40 nights, leaving aaron and hur in charge.

study


				7 ways the torah can actually sharpen your mind			


engaging with torah is like yoga for the mind: it keeps our perspectives flexible and creativity strong. 









ask the expert


				ask the expert: do all religions worship the same god?			


jews don’t have a monopoly on god, but we do privilege and prefer our own access. 









jewish languages


				similar jewish words you don’t want to mix up			


from kibbitz/kibbutz to mitzvah/mikveh, we round up some easily confused hebrew and yiddish terms. 









bible


				who was moses in the bible?			


the greatest jewish prophet led the israelites out of egypt and received the torah at sinai, but he never entered the promised land. 









spirituality


				how to talk to god			


the hasidic prayer practice of hitbodedut — talking to god freely in one’s native tongue — helps to build intimacy over time. 









beliefs & practices


				tikkun olam: repairing the world			


this phrase with kabbalistic roots has come to connote social justice.
