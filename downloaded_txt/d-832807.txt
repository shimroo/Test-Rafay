serving our youth: rancho cielo youth campus






rancho cielo youth campus in salinas ca, has a 20 year track record of successfully turning around troubled youth, and carmel by the sea rotary club has been a big supporter since their inception. today, under a rotary international global grant, our club is developing a new classic & antique car repair vocational training program at rancho cielo. monterey county is an epicenter for classic & antique cars, yet the restoration skill set is “aging out” and no vocational training exists on how to repair these cars - until now!
