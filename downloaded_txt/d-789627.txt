rich meredith
the hudson gardens & event center
i‚Äôm writing to compliment the crew members that worked the super diamond and etheridge concerts.  both were extremely smooth operations, no issues, no concerns, and significant high praise from both tours.  the etheridge tour was especially complimentary.  from top to bottom ‚Äì tour manager, production, audio, hospitality, etc. they sung high praises for rhino.


scott beelman

i could not be happier with the crew and leadership from kent (yeomans) as well as the general attitudes and experience levels from the crew that was on this event. it really made the whole event run smooth and ahead of schedule. i appreciate the partnership and look forward to many more successful events in the future with rhino.
