testimonials 



what our customers are saying 









what a wonderful experience! we had a major remodel of a kitchen, master bathroom, and kid’s bathroom. andrea was simply amazing. she was honest (kept me on budget) and had wonderful ideas.





michelle o’fallon








i worked with my rsi designer for almost an entire year on the design. she was helpful about suggesting something she thought i would like and never complained when i changed something yet again. i wouldn’t hesitate to recommend rsi to anyone redoing a project. she started out as my designer and finished as my friend!





diana wildwood








hollie has always been great. she gives attention to me as if i am a friend. she remains neutral unless i demand her personal opinion. i have used her now for three jobs and will continue to!





christy south county








kelly was all the typical things that people say in positive reviews – professional, knowledgeable, friendly, prompt, and thorough. but, she was more than that. she demonstrated intuition and knew what we liked and what didn’t match our style. she didn’t attempt to oversell, which actually resulted in us wanting to do business with her because we trusted her. the end result... a beautiful bathroom that makes me smile every time i see it!





cathi south county








it was a pleasure working with cindie and rsi. you have such a great selection of products to choose from, and cindie was very patient with us while we made up our minds. she is very knowledgeable and was very helpful through the whole project. we are looking forward to working with her and rsi when we start our kitchen remodel.





don & susan grantwood village








alex was wonderful! professional and yet warm and friendly. she planned our kitchen perfectly! the major renovation of our kitchen went smoothly and with no problems. she kept our budget in mind and still gave us a spectacular kitchen.
