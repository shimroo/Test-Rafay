about us



















“having a firm that literally wrote the book on construction defect claims, with current experience against the very same builder, was extremely beneficial to our community. the miller law firm kept the board and our owners informed while the claim was pending. that was important to us as a community and eased the burden on the board. recovering this amount in only 13 months is a testament to finding the right legal team to take us through the process.”martha donahue • board of directors of the peninsula real association
