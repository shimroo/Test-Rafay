tragic: liar frank andrews shimkus loses re-election bid





liar – and potential perjurer – frank andrews shimkus failed to get re-elected to the pennsylvania house of representatives, meaning the former wyou news director will have to take his diploma-mill advanced degrees and find work elsewhere.given what has been exposed about his conduct as a state representative (hogging the per diems, crashing all the state cars, the residence issue, the potential perjury issue) it would be interesting to look more into his conduct at wyou, especially as it connects with his political ambitions.

"fearless: the richard a. sprague story" coming to bookstores soon!





(note: this will be the most carefully-written blog post in american history.) while it isn't labeled as such, what appears to be the official/authorized biography of richard a. sprague is on its way to bookstores, courtesy of our friends at the american bar association."richard a. sprague's philosophy holds that the law is sacred in this land, and as a lawyer he has always had the solemn obligation to fight as hard as he could to make the law serve his client, whether the client be the people of the united states, the people of pennsylvania, or an individual caught up in the system," the blurb on the aba site says. "read this compelling story of a man who wasn't afraid to risk everything to fight for his fellow man and made a difference in the legal profession."in short: the perfect secret santa gift for john murphy!

"the project isn't as ambitious as it sounds"





all of you who thought you'd never see the times leader try to break into the scranton market: these are strange days indeed. after scrantonedition.com soft-launched a few weeks ago, real printed editions of the times leader's "scranton edition" hit the streets today.does this qualify as a shot across the bow of the lynetts? more like a pea shooter. or maybe just a dirty look. the content was amazingly thin, rewritten press releases and repurposed w-b copy. as scott wasser told the troops in a memo, "the project isn't as ambitious as it sounds." readers have no reason to doubt him so far.>> read rich connor's hearty hello to the people of lackawanna county>> read managing editor scott wasser's memo to the troops

"i could have overruled but didn’t because i believe our process was democratic, the decision a mirror of what appears to be the sentiment of many persons, perhaps even a majority," connor writes, "and because i respect the intellectual honesty of the members of our editorial endorsement board."

more on the 'kill him' controversy at scranton's palin rally





• the times-tribune reports more about what reporter dave singleton heard and where he heard it• “tl story draws national interest,” the tl reports, noting that their initial story drew more than 200,000 page views• singleton tells propublica that a secret service flack has suggested that the story should never have been published• singleton's reporting isn't good enough for university of scranton journalism professor matthew reavy, who calls the death threat story "unsupported" on his blog

times leader: no one to corroborate times-tribune report of "kill him" at palin rally





fight! the times-tribune of scranton reported that someone yelled "kill him" at the sarah palin rally in scranton on tuesday. the threat was national news, and was fodder for keith olbermann's show that night. andrew seder and the times leader hit back hard, all but calling the story a fabrication. the story quotes the local secret service boss as being "baffled" by the times-tribune story. reporter dave singleton and metro editor jeff sonderman are both namechecked. the times-tribune also has a story about the secret service investigation of the threat, but omits the agency's skepticism. discuss.
