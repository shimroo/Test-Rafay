what others have to say about us! 



what others have tosay about us! 














						23 years later, there are still fruit under that first net. when a hole unravel. holes can easily be fixed.
appears, the net doesn’t run like a stocking, and neither does it
i am very satisfied with knittex. their nets protect my harvest.
