from past to presentnew college berkeley (ncb) was founded in 1979 by dr. david gill and rev. dr. earl palmer as a center for advanced christian studies to provide students and working professionals with courses and conferences to “think christianly” in their vocational lives. in 1994 (“ncb 2.0”), dr. susan phillips introduced a needed emphasis on spiritual formation for cultivating souls centered in god. today, under the leadership of executive director dr. craig wong, “ncb 3.0” builds on these two pillars to connect the body - across culture, tradition and generation - to pursue truth, cultivate spiritual friendship, and discern what it means to live faithfully at a significant cultural inflection point for nation and world.
