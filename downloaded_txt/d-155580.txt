as the sun slips away, dallas-fort worth boots up with loads of nocturnal low-down at entertainment districts from deep ellum to the stockyards.

dallas -- motto "live large. think big."  -- packs attitude for diverse sports, culinary, and club action. greenville avenue, both upper and lower, attracts an eclectic mix for good times at modest pubs and eateries. stan's blue note, a greenville favorite, has 100 types of bottled beer, 50 draft options, and outside patios for tracking street action. terilli's serves up italian fare and live jazz thursday through saturday evenings, and café nostra ranks as a hot spot for wrapping up a long night out. deep ellum, a center for blues artists since the 20s, has broadened appeal for live music and trendy watering holes. the knox side of knox-henderson, a two-mile stretch near downtown, features popular bars and restaurants, with the old monk, drawing a loyal following for fish, chips and imported beer. downtown's purgatory, with five levels, has a martini bar and a vip lounge, and gilley's, with its famed mechanical bull, keep things rocking. uptown's uptown bar and grill is a karaoke destination, and the west end historic district has more than 100 popular shops, restaurants, and nightclubs.

in fort worth, sundance square is a magnet for out-on-the-town revelry for nightclubs, restaurants, movies, and live theater. up north in the stockyards, plenty of action brews in western-style saloons. as a fort worth stronghold, billy bob's texas, billing itself as the world's largest honky tonk, attracts  hordes from around town and out of town. 

music plays a texas-sized role throughout dallas-fort worth, with performances in venues from roadhouses to concert halls. set for 2009 completion: the $275-million dallas center for the performing arts, with world-class stages for opera, ballet, broadway road shows and more.
