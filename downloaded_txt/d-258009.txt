bounce back from the ups and downs of family caregiving



introducing the bounce back podcast series



give yourself some well-deserved time to do something just for you…listen to my conversations with special guests, who care deeply about family caregivers and understand the issues we deal with day in and day out. these podcasts get personal as we talk about important topics that all family caregivers face.we candidly chat about how to work through guilt when you make self-care a priority, ways to find community, and approaches to creating personal boundaries – something that took me a decade as a family caregiver to truly understand and begin to adopt. the more you practice some of the proven and helpful life tools you’ll hear about, the easier it will be to bounce back after a particularly grueling day, especially when personal control feels like it’s flying out the window.

about victor imbimbo















my family caregiving experiences began in the wee hours of the morning on saturday, february 2, 2002. like most family caregivers, i was totally unprepared for how this responsibility would change my life and the choices i had to make to determine the life i would live. “choice” is not a throwaway term. in my opinion, it is the backbone of having the life you desire rather than one that falls short on many levels. lucky for me, curiosity has always been a particularly important trait. this curiosity has led me down a twenty-year path of studying what motivates the day-to-day behavior of family caregivers, the psychology behind it, the physical toll it takes to persevere, and why we all make the choices we do. through market research, conversations with thousands of fellow family caregivers, and my very personal story, my hope is to be a beacon to help guide you to better understand and embrace the many choices you have to experience a healthier and happier family caregiver journey.
