joann was exceptional when we were looking for a place on a lake.  
showed us several properties.  no pressure towards any, just pros and 
cons for each place.  after we bought, she has been a wealth of 
information as we were new to the area and she had so many good 
referrals.  thank you joann for such an enjoyable experience!
