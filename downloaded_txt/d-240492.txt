"the fundamental basis of this nation's laws was given to moses on the mount.  the fundamental basis of our bill of rights comes from the teachings we get from exodus and st. matthew, from isaiah and st. paul. i don't think we emphasize that enough these days.  if we don't have a proper fundamental moral background, we will finally end up with a totalitarian government which does not believe in the rights for anybody except the state". - president harry s. truman, attorney general's conference, 1950

prayer of president george washingtonon june 8, 17831:14

"god who gave us life gave us liberty. and can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are of the gift of god? that they are not to be violated but with his wrath? indeed, i tremble for my country when i reflect that god is just; that his justice cannot sleep forever." - thomas jefferson, 1781 (engraved on the jefferson memorial)

there is a needed change in the thinking of many americans (black and white). how can we hold our hands to our hearts, pledge our lives to a country and to a set of laws that contains the phrase "that all men are created equal" and yet look down on people based on the color of their skin or the land of their birth? how can people who have been so treated still follow hate-mongers who claim to be 'reverend' but only want to keep the race-divide alive for their own political and financial gain? who want to keep their people as slaves to a government with 'free-stuff' just to keep the power.this movement  still has a long way to go. may this dream someday be seen by all.
be sure to ignore the fact that the mlk memorialin washington d.c. was made in communist china bythe designer, communist lei yixin, a sculptor ofthe people's republic of china with stone fromgreece and installed in washington d.c.by communist chinese workers. also ignore the factthat a certain senator-turned-president (in 2008)from chicago approved of this contract.(guess no black americans were available)statue had to be 'repaired' at a cost ofnearly $1-million to correct mis-quotechiseled in on one side

"our government rests upon religion. it is from that source that we derive our reverence for truth and justice, for equality and liberty, and for the rights of mankind.  unless the people believe in these principles they cannot believe in our government." - president calvin coolidge, october 15, 1924
