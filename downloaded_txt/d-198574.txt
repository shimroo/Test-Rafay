          need a printed manual for your camera?
        

          just search for your model of camera in the search box above. 
        


          have you just realised that the manual for your camera is only available online? you want a printed version but, 
          because it is hundreds of pages long, it will cost you a fortune to print it yourself. 
        

          place an order and we'll send you a top-quality printed and bound manual by return.
          our manuals are supplied in a5 paperback book size - 5.8 x 8.3 in (148 x 210 mm).
          these are both portable and easy to read.
        






        the manuals can be either perfect or spiral bound. spiral binding is stronger, opens completely flat and is recommended for larger manuals.  
	      the manual will have a clear acetate front cover and a white card back cover.
