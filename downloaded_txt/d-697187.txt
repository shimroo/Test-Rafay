mendocino is a destination perfect for enjoying the northern california coast. the quaint village, reminiscent of a new england town, has many boutique shops, art galleries, and charming restaurants. hiking at the mendocino headlands state park is adjacent to the village. the pt. cabrillo lighthouse and the mendocino coast botanical gardens are two popular attractions less than 15 minutes away.
