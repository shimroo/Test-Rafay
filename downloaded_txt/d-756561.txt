i trusted shaun to sell my beebe carson city collection.  he gave solid advice and achieved fast results.   i now collected randomly and appreciate shaun’s objectivity.  he’s even talked me out of buying some of his coins when he felt they weren’t right for me.  am grateful for his professionalism and along the way he became a good friend.

i would like to express my sincere thanks to shaun bobb at mike’s coin chest for all of the wonderful assistance he provided in helping reach my goal of putting together one of the, “top 5 all time finest” pcgs registry sets of morgan silver dollars with major varieties. 
     shaun has one of the best “eyes” for choosing high quality coins. many of my purchases from him received substantial upgrades, resulting in both improving my registry set standing and at the same time increasing the value of my entire set. shaun not only provided valuable insight during my collecting experience, he also became a great friend. he is a true professional with the utmost integrity and honesty and will always have my trust and respect.
all the best to you shaun in the future.  


jim s. - the jcs collection


























 
i started collecting again in the mid 90’s and when attending my first major shows i came across mike’s coin chest (mcc) table. even though i was fresh to the scene, i could tell this table was nice and different. purchased a couple of flashy cc morgans from mike that day which essentially began the long relationship that continues today. years later shaun started showing up at the mcc table and developing the eye for the quality that i recognized for mcc. i would see mike and shaun at many show and always stop to check the inventory and talk. however, the coin market at the time was changing in a few ways and one significant one, that is known by many names, was the internet. while shaun was attending most all the major shows and learning the bourse scene, he also brought mcc into the internet world with a new mcc website. now i could check mcc inventory at home. today mcc still maintains the same eye appealing coins and nice table setup that attracted me over 2 decades ago. shaun is at the shows to answer any questions or just talk or if i wish to shop mcc on-line and have a question, i can give him a call.

i have known shaun for over 10 years.  shaun has been invaluable in obtaining the morgan dollars i have needed to build the number one morgan dollar set on the pcgs registry.  if you are looking to build a high end morgan or peace dollar set, or just want to obtain some of the finest dollars on the market, i would highly recommend shaun.
