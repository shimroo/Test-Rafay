new internationalist australia
the new internationalist is an independent bi-monthly not-for-profit 
          magazine that reports on action for global justice and is funded by subscriptions from our supporters. we believe in putting people before profit, in climate justice, tax justice, gender equality, solidarity with indigenous peoples and human rights for all. we celebrate effective altruism and activism that loosens the stranglehold of transnational corporations and sets the agenda for sustainability and a radically fairer future.
our reviews of new movies, books and music from around the world are very popular because they help make sense of important global trends and insights.
popularity of the digital edition of the new internationalist magazine is growing rapidly and we think you'll enjoy the convenience of our mobile  apps for apple and android tablets and smartphones.
we also like to blog and keep you in the loop via our email updates.
