hear from our members








we are members of a couple of chambers where we have our other salons, and the loudon county chamber is by far, our favorite!  just the hometown feeling of family, care, and genuine concern is comforting!
frank and janette saroka tune up the manly salon






loudon county’s chamber of commerce is a beacon of support for businesses in the area.  the networking events and personal care they have provided us have been invaluable for our company’s growth and we are incredibly grateful to be a part of a team that places so much focus on cultivating a healthy, thriving ecosystem for small businesses in the community!
