					at the window of tomorrow				
at the window of tomorrow,
i saw many a yesteryear.
it was easy to see where we’d come
in the intervening time –
how we’d grown, and struggled, and triumphed.
beyond the yesteryear was tomorrow’s future.
it wasn’t much different than today,
but a little more was added
– a little more light –
and in this way, we came to transcend.
and the yesteryears moved up slowly,
and the tomorrows moved down gradually.
they joined in the middle and spun around each other
to become heaven on earth –
the one we’ve been promised.
