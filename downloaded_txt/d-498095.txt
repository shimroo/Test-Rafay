the ensemble
sequentia is one of the world’s most respected and  innovative ensembles for medieval music. it is an international group of  singers and instrumentalists â united in paris under the direction of the  legendary performer and teacher benjamin bagby â dedicated  to the performance and recording of western european music from the period  before 1300. the size and disposition of the ensemble is determined by the  repertoire being performed, and ranges between an instrumental/vocal duo to a  large vocal ensemble. based on meticulous and original research, intensive  rehearsal and long gestation, sequentia’s virtuosic performances are  compelling, surprising in their immediacy, and strike the listener with a  timeless emotional connection to our own past musical cultures. more

in memoriam
agnethe christensen (1959-2024)

the members of sequentia mourn the passing of our colleague and friend agnethe christensen. agnethe performed and recorded intensively with the ensemble between 2001 and 2014, featured prominently in our programmes 'the rheingold curse', 'lost songs of a rhineland harper', 'krone und schleier' and 'hildegard von bingen.' her generous spirit and her splendid singing will always be remembered by the many colleagues who honour her vital presence in our lives and in our shared  music-making.
a memorial concert in agnethe's memory is planned for 21 march 2025 in copenhagen.â

world premiere on 18 march 2022
sequentia & peter sellars: roman de fauvel

fauvel is a monstrous and stupid beast, the leader of a land   where lies and corruption triumph happily. he is supported by a host of   ministers, power brokers and multi-millionaires who shamelessly flatter   him, carefully rubbing him up the right way, and polish his backside   taking great care never to ruffle his feathers. meanwhile, chaos   triumphs as the nation comes apart. this strikingly modern story was   bequeathed to us 700 years ago by a handful of artists and intellectuals   who wrote and circulated a strange and subversive satire: the roman de fauvel,   a sumptuous manuscript of which, with its jumble of texts, illustrated   vignettes and musical scores, is kept in the bibliothã¨que nationale in   paris.

new program for 2021
hus in himile: apocalyptic songs from  german cloisters (9th-11th  centuries)

the long covid confinement of 2020 has fostered reflections on the fragility of the world, and given a rebirth to the legendary sequentia program and cd, 'fragments for the end of time' (endzeit fragmente). vocalist/harper benjamin bagby und flautist norbert rodenkirchen will be joined by vocalist jasmina ärnäiä and multi-instrumentalist ian harrison (les haulz et las bas) to explore the musical world of surprising, powerful, apocalyptic texts from medieval german cloisters. 
from the time of christianity's introduction into europe until the end of the first millennium, apocalyptic images of the end of time and the last judgement were widespread, both in texts and in the visual arts. these powerful christian images, based largely on the biblical revelation of john, at times bear a remarkable similarity to the pagan-germanic description of the world's destruction during the final battle fought by the gods and giants of norse mythology. it is a musical tradition steeped in mystery, with a special dreamlike quality, including descriptions of the celestial heavens but also firmly rooted in the violent world as it was known. there are also tender promises of a blessed afterlife, an end to sickness and suffering, and even a 'hus in himile' (home in heaven).these are songs from a thousand years ago and more, when men and women were expecting the world to end, and the singer's duty was to prepare them, warn them and yet also, to console. 
the premiere of this program will take place on 18 march 2021, in cologne, germany, as part of the zamus early music festival.

new programs for 2019-20
oswald in constance
following a commission from the city of konstanz (germany) in 2018, sequentia created a special program around the tirolian nobleman, poet and songmaker oswald von wolkenstein (early 15th century), who was present at the epochal council of constance, where he certainly entertained churchmen and nobles with his biting satire and social commentary. more
words of power â charms, riddles and elegies of the medieval northlands

following a ten-day rehearsal and teaching residency at swarthmore college (usa), sequentia will give the world premiere of a new program called 'charms, riddles and elegies of the medieval northlands' on 1 march 2019. for this new program, the sequentia trio of bagby, rodenkirchen and marti will be joined by the english vocalist stef conner. more
le roman de fauvel
returning to a theme which sequentia has explored before, in concert and in recordings, we will expand the ensemble of men's voices to perform music from the 14th century roman de fauvel. this project is currently planned for summer and autumn of 2020, which promises to be a time of political upheaval very much in the spirit of fauvel and its world of corruption, lies and the abuse of power. more details forthcoming in late 2019. more


new cd release
boethius: songs of consolation

following years of intensive collaboration with university of cambridge musicologist sam barrett, sequentia releases boethius: songs of consolation.  
based on an 11th century manuscript from canterbury, transcribed here  for the first time after 1000 years of silence, sequentia brings to life  the vitality and depth of boethius’s famous text about the nature of  man in the universe, of good and evil, of fate and justice. more

ensemble peregrina
benjamin bagby featured in new recording of medieval danish song

in 2017 benjamin joined the ensemble peregrina (basel), under the direction of its founder agnieszka budzinska-bennett, in a recording project focused on medieval music from the baltic area: mare balticum, vol. 1: music in medieval denmark. it has recently been issued on the tacet label, with excellent reviews so far. many congratulations to agnieszka and her colleagues! 
one review of the cd has this to say about benjamin's contribution:
“...and benjamin bagby, as scholar and interpreter one of the great masters of this repertoire, doesn't need to be asked twice: he is a magnificent storyteller and brings to this project his harmonically-rounded baritone in all its glory, with incredible stature and authority. playfully and full of life, he animates the rigid forms of regular textual structures â or: he pulverises them, according to the perspective. as an example of this last observation: he breathes life into the almost 15-minute long textual mass of the michael beheim ballad 'von meiner mervart'... “

excerpts from sequentia's first demo recordings (1978-79)
by benjamim bagby

for the ensemble's 40th anniversary in 2017, my colleague norbert rodenkirchen encouraged me to rummage in the sequentia tape archive in cologne and see what old recordings were lying around. i found two of our oldest demos, on reel-to-reel tapes. norbert took the fragile tapes to the renowned topaz studio in cologne, where sound engineer reinhard kobialka was able to save most of the deteriorated sounds. still, one hears the hand of time in these old recordings. norbert had the idea to use the old label of the demo as an image. the list was written on our old mechanical typewriter, and the lettering done by hand, with letraset (considered very hightech in pre-computer times). more

first performance in 1,000 years
boethius' consolation of philosophy
after more than two decades of painstaking work on identifying the techniques used to set particular verse forms, research undertaken by cambridge university’s dr sam barrett has enabled him to reconstruct melodies from the rediscovered leaf of the 11th century ‘cambridge songs'. sequentia (benjamin bagby, hanna marti and norbert rodenkirchen) presented the boethian songs at a concert held in cambridge on 23 april 2016, and again on 2 july, as part of a symposium on medieval latin song. an informal rehearsal video made by the university became a youtube sensation (see below), with over 500, 000 views so far.more

new program for 2016
monks singing pagans
when we think of medieval monks and their musical lives, the first thing to come to mind is gregorian chant, but a closer look at medieval monastic manuscripts from the 9th to 12th centuries shows that many monks were singing other songs as well, with texts which were sometimes anything but christian. the medieval monastic and cathedral schools of medieval europe were great centers of learning and focal points of intellectual life. for all monks and clerics, who were native speakers of european vernacular languages, it was essential to become bilingual, to speak, think, perhaps even to read and write in latin, the language of their faith, the liturgy, the sciences, philosophy and literature. more
