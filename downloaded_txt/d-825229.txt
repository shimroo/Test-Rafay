why am i being charged "special handling" 



you’re ordering, and we’re shipping hand-made bakery.  some of the items in your cart require some additional love to make sure you get them fresh, fast and hopefully, in one piece. we would like to be completely transparent, therefore, the additional handling fee is displayed.
