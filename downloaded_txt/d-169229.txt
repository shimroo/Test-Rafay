executive order #13476.2(a)i have just signed executive order #13476.2(a), which accomplishes the following three national priorities:- it allows for the creation of a link to be made available on this website for those constituents who would like to donate to hurricane katrina relief. this link is located on the left side of the page, just above the site meter statistics, and conforms to all federal regulations regarding font size and color.- it provides for the immediate "retirement" of supreme court justices souter, ginsburg, breyer, stevens, and kennedy.- it makes gay people disappear.thank you, and may god continue to bless america.

john robertshere's some elite opinion on my nominee for the ussc:- "president bush had breakfast with his supreme court nominee john roberts. afterwards bush said he's never seen such a qualified candidate and john roberts said he's never seen a grown man eat count chocula." --conan o'brien- "president bush said the job of the supreme court was extremely important because these are the people we choose to pick the next president of the united states." --jay leno- "you realize (john roberts) is only 50 years old. he could serve on the court for the next 40 years. so he could still be there when we pull out of iraq." --jay leno- "the white house revealed today that there were eleven finalists for the supreme court nomination before president bush chose this john roberts guy. and here's the shocking part: you know who the runner up was? bo bice." --jay leno

bush quiz!please take this short test to determine the level of your loyalty to me.it's pretty difficult; even i only got a 70%! (which brings back some of those old college memories...)as someone who strongly supports standardized testing in schools, i believe this little quiz should become part of the national kerr-ick-yoo-lum starting in the fall. any student who fails will be sent down to gitmo for a lil' bit of "re-education"...and rove assures me i can sell it to the public as a form of distance-learning!

bikers for bush!  i just picked up a key endorsement from the rolling thunder motorcycle club. it seems we share many of the same values: violence, improper grammar, and meth. in related campaign news, recent polls show me leading kerry in capturing the crucial toothless vote. and skanks reportedly favor me over kerry by a margin of three to one.

this president  john f-ing kerry has a habit of referring to me as "this president" and then following up with a baseless claim. examples abound: "this president has created an economy that feeds the special interests..." (says the senate's number-one recipient of individual campaign contributions from lobbyists...) "this president has in fact created terrorists where they didn't exist..." (now i'm a fucking magician?) "[t]his president has run the most arrogant, inept, reckless and ideological foreign policy in the modern history of our country..." (so, if i was less "inept" maybe north korea and syria would have been liberated as well as iraq and afghanistan?) i am taking bets on future "this president" attacks against me by the senator from massachusetts. here are a few possibilities: "this president has been known to hate his mother, turn down apple pie, and only feign interest in the sport of baseball." "this president is addicted to re-runs of the smurfs, and does keg-stands during the commercials." "this president gets sexually aroused whenever arafat reaches for another baby-wipe." "this president cut your taxes, defeated two evil regimes, and has not yet gotten blown by an intern. uh, and he must be defeated in november!" this president is about to dry heave.

mexicans  it was a difficult decision for rove to make, but he decided we should let illegal mexicans take american jobs. well, they're already taking them, but now we wanna make it legal. sure, when they came to our country, their first act upon entering was to break federal law, but that's cool. i mean, i used to do an eight-ball a night, and that sure as shit ain't legal! so, for the sake of my re-election, instead of punishing federal criminals, we'll give them american jobs, let them send the money back to mexico (or as i say it, may-he-coh), and further strain our social support system. and if that doesn't get me re-elected, i'll just send someone back to the moon! let's hope he makes it in one piece...

it  it don't mean "information technology" anymore. it means "international terror." and i oppose terror. this ain't the clinton years, where you could just get a good job in the high-tech sector and have a good life. nope. now you are called to duty to die for your country. like i was told to say: “i pledge to you that america will never relent on this war against terror. (applause.) there will be times of swift, dramatic action. there will be times of steady, quiet progress. over time, with patience, and precision, the terrorists will be pursued. they will be isolated, surrounded, cornered, until there is no place to run, or hide, or rest.  “as military and civilian personnel in the pentagon, you are an important part of the struggle we have entered. you know the risks of your calling, and you have willingly accepted them. you believe in our country, and our country believes in you.  “within sight of this building is arlington cemetery, the final resting place of many thousands who died for our country over the generations. enemies of america have now added to these graves, and they wish to add more. unlike our enemies, we value every life, and we mourn every loss.  “yet we're not afraid. our cause is just, and worthy of sacrifice. our nation is strong of heart, firm of purpose. inspired by all the courage that has come before, we will meet our moment and we will prevail.” terror will not win. i oppose it. like my daddy woulda said, it's bad. and if a few more hundred americans have to die between now and my re-election, so be it. it's all about terror.

warm thoughts  hopefully, another raving non-christian madman will destroy the lives of hundreds of americans sometime soon. hopefully, this individual, or these individuals, will be kind enough to give me an opening to invade syria from iraq.  this would certainly change the subject in the mainstream media from one of foreign policy disaster to one of proactive attacks against terror. this would also afford me the opportunity to use the second anniversary of 9-11 as a re-election tool. there is always hope, in this great land of ours. god bless america. and god damn howard dean!

i love august  it's vay-cay-shun time again! i love this time of year. it's the only opportunity i get to binge drink.  people wonder why i wasn't all over the airwaves during the power crisis last week. well ironically, during the blackout, i was blacked-out! so, i let a republican mayor of nyc do all the heavy lifting. (sound familiar?) looks like dean's gonna get the democrat nam-inn-nay-shun for president. sounds good to me. just gotta get rove to "doctor" up some photos of dr. dean performing a third-trimester partial-birth abortion on a 13-year old hispanic girl, and i'll be set.

things to do today  i'm so glad karl provides me with a list of things to do. it really helps quite a bit. here goes: 1 - look into mirror and say: "i support nuclear terror." smirk. wink. repeat. 2 - continue to stare blankly into mirror. "i support the people of iran. they deserve the right to vote for their leaders, just as we americans do. and like the people of the great state of florida, their votes deserve to be counted, eventually. long live the mullahs!" repeat. 3 - masterbate to blown-up photo of own twin daughters. deny ever doing so. have a coors cutter. 4 - kiss laura in public. deny ever doing so. have a coors lite. repeat. 5 - go back to bed. karl will handle it from here. let me tell ya'll once again: this is one tough job!

rough day  i've got my daughter jenna snuffling around in mick jagger's underpants, my secretary of state is sucking up to the national socialists...er...i mean the social democrats in germany, and the economy risks going into not merely recession, but deflation. i haven't needed a beer this bad since rove told me about this site.

a new european axis!  the french, germans, belgians, and luxembourgites (luxembourgians? luxembourgers?) have agreed to set up a european defense union in an effort to move away from nato. the only question is, who surrenders to who?
