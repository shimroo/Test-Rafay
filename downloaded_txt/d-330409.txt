the most common
                              questions about private jet travel:
                           




1. which is
                                          more economical; jet charters or fractional
                                          jet leasing?


for most travelers
                                          having the ability to fly whenever, wherever
                                          without concern for "per purchased hours" or
                                          "what's left in my account" gives them a
                                          better comfort level with our private jet
                                          charter programs.  since our rates are
                                          less expensive that fractional leasing
                                          programs there is no advantage to prepaying
                                          for airtime into a non-performing asset. 
                                          if you are currently near the end of your
                                          fractional jet ownership program, give us a
                                          call to allow us to show you how you can
                                          save money and get great service with
                                          aircharter.  we take the hassles out of
                                          private jet travel.

2. how many
                                          people can travel about a private jet plane?


aircraft has a wide
                                          range of passenger cabin configurations and
                                          flight ranges.  simply click on the 

"the aircraft" 
hyperlink and look
                                          at the details on each plan. however, the
                                          exact number of seats on any plane depends
                                          how the plan was built.


for example, a
                                          gulfstream v can be configured with 10 to 18
                                          seats.  when we order a plane, it can
                                          be configured in many ways to reflect the
                                          current needs of our clients.  on the
                                          small, local range jets have a minimum
                                          configuration of five seats, so if you
                                          mostly travel with 4 or less people, your
                                          choices are often a factor of range and not
                                          seating capacity. 


we will always seek
                                          to match the needs of your private charter
                                          jet flight plan to the "best fit" in
                                          aircraft so that you have a very memorable
                                          private charter jet experience.

3. how much time
                                          savings does private jet travel give back as
                                          compared to commercial first class service?
                                       

as recently as summer
                                          of 2006, commercial air travel has become
                                          even more complicated and time consuming. 
                                          commercial first class customers have the
                                          same security requirements and screening
                                          protocols as coach ticket holders. 
                                          most commercial carriers recommend that you
                                          arrive 90 minutes prior to travel on
                                          domestic flights and 3 hrs in advance for
                                          international flights.


a good example is a
                                          common private charter jet trip from the 
                                          ny area to miami, florida.  on a
                                          commercial carrier like
                                          
                                          continental airlines.  flight co438
                                          has a departure time of 10:55 am from newark
                                          and an arrival time of 2:00 pm in miami; a
                                          total trip time of 3 hrs and 9 minutes. if
                                          you follow the airline guidelines, your day
                                          looks like this:

                                          founded in 1985, air charter has become the market
                                          leaders in providing world wide private jet charter
                                          services. born out of the desire to provide clients with a
                                          simpler and more understandable way to buy charter services, 
                                          air charter was founded on the principle of placing the

the true cost

                                             confusing for even a seasoned traveler. air charter
                                             simplified the process by creating the "charter jet price
                                             guarantee". the charter price you are quoted is the price
                                             you pay.
