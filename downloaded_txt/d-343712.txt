amazon reviews





















nina o.“i love that mr. spice came out with these flavors because i am a very low fat, sodium free diet and low sugar diet. the barbeque sauce, tangy bang and honey mustard are awesome. very tasty. makes me feel like i can enjoy food. i'm definitely getting more flavors!”






















daisy p.“this is a delicious sauce, and great for a low-sodium diet. it's nice to have a sauce on hand to flavor things up, and it's so hard to find low-sodium options. i just pour it straight on plain chicken or on turkey patties.”






















tom m.“what a flavor, just right on the spice for me. if you wanted a bit more heat you could just add a pinch of red pepper. it is such a pleasing taste and always makes me feel contented after eating this. i will be ordering more in the future. and no salt!! thank you mr. spice!”






















timothy p.“be careful not to get any of the honey bbq on your fingers,,, you will start out licking them, but you my just gnaw one off! so good!”






















matthew k.“…the sauce has a terrific flavor! hot wing has zero sodium with a real peppery kick, this stuff makes a fantastic marinade for burgers, chicken, chops, etc. it is also terrific as a dipping sauce. the flavor is so good i've dipped steamed veggies in it just to jazz them up… i highly recommend it.”













 











salt-freeok. so let's get down to it.we all want to be healthy. we start diets, count calories, shop in the natural foods aisle, etc.food labels boast "fat-free" or "low-carb" to consumers but the fine print often leaves one thing out...salt. lots of it, too. most companies use high volumes of sodium to compensate for lack of flavor.
