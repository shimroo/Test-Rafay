yarusso's 
              is proudly offering 2 new local beers: 






angry 
              planet pale ale



 


cygnus 
              x-1 porter












this 
              beer is a good example of what happens when old mother nature gets 
              mad. angry planet is made with organic american 2-row, c60 and munich 
              malts. featuring cascade hops and a large dry hop addition, together 
              create an aroma of citrus and light toast and carries a nice flavorful 
              punch of citrus hop that is balanced by a slight caramel sweetness 
              which plays off on the hops bitterness. angry planet pairs well 
              with yak momo, pizza & pad thai as well as burgers and brats 
              off the grill.


named 
              after a black hole and a song, this is a porter like no other. we 
              took an old english porter recipe, added some rye malt, and our 
              porter was born. this brew floods your palate with hints of chocolate, 
              biscuit and all-around roasty goodness with just a touch of smoke 
              that finishes dry but is not overpowering. perfect with roasts or 
              fowl. enjoy by the fire, and it will certainly warm you on any cold 
              evening in the great white north.






flat 
              earth brewing offers a variety of hand-crafted beers 
              for any occasion. every flat earth beer is brewed using only the 
              finest ingredients and the capital city's purest water. we skip 
              the market research and brew what we believe is a great beer that 
              people will enjoy. pair any of our beers with your favorite entree, 
              we think there's something for. 
they 
              are now open at their new location,
              688 minnehaha ave. east 
they 
              are an organization of fun loving beings, 
              always looking for an excuse to have a great time. 
as 
              one of the twin cities' favorite micro-breweries, they are on a 
              mission to provide the finest craft beers worth talking about.
