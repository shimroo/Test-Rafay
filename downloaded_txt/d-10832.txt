making disciples
learn how we're growing the church








in observance of dr. king’s legacy and prophetic vision, our offices will be closed on monday, january 20. we encourage you to join rev. terri hord owens and others for the for such a time as this interfaith service that evening.
new church ministry is a ministry of the christian church (disciples of christ) in the united states and canada that trains, equips, assists, and multiplies emerging and affiliating congregations and leaders from the disciplesnext methodology, which focuses on contemplative action, prophetic advocacy, and faith-rooted organizing.
here are just some of the ways that we support pastors, movement initiators, and others:
training
leadership academy
this interactive experience brings together clergy, laity, core teams, and undergraduate and seminary students (regardless of their denominational affiliation), to address missional transformation, dive into disciplesnext, and explore finances, branding and marketing, and capital campaigns, alongside a cohort at the same stage in the church launch process. join us online for our asynchronous course!
equipping
impact
this new webinar series focuses on storytelling and deep mutual learning, featuring guests from a wide range of religious backgrounds sharing their personal narratives and experiences. by exploring the challenges, triumphs, and transformative moments of these visionary leaders, attendees gain invaluable inspiration and direction for their own ventures. join us on wednesday, november 20 at 3:00 pm est for our latest episode, unpacking the core competencies of disciplesnext: faith-rooted organizing, where host rev. dr. jose martinez, minister of new church strategies and guest elizabeth madeira, organizer at southern christian coalition, will speak to the many ways that activism and ministry overlap and intersect.
new church hacks
this free webinar series provides practical (and sometimes peculiar) prompts for new church starts. each episode is jam-packed with clever solutions to tricky problems and empowers courageous leaders with the tools, tips and how-tos to start, sustain, and strengthen congregations.
assisting
coaching
coaching is a one-on-one process of imparting to a leader the encouragement and skills they need to succeed in a task. new church ministry coaches walk alongside new/affiliating pastors and leaders to help them remain on track and accountable for the goals they have set for themselves and their faith communities.
