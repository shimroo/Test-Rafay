i would like to thank you for putting on one of the most enlightening and informative classes that i have seen in my 25 years in the polymer industry. it had an excellent balance of theory and practical application and was applicable to many applications beyond purge columns. i got a lot of positive feedback from the attendees.

the folks at j&j always present themselves with the utmost professionalism and expertise. i’ve worked with a some so-called ”experienced” engineering firms over the years that make a lot of conclusions with little data or analysis to back it up.

[jenike] abriram nossos olhos para vários problemas que tínhamos através de treinamentos técnicos. tenho trazido a expertise deles em todas as nossas funções que eu assumi.


eu estava liderando em um projeto de inovação em sólidos, algo bem fora da caixa, e estávamos chegando em um ponto do projeto que dificilmente teríamos toda a base técnica para tomar as decisões de seguir em frente, devido ao rigor técnico de passagem de fases em nossos processos de aprovação de investimento, inviabilizando um produto que poderia ser incrível. felizmente, encontramos a jenike. eles nos suportaram com sua capacidade técnica, sua expertise em dimensionamento de equipamentos, armazenagem de produtos e ainda por cima, abriram nossos olhos para vários problemas que tínhamos através de treinamentos técnicos. tenho trazido a expertise deles em todas as nossas funções que eu assumi, depois dessa primeira experiência.
