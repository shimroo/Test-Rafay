charlie
					musselwhite, 6-time grammy nominee and
				23-time blues music (aka w.c. handy) award winner prefers his blowsmeaway harmonica microphones (he has
				three!) and in-line volume controls.
				
the mics greg made for me have everything i like, want and have to have in
						a mic. first
						of
						all they have great tone. second, they are very comfortable with easy access to the volume
						control;
						the wood shell makes it very comfortable to hold. and, third, they're great looking mics with a
						lot
						of class.
						
							charlie musselwhite - june 2008
						










toots thielemans —
				perhaps
				the most famous harmonica player in the world — performs with an ultimate 58.
				
my sound engineer (chris weeda) introduced me to a new microphone for my harmonica a
						while
						ago. although it also takes a good sound engineer to give you the sound you want to hear on
						stage, i
						can say i'm very pleased with the ultimate 58. it's a very nice, light and comfortable
						microphone.
						thanks greg!
					august 22, 2016 - r.i.p. toots thielemans — you will be deeply missed.

				for more than 30 years and nine albums, rick estrin
				fronted the jumping, swinging little charlie & the nightcats. the band continues with rick up front
				to this day as rick estrin and the nightcats. here's what rick says about his blowsmeaway mic:
				
i've been performing for over 40 years and i'm very selective about the
						mics i use. the
						mic
						greg made for me is great
						in every way. it has a huge, warm tone. it's light, easy to hold and i really dig the
						convenience of
						greg's smooth "stealth"
						volume control design. and, if that's not enough, the beautiful, unique look of this mic is
						pure,unsurpassed class.
						
							rick estrin - june 2012
						










				with his band the blues survivors, mark hummel
				has released some twenty
				albums since 1980, and has been both producing & performing at his blues harmonica blowout™
				series since 1991.
				these shows have grown to be a much heralded event & continue to draw sellout crowds wherever they
				appear.
				here's what mark has to say about his mic:

my customized blowsmeaway mic is the lightest, most comfortable, most
						beautiful, great
						sounding mic and piece of handcrafted art i own!!! thanks, greg!!
						
							mark hummel - august 2012
						










				with his band the mighty flyers, rod piazza
				has been recording longer than his mentor george "harmonica" smith did, or sonny boy
				williamson (either of them!), or
				big walter horton. he's been making records for more years than little walter was alive. piazza is a
				tried-and-true, dyed-in-the-wool
				blues veteran with credentials that are second to none.
				rod chose burl maple, with a double stripe of black stone inlay and a personalized brass grill for
					his mic.
					rod also uses a blowsmeaway wireless system 
					in his performances.
					here's what he has to say:

hey baby. just used greg's new personalized harp mic and i'm here to tell
						ya. not only
						is it
						gorgeous
						in appearance, but the feel and tone of the mic are as dynamic and punchy as you would want. the
						volume is a perfect taper and smooth as they come.
						i can dig it.
						rod piazza - february 2013










				willie nelson's harmonica player for the last 37 years,mickey raphael endorses his blowsmeaway wood
				harmonica mic
				for his blues work on stage with willie. additionally, he does studio work and has a cd out under his
				own name, and has worked
				with a who's who of artists including elton john, u2, motley crue, vince gill, emmy lou harris, the
				mavericks,
				kenny wayne shepherd and neil young. mickey wanted a very dark colored mic. this one is made from gabon
				ebony.
				he also wanted a low impedance setup so he could switch easily with his acoustic mic during his shows
				with willie.
				finally, he wanted the stealth volume control so he could easily match levels with the other mic.
				blowsmeaway productions
				is all about working with the customer to deliver exactly what they need and want.

				here's what mickey has to say:this mic "blows me away". willie turned to me and
					asked, "hey is
					little walter here?" then he said "wait, is musselwhite here?" our sound guys, who
					are never
					satisfied, said they really like this mic."








				grammy nominated performer kim wilson endorses blowsmeaway custom wood harmonica
					microphones.
				
i've been in show biz a long time so i'm not easily impressed, but when i
						saw the
						workmanship that went into this mic i was, literally, "blown away". the attention to
						detail, the quality and beauty of the materials and,
						of course, the sound are very impressive indeed. i'm takin' this one on the road! thanks greg!

product line overview
custom wood microphones

			the
			vintage industrial microphones they're intended to replace. they also have a wonderful warm tone and
			excellent feedback
			resistance as a result of the choice of materials. each mic is a unique, handcrafted work of art.
			go to the custom wood mics page for much more information.
		






i play with a blowsmeaway productions wood mic and it is my favorite mic! super
				light,

				greg's mics!

				sub-sized bullet mic
				on the planet with the heumann element- the world's only microphone element developed specifically
				for harp!
			






the incomparable aki kumar demonstrates the
					bulletini.


see the bulletini mics page for more information.

					lighter, built in volume
					control... and a choice of impedance and connectors to match your gear.
					see the ultimate series page for more information. ultimate series
						mics are the choice of pros
						like toots thielemans, ross garren, hermine deuerloo, billy branch, jackson kincheloe, and rob

					the hands-free microphone that cups the mic for you - so you can get big fat dirty blues tone while your hands are busy playing guitar, drums, keys....
					see the rackit! mics page for more information. rackit! can be handheld, stand mounted or held in a neck rack. removable end caps allow you to choose 
					the degree of "cupping" you want, for a range of tones from blues grit to jimmy reed/bob dylan clean!




 



wireless systems
				i am no longer carrying wireless systems but i can help you get up and running with recommendations and any adapters you might need. 
				visit the wireless systems page for more information.





in-line volume controls

					designed by harp players for harp players, these handsome in-line volume controls give you simple
					and reliable volume
					control where you need it - at the microphone! this is useful for many reasons:
				

kill feedback instantly
					 optimize for vocals and harp when using the same mic for both
					 adjust mid-performance for quieter harps (low d comes to mind)
					 "back off" a bit when filling behind anothers' solo or vocal.
					 leave a little headroom for when the guitar player turns up (and you know he will...)
 turn your amp way up for overdriven sound, and back off at the volume control.
					 walk over to adjust amp without feedback as you approach
				
these controls are precision machined, hand made and individually tested to withstand the rugged
					performance environment.
					i have made and sold hundreds of these controls. for more information, go to the
					volume controls and adapters page.
				







kalamazoo amplifiers

					i restore these wonderful mid-60's vintage amplifiers - quite simply the best little
					harp amps there ever
					were. i have bought, rebuilt and sold over 400 (!!!) of these, making me the worldwide kalamazoo
					model 1 and model 2 expert.
					visit the kalamazoo page for more information.
				





the bulletizer™
you play a shure sm57 or 545 mic. you love the tone but the small diameter makes your
					hand cramp up.
					this is the solution. get a grip™ with the bulletizer.





custom work
i also customize and repair microphones and build custom controls, cables
				and adapters.

new! september 2019 - shane sager endorses ultimate microphones 

shane
					sager is touring worldwide with sting.
				 shane says: 
i have been using a shure 57 for many years now- i come from the blues originally like most
					harmonica players and love the sound of my blowsmeaway custom wood bullet mic, but during this tour
					i needed to access a cleaner, more natural sound to be able to play in all styles from jazz to rock
					to reggae. i find that the ultimate 57 is the perfect mate to my chromatic harmonica; compact, easy
					to hold, and delivers a sweet and natural tone. i have used it on countless gigs all over the world
					and it has never failed - thanks greg!







march 2019 - chris wood (the wood brothers band) endorses blowsmeaway
					productions rackit! microphone! 

				two brothers decide to form a band, adapting the blues, folk and other roots-music sounds they loved as
				kids into their own evocative sound and twining their voices in the sort of high-lonesome harmony blend
				for which sibling singers are often renowned.
				the wood brothers are an international touring act drawing crowds wherever they perform.
				 chris wood plays both electric and acoustic bass, and harmonica in a rack, along with vocals. he has
					recently begun using the rackit! microphone for his harp work, as well as some backing vocals.
 chris says: 
for years i've dreamed of a way to mimic the sound of hands cupping my harmonica in its rack
					while i play the bass. the rackit! finally made that possible!â --march 2019.

march 2018 - gary smith endorses blowsmeaway productions' custom wood microphones.i'm proud to
				welcome gary smith as my newest professional endorser. gary, a hohner âmaster of the harmonica", has
				been playing professionally since 1969 and was a big influence on many harp players, david barrett, aki
				kumar, mark ford and myself among them. gary is a tone monster and has many records and cd's out there.
				if you don't own his "up the line" - make a point of adding it to your collection.
				here's what gary has to say:
				i've had a week or so with the mic. i haven't got back to you in part, because this work of
					yours is so damn thought provoking. every harp mic i've ever used has been a resurrection of some
					antique repurposed p.a. mic. this is entirely different. you've reimagined the harpmic into a
					handcrafted artful and musical expression of your own design. quite an achievement. so first ,kudos
					to you and your cottage industry of one.
					as for this mic...over the top looks, my friend. anyone who has seen pictures is blown away, but in
					person...the eyes bulge! like a flame-top les paul, only round! the sound is top shelf as well, the
					cr that you hand selected is spot on - big tone.
					and i've got to add something about the light feel of the mic. so different, and so welcome! i've
					long gotten accustomed to the heft of a jt-30 or 520, but i must say my 'arthur' hands really came
					to appreciate the light grip. long and short, i'm really glad we made this happen. i'm the latest
					harp-maniac to be 'blown away' a zillion thanks, gary smith." march 2018.







november 2017 - john nemeth endorses blowsmeaway productions' custom wood microphones. john nã©meth is
				an american electric blues and soul harmonicist, singer, and songwriter. he has received two blues music
				awards for soul blues male artist in 2014 and soul blues album in 2015. john's mic is made from an array
				of colored pencils, cast into a solid block with clear resin and then turned. john and i chose a vintage
				shure black label cr element, made in 1950 to power this beauty. john says:
				my blowsmeaway microphone is the best one i own both in tone and craftsmanship,
					i love it!
					
						john nemeth — november 2017








february 2017 - jackson kincheloe endorses blowsmeaway productions' ultimate
						57 microphone. 
jackson kincheloe and his band
				sister sparrow and the dirty birds are a new york based band
				playing a funky modern blues/pop-hard to describe unique mix of great music, fronted by singer (and
				jackson's sister) arleigh. jackson accompanies with a very broad range of harp tones - sometimes
				sounding like a blues harp, sometimes like a hammond organ, and sometimes joining the horn section.
				jackson says:
				i've been using the ultimate 57 from blowsmeaway for years, and absolutely love
					it! the
					shorter length barrel makes it easy to hold, and the volume knob is a must when using different
					textures/sounds. i prefer the 57 when playing through my pedalboard, but also love using the
					ultimate 545 for blues and rock gigs. greg is a pleasure to work with, and always gets right back to
					me if i have any questions. it's no surprise that i see greg's mics being used by harp players all
					over the country: they're the best!
					
						jackson kincheloe — february 2017
					








				may 31, 2016 - andy santana
				endorses blowsmeaway productions' bulletini® microphone. 

				andy santana and the west coast playboys have been around since the early 80's. andy is a delta groove
				records recording artist and has been playing harp for 36 years plus. andy says:
				... and during all that time i searched far and near for the best harp mic i
					could find.
					this quest recently led me to greg heumann and his bulletini mic design. i have an impressive
					collection of very high quality mics from a variety of sources. all cost a lot more than the
					bulletini, but what sets this unique mic apart from the rest is its consistency in every amp i use
					it with. it doesnt matter what amp i use, the sound is rich, round and fat. even on amps designed
					for guitar it sounds good, and i can't say that for the other mics. not only does it sound great but
					it's affordable as well. quite frankly i love this little mic for its small size which allows for
					the most wicked cup possible, and its fat sound. i highly recommend the bulletini to anyone. lastly
					greg heumann is a good human being with integrity with a capitol "i". and he's a great harp
					player/singer. the fact that he plays allows him to deeply understand what it takes to build a great
					design. i highly endorse this fine product and hope you will check it out!
					andy
						santana — may 2016








				custom wood mic endorser, veteran harmonica master and king of tone westside andy loves his new blowsmeaway

about me

			in february 2017 harmonica manufacturer seydel and pro player pt gazell published a video about me:
		


			the short story: i retired from my first career and started blowsmeaway in 2004. i operate my own machine
			shop,
			wood shop and electronics lab. i'm the engineering department, the marketing department, the sales
			department, the
			shipping department..... you gotta problem? i can take care of it! perhaps more importantly i'm a performing
			harmonica
			player and i use the gear i make. my band, 
				bluestate, released an album called duracool which is available on itunes and here at cdbaby.com. (i am the lead singer -
			there is harp on about
			5 of the tunes.)

			i think it is important for your mic builder to be able to "walk the walk." you be the judge.
