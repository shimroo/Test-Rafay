message from deb lopez 
review - “saving
america’s horses is a
powerhouse narrative, telling of the often inglorious fate of our
glorious horses, bought by ‘killer buyers’ for
slaughter.
this film takes in every aspect and tells its story with intelligence
and a deep-running composure. the factual authority of soft-spoken
experts, the dismay of a racehorse jockey, the anger of horse owners
deceived, and the vows of politicians committed to righting a
wrong--all play alongside the beauty and inspiration of
america’s
horses and the determination of those working to save them.” –
