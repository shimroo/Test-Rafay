			   our mission
			



			    ny artists unlimited, founded in 1982, is dedicated to taking professional theatre to under-served audiences.  the company focuses on works that evoke dignity of the individual and sanctity of the human spirit.  a multicultural nonprofit touring company, we travel self-contained to ny's inner city neighborhoods as well as to remote regions of the northeast in order to create an appreciation and understanding of the arts through performances, discussions and workshops.  audiences are composed of people who, because of economics, geographical location, disability, age, and the like, cannot afford tickets or gain access to thought-provoking entertainment.  workshops with artist-teachers are offered in creative dramatics, improvisation & comedy, poetry writing & performing, broadway/jazz dance, and more.  teachers have included:  richard pryor jr., kenny wade marshall, court sweeting, francis j. roach.
