coming soon to hpt















help! my vagina is trying to kill me!february 20 - march 22, 2025written and performed by yola jean luokay, technically this is a one-woman show about sti’s, miscarriage, and hpv. but believe it or not, it is also uproariously funny, except when it makes you cry so hard the person behind you offers you a tissue. it’s about love, loss, overcoming shame, and possibly even—i know it sounds crazy—learning to love and accept yourself for who you are. not just for owners of vaginas! an excerpt from this show won fronterafest 2025 best of fest.
