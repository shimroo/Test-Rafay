welcome to the american heritage shop
please scroll down to see our new offering
important news about our website
 
 
after 35 wonderful years we have decided to slow it down a bit.
 
our plan is to keep providing quality furniture by town and country and lawrence crouse with a few high-quality items like painted boards and other unique items that we discover.
so many of our wonderful, very talented craftspeople have retired so we feel this is a good time to consolidate our focus on a few items to offer you.
it has been such a terrific run over the years with our “brick and mortar” shop in three different locations and now only on line.  the hundreds of customers we have met were truly wonderful.  and we hope to continue but with a smaller focused customer base.
 
we will be announcing substantial savings on the items we are phasing out over the next couple of months.
it’s here.  dramatic discounts as we retire.
30% on all painted boards
https://americanheritageshop.com/product-category/hand-painted-signs-boards/
35% on all tin
we encourage you to email or call us at 1-860-350-3403 with any questions or comments.
enjoy your visit to our american heritage online shop!

our passion is heritage american country












the history of the american heritage shop
we have been in the business for over thirty years. in our last location, in kent, connecticut, our shop was located inside the historic judd house. we decided to convert that grand old house back into a home.
we wanted to stay in the business and in contact with our wonderful customers that we had come to know over the years, so we decided to create an online shop that features only the best of what we sold in the judd house.










the finest furniture craftsmen
producing outstanding american country furniture, along with home accessories that truly enhance the early american primitive look. we want to make our website as customer-friendly as our brick and mortar shop was, with the personal customer service that you have come to expect in the past.
we encourage your input and suggestions on how we can make it even better for you. please let us know.
