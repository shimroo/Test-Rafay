“neo-hillbillies with a twist, frog holler plays mountain blues and country as accessible and modern as the most hummable pop”

the washington post





“well-written, well-played, mark them as special. ”

sylvie simmons, mojo





“all this band has to offer is talent, great songs, and consistency. ”

andy turner, no depression





“some of the most rollicking, heartfelt country rock songs this side of nashville”

brian howard, the philadelphia city paper





“great songwriting, deliriously entertaining live act”

the village voice





“as apt to produce a belly laugh as a tear, but sure to make you feel something every time.”
