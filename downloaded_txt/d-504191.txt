give to rslp








julian robertson gave boldly and generously when he created the robertson scholars leadership program twenty-three years ago. he believed in the power of communities, and more importantly, he believed in the power of people to create a better world. 
we launched a generosity campaign in his honor, asking you to do as he did: to give boldly and generously as we establish the julian h. robertson, jr., alumni fund.
