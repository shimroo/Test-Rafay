welcome to the gordon highlanders museum







the gordon highlanders museum
the north east of scotland. for two hundred years this spectacular landscape gave us the men who made one of the finest regiments the british army has ever seen – the gordon highlanders. 
forming the ranks were farmers and fishermen, ghillies and labourers, aristocrats and university students. ordinary men with an extraordinary sense of duty; all with a story to tell.
these stories are brought to life at the gordon highlanders museum by exploring our nationally significant collection. guided by our knowledgeable staff and volunteers retrace the remarkable history of these famous fighting men of the north east.
situated in the fashionable west end of aberdeen, scotland, in the former home of leading scottish artist sir george reid, the gordon highlanders museum and café, ‘cognito at the museum’ offer a warm, friendly welcome to all our visitors and is a great day out.
but we are more than just a museum! we also offer a first class conference venue, unique private and corporate fine dining, group tours and school visits. 
a top-notch visit scotland 5-star attraction in aberdeen, the museum tells the extraordinary 200 year story of “the finest regiment in the world!”*
