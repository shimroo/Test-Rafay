consumer bankruptcies soared to 2 million in 
2005 following the enactment of the bankruptcy abuse prevention and 
consumer protection act of 2005. dr. manning, who testified against the legislation in the u.s. senate judiciary hearing in february 2001 and a 
u.s. congressional policy briefing in may 2006, emphasizes that  it not only threatens american's consitutional right of filing for 
personal bankruptcy protection but it is a hollow victory for the financial services industry since it will
 not deliver significantly greater payments to unsecured creditors.  in his forthcoming book, give yourself credit, dr. manning explains the 
implications of the new law to financially distressed consumers. furthermore, major changes in 
the consumer credit counseling services (cccs) is occuring as the irs is rejecting nonprofit status to many creditor financed "nonprofits" as well as 
nonprofit counseling organizations associated with for-profit debt consolidation and debt relief programs.  see irs rulings while module 12 is being revised. click here for information on how to file for bankruptcy in your specific state.
