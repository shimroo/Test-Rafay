please indulge me while i hype the release of a new magazine by a couple of local kinky/poly/swinger friends of mine. i’m always happy to promote pacific northwest erotic arts and services. please consider supporting them by visiting the site and picking up a copy.thanks,darklady=========================for immediate releasefebruary 09, 2011syzygy magazine provides classy male/male erotica for womenportland, or – those who truly know women know that many of them love seeing or reading about handsome men enjoying one another’s bodies. after all, it’s a double scoop of what most women love most. that’s why the newly released first issue of syzygy magazine (pronounced ˈsɪz.ɨdʒ.i) was created.the brainchild of publisher/photographer susan beaver and editor brad hanon, syzygy illustrates erotic fiction with original, evocative softcore photographs of gorgeous young men, producing a visual and literary combination specifically crafted for women – by women.specific inspirations for syzygy include slash fiction, male/male romance novels, and yaoi manga, with its uniquely female gaze.“i spent years studying the porn women create for each other before i began to truly understand the difference and the similarities between it and ‘mainstream’ porn,” hanon explains. “call it erotica. call it porn. as long as the story’s good, the characters are interesting, and the sex is hot… i’ve done my job.”drawing female writers from throughout the united states and male models exclusively from portland, or, the magazine, whose very name means a unique form of unity, is based in the famed city of roses, a bastion of pacific northwest pansexuality.the first issue, currently available, is expected to appeal primarily to female readers, but will also likely be of interest to gay and bisexual men and has already earned fans on three continents.“i want this magazine to be something that adult women can buy for their own enjoyment,” beaver confesses, “without shame or even that weird feeling that they’re not the intended audience.”a second issue is currently under production, with a biannual publication schedule anticipated.for more information, visit www.syzygymag.com or write:brad@syzygymag.com4534 se 17th ave m100portland, or 97202

anyone who knows me – or thinks they know me – has figured out that i do not suffer fools gladly. with a drill sergeant for a father and an irish catholic for a mother, it didn’t take me long to learn that a lot of people want to convince me of things that make no sense.if they can’t convince me that pigs really do fly and that up really is down, the fall back position is generally to marginalize, minimize, and/or muffle any opposition.…which just pisses me off more… and helps explain my decision to launch www.dotxxxopposition.com.one of the reasons that i am so strongly drawn to the adult entertainment industry and the topic of human sexuality in general, is that i believe sexuality is one of the most powerful creative forces known to humankind. not merely because it includes reproduction, but because it also inspires great thought, great emotion, great realizations of self and others.conscious sexual expression, in my opinion, is the most pure form of political speech there is. as i understand it, political speech is one of our most dearly protected rights in the united states of america.or so i’ve been repeatedly told.long before i knew what and who icm registry and stuart lawley were, i had decided that, although .xxx sounds great upon first hearing, it doesn’t sound good for very long once the many real world implications are considered.in a world where no adult content is allowed outside of .xxx, the stld makes sense. but who wants to run their business or live their life behind such an easily isp cisco server enforced wall – and why should they?rarely one to be at a loss for words, i brought a few pages of full paragraphs to wasteland founder, colin roundtree, who enthusiastically agreed to cast, direct, and produce what we now lovingly call “dot-xxx – the movie!,” which premiered during the .xxx panel at the recent avn show in florida. although he had promised to attend the event, i have not heard that mr. lawley actually graced it with his presence.please visit www.dotxxxopposition, check out “dot-xxx – the movie!,” and browse the articles i’ve posted so far. feel free to comment and to contribute any news and information you feel will help make our opposition to this proposed stld more understandable to those still confused.thanks, of course, to colin rowntree – and to those industry members who were willing to get in front of the camera to state that online adult website owners and businesses do not want this stld and payment processor company store in our corner of the internet. thanks to larry flynt, john stagliano, joanna angel, quinten boyer, allison viva, peter ackworth, ron cadwell, mitch farber, and more, more, more.just because it’s sex doesn’t mean it’s not serious.-- darkladywww.darklady.comwww.masturbate-a-thon.orgwww.dotxxxopposition.comtwitter.com/thedarkladytwitter.com/opposedotxxx
