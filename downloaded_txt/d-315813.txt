we are proud to annouce the replacement for gnudb.org has arrived - accuraterip meta is now live. we are opening this meta database up for other programs, no restrictions 
		(watch this space). head over and download dbpoweramp r2024-5-30 and have access to 5 databases which combine through perfectmeta.

		batch ripper r2024-05-09. removed gnudb.org and replaced with our own freedb server
dbpoweramp music converter r2024-05-01.  [windows change log] [macos change log]
		we have restored freedb.dbpoweramp.com as a replacement for gnudb 
	(which took-over from freedb.org), why? gnudb.org have started requiring 
	emails to access their system. we do not agree with this type of intrusive 
	data collection to access a publicly created database. it goes against the 
	ethos of running a public database, especially as dbpoweramp users would 
	have submitted a very significant percentage of all discs in that database. going forward we will create a new community populated metadata 
	database, it will be branded as part of the accuraterip family, and will be 
	open to all. accuraterip has existed without restrictions for almost 20 
	years, together we will create a high quality database, watch this space...
