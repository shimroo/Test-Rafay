patient reviews















"the best in the business."
after a sub-optimal outcome from a previous surgery, i was hesitant to try again. i spent years saving my pennies, and researching potential surgeons. i came to the conclusion that dr. denenberg is the best there is. ...and wow, i was right. revisions are challenging, and my nasal structure was a mess of scar tissue.  dr. denenberg was able to achieve the best possible outcome for my particular face. i no longer obsess in the mirror. now, i focus on my day instead. when we look at someone’s face, millimeters matter.  dr. denenberg has invested decades studying not only the surgical techniques, but also the subtle ratios, angles, and optical illusions that contribute to aesthetic perceptions. i am so glad i chose the right surgeon this time.  without any hesitation, i can wholeheartedly recommend dr. denenberg to anyone considering a procedure. he did great work for me, and i know he will do great work for you.











"thank you!"
the denenberg office and people are the most down to earth, caring, thoughtful group you can imagine when going into a procedure like this. it is so obvious that they are only thinking about you and the best outcome.  this is not turn and burn place but detail oriented and so much specifics on the procedure and the patient’s wants and realistic outcomes.  thank you!











“there is world-class mastery in dr. denenberg and his entire practice.” 
my experience with dr. denenberg and his entire team far exceeded anything i ever thought it could be. everyone made you feel like you were their only patient, in fact, i was the day of my procedure. and when you’re already anxious, that’s a great feeling. this is a place of warmth and sincere honoring of the work they do.  they aren’t trying to boil the ocean and run patient after patient through a system. they took their time, and they were sincerely interested in not only a perfect outcome but a remarkable experience from start to finish.  there is world-class mastery in dr. denenberg and his entire practice. there are no words to express how fully i would recommend them to anyone. they are really, really great.











“the only regret i have is not having it done sooner!” 
once again, dr. denenberg has used his incredible skills and talent to perform another life-changing revision rhinoplasty! he is very patient and kind and takes the time to explain everything and manage expectations.  i gave my revision rhinoplasty procedure 8 years of consideration from the time i first consulted dr. d. before moving forward. the only regret i have is not having it done sooner!  the staff is very professional and made me feel very comfortable with my procedure. dr. denenberg is very skilled with bulbous noses and i feel so grateful that he was able to give me a “normal” looking nose after all of these years!! :-)











"i was looking for a few years for a doctor that i could count on to do my nose since i’m very picky. "
when i saw dr. denenberg’s before and after photos, i understood that he had many years of experience. i contacted his office, and his staff was very accommodating with all of my requests.  i flew all the way from new jersey to nebraska for my consultation and procedure, and that was definitely the best decision i ever made! dr. denenberg addressed my concerns and was very honest about my expectations. the recovery was very easy, and i am very happy with the results.  i will definitely consult with dr. denenberg again if i am considering any other procedures in the future.











dream nose! flew to omaha for life-changing rhinoplasty!  
dr. denenberg’s work on me is just out of this world, masterful.  he is a quintessential master of his craft, phenomenal. i was extremely fortunate to have him perform my primary rhinoplasty. from the first moment i contacted him, dr. denenberg has been extremely responsive to all of my questions and concerns. both he and the information he generously publishes on his web site have great integrity and guiding input.  thank goodness i didn’t let the idea of travel stand in the way of my going to him for surgery!  thank you tremendously dr. denenberg and staff!
