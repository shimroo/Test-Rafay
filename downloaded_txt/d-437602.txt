humor and healing podcast
this timely and timeless podcast features a conversation between joel goodman and jeneye abele focusing on how laughter can help carry us through the most difficult times. together, they reflect on how an attitude of humor doesn't mean you have to be a comedian. the simple act of choosing to laugh at ourselves and see things with childlike curiosity and light-heartedness can give us perspective on otherwise overwhelming situations. positive humor connects us, builds confidence and makes us think about our shared humanity. and bonus, it just feels darn good to laugh. this podcast is part of a fantastic series presented by two wonderful non-profit organziations: beyond my battle and unfixed media productions. you can lend an ear to this 36-minute podcast by going to humor and healing popcast

one thing i've learned about humor is that it's never quite so funny as when your situation is almost hopeless.  you're dealing with an absurdity, and the humor arises out of the absurdity.  (pat mcmanus)

where is the humor in an absurd, hopeless, seemingly humorless situation you're now facing?

use the humor skill of reversal.  whenever you're having a bad day, completely stop whatever you're doing, pause for a moment, and reflect on some of the things that make you happy, and reasons you could be smiling.  it's amazing how quickly this can turn your mood around.
