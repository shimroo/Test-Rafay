central
            california rails is centered around stockton,
        california, united states of america. stockton is a community of roughly 250,000.
            it is located approximately 80 miles east of san francisco. and 35 miles south of sacramento.

        stockton is served by the bnsf and the union
        pacific. and it is also served by two shortlines. the central california traction, and the
        stockton terminal and eastern. this in addition to
        several industrial plants that have their own railroads.
        such as cargill(sw1) & corn products(cf7).

        bnsf and up come together in a one block area that until 08:00 am tuesday january 12, 1999 was
        governed by bnsf's stockton tower. control is now done by bnsf's san bernardino dispatch
            center and is now called "keddie junction" by the bnsf. amtrak's san joaquin
        also serve the town 12 times daily with four trains running between sacramento and bakersfield, and eight trains running between 
        oakland and bakersfield. ace runs stockton to san jose four times a day
            monday through friday except holidays in the morning, the same 4
            trains return in the later afternoon early evening.

        the stockton area. photos and a map of
        the stockton tower area, you will also find pictures of
        the various california railroad museums.
