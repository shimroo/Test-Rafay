press 



“they opened fonda san miguel in 1975, gradually converting the space into a replica of a colonial-era hacienda, filled with artifacts, original artwork and blooming plants. their timing was auspicious, coinciding with a period of culinary exploration. fonda remains the grande dame of interior mexican cuisine in texas.”
