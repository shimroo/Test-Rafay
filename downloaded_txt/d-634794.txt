featured album: stories and songs“on a whim, i had an idea to invite the five best musicians i know to gather in the studio for a week to create an album spontaneously. we had no predetermined songs or direction. we simply gathered and began throwing out ideas. this project is the result of that week, featuring several of my favorite songs, mostly remakes with a few original pieces. i hope you enjoy listening to them as much as i enjoyed recording them.”  - charles billingsley
