i took part in the italian knife and staff workshop at forteza martial arts in chicago over the weekend. 
 on saturday we worked on the knife portion of the workshop. roberto 
laura, the instructor, started out by explaining he was going to 
introduce us to two different systems of knife fighting. the first is 
primarily a dueling system that only allows point work but will allow 
cuts if used on the s

treet. the second is only aimed at use on the street.  
 both systems are based on the use of a long folding knife somewhat like
 a navaja. the second street oriented system also has hooking actions 
with the butt of the knife as in the navaja. the dueling system is quite
 interesting and as roberto said think of flamenco dancing with a knife.  it was also interesting that the training tool we used for all of the knife work was a wooden drumstick..  
 the staff system is based on using a four foot hard wood staff about an
 inch in diameter. the staff is held with both hands. i saw similarities
 to both montante and jogo de pau in the moves we did.   roberto
 is a very good instructor and moves around the room helping out with 
footwork and pointing out how to improve your techniques. if you have a 
chance to take a class from roberto i recommend it.

      report from gallowglass academy bartitsu semianr febraury 11, 2012on saturday february 11th five new bartitsuka gathered at gallowglassacademy to find out more about the art of bartitsu.  four out of thefive had previous oriental martial arts experience. the other studenthad previously taken my classes on bowie knife and tomahawk.i started with the standard precis of the history of bartitsu and howit got to where we are today.  we then started in on 19th c pugilism. ilike to start with pugilism as i find it provides a good warm up andstarts building a sense of body movement and contact.we covered the standard left lead and right rear punches both in slowmotion and then with focus mitts so everyone got to actually feel  howpowerful the punches can be. we then covered defenses from thesepunches. first the standard blocks with the opposite arms and then thejack slack elbow block. from the slack guard i showed how to  counterwith a "chopper" to the nose of the opponent. we then returned tostandard blocks and worked on using the elbow and hammer fist as acounter strike.we then moved to the two savate kicks i include in my barttisuteachings, the coup de pieds bas and chasse bas (both front foot andrear foot versions). first we worked them slowly using each other tosee how they can be used against knee, shin and foot. i then had eachstudent use the kicks with full force against a kick shield. we thenwent back and worked on combinations of kicks and punches in slowmotion on each other. for this i like to use tony wolf's idea of pushingthrough with the punches and having the person being "hit" act out theblows.during the discussion of pugilism i showed how the pugilistic left footand arm forward stance can be modified for modern self defense with the"fence" stance of both hands open in front of you to provide a physicaland psychological barrier to an attacker. yet the hands up in frontalso allow for powerful strikes.this brought us to lunch time. during the lunch break i discussed themodern legal ramifications of using force in a self defense situation.after lunch we put the mats down and worked on how to do break falls.two of the participants had experience with falling before but theother three had not.  i then started work on the back hell throw frompugilism has this is close to the throws that barton-wright (b-w) uses inmany of the jujutsu techniques.this then moved into doing jujutsu from the canon. since we had beendoing the back heel throw i first taught the defense from a face strikethat is blocked and you end up tripping the attacker up with a rearthrow (back heel.) we then did a failure drill of allowing the attackerto block the "back hander" strike so the defender had to do some otherstrikes to set up for the throw or take the attacker down another way.we then worked on the defense from a one handed lapel grasp, since thisis pretty much the same defense as the face strike but we did the graspwith the left had so everyone could learn that these techniques can bedone on both sides. the failure drill for this technique was that theattacker steps back with his left foot so you can not get the trip onthe first attempt.the final technique we worked on from this series of throws was thebelt grab or reaching for the pocket watch defense. i switched this toa neo-bartitsu grab on the wrist since none of us wear swords or carrypocket watches very often.  for this i showed the pain compliance grabat the throat version showing how this can also be used as a choke.next i taught the "how to escort a man out of the room" with the figurefour lock on the elbow. we then worked on a neo-bartitsu version usingthe same arm lock for a knife dense.with that i thought it was time to start work on the vigny canetechniques. i explained how vigny advocated using a walking stick witha heavy ball on the end but i liked to use a crook handled cane formodern defense since it is legal any where you go and does not standout as much as a walking stick does in our modern world.first we worked on guard by distance. we started by doing the canonicaltechnique slowly to get the feel for the move. i then had one of thepartners in each pair put on a focus mitt on their "cane" hand so thedefender could actually strike with power to the incoming hand. afterseeing how powerful the blow to the hand could be we switched to aneo-bartisu move with the attacker wearing a hockey glove while armedwith a knife. so again the defender could strike with some power whilefacing a more realistic modern attack.for the failure drill i had the neo-bartitsu attacker with the knifedecide if the strike to the hand was hard enough to disarm them and ifnot the defender had to follow up with other strikes with the cane.we then worked on the first of b-w's defenses using a light stickagainst a man with a heavy stick where again the idea is to trip theattacker up. first we covered the canonical technique and then switchedto a more modern neo-bartisu "heavy stick" of a base ball bat. we thenworked on how to do the same basic technique but using the crook neckcane to hook the knee of ankle of the attacker.i then showed the technique of hooking an unarmed attacker at the neckand pulling his head into a knee strike.as a prelude to doing a series of failure drills against an unarmedattacker i went back and showed how to use the head control movementsthat b-w uses in the jujutsu techniques. for the canonical technique weused the two handed lapel grab. we then did a series of failure drillswhere the defender with the cane has the cane grabbed or taken away bythe offender.the grand finale of the day was everyone put on some head protectionand we did individual drills with everyone rotating through beingattacker and defender one at a time so they had the mat space all tothemselves. after the first series i stood by as coach and secondattacker who came with a base ball bat in case any defender got tootied up with their offender.after it was allover we did a quick after action review. everyone saidthey enjoyed themselves and learned new things. in particular theyliked the failure drill since their previous martial arts training hadnever included that kind of follow up in case the first plan did notwork.the one really local student has already asked to continue training atgallowglass.

      medicine ball/playing card workoutsas i mentioned in my last post i am trying to add some variety to my regular workouts. i continue to use the new book i bought. i like the short workouts it provides so i can also use my recumbent bike or do martial arts in the same workout.however, i have also developed two new workout routines by combining a playing card workout with the use of a medicine ball.  i have put together a workout for the arms and upper body and one for the abs and legs. if you are not familiar with using playing cards for a workout the idea is to match each suit of cards with an exercise. you then do the number of reps of each exercise to the number of pips on the card as you come to it in the deck. i do ten reps for each court card and for the ace. if you use a full deck of 52 cards you will get 94 reps per suit. or you can make the ace 11 reps and go all the way to 95 reps!here are the two sets i have put together. feel free to use these or develop your own.arms and upper bodyclubs - bench pressspades - overhead presshearts - bent over rowsdiamonds - curlsabs and legsclubs - lungesspades - squatshearts - butt lift crunchesdiamonds - knee raised crunches
