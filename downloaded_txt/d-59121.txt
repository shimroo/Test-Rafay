euthanasia
                    to be encouraged? 
                   i was just reading that insurance companies encourage suicide, in 
                   states that permit assisted suicide. greater profits by less medical 
                   bills and life insurance policies invalidated? i suspect that with a 
                   rapidly aging population, the elderly will be encouraged to end their 
                   lives. perhaps euthanasia 
                   will be presented as the patriotic or honorable thing to do. we are 
                   truly entering into an age of barbarism and abandoning civilization.

                   undermines the direction of the mainstream agenda.

a
                    reminder to fellow
                    citizens when
                    you walk down the street, just remember that every person who you 
                   pass by, regardless of their race or physical appearance, or if they 
                   are rich or poor, has their own goals and aspirations, trials and 
                   tribulations and each person must be treated with basic respect and 
                   dignity. it is essential to individualize and not generalize. each 
                   group has their good and bad and one must not fall into the trap of 
                   assuming that everyone in a particular group is the same or thinks 
                   the same. sometimes in our rush or arrogance, we forget these basic truths.

                    checkers so-called
                    "fact checkers" are merely a way to control the narrative 
                   and should never be taken seriously. fact checkers always agree with 
                   what the controlling party wants.

global
                    warming will greatly benefit society. 
                   many people have been led to believe that if the planet continues to 
                   get warmer at the ever so pace that it has been warming for hundreds 
                   of years, that somehow it is bad for society. the exact opposite is 
                   true. global warming will be wonderful for society. it will be far 
                   greater areas will be able to be cultivated, leading to vastly more

                    "relationships" 
                   for the past few years, i have heard more and more of people 
                   referring to their girlfriend as their "partner" or that 
                   they are in a "relationship". traditionally, men and women 
                   would "date". the purpose of "dating" was to find 
                   a person that they would marry and stay with forever. dating was not 
                   necessarily exclusive. exclusivity only came with marriage and it was 
                   assumed that marriage was forever. further, "dating"

the
                    media influences everyone. 
                   no one is smart enough or insightful enough not to be influenced by 
                   the media. the media influences everyone. those who controls the 
                   media, also controls the views, opinions and desires of the 
                   population at large.

we
                    are free 
                   ... because we are told that we are free. most people do not 
                   really understand the meaning of true freedom.

the
                    first thing that a child or even an adult learns 
                   on any topic, is assumed to be true. after that, it is extremely 
                   difficult to change that person opinion, even with overwhelming 
                   evidence that the first thing that they heard was false. changing 
                   such a embedded opinion must be gradual, with the planting the seeds, 
                   of the correct point of view and slowly over time, work to change 
                   that opinion.

constant
                    smart phone use 
                   constant cell phone / smart phone use dramatically reduces creativity 
                   and productivity. it acts as a constant distraction. many, if not 
                   most people, waste hours upon hours of time on these devices. i 
                   recommend that a person leave their "smart" phone at home 
                   and enjoy outside, electronic free and observe society for how it 
                   really is.

"the
                    great reset".
                    most people consider the "great reset" something to do 
                   with the world economic forum, klauss schaub and others who have 
                   received much bad press recently. it should be pointed out that the 
                   future is far less predictable than one might think and that the 
                   "great reset" may well be in the opposite direction that 
                   people might consider and may well happen to be a return to 
                   traditional values and other unexpected directions. such as happened 
                   many times in the past. for example, 1638 to 1658 in england, after

people
                    are being slowly but surely, social engineered the
                    education industry, journalism, the entertainment industry and even 
                   the medical industry push social engineering that serves to influence 
                   what people think, want, buy and how they see themselves.

people
                    believe the first thing they hear the
                    first thing a child or a person hears, on a topic that they are not 
                   familiar with, the person will normally accept as fact. later, if it 
                   turns out that the information was wrong, it is extremely difficult 
                   to change that persons mind to see the truth, regardless of the 
                   amount of contrary evidence and proof presented. in the future, a 
                   persons mind can be changed, but in almost all cases, the change will 
                   be gradual. it is important that in school and at home, a child (and 
                   an adult) be trained in critical thinking and not immediately accept 
                   the narrative. children must have adults make decisions for them.

causes
                    of violent crime and property crime is
                    violent crime and crime against property caused by poverty, lack of 
                   education and public policy or is it a lack of good family training, 
                   morality, lack of civics education in school and the media, 
                   intelligence or is it the temperament of certain groups of people? 
                   the media and schools should always and only present a positive view 
                   on life and steer away from the bottom of society.

self
                    defence 
                   it is obvious that most cities and locals in the united states do not 
                   want people to defend themselves from theft and attack and instead, 
                   want the population to meekly submit to the criminals and later, 
                   contact the police. if a citizen defends themselves, either through 
                   hand fighting or with a weapon, such as a club, knife or gun, that 
                   citizen will be charged by the jurisdiction, even if the criminal 
                   entered into the home or business of the citizen. as one old saying 
                   says, "the police are only minutes away, when seconds 
                   count". this must change back to to past when a person was 
                   allowed to defend themselves without fear of prosecution. the fact is 
                   that armed citizens do stop and prevent crimes. of course armed 
                   citizens do pose a threat to governments, particularly when the 
                   governments are not for the people at large, but only to particular 
                   special interest groups. strong, authoritarian governments never want 
                   armed citizens. in those cases, the government (acting on behalf of 
                   certain small interest groups) want to control everything.

opinions
                    it is important to have opinions, based on facts and 
                   known information, but one also be willing to change their opinion as 
                   new information is received.

is
                    everyone equal? certainly in the christian world and by 
                   extension, under the law, everyone is equal. however the fact that 
                   everyone has the same intrinsic value mean that everyone is entitled 
                   to the same? should people who are more ambitious, or people who have 
                   better ideas, benefit from their efforts? societies that have 
                   attempted to distribute wealth equally among all people have always 
                   failed. people need an incentive to work hard and be productive.

arrogance 
                   over the past two years, a type of entitlement and arrogance
                    has developed among the less 
                   productive people who now seem to be demanding property and rights 
                   that they have not earned through efforts of their own.

child
                    neglect? is it a form of child neglect is a woman is 
                   pushing a baby carriage and is also on her cell phone either speaking 
                   or surfing the net? should the woman instead be paying attention and 
                   teaching the child? children mostly learn through observation, rather 
                   than from schools.

a
                    utopian society it has been the dream of mankind since 
                   the beginning to have a perfect society where everyone lives in peace 
                   and harmony and where everybody's wants are fulfilled. shangra la in 
                   the book and movies "lost horizon" is an example. today the 
                   world economic forum is also pushing their version of utopia. however 
                   it is very unlikely that such a utopia can ever exist, without the 
                   merit system of people producing and benefiting from their efforts. a 
                   "garden of eden" can not be recreated.

war
                    against personal freedom? it seems that many countries 
                   have embarked on a program that limits personal freedom for the 
                   alleged common good. for example, many cities around the world have 
                   expanded bicycle lanes at the expense of limiting automobile lanes. 
                   of course an automobile implies both freedom of travel and overall 
                   prosperity. the bicycle lanes tend to be an excuse since bicycle 
                   lanes only benefit the young and fit people, mostly men under the age 
                   of 40. the plan to eliminate gasoline powered cars and replce them 
                   with electric cars is a fantasy since far fewer people will be able 
                   to afford an electric car and the range and slow charging time of an 
                   electric car prevents long road trips.

climate
                    change excuses, by design or default are limiting 
                   personal freedom of travel and preventing one to do as one pleases.

 schools
                    have become indoctrination centers compulsory
                    education was never meant to improve one's social status, though 
                   that is how it is presented to the public. originally, students wore 
                   uniforms, similar to military uniforms, students learned obedience, 
                   such as marching into the school, or raising their hand for 
                   permission to read
                    more

compulsory
                    education since it started in the 1870's. 
                   people today are told that compulsory 
                   education in grade schools and high schools are necessary for the 
                   development of the child into a productive adult. certainly school 
                   has the potential to educate the student to learn to read, write, 
                   mathematics, basic history, science, geography and perhaps civic

dating
                    today 
                   permanent dating without choosing one person and having a family is 
                   today the norm. often people live together in a farm of limbo or 
                   suspended animation without any real plans for the future, children 
                   or progress. sometimes these "couples" will buy a pet dog

sex
                    and violence in the media the media, including 
                   television, the movies and various lifelike video games constantly 
                   display violence to the viewers. the various medias however, state 
                   that such violence does not influence the viewers. perhaps 
                   advertisers, who spend fortunes every year advertising in the media, 
                   should be notified that the media does not influence people and that 
                   the advertisers are wasting their money.

people
                    feel entitled unfortunately, many people in america have 
                   a sense of entitlement regardless of their skill, drive, intelligence 
                   or ability. this has led to unfounded jealousy of others and excuses 
                   for not being able to achieve the same. these anti-society feelings 
                   must end and must be controlled, if not at home as a child, at least 
                   in schools and harmony must be encouraged in the media, rather than 
                   constantly showing off the life styles of the small number of 
                   financially wealthy or socially successful people.

censorship 
                   i am opposed to almost 
                   all forms of censorship. there are certain types of "speech"
                    that should indeed be banned. this includes all pornography, sex 
                   stories that describe explicit sexual encounters, stories that 
                   encourage any act or actions that one might define as contrary to 
                   nature. what two consenting, without coercion or any psychological 
                   force is to be tolerated, however publishing or telling or filming 
                   such acts or encouraging others must be strictly forbidden.

mass
                    media vocabulary 
                   when the word "education" is used in the media or when 
                   governments promote a certain point of view and provide funds to 
                   "educate the public", it normally means to attempt to 
                   brainwash the public through propaganda and showing only one side of 
                   the issue.

 

 

 

 


reduced
                    intelligence levels and separately,
                    reduced cognitive ability? 
                   it seems that with many forms of modern technology, such as the 
                   cellular telephone/smart phone, which is really a window to the 
                   knowledge of the world, people have stopped being innovative and 
                   thinking for themselves and rather simply rely on their device. one 
                   would have thought that the exact opposite would have occurred, but 
                   it has not. further, over the past three years, there seems to be a 
                   mark decline in cognitive ability. some say the the recently 
                   developed covid vaccination causes micro blood clots, but this has 
                   yet to be proven. something however is causing a decline in rapid 
                   thinking and cognitive ability in the population.

life
                    was easier in the middle ages, 1000 years ago? perhaps, 
                   at least in europe. first, farming is far less demanding than one 
                   might think. in traditional farms, the work was primarily for a few 
                   weeks during planting season and then for a few weeks during the 
                   harvest. the rest of the time was rather easy. further, a thousand 
                   years ago in europe, there were as many "holy days" (the 
                   world "holiday" is a derivative of the "holy day")
                    as work days. thus a working year was about 175 days, rather than 
                   254 days that it is today. further today, most jobs are 8 hours of 
                   constant work in one spot, while 1000 years ago, work was not as 
                   intense. as far as longevity, we know know that people 1000 years 
                   ago, based on grave stones, lived about the same length as today, 
                   that is between 75 and 80 years on average. further, modern diseases 
                   such as heart disease, diabetes or cancer, for example, was very rare.

luxury
                    apartments the definition of luxury has changed

                   doesn't start till a minimum of 9 rooms, further, historically, a 
                   studio apartment was on the top floor, with an angular northern 
                   exposure window, so the artist would be able to paint with diffused 
                   light. real studios were considered only for the fringe or artistic 
                   people, and was less expensive. those studios usually were 25x70 
                   feet. what is called a studio today, is a one rooms sleeping place 
                   and in the past was only for someone starting out.

self
                    sufficiency 
                   america was founded on the concept of self sufficiency. 
                   unfortunately, since president franklin delano roosevelt (fdr), some 
                   members of the lower classes have come to depend on handouts and have 
                   essentially become wards of the state. true freedom is only achieved 
                   when a person is self sufficient. of course certain things are best 
                   handled by the state, such as the construction of roads, protection 
                   of people and property, food and quality maintenance, basic civil 
                   order actions and a few other societal rules to allow society to 
                   operate smoothly.

usa
                    is now a third world country? 
                   the strength of a nation is its manufacturing capacity and 
                   capability. since 1978, the united states has deindustrialization and 
                   is now similar to what used to be the definition of a third world 
                   country. that is that the usa sends raw materials and food stuff to 
                   more industrialized countries and after, those countries sends back 
                   finished products.

avoid
                    "start-ups" 
                   most so-called start up's are a waste of time and investment and are 
                   doomed to failure. the majority of startups do not attempt to 
                   manufacture or develop anything new, but instead make apps or 
                   software, yet they refer to themselves as "technology" 
                   companies. a true technology company produces physical products. apps 
                   and software are not the end but the means to service the end.

                   people want to be told what to do and how to live. people want others 
                   to do things for them. people are told what to buy, how to dress, how 
                   to talk, how to live, what to eat, almost everything, buy the media

 it
                    has become obvious that the lockdowns, imposed by most of the states 
                   to control the spread of covid-19, has clearly benefited large 
                   companies, particularly on-line mega-companies, at the expense of 
                   small, local businesses, that were forced to either close their doors 
                   or greatly curtail their operations. it was estimated that these 
                   small companies and stores represented about 60% of the economy. as a 
                   result of the government imposed lockdowns, much of this bushiness 
                   activity and wealth has been transferred, perhaps permanently, to the 
                   on-line stores. this is rapidly creating a vastly different business 
                   environment and potentially will reduce the ability of an individual 
                   to start their own business in the future.

a 
                   $40 per hour minimum
                    wage? ...frank
                    x. didik, september 22, 2021
 in
                    1962, the average 35 year old working man was able to support a 
                   wife, 3 or 4 children, own a house in the suburbs, have 2 cars and 
                   had enough money to go on a vacation once or twice a year. today, it 
                   takes two highly educated people working to buy a small one or two 
                   bedroom coop or condo, car ownership is rare and they can only afford 
                   to have one or two children at best. to achieve what a man in 1962 
                   made per week and to regain the standard of living of that time, the 
                   minimum wage must be increased to $40 per hour. the gradual decline 
                   over the past 60 years should be changed. perhaps "shock 
                   treatment" that was recommended to the former communist 
                   countries in eastern europe by "experts" from leading 
                   american universities, should be the guide for this sudden increase 
                   in the average (minimum) wage. several things would happen. first, 
                   people would initially spend much more money and this would almost 
                   instantly create huge demand. at the same time, it is very possible 
                   that prices would go up, though perhaps not as fast as one might 
                   expect, since production efficiency is much greater today than in 
                   1962. finally, it might be necessary to implement trade barriers. 
                   this of course would run counter to the direction of globalism. 
                   perhaps it is time to modify the notion of globalism and take into 
                   account the different global cultures, work ethics and achievements.

                    it
                    is fascinating to note that as a result of the government imposed 
                   covid-19 restrictions, that for a period of time, an estimated 30% of 
                   the population was out of work, and yet the country did not 
                   experience any long term shortages, in any area. one might say that 
                   this is a wake-up call for companies to show them that they have too 
                   many redundant employees. read

does
                    constant mask wearing reduce cognitive ability? studies
                    have shown that people inhale between 7% and 12% of their exhaled 
                   breath, with an accumulation of carbon dioxide. does this cause minor cognitive 
                   loss for the wearer over time? further, over time, the masks quickly 
                   become both moist as well as becomes a breading ground for bacteria. 
                   also, does the additional stress on the lungs to breath through a 
                   filter effects the lungs? more studies must be performed to determine 
                   if mask wearing causes biological issues as well as psychological 
                   issues over time.

what
            if and what can or might be.

in
            1812, napoleon wrote that "history is a myth agreed upon". 
           i say that these days, 
           "science is a myth 
           agreed upon".
            so much of alleged science today is complete nonsense. the 
           definition of science is the ability to test and retest and always 
           get the same results. anything that can not be tested is speculation 
           and should fall under the domain of philosophy, not science.


what
            is the speed of gravity? if it is instantaneous, then what if 
           gravity can be modulated? today
            most scientists, assume that the speed of gravity is the same as the 
           speed of light, but what if the speed of gravity is instantaneous? 
           further, if gravity can be modulated, it might allow for 
           instantaneous universal communication. thus it might be possible to 
           communicate with space craft instantly, rather than waiting for 
           minutes for transmissions to reach the craft or earth. perhaps 
           computer chips can be made to operate vastly faster. and this is just 
           the beginning since ...read

reason,
            logic and intellect is not reliable. 
           the late christopher hitchens often stated that we should rely on our 
           logic, reason and intellect to determine the truth. many people who 
           pride themselves as educated, intelligent and progressive believe the 
           same. as reasonable as this seems, galileo proved over 400 years ago 
           that our logic, reason and intellect is unreliable and that only 
           direct experimental data, should be relied upon. galileo had dropped 
           two balls of the same material, but different masses, from the 
           leaning tower of pisa to demonstrate that they would hit the ground 
           at the same time, rather than the heavier ball hitting the ground 
           first, as almost everyone, including aristotle, 2000 years ago, had 
           assumed. our logic, reason and intellect is not reliable and should 
           only be viewed as speculation. only direct experimentation and 
           obtaining the same results, over and over again should be relied upon.

question:
            do bicycles and 
           skate boards represent a more environmentally friendly world or does 
           it indicate a decline in the standard of living? i ride my bicycle 
           about 10 miles every day, but only a small percentage of the 
           population benefit from bike lanes, mostly men under the age of 50. 
           further, most people ride bikes in warm, favorable weather and rarely 
           in the rain, snow or cold weather.

old
            computer formats and the longevity of our digitally stored 
           knowledge. are 
           we entering into a "pre-history" era? how can we preserve 
           our computer written records, books, photographs, video and 
           knowledge? if you 
           wanted to, would you be able to read a:

           doubt that the current line up of formats, such as sd cards, usb

questioning
            the results of modern science. for
            the last 100 years, we have been experiencing the collapse of real 
           science. theories, speculation and fantasy is the norm today. by 
           definition, the scientific method is the ability to test and re-test 
           and always get the same results, over and over. if an idea or a 
           theory can not be tested, the idea must be viewed as speculation and 
           not considered true, till that idea is proven without a doubt. 
           scientific theory has moved to areas that are beyond our present 
           capability of testing and gradually a number of unproven theories 
           have become accepted as fact without any real proof. further, new

           review the discovery and confirm that it is in fact correct. such

eclipse in upstate new york

eclipse in upstate new york:
            april 8, 2024 the width of totality was about 109 miles/170km and 
           lasted for little more than 3 minutes. a total eclipse is vastly 
           different than a 99% eclipse. within just 4 seconds, the temperature 
           dropped by 7 degrees fahrenheit. the colors, for some unexplained 
           reason, seemed to shift. further, our digital cameras did not seem to

frank
            x. didik theory of theories:
people often forget that any "science" that 
           has the word "theory" in it is mere speculation without any 
           substantial proof.
for example, the atomic "theory", or the 
           "theory" of evolution, big-bang "theory", theory 
           that stars are suns, theory that there are millions of other planets 
           and universes, the theory of climate change, and the list goes on and 
           on. so many things are taught in our schools without any real proof 
           are mentioned so often that people accept these thoughts are 
           unquestionably real, but the fact is that all of them are mere 
           speculation that may or may not be true. some things are accepted as 
           fact, that may not be true or accurate. such things as carbon 14 
           dating, or the age of certain stratigraphy or fossils are all 
           suspect. truthfully, we just do not know. science is the ability to 
           test and retest and always get the same results. if something can not 
           be tested, it falls under the domain of philosophy.

frank's old girlfriend? no! this 3 foot high 
           speculative recreation of what i think is a monkey, is on display at 
           the national museum of ancient history in ueno tokyo. the museum 
           states that this creature is what human's "evolved" from, 
           for those who actually believe in "evolution". the museum 
           complex is excellent, though i do not accept their conclusions. there 
           are so many theories that perhaps the museum should be renamed 
           "the museum of speculation and wishful thinking"! sadly, 
           many museums around the world repeat the same speculations without proof.

value value is 
           determined by availability and unavailability. value increases if 
           something is difficult to obtain and if the item is needed or desired.

science today attempts 
           to prove natural phenomenon without the existence of god. another way 
           of saying this is that science is attempting to prove the god does 
           not exist. unfortunately many things that so-called "modern"
            science clings to are very dubious at best.


without proof there is 
           always something that some people will believe without proof. for 
           example: if an atheist is asked if god exists, will immediately say 
           such things as only primitive people believe in god or those who will 
           not accept "science", etc. when asked about ghosts, 
           spirits, astrology the atheist may again say that 
           it is complete nonsense. however if you ask the atheist if he/she 
           believes in life on other planets, the existence of millions of 
           planets and solar systems, global warming, and most of what is in 
           books on the current view of the pre-historic world, the atheist may 
           well accept it even though there is not a shred of evidence 
           that any of this is real. other concepts that are often accepted 
           without proof include:



 the theory of "black holes",
the acceptance that the decay rate of radioactive 
            elements to be a constant, rather than varying over time or because 
            of outside influences, such as pressure, temperature, etc. if the 
            decay rate is not a constant, it will completely effect the notion of 
            carbon dating, a method that is already questionable.
human caused global warming
evolution
the atomic model of protons, electrons, neutrons 
            and a host of "sub atomic particles".
that stars are suns
the expanding universe or big bang theory
the speculative belief that life exists on other planets


...and the list goes on and on.

moving ahead it is 
           difficult to accomplish things and move ahead if you are always busy. 
           you must take the time to step back and think things through.

evolution
            of american english accents i have noticed that accents 
           evolve very quickly. if you were to watch a movie from the 1930's, 
           1940's or any other time, you will notice that people from each 
           period have distinct accents. recently, i have noticed that first 
           generation americans, who perhaps grew up in bilingual families, for 
           example polish or chinese families, have a distinct, new american 
           accent. i presume that over time, everyone's accent will be 
           significantly different in years to come.

collapse
            in the standard of living i believe 
           that the standard of living in the united states was highest in the 
           early 1960's. in 1962, the average 35 year old working man was able 
           to support a wife, 3 or 4 children, own a house in the suburbs, have 
           2 cars and had enough money to go on a vacation once or twice a year. 
           today, it takes two highly educated people working to buy a small one 
           or two bedroom coop or condo, car ownership is rare and they can only 
           afford to have one or two children at best.read

automation

           with new automation and robotics, which requires less employees, it 
           is now possible for most american based companies to return 
           manufacturing to the united states, with the benefit of lower 
           production costs, lower shipping costs and a safer business climate, 
           when compared with outsourced manufacturing. -february

the
            downside of robotics robotics will 
           bring about a fundamental change in society. millions of jobs will be 
           lost, but only a few, high end jobs will be created. most former 
           employees will not be employable in this new environment. the same 
           occurred in england in the early 1800's with the industrial 
           revolution. high end weaving jobs were lost after the introduction of 
           high speed looms. another example is the computer revolution from the 
           late 1960's till the mid 1980's and on till today eliminated the need 
           for thousands of office clerks. - may

social media social
            media has very little to do with being social, but rather deals with 
           ego and the desire for recognition and self defined importance and 
           with the number of "likes" or "followers". 
           perhaps "social media" should be renamed "anti-social 
           media". a key issue is that those who are addicted to 
           "social media" tend to neglect real life.

education today 
           as mentioned before, schools have become more and more focused on 
           indoctrination and formation of opinions, rather than focusing on the 
           basics such as reading, writing, mathematics, critical thinking, 
           basic history, art and business.

bitcoin: 
           bitcoins are backed by nothing more than the gullibility and wishful 
           thinking of the bitcoin holder.
i believe that the 
           bitcoin rise in value is akin to the dutch tulip craze in the early 
           1600's and that a massive decline in value is imminent.

foreign
            manufactured products versus american manufactured products: 
           american's will never buy an american made product if the same or 
           similar foreign products is sold at a lower price. this means that 
           manufacturing jobs will never return to the united states, unless 
           there is an import tax, however import taxes will violate most of 
           america's nafta and gat treaties. any talk of manufacturing jobs 
           returning to america without import taxes is simply idle banter.

the
            safety of plastics. 
           over the past 30 years, there has been a massive increase in the 
           number of human ailments such as alzheimer's, breast cancer, prostate 
           cancer, autism, declining fertility, and other ailments. some people 
           say that the cause is actually better diagnosis, while others blame 
           processed foods, gmo foods, pesticides, wifi, cell phones, 
           vaccinations and other outside influences. during this period, there 
           has been a rapid increase of various plastic packaging for food, 
           water and even clothing made out of polyester and other plastics, 
           with a decline in 100% natural fibers such as cotton and wool. 
           studies should be conducted regarding the safety of these new 
           materials, as well as the fabric dyes and determine if such chemicals 
           can be absorbed by the skin and if they have any type of long range 
           human effect. -february

           people do not understand the true cost and effect of interest over 
           time. for example, if you put $10 in a bank account you will have the 
           following after 100 years:

at
            3% interest, compounded yearly: $192.19
at
            6% interest compounded yearly: $3,393.02
at
            8% interest compounded yearly: $21,997.61

as you see, 
           doubling the interest rate, vastly increases the amount you either 
           get from interest or have to pay in interest. this is why when the 
           central bank increases interest rates, it matters so much and can 
           have such a massive effect in the economy or commerce. -april

sunglasses
            reduces reaction time, since it takes 
           longer for the brain to process a darker image then a well lit image. 
           this could lead to potentially dangerous situations. some stereo 3d 
           systems used a dark glass and a lighter glass for two different eyes 
           to achieve the 3d effect, though polarized glasses are more common.

           no children, only dogs. i
            have noticed that in new york city, the playgrounds are empty but 
           the dog runs are full. people are no longer getting married, and 
           having families. where will this all lead to? when i was a child 
           growing up in nyc, there were children everywhere and the stores 
           catered to families, rather than individual single people. the best 
           boutiques along madison avenue on manhattan's upper east side, always 
           had play areas for the children, so that the children could play, 
           while the mothers shopped. we children knew which stores had the best 
           toys and demanded to go to those stores, which in most cases, were 
           the most expensive stores! a sizable 
           portion of the population are no longer getting married and forming 
           families, but read

it
            is essential to maintain law and order in new
            york city there
            has been a type of collapse of law and order in nyc. shoplifting is 
           rampant, with little chance of punishment, even if caught. 
           shoplifting is so prevalent that some stores have simply closed their 
           businesses. unfortunately, the recent state law that removes the bail 
           requirement for many smaller crimes has given the green light to 
           criminals to continue their criminality.

besides the 
           shoplifting and new bail rules, new york city has become like the 
           wild west when it comes to motorcycles. today, very few motorcycles 
           seem to even have license plates, which means that they are probably 
           uninsured, unlicensed, and unqualified to even be riding. further the 
           motorcycles rarely obey traffic laws and almost always go through red 
           lights, ride on the sidewalk or ride the wrong way down one way 
           streets. in the past, police commissioner bratton and others 
           maintained that by enforcing smaller regulations, the larger laws 
           also benefit.

we must have 
           reasonable police enforcement in new york city and certainly let us 
           not even consider reducing funding to the nypd. let the nypd do their job.

bike

            i am a strong believer that less government is best government, the

           bicyclist obey traffic rules. this is particularly necessary in 
           crowded urban areas. with the proliferation of bicycles, more and 
           more accidents and related injuries are occurring to both the cyclist 
           as well as pedestrians. a basic form of a license plate for bicycles 
           as well as liability insurance is clearly necessary.

massive
            surpluses in society 
           industry has produced massive surpluses since the start of the 
           industrial revolution, 230 years ago, society has gradually managed 
           to ever increase productivity and surpluses. today, these surpluses 
           are so great that i estimate that only 20% of the population can 
           support themselves and the rest of the population. this assumption 
           was proven essentially correct with the covid/corona lockdowns when 
           it was estimated that over 50% of the population was not working and 
           yet society did not experience any shortages in any area. further, 
           with the robotic and artificial intelligence revolution just around 
           the corner, even greater surpluses will be achieved and even less 
           workers/employees will be needed. this leads to the question of how 
           to deal with the vast number of people who's work will no longer be 
           needed? if the present monetary system continues, perhaps a basic, 
           livable income will necessary, though in general, i am not in favor 
           of the idea, since i have always felt that everyone should be 
           required to carry their own weight in society and further, give back 
           to society. there are some who feel that the population should be 
           reduced by discouraging the formation of families, encouraging single 
           life, birth control, abortion, same sex unions encouraging latter age 
           marriage and other methods. most non-retail businesses can easily 
           survive with less than 50% of their work force.

where
            have all the insects and birds gone? 
           just a few years ago, when i would drive in the country, my 
           windshield would be covered with insects that had hit the car. this 
           simply does not happen anymore. has the insect population somehow 
           died out? no one seems to talk about this. has insecticides or 
           plastics or radio transmissions somehow effected them? further, i 
           have noticed a large drop in the number of birds that we have in the 
           cities as well as in the countryside. it seems that we are headed 
           towards, a silent spring.

weak
            students: 
           i have long believed that in a classroom environment, the weak 
           student holds the better students back. the idea of putting a weak 
           student with better students is a disservice to both the weak as well 
           as the better students. president thomas jefferson wrote how a slow 
           person holds back the others, rather than catching up to the others. 
           it should also be recognized that not all people have the same 
           ability and potential in every field. two individuals completing the 
           same university program and having the same grades and degree, does 
           not make them equal in ability and potential. students should not be 
           told that they can succeed at anything that they try to do.

            read
            more ...

teaching: i
            feel that it is not possible to teach a person to be creative or a 
           good businessman and the same applies to many other fields. you can 
           only expose that person to what has already been done and the current 
           understanding of the tools and materials of the trade and perhaps 
           with this understanding, the student can expand upon this knowledge.

learning: my
            view is that almost all learning is through observation and 
           questioning. this underscores the importance of parents to teach 
           their children and expose their children to the parents daily lives. 
           in today's society, most parents are forced to work and thus the 
           child has only limited exposure to the richness of the parents 
           understanding of things. i would also argue that when a parent is 
           walking with a child, that the parent should not be using their cell 
           phone or texting and instead be devoting their full attention to the 
           child. schools, as they exist today, have a limited ability to truly 
           train/educate a student and most of what is taught to the student is 
           repeated over and over with little practical use for the student 
           after graduation. so many students today study for years and yet 
           after graduation, never use what they have learned or what they have 
           learned is of little relevance to their lives.

           no children, only dogs. i
            have noticed that in new york city, the playgrounds are empty but

where
            have all the twenty something year olds gone?
strolling
            down fashionable fifth avenue in manhattan, new york city recently, 
           it struck me how the average age of the crowded streets seems older 
           than in the past. i would guess that the average age of the people i 
           saw was around 35 years old. twenty years ago, the average age would 
           have been probably around 25 years old. why? i will further guess 
           that the answer is that many people are postponing marriage and 
           having far fewer children. perhaps the high student debt or perhaps 
           women seeking careers over family or perhaps the hook-up culture is 
           the culprit. regardless, this does not bode well for the future and 
           increasing family commitments is a must for a healthy society. ---

immigration: 
           almost all countries consider what perspective immigrants can do for 
           their country and if those immigrants will contribute or be a burden 
           on their society and also evaluate if the potential immigrant will 
           blend in with their existing culture. perhaps the united states 
           should take the same approach. ---feb 11, 2019

the
            term "white privilege"
            is a racist term, on the same level as the "n" word 
           and only serves to create racial tension, towards whites. needless to 
           say, there are both poor and wealthy whites. all people should be 
           treated with respect, regardless of their race or physical 
           appearance. it is essential to individualize, rather then judge an 
           entire group of people, as though they are all the same. the 
           derogatory term of "white privilege" should never be used 
           by politicians, in the press or used in schools and the term should 
           be allowed to die out.
