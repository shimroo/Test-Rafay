most cancers are driven by sub-clinical inflammation



http://www.entrechem.com/en/development/index.html

nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kb) , is the master switch, the primary means by which inflammation is adjusted. nf-ĸb activation is a major mediator of inflammation in most diseases and inhibition of nf-ĸb can help prevent/delay the onset of the disease. 

curcuminoids found in immunopower gold’s curcumin complex provide natural compounds derived from turmeric roots that inhibit nf-ĸb.

what a few of our happy customers are saying!




don, ca
“i have been taking the maintenance dose of immunopower for about a year now. i buy the larger quantity. immunopower maintenance dose supplements are working for me. my brief history: radical prostatectomy in 1999, radiation and hormone therapy in 2005. my psa level started to climb again after the hormone injections wore off, so i made radical changes…. … my oncologist says i am the only guy he has ever seen who can control a rising psa with nutrition and lifestyle changes. i like to think that immunopower has helped as far as the supplements are concerned. they have everything in it, plus more, than i was taking individually and it’s cheaper.”



mary, mi
“immunopower is a unique powder form nutritional supplement recently devised by dr patrick quillin to maximise the cancer patient’s chances against cancer. it contains everything known to science that affects the course of the disease for the better. its primary attractions apart from this are ease of consumption and best value for money anywhere available for a comparable regime. we would agree with dr quillin’s claim that it is 75% cheaper than buying all the necessary supplements individually. “



linda, canada
“i was diagnosed in november of 2014 with uterine cancer that had matastisized. i went through the surgery to debulk the tumor and out lying tissue. i elected not to go with radiation treatments for five weeks five days/ week and full strength chemo at the same time for six months that my radiologist and oncologist had encouraged and elected me to go on, when i read your book and my husband and i knew this was a much better and safer way to go. through my protocol i’m doing much better and picking up strength and energy every day. thank you so much for the enlightened encouragement and hope!!”



richard, va
“after 4 years of sliding down the prostate cancer becoming bone cancer road, and having my husband so weak he could hardly get out of bed, i was looking for a miracle. i found patrick quillin’s book and immunopower two months ago and started following his nutrition program, ordered immunopower. i am now in complete remission “
