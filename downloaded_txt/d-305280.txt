our story 



with over 40 years in business, the original crabby bill’s stands as the epitome of a family legacy intertwined with the community of indian rocks beach, offering fresh, no-frills seafood in tampa bay, florida. our family business story kicks off with the loder family patriarch, bill loder, whose roots in the seafood business trace back to the shores of new jersey. picture a young couple, bill and dolores, immersing themselves in the world of seafood since their marriage in 1954, just outside philadelphia. blue crabs were their roadside specialty, complemented by the charm of a small seafood joint.
