because it accepts that deity is ultimately mystery...
the mystic's wheel of the year multifaith calendar celebrates the diversity 
		of beliefs and practices in all the world's religions. it promotes understanding 
		of, and respect for, all religions. it includes both eastern and western 
		religions. it includes both ancient and contemporary religions. it includes 
		views considered unorthodox as well as those considered orthodox. it recognizes 
		universal spiritual principles and the elements common amongst the world's 
		religions. it reflects deep ecumenism.

as mahatma mohandas gandhi said: "religions are different roads 
		converging to the same point. what does it matter that we take different 
		roads, so long as we reach the same goal? in reality, there are as many 
		religions as there are individuals."
		this multifaith calendar helps in exploring those different roads from 
		the perspective that those roads all converge at the same point.

		this multifaith calendar also helps in rediscovering deity in non-patriarchal ways. 
		it helps to explore various concepts of deity -- as within all and beyond 
		all; as all forms and formless; as masculine and feminine and genderless; 
		as an infinite, all-encompassing, and universal unity; and as all-embracing 
		love.

		this multifaith calendar also promotes deep ecology, social justice, and world peace. 
		consequently, it focuses on ecological, egalitarian, and peaceable aspects 
		of the world's religions. it recognizes the interconnectedness, interdependence, 
		and sacredness of all nature. it recognizes the need for environmental healing 
		through preservation and conservation. it recognizes the need to have respect 
		and deep compassion for all humanity and for all animals. it recognizes 
		the equality of men and women and the equality of all peoples. it recognizes 
		the human rights of all. it embraces multiculturalism and rejects cultural 
		imperialism. it recognizes that peace will only be achieved through justice, 
		cooperation, and elimination of weapons of mass destruction.

		this multifaith calendar promotes interfaith dialogue. as dr. hans kung said: "there will be no peace among the nations 
without peace among the religions. there will be no peace among the religions 
without dialogue among the religions." and there cannot be true understanding 
and true acceptance of other religions without learning about the diversity 
within one's own faith as well as the diversity within others. and seeing 
		the good and the beauty in them all.

		and ultimately, this multifaith calendar hopes to promote love for deity and love 
		for all...because that is what mysticism -- and eco-egalitarian spirituality 
		of all kinds -- is all about.

the mystic's wheel of the year multifaith calendar features 
		religious holidays 
		of:

		* judaism (kabbalah)
		* christianity (ecumenical mysticism/wisdom tradition)
		* unitarian universalism (including transcendentalism & deism)
		* islam (sufism)
		* baha'i faith
		* hinduism (shaiva, vaishnaiva & tantric)
		* buddhism (tibetan, zen, pure land & theravada)
		* jainism
		* sikhism
		* taoism
		* shinto
		* zoroastrianism
		* african religions (santeria & ancient egyptian)
		* native american religions (iroquois, navajo & pueblo)
		* meso american religions (inca, mayan & aztec)
		* old european religions (greek, roman, slavic, celtic, anglo-teutonic & 
		norse)

the mystic's wheel of the year multifaith calendar also includes:

		* a primer on eco-egalitarian spirituality
		* days focused on milestones/teachers/activists in the deep ecology (environmentalist), 
		social justice (human rights/feminist), and peace (disarmament) movements
		* solar and lunar cycles, eclipses, helions, meteor showers, visible planets, 
		and astrological periods
		* experiential meditations (for each phase of the moon throughout the year)
		* empowering meditations
		* action offerings (to help the environment and further social justice)
		* art as meditation

		     * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

		those with a mystic perspective believe that the truth is unknowable. 
		they believe that all beliefs and practices are legitimate if inspired 
		by love for deity, love for humanity, and love for nature. thus, mystics respect the 
		life-affirming (non-harmful) beliefs and practices of all, whether those 
		beliefs and practices are similar to, or different from, their own.

     * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

		our intent is to treat all religions equally. there is no intent to favor 
		or disfavor any religion. there is no intent to "convert" anyone to or from 
		any religion, though we do hope to serve as a means to better understand 
		one's own tradition as well as other traditions.

		some holidays have been reclaimed to reflect their positive, non-patriarchal, 
		nature-based aspects. our intent is to be inclusive and respectful to both 
		genders, all peoples, and all traditions.

		because this calendar is a multifaith calendar, the term "god" is used 
		only when referring to a male deity. the term "deity" is used to refer to 
		the universal gender-neutral deity that encompasses both male and female 
		characteristics and all gods and goddesses.

		religious holidays are calculated based on available information. except where the 
		religious tradition dictates otherwise, lunar-based dates are calculated 
		using u.s. eastern time.
in addition to religious holidays, this calendar includes official and 
unofficial u.s. civic holidays, u.n. holidays, other international holidays, and 
commemorations of significant events.

		     * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

		this calendar was first published in 1995. as there remain many more religious 
		traditions and celebrations yet to be included in the calendar, it remains 
		a work in progress.

		because we were not raised in all the denominations of all these 
		traditions, our knowledge and understanding is regretfully limited and 
		superficial. and we accept that this calendar will not please everyone.
