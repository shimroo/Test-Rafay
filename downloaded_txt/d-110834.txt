plan ahead for planting success

                                        
                                         if you’re anything like us, you’re thinking about planting and landscaping plans all year ‘round.
                                    







what is buffalograss?

                                        
                                         buffalograss is a fine-leaved native grass species that has prospered on the great plains for centuries.
                                    







care after planting

                                        
                                         all seeds need moisture to germinate.
                                    







how to plant wildflowers

                                        
                                            
 preparing to plant 
 it is extremely important to eliminate any undesirable plants by either herbicide or tillage treatments.
                                    







warm season grass (wsg) vs. cool season grass (csg)

                                        
                                         although a majority of prairie plants we carry are warm-season plants, the prairie also maintains a variety of cool-season plants.
                                    







prairie grasses: what to expect the first year

                                        
                                         less-experienced growers are almost always convinced they have a failure in the first year; however, most of the time it is actually a good stand.
                                    







seeding successfully on highly erodible sites

                                        
                                         although prairiegrasses and wildflowers are low maintenance, they are not no maintenance! as your stand matures and fills in, it becomes more competitive to weeds, but care must be given to eliminate undesirable plants from new and old seedings.
