help two teens raise money for mmfcsupport life changing medical procedures for childrenalexia and ava o’donnell have been volunteers for mmfc for a few years. the two teens began their volunteer experience in the mmfc office, helping to pack medical supplies for the missions, volunteering at fundraising events and collecting stuffed animals to give to the children.
in june 2023, they had an opportunity to join the mmfc mission to guatemala. based on their experience in june 2024 and a subsequent visit in january  2024, the teens decided that if they could raise money for medical equipment for the hospital in guatemala – then they could help hundreds, if not thousands of children for many years to come. 
these young women have set up a gofundme page to raise money to buy medical equipment.  please read about their experiences, then donate!

what is cleft lip & palate and why is it so prevalent in certain areas?
cleft lip and cleft palate occur when tissues in the baby’s face and mouth don’t fuse properly. normally, the tissues that make up the lip and palate fuse together in the second and third months of pregnancy. but in babies with cleft lip and cleft palate, the fusion never takes place or occurs only part way, leaving an opening (cleft).

success stories







denver
denver is a 7 year old boy who lives 4 hours away from angeles city in province of aurora. denver has been bullied a lot. when he is bullied he will just return home, even if he is at school. his parents need to smash up his food so he can eat it. then each bite is followed by milk to wash the food down. his father, nick, is a rice farmer. they journeyed to angeles city when nick's sister-in-law told him about mmfc's mission for february.








maria
maria anne was a 3 month old girl with cleft lip and palate. apparently both the birth parents have cleft deformities in their families. this year, we will fix her cleft lip and if she’s healthy and weighs at least 20lbs next year, we will fix her cleft palate.

 

maria anne came back in february 2019 to have her cleft palate fixed. along with the palate surgery, the doctors will fix some of the scarring from the cleft lip surgery.
