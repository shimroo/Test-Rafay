what members are saying




noda has provided me a place to learn and develop in areas i did not even know i was interested in. no matter where you are professionally, noda has something for you to find community and growth.vincentnoda member since 2016southern methodist university
being involved with noda has given me a professional home and a network of colleagues-turned-friends. my involvement with the association is very complimentary to my professional responsibilities and directly supports my development. through these opportunities, i am challenged to think outside the box by peers who understand the realities of our profession, encouraged to grow and learn, and feel uplifted as i make meaning and add value to my work.thomasnoda member since 2018northeastern university
noda has been a way for me to develop a greater sense of purpose in my everyday work. the community and support system i have developed within the association has been the driving factor behind my involvement. i have been able to combine my passions, strengths, and interests to give back to an association who has helped define me as the professional i am today. taylornoda member since 2019the university of georgia
