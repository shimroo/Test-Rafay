this was the world premier for unleashed
              power  
june 6, 2008 - le petit
              versailles lower east side new york
while the piece has evolved since this performance,  this performance being that it was the world premier & that it was at le petit versailles is one i'm rather attached to.

robots: in our image 
['temporary office' located at
             21 grand 416 25th st.] 
a presentation by eliot k daughtry, executive
                    director
                  a performance by killer banshee 

most of the world's robots are
                             industrial, but most of the ones we imagine look like humans.
                             why do we think about one and use another? how can a robot
                             be a human and also be an artificial intelligence? why are
                             we comfortable with some robots, but find others creepy? why
                             are more robots male than female? this presentation will discuss
                             major areas of the robot taxonomy project, an ongoing effort
                             to classify all types of robots and why humans create them.
the holidaze are coming!!! 
whatever are you going to do for
                         all of the presents you need? check out the killer
              banshee studios shop or our etsy
              store.
