wpi is a top-ranked university with more than 50 undergraduate degree programs in science, engineering, technology, math, business, and the humanities and arts. a wpi education will enable you to pursue your passions at a world-class research institution with an innovative project-based curriculum where you combine theory and practice.







what’s in a wpi education?








 






							to start off,
						

							projects from day one, hundreds of student clubs, 50+ global project centers, infinite opportunities–
						

really, it’s easier if we just show you →










 






							from day one:
						

							project-based learning
						

take the theories you learn in the classroom and put them into practice through project work starting from your first days on campus—there’s a reason our motto translates to theory and practice, after all. 









	more about project-based learning >











 






							a lasting impact
						

							50+ global project centers
						

travel to one of our 50+ project centers around the world to collaborate with a local community to address a problem. you’ll learn just as much from them as they will from you, and your work can have a lasting impact—not just on the community, but on yourself. 









	more about global projects >











 






							here, research is in our dna.
						

							undergraduate research opportunities
						

whatever your field of interest, take advantage of research opportunities starting from your first year at wpi, and learn from and collaborate with renowned faculty. 









	more about research at wpi >











 






							sure, we’re a stem-focused university, but that’s not all we love. 
						

							more than stem
						

pursue your passion in music while earning your robotics degree, take center stage in the lab and the theatre, or perfect your skills in both underwater hockey and business. 










 






							from the moment you arrive on campus
						

							poised for success
						

we’re focused on providing you with the education, experiences, connections, resources, and support necessary to achieve your goals both before and after graduation. 









	more about return on investment











 






							we do a lot of things differently at wpi
						

							seven-week terms
						

and that includes our academic schedule. instead of two semesters, our academic year is split into four seven-week terms, giving you the chance to immerse yourself in your coursework.
