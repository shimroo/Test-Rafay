what people say about us





if you are buying or selling real estate in the huntsville, alabama area mike is your best choice. mike is a professional & a pleasure to deal with. i have used him twice in the last two years & couldn’t be more pleased. mike handles all the details from start to finish. he has a list of excellent vendors in case you need any work done & actually will take care of getting the job done. - bob m.






mike manosky is the perfect example of a realtor. he is educated in the market, extremely intelligent, forever patient and truly listens to his clients needs and wants. mike first started working with my husband in 2010 even though we were a couple years out from moving here as a family. he showed my husband hundreds on homes, plans and offer sound advice. we finally made a choice the beginning of 2013 and closed on our new home 3 weeks ago. we could not be happier with mike. he is not just the best realtor out there, he is someone we consider a friend. he is the only realtor i feel 100% comfortable referring family and friends to!!! - pamela olbert






mike manosky is a consummate professional. his insights on the current market trends were critical in helping us establish the right price. mike's attention to detail in reviewing our preparations to bring our home to market, as well as keeping us informed every step of the way, made all the difference. our home sold faster than comparable properties, and at a price we expected. we recommend mike manosky to anyone who is serious about buying or selling in today's market. - bob & peggy






we like mike! we've used multiple realtors over the years, however none have came close to the service, professionalism and knowledge of his area as mike manosky. we contacted mike in august to see if he could represent us as a buyer's agent. we closed on our home last week. the entire experience was great from start to finish. mike set everything up for a couple of weekend/weekday visits and followed up regularly with information and answers to any questions we had regarding a property. in the end he assisted with our purchase through the closing with interest in meeting our needs as a client. we highly recommend mike for any real estate need you might have. thanks again! - tracy






mike had an intimate knowledge of the entire huntsville and surrounding areas, and quickly honed in on the area and type of home we were interested in. once we selected the home, mike continued to provide outstanding personal support in coordinating the myriad inspections required prior to closing, and offering sound advice on price negotiation strategies. - dave harsch
