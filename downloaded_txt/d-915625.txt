feel free to print out pages on this site and to give them to others, but
i ask you to include the complete page with header. check out the monthly
technical tidbit article linked at the bottom of this page. each one will
illustrate a design or measurement principle, sometimes what
 not
to do.

you may also enjoy my twitter feed. just go to http://twitter.com
and follow me at @dougcsmith_ee . i usually post short items such as
interesting technical links once or twice per day.

design and troubleshooting tips and techniques:
you will find many tips on design and troubleshooting on this site, yet what
you see is just the "tip of the iceberg" compared to what is available in
my on-site private seminars. the seminars cover many effective design and troubleshooting techniques developed by myself and not taught anywhere else!  click here to request more information via email.

great design, troubleshooting, and emc/esd seminars!
learn and have fun, all at once at a beautiful, historic venue 22 miles from las vegas.
attending one of these classes is like insurance against a design or field disaster for your company
and can add to your company's financial results immediately (this quarter)!






lab techniques, robust design, and troubleshooting click here for virtual classes (four half days) limted to 10 attendeesclick here for the next live class (three full days)* limited to 6 attendees
or pick your own dates (contact me for details)

why come to this class?  why come to boulder city? click here
lots of new material have been added to both seminars above that will help you crank out good designs quickly

* the most fun an engineer can have! attendance limited to six lucky people for a great experience.

lab techniques, robust design, and troubleshooting
(click here to register and for more information on the live class)
(click here to register for the vertual, web based class)

this seminar is fun and covers material not covered in any other seminar by others.
it is much broader than just emc/esd issues, covering my research over many decades.
(also known as high frequency measurements and noise in electronic circuits)

click here for more information, including cancellation policy.
the live seminar is limited to 6 people to insure the best experience and social distancing!
click here to see a walk through of the facilities in boulder city, nv



three whole or four half days, one instructor covering
great techniques to get your design working and finding defects that
could become field failures. in addition, unique and powerful methods
of troubleshooting emc and esd problems in minutes to hours instead of
days to weeks or more are presented. lots of demos on live circuits
illustrate most of the main points covered. people have said this was
the best course they have ever taken! click here for more information. low cost, and some travel expenses included.

the
seminar includes many design and troubleshooting techniques from my
research that have saved my clients millions of dollars and are only
available at this seminar. no other event, symposia, seminar, or
webinar covers these privately developed techniques.

new:
new data for waveform purity and e-field radiation from most modern esd
simulators that will help you select a simulator that will be more
likely to fail or pass your product. esd testing standards do not
adequately characterize the simulators leading to inconsistent test
results. this data will help make sense of test results.





the lab, design, and troubleshooting seminar
is my three day seminar on design, lab techniques, and 
troubleshooting which includes about 1/2 day on emc in designs, esd in
designs, and troubleshooting and measurement techniques in the design
lab. i started this seminar years ago and constantly add and update it.
a number of  people have said to me that it is the best course on
any topic they and eveqr taken. almost 50% of time is devoted to
demonstrations. this year i have added a new section on exposing low
probability failure modes that can present safety or other problems
that can be a field disaster. there is content on my unique emc/esd
troubleshooting techniques, but in addition, there is a lot of content
on just getting the design to work in the first place or to
troubleshoot it later on.

this class is held in the boulder dam hotel, a restored
national landmark building that hosted the dignitaries who came to
visit hoover dam during its construction. to visit the boulder dam
hotel website, click here.






about boulder city, nv



boulder city, nv is a small, quiet town that
once was home to the workers that built hoover dam. there is plenty to
see within a few blocks of the seminar venue shown in the picture
below. it is located about 6 miles from hoover dam and about 22 miles
from las vegas. boulder city is the opposite of las vegas, but the
glamor of las vegas is not too far away if you want to go there. i
often say that being in boulder city is like living in the 1950s but
with very high speed internet. follow the links below for more
information.

webinars on targeted topics to avoid/fix design problems!


click here,
to see descriptions and registration information on my one hour
webinars than can solve difficult design problems quickly. touching on
topics like signal integrity, emc, esd, and general analog and digital
design, these webinars are a quick way to get your design working.
there are public presentations most weeks as well as private
presentations on demand with a new simplified, lower cost price structure. new webinars are
added periodically.



wireless charging and power transfer - problems and solutions
friday, june 14th, 2019 at 10 a.m. pdt (us)







wireless charging has several problems including noise injection into
the system structure that can lead to emc issues. many such devices get
past emc testing by limiting the way emc testing is done to benign
cases. this webinar will demonstrate the problems and possible
solutions in a live lab environment as opposed to just showing slides.
target is for a one hour presentation but the length may vary depending
on audience participation and may go longer.

the cost is lower than most webinars at $100/person capped at $500 per
location, so that even individuals can afford to attend that will not
be reimbursed by their employer. if you have several people that can
attend, the cost becomes very low per person. private delivery for a group is $500.

please call/text/or email me before registering to make sure there is a spot for you. cell: +1-408-858-4528, doug@dsmith.org

podcasts on technical topics     


      






you can find lots of audio and video podcasts on various topics of
technical interests. most of them are from a few years ago and were on
my paid website emcesd-p.com but are still current and useful, and now
free. i will be adding podcasts regularly in the future. this has been
made possible by the continuing decline in costs of bandwidth. click here to go to my podcast page or go directly to my papers, articles, and technical tidbits on this site!










check out one of my non-technical adventures, the devil dash, a footrace combined with an obstacle course (barbed wire, mud,  rough terrain, etc.). click here
to see the story. the event took place in bootleg canyon, here in
boulder city, nv march 23, 2013, on a much colder than normal day.i
finished faster than 90% those entered, who on average were less than
half my age (67), including finishing faster than 82% of the 20-25 year
old group!
2022 update: currently i am running in the top 1% of all runners of all ages for mileage per month according to strava (200-250 miles per month)!

have a tough design problem? design
problems can be very costly. even if caught in the lab, precious resources
can be wasted tracking such problems down. my private seminars cover design
and troubleshooting techniques i developed that are not taught by anyone
else! these techniques have solved tough problems in a day or two after design
teams had struggled with the problems for weeks or months, not to mention
avoiding the problems in the first place. click here to request more information.

design troubleshooting and verification: tracking down design problems in the lab can be time consuming. my public 
seminars and my private on-site seminars include new information
to minimize debug time. the difference can be hours to a solution instead
of weeks! click here to hear a 1 minute, ~128k, audio clip discussing the seminar.
