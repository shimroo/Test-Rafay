two dimensional curves




























mathematical curves 




hi, you've entered a collection of 
      939 two-dimensional mathematical curves
you can find a curve in five ways:
1. by name
a  b 
      c  d 
      e  f 
      g  h 
      i  j 
      k  l 
      m  n 
      o  p 
      q  r 
      s  t 
      u  v 
      w  x 
      y  z
