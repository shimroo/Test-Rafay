swimwear

can you tell your jammers from your briefs, leggings, swim shirts, stingersuits, and diveskins?
weÂ clarify this aÂ bit.



sun protection

many people don't realise that sunburn risk on the beach is much higher than inland, due to the light reflection from sand and sea.
weÂ look at solutions.



waterwear

when it is too warm for a wetsuit,
but not right for swimwear, water clothes offer you convenience, warmth and sun protection.




modest swimwear

modest swimwear is gaining broader appeal beyond the religious community, with sunburn protection being a major consideration.



sportswear


sportswear and casual clothes work well for watersports if you don't want to spend a lot on specialist gear.



fabricsÂ guide


watersport clothes can be high tech.
this guide helps you find the right gear and enjoy your time in theÂ water.



swimwear colour warning


fashionable swim shirts and leggings are available in many bright colours.

while blue is a popular color for swimwear,
it may be noteworthy that light blue swimwear makes you almost invisible to the lifeguards and other swimmers.
in swimming pools pale blue clothing is effectively camouflage.
youÂ just fade into the background.



the kid in the pale blue swimsuit is almost invisible.
this could be a safety risk.




swimwear in bright colours keeps you visible to other swimmers and the lifeguards.




test reviews

the watch is waterproof, but how long will the suitÂ last?

on this website you'll find tests and reviews of a wide variety of swimwear, waterwear, and travel reports.
our keen swimmers will check out any kit we get our hands on and write a review with links to suppliers.

first look
when we see an interesting new product we write a brief report for our readers,
either as part of an article or on a page of its own.
this might happen at a shop, a trade show, or some otherÂ event.

full reviews
whenever we get our hands on new swimwear we test it under realistic conditions for a detailed full review.
these get updated over time after we've used the samples for a while.

first we try the products in the pool to see how they fit and feel to check how comfortable a swimsuit reallyÂ is.
next we see how it performs during watersports like canoeing, sailing, or surfing,
and how good the design is for readers who really enjoy watersports, rather than wear it as a fashion statement.

manufacturers: promoteÂ !



if you're a manufacturer or supplier of swimming clothes or watersport accessories, send us products for review.
you get publicity on a busy website for the cost of a product sample.
reviews carry a clickable link to the supplier's website so our readers can order the products we've reviewed.
ifÂ a supplier provides more than one item, they get a dedicated section with aÂ company profile.

affiliate partnerships
when we come across really good products,
we like to share them with our readers who come here to find the best and most original swimwear.
ifÂ you run an affiliate program, talkÂ toÂ us.
