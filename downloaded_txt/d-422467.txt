why the stillen sucks 
name for my address?
if you want to know why 
the web address to my site is  
www.stillensucks.com, go
 here to find the details.  besides that, since 
i own the url name, i thought i might as well use it, as it is a lot 
easier to remember than  
www.gnakata.crosswinds.net.  
using either of these addresses will get you here, so use whatever is easier for 
you to remember.
