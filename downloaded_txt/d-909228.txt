i've had several queries about the sales situation of the proto:87 stores, so i thought a public update here is in order.i'm suffering from age and workload burn-out and it doesn't seem to be getting better. so i'm in the process trying to figure out how to retire gradually without having a natural successor to take over shipping orders. i hope to have the website continue as part of my ongoing hobby interest, but eventually become mainly for modeling prototype street (trolley) and regular track and infrastructure and certain standards information and possibly provide open source parts designs and drawings for the diy folk and other small suppliers out there.currently i'm focusing on still taking orders for just streetcar track and plain rail. i do have some updates i want to make for several of the proto:87 items, in order to open them up again later, but i don't have enough time left to continue to support more than the overwhelming backlog of nmra coarse ho stuff orders i already have.updating the website to reflect the latest situation is another problem i have yet to fix. my early background is miniature electro-mechanical engineering with closely inter-active micro-computer control. so higher level modern website software is an area of expertise i've not pursued, nor have had any particular interest in.for those who still want stuff, i sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. i will be open, once my current backlog is completed, to discussing possible solutions for anyone who still need specific critical items.i would like to take this opportunity to thank all my thousands of customers over the years for their support and enthusiasm for more prototypical and realistic track.
*** note: the nmra has since produced a second, cruder version of proto:87, without changing it's name. i only support the original fine version as used everywhere else in the world._________________________________________ 
 fine scale, add-on, working switch stand indicator 
and you can even add it to your already laid existing turnouts!  
includes a "last for ever" stainless steel gearbox so flat it slips under the end of the head ties. 
 just link it to your throw bar with the springy wire supplied.

click here to read the nmra's
real track scaled down tm story!
and  then
save at least 60% !!! 
compared to costly "slab" turnout jigs
 

like this one above
e.g just $50 for a switch-works #6 turnout option compared to $130 (plus expensive tools) from other suppliers.
whereas . . .
"switch-works" tm
 is the original, far less expensive, nmra warranted, 
  expandable turnout building fixture

 
the extra smart, lh-rh flip-over design saves 50% of the cost immediately!
and on our steel bases you can use magnets for clamping!

can't see the rail grooves that make laying the rails so easy on a slab fixture? . . .
take a closer look. . .  
 

our own design, proprietary, copyright tie plates have the grooves built into them. . .
so placing and aligning the rails is just as easy
 and actually far more accurate.
 
what's more, because the fixture base splits apart lengthwise, you can build, by spikes, glue or solder, tough, "last forever" rtr turnouts directly onto a plastic or thin plywood base, and still remove them from the fixture when finished, without damage or loss of accuracy.
 
and just the one expandable fixture builds everything to completion, including all the ties, the points, the frog and of course, all the prototype's many different tie plates. 
the proto:87 stores 
 transforming ho model railroading track realism for the 21st century
just a reminder, we are the knowledgeable, qualified and experienced designers and manufacturers of  absolutely accurate and fully, correctly detailed 
"real track scaled down" tm 
model railroad track. 
only our own "switch-works" tm fixtures, jigs and templates have passed the strictest testing by the nmra tecnical dept. staff themselves. 
 

and remember, our "88-safe" tm technology means that you can run the popular but narrower code 88 wheels safely and smoothly on regular nmra ho standard track work. 
 
but there's (so much) more . . .
 
as well as truly realistic, zero derailment track, we are working toward  realistic heavy car inertia and rolling, realistic simple remote switching, realistic gliding train movement with working suspension.
using advanced hi-tech miniature engineering to design for completely hands off, 100% reliable, totally realistic operations.
 
the new "presto" tm,  smart push button switch motor controller 

adds push button operation to the mole tm, or almost any other make of stall switch machine, from local to mutiple panels, with dispatcher override and local lockout.
many other features including optional rotating switch stands and "invisible switchman" tm simulated local hand throwing of yard turnouts without needing ugly overscale manual switch stands. typical installation "plug and play" cables included! 
just "touch" near the switch stand, or wherever is convenient and the turnout will throw automatically..

please note we are currently updating the presto tm web pages ordering and technical information. please excuse any strange appearance while we finish this work. if you have any ordering problems, please email us for assistance. contact@proto87.com

 
the mole ii tm is the new even more shallow depth,  easy mounting mole tm, with a new ,precision rotating switch stand option. see the new help video for the mole ii under the information menu.
 

 
the new way of making curved turnouts of any radius that you need to fit your particular layout plan is here! click here to find out all about it. 
 

do you have what is probably the most common type of frog in us railroad yards - in your model yards?  
 
we have the "yard turnout" tm  specially designed and equipped with as assembled self guarded frog, which is currently available in #6 frog size and coming soon in #5 size, for really compact yard ladders.

 now you can have far more realistic switching and operations on your layout.

 professional engineering designers and manufacturers of truly realistic and prototypically accurate model track, precision electro-mechanical mechanisms and prototypically working miniature engineering items for small scale model railroads.
originally founded in 1996 as the r&d and supply department of the nmra proto:87 sig, we have steadily grown to become the leading provider of more accurate and realistic ho, n and z scale track kits and parts to discerning modelers around the world. 
 
as a truly usa based, r&d and manufacturing house, we give you real choices and more choices!
like truly realistic trackwork
on either, "fast and easy" tm plastic flex tie bases, or our "ultimate" tm, "real track scaled down" tm, exactly prototypical, real wood ties with true scale spikes and tieplates.
or even both mixed for your ideal balance of convenience and appearance

regular nmra ho width flangeways         near scale,  nmra proto:87  width flangeways absolute precision, super-detailed, manganese or regular bent rail frog kitsfully inter-changeable, for easily changing style,or even upgrading later to the finer proto:87 standard

 yes! this really is our "ultimate" tm ho scale hand-laid track!
with our absolutely precision "drop-in" (when assembled)  frog kits, along with our cnc pre-machined "slide-in" points and our scale appearance, solderless, "snap-in" throwbars and "glue-down" point hinges, we make it so easy, that anyone who can glue together a plastic kit, can easily make track this accurate and realistic. 
or you can even use our individual parts to upgrade the turnouts you already have!!! 
 while for comparison, this is the real thing!
 
 unparalleled scale trolley track for ho
the "electric avenue" tm, complete realistic trolley and industrial railroad street track system. we are dedicated to helping you model what the prototype actually looks like.
we pride ourselves in the proto:87 stores, that we help you model the way the prototype actually is, so everything you do automatically becomes much more realistic. so when it come to the track and it's details we make, we continually go out with our camera and "walk the tracks", to find proper examples to base our parts on. that's why you will probably find our site to be very different from most other model railroad track suppliers. we try and show pictures of "the prototype" alongside our parts, so you can judge for yourself how close to the "real thing" it's now possible to get! but at the same time we use extremely advanced 21st century "hi-tech" engineering technology, materials and manufacturing techniques to design realistic new parts to be very strong and very inexpensive, as well as being incredibly tiny and accurately detailed.
 
 the 24/7 automatic order form will to save you creating your own lists of parts to email in to order. however we still want you to enjoy the previous personal relationship we have had with every one of you. if you have questions that require  a verbal discussion, send me an email and i can arrange a call to respond.finally, this site is continually growing and evolving, as well as having new products added at frequent intervals. check our "news" page for the latest additions!. but if there is something you don't see this time, or want to find out about, come back and look again soon, or email and ask :)thanks for all your support!sincerely,andy reichert
