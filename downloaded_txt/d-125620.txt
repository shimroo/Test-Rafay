          engineering
        






















don’t settle for good enough. looking for an accredited bachelor of science in engineering program where faculty and staff are committed christians? you’ve found it—and so much more.we hear it again and again from employers: calvin engineering alumni have the technical skills expected of graduates from much larger programs, but also the critical thinking and communication skills you’d expect from a top christian liberal arts university like calvin. they are able to design creatively, even outside of their specific disciplinary focus, and can adapt to a constantly evolving field.how do we do it? student-centered learning. no teaching assistants. small classes. lots of hands-on design opportunities. opportunities for awesome internships in the west michigan region or elsewhere.plus, you’ll learn from dedicated christian professors who challenge you to integrate faith and engineering. at calvin, your engineering professors will know you personally and love watching your designs take shape. they will also use their industry experience to prepare you for great internships and jobs.when you graduate, you’ll have the skills to lead in your field and the vision to build a more just future.
