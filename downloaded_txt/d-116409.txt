diy vacuformer





i have always wanted one of these.  could also use toaster oven to heat the plastic. 
from sci-spot.com


























cast with durham's rock hard water putty.  it's inexpensive and fun.  one use is to paint raised designs on furniture or cast as separate pieces.  maybe cast some small picture frames?
could the models be made from cardboard?
