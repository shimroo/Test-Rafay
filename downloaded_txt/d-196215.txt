welcome to santee national
just minutes from both i-95 and i-26, santee national presents golfers with an excellent challenge. it’s like playing two different courses – the front nine lays open and well guarded – while the back is a rolling, tree-lined test. though each hole has its own character, #17, a par three, is framed by a church and has been dubbed santee’s own “amen corner”. the finishing hole is spectacular, beginning at a beautiful lake and ending at the low country style clubhouse. give us a call today at 803-854- 3531!
