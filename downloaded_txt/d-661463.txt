 our menu
 built on quality

what goes in the food makes the difference in our book. our dough is rolled fresh each day and our food is always made to order. our produce is purchased locally and our meats are usda grade. we select quality cheeses including a mozzarella that is made of 100% whole milk.
we roast the turkey used for our sandwiches in our very own ovens. we make decisions like these because it’s our village. there is no other way we’d host our family and yours.
