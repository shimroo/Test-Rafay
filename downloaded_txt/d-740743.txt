            advancing the quality of cancer care
      

since 1981, the oncology nursing foundation has provided more than $33 million in support of awards, grants, scholarships, and educational initiatives, investing in the idea that improved patient care and outcomes result from dedicated, well-trained, and fully appreciated oncology nurses.


funding for nurses










            oncology nurses need your support
      

as cancer medicine gets smarter and more targeted, oncology nurses play an even larger and more pivotal role. nurses need to advance their education. nurse scientists need to continue their research. all of which requires ongoing funding. here’s how you can help. 


support the foundation






            meet the recipients who improve outcomes
      

about 1,685,000 new cancer cases will be diagnosed in the united states this year. in each instance, an oncology nurse will help shape the story of how patients and families respond.
