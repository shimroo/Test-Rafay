yeah i said it before and i’ll say it again, i'm no good at this journal thing lol. so it's been forever and a day since my last post;ohwell. the lack of updates is due to my work schedule and my overall laziness when it comes to my site. you can check out me new stuff at y!gallery http://yaoi.y-gallery.net/user/jaytee/ you'll have to login to see the dirty stuff

|busy]15-jan-2006- i know it’s been about half a year; sorry for the long wait. i moved my living location twice during that time, but now i’m back. so sit back and relax i’ll update as fast as i can color..about the manga, i removed them because i want to redo them they just didn’t look as good as they could, and some pages are just very, very old. big thanks to everyone for visiting, and for your kind comments.. over 366,000 hits wow.

|uncomfortable]04/09/2005-over 100,000 hits!! thank you *bows*. there are four new pics in the original gallery i did a naked hinto pic (see i do listen)... devton, toby, and kevun are coming back also (i got fan mail for each of them), one new fanart, and one new gift. i'm trying to fill up the fanart section (it looks so empty) so the next update might be mostly fanarts

|hungry]03/27/2005 sorry about the lack of updates recently. a lot of things have been going on and i haven't had the time to draw yaoi as much as i would like to. i changed some of the layout and made it a bit more organized. the new pictures have the red border around them; and there are two games in the goodies section.

|sick]12/11/2004 i can't delay it any longer, here is an update, i'm not updating the mangas right now, because i don't think they are ready yet; quality is better than quantity. i want to make sure it is just right. there are nine new illustrations by me and six new gift arts. the about page is up; if you want to know a little about me. the christmas card is your gift click on the package to see his "package". happy holidays

|sleepy]09/12/2004-thank you for 1000...i mean 2000+ hits, yay! i had to change the pic before i posted it, i didn't know the counter would go from 1000 to 2000+ so quickly. there are four new illustrations in the gallery (soo sexy), and i got my first gift picture, i love gift art; love it, love it. i'm working on some more pages for the site, like a pbbs board. so keep your eyes open for it. i'm working on some things so future updates might be late.  so sleepy..zzzzzzzzzz
