telemarketer refugee camp
my goal... no our goal is to stop the telemarketer phone calls form affecting our lives... we may not be able to save this generation but our children's children may have a fighting chance. next we take on the spammers! where the only enlargement needed is our free disk space! 

join me in my quest to rid the world of the call but save the person calling... one phone call at a time.

          you know the ones! they start out like they just f*#^&$ed up and dropped the phone. *clankity clank clank* "oh sorry! hey this is sh*t for brains and i have been meaning to call you all week... seems i have been a little busy and i am so sorry . . blah freaking blah" and all this time (insert idiots name here, for this we will name me - robert) is saying stuff to get the rat bastards attention  "hello sfb i am busy inserting an iv into my heart!!! hello... can't talk now i am in the middle of giving cpr to the mail lady... yooooooo hoooooo" then you have to stop and say something bad in another language. hsihedhj dcyuhohj  i hope that was a bad one!  meaning your goat and mom did something your dad would frown upon. *sigh* damn charlatan's!

hollow balls called me back! 

          from haggis ain't cake!  you ain't gonna believe thisremember i wrote about some cat who called me trying to sell me paint and ???... his name was aaron (will not say the name of the company).  well i get a call just a minute ago me "hello"  aaron "hey mr. keeme my name is aaron from ..."  me "hi" *i wonder if this is another sales call... get pen ready*  aaron "i just wanted to tell you i did a search on yahoo and your site comes up right after our name and was wondering if you could move it?"  me *omg no way*  aaron "i have to tell you i laughed and the people around my office laughed it is funny as expletive deleted" me "cool... it was meant in as much fun as possible and your call was the most fun... are you the owner?"  aaron "no they actually handed a printout of this to me" *statements i won't go into here - unless*   me "ahhh tell you what... have them email me and you place a post on there and i will try for you" *thinking poor cat was told to remove it or get fired*  call ended around here somewhere with me mentioning this site has a larger audience and he said he would come read (hi aaron!).  if you get tired of that job i know of others i can hook you up with... really.  so looks like one of my frustrations (after telling the world i do not want solicitation phone calls) is actually frustrating the very solicitors themselves!  too funny aaron you freaking rock man!  and p.s. guess ya figured i did not give you all the correct info before... sorry man... if had not been you it would have been the next guy.  hope you continue reading and maybe me and dave will send you a hat.

maria with centex 

          maria was so upbeat telling me how they can give me better rates than the current company i am with (how do they really know this?).  i told her i was going to prison next week due to being convicted of arson. i asked if they frown upon this and could they call me in prison? she became less enthusiastic and told me she could not answer my questions and could she have a loan officer call me. i told her i wanted them to call me in prison and she stated "your not in prison yet"  duh!  she told me to have a nice day and hung up.  i will try and make them talk more next time.  :-)

i am going to prison  

          yesterday and then again today i used that line.  this lady called me yesterday from some wireless company telling me how she could save me tons of money. i did a bad bad thing me "i wish i could but i am going to start serving a prison term next week"  tm "oh my"  me "ya thats what i said"  tm "i am sorry to hear that"  me "well i am guilty and i got sentenced last week"  tm "that is really a shame"  me "i wonder if i could have a cell in there? i really don't know the etiquette"  tm "i don't know, i would think not"  me "your probably right"  *by this time i think she was trying to give me her address to write her or something. now i know how those cats in the pen get chicks*  so today i did it again but it went a little like this me "hello" tm "hello this is mark with the fraternal order of police"  me "your with the police?" tm "yes"  me "then you probably know i start my prison term next week"  tm "that sucks"  me "tell me about it"  tm "you should live it up this entire week, or whats left"  me "plan to"  tm "good luck"  me "thanks" i am going to hell for that one
