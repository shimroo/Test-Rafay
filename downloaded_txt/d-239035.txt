more bitchy ramblings. 

          i am so. freaking. tired. of hearing about laura b_annister!lb this.  lb that.  i can't wait til lb gets here.  we should get lb to the red lantern to reprise her rendition of "witchy woman."  there will be cornbread!  i miss lb so much.  la la la la.to be honest, i do not really care to see her right now.  and this is something horrible -- something i can tell no one.  except for you, blogger.  and i guess i could tell postsecret, but i might not get the satisfaction of seeing it on the website.people i would not mind seeing right now:1.  j.ho2.  sara nicole and kyle(and i'll get my wish soon -- yay!!!)3.  kara and cantley(i won't get that wish anytime soon.  ugh.)4.  my dad(not 'til heaven.)5.  my mom6.  my brothers(not 'til...february!  heck yes!)7.  mitchell.8.  rachel y_ellen9.  any/all members of the becker family (particularly katie, eliza, and hannah)10.  dave ward11.  zach w. and fam (including noel and 'lis, and yoshi and corinne)12.  shawn m.13.  archbishop orombi.14.  dr. haddad.15.  pastor eric16.  most of the rock creek ladies.17.  anyone not playing guitar hero18.  chris cooper(he's basically wonderful)19.  brent!20.  bob dylan21.  ernest hemingway22.  joan baez23.  cate blanchett (sensing a small theme here?)24.  the katzenberger women(but no men, or any men associated with them)25.  amy long, and jj kelley.26.  lauren winner.27.  jesus.  i want to see him, truly.  please.i'm in a pissy mood, but somehow posting on blogger helps ease this.  i'll be on my way back to school soon.  fearing a potentially-horrifying semester.and i do not, not, not want to see laura b_annister.  at all.  but what can you do.

ok...this demands to be written. :) 

          "kara was like 'there's mitchell!' and i was like [whispering] 'fuck!' [normal-volume-level tone] 'i mean...i love god!"-i love my roommate.  she has actual struggles, bears them with humor, and still manages to keep a relationship with god (even though this quote might indicate otherwise).

oh, the humanity! 

          got the part.  glowing.lost the boy.  glowering.knot in stomach.  mood swings.  desperate craving to eat chocolate and watch "pretty in pink."  desire for read-through and dialect instruction to come faster.  happiness with my new "husband."  stress with my friends -- just about all of them.  (because i love them, that's why.)  need for a phone.  bridal showers, tests, dateless evenings, chapel credits, paper-writing sessions, boy-shaped-hole-in-heart (which is actually a lie that i almost never believe, but do at times like this).  aghhh.i feel like i was able to let out my emotions a bit more tonight (and hopefully will in the future) because i learned that m--- is not interested in b-----... whom i've known to be interested in him for a long time.  and that hurts.  i don't think he knows how much that hurts.  he's more concerned with "how do i handle this" than "how do i assure her that things are going to be ok."  and that should not be the way it is.  how do i coach him on this without losing control due to my own personal pain?  the boys in that family do not know the pain they've indirectly (and sometimes directly) caused.and, in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.  i want to love, not loathe.the week after next is finals week.

last ni-iiight... 

          i auditioned for the first play since high school.  i've been involved in almost every play here at covenant, but i haven't acted in them.  (i did take acting classes, though, so i'm not rusty.)it's a rush, auditioning.  i'd forgotten what it's like to go in, present yourself onstage, and pray that you do your best and the director sees your work for what it is.  i was forced into remembering what it's like to make callbacks, to freak out and try not to over-analyze everything (from the few short scenes you're given to read, to your character choices, to your eyeliner application), and to try to guess what the director's looking for.  and i've never forgotten what it's like to sit wondering if i'm cast or not.i really want to be in this play.  i'm trying not to want it too much.  i keep reminding myself -- i want this, but i want jesus more than this, and if god wills that i not have this part, then i will be grateful for that.  he gives and takes away -- blessed be his name!if he does will that i get this part, i will be ever so grateful for that, too.  i don't know exactly what it is about it, but this character has already made her way close to my heart.  maybe it's because she reminds me so much of my mom, and her relationship with her daughter reminds me of mine with my mother.  she is, in many ways, what i'd love to be when i'm grown:  a fun, loving mother, who puts on little plays starring her children (and husband, haha!) and takes care of her family the best she knows how.  and she has a wonderful circle of friends -- writers and dramatists.  her interaction with them reminds me of my mom's interactions with her talented friends (city board members, lawyers, authors, actors).  and how wonderful would it be to play george macdonald's wife?  and how wonderful to get to act with sarah again!it is in the lord's hands (and hallstrom's too) now.  and i trust them both. :)  (although hallstrom did call back some peculiar choices.  so my analytical brain won't be satisfied with any sort of prediction for what she'll do -- although more than one person who was present at auditions told me that i did well, and that i was the most interesting to watch of all that tried out for louisa.  i just don't know what she's looking for, really.)  at any rate, i trust the lord, and i'm praying that our director's mind will be clear when she considers a cast list.

pep talks with matty: 

          worth a thousand therapy sessions.more on that later, perhaps, if only to record what he said.  that conversation was truly a godsend tonight.  truly.  how unexpected and marvelous.  for now, this is worth recording:"if a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly."-winston churchillmatty katty.  i cannot thank you enough.  who knew you had such encouragement readily available inside of you....................................................................................................................................................in other news...visited dr. katic today, and he wrote me a prescription for prozac.  you'd think my self-esteem would be completely out the window at this news, but i am actually thrilled.  i want to be well, and i think this will help me, no matter how great or small the help.  praise god for family, friends, therapists, and meds to help me get through this thing!

clinical depression:  all it's cracked up to be and more. 

          people keep asking how i am in an excited tone.  they want to know what i've been up to this summer, what i'm doing in the fall, and "how life is going."  they want me to call them, to go to dinner with them, to visit them in college station.  they don't know. (and this, i guess, should be a comfort.  they don't think that i'd be crying over little things, stone-faced over things i'd normally be crying about, starting to lie to my mom about how my paper is coming, sleeping too long, writing "i hate me" on my arm in swirly cursive.  watching television for five to eight hours a day doesn't help.  they don't think of this first.)and i don't want to tell them.  why should i have to?  i want to wait until i am well.  i want to see them when i am happy, so that i don't make them sad.  i've made my own family sad enough.  no, i will wait.  no use in making people sad, confused, and judgmental over me.by the way - if anyone still reads this - this is not a cry for help.  this is just me getting my thoughts out.  i needed to say something and i said it.  i am not going to physically hurt myself, so there is no danger of that.  please, do not call me expressing your concern.  that, obviously, is what i want to avoid.  also, please keep this information between you and our heavenly father.  i need prayer.  it's getting hard for me to do it myself these days.  so, no calling, no gossiping or sharing this information with steph (manders, i do think you're my only reader if you still read this), and please pray.  the end.

you know... 

          god loves me. and that is truly the important thing.  i do not need the love (or desire) of a human man in order to be whole.sometimes, though, it sure feels like i do.  maybe that means that someday i will have this.  but who can know the mind of god?it is so easy for me to get wrapped up in what people think of me.  sometimes i even treat it like a psychological game to get me motivated towards a certain goal.  i think there's no harm in allowing myself to start really wanting men to look at me, if it gets my butt to the gym.  what a trap that is!i am a child of god.  i am god's treasure.  i do not need a boyfriend to prove to myself that i am worth something.  and, as hard as it is for me to even type this, i do not need a reply to an attempt at communication to prove that i am worth something.  and even as i do type this, my brain keeps asking:  why does he not respond?  does he think i'm creepy?  am i creepy?  maybe he's just that quiet.  maybe he's busy.  maybe he's on the bubble -- he could like me, if i were a size 6.  that's it, i'm hitting the gym tomorrow.i will be hitting the gym tomorrow, but trust me, it's for my mental health.  (working out, if you didn't know, helps you not to be so depressed.  something i need right now.)lord, have your way!  please rescue me from what feels like a prison of self-doubt and confusion and self-loathing.  i know that i am made in your image, and you desire victory.  have your way.

striking words from one of my favorite people. 

i've never fallen in love with someone i worked on a story with, but there arelots of moments in interviews where i fall for the interviewee. this can happenwhether the interviewee is a man or woman, young or old. some conversations areso intimate there's no way around it. it happens a little bit in almost anyinterview that goes well. i've talked to other reporters who this happens toalso.you know what i'm saying, yes? it's not the actionable, jump-on-themkind of love. it's just ... love. everything they say makes sense and seems sortof wonderful. you just want to keep the friendly warmth of the conversationgoing. everything feels easy. -ira glass, answering questions following his "manifesto"
