tracking
your roots 












  tyr is dedicated to placing alabama research material on the www
  for access to those interested in alabama history &/or genealogy. created
  05 oct 1995 by lisa r. franklin rn, bsn. 
after years of lapse while i worked on other things, i
  realized today i had some invaluable files for early alabama researchers to
  share so a number of counties have new files today!ï¿½ enjoy! :)
