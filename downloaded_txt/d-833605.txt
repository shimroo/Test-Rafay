“the chamber of commerce in any community can be the hub of the business community.  baker college has had the opportunity for this type of relationship with our local cadillac chamber over the years.  given the challenges that the current environment has brought to all businesses, including baker college, i am excited to have future leadership and business visioning being done by a re-energized staff in caitlyn berard, hailey soderman, and kate dekam.  this group has great passion, excitement and zest for the work that needs to be done to take our chamber to the next level.  i am excited for the future of our business community and the growth we will see form the cadillac chamber.”kelly smith, baker college
“exposure and name recognition is a large part of growing a business, and that’s one reason i joined the cadillac area chamber of commerce right away when i started my business. having my business represented at events such as business after 5 and rise up – and being able to connect with other community members at those events as well – helped me get my business planted in the community.”
gabrielle haiderer, yellow wood media solutions“”the cadillac area chamber of commerce is a vital partner to the cadillac area ymca. they are dedicated to advocacy for all segments of our business community. their dedication provides the opportunity for thriving success of businesses, families, and individuals.””mike kelso, cadillac area ymca“as a small business owner, joining the chamber of commerce has been a game-changer for me. not only has it provided valuable networking opportunities and access to resources, but it has also played a pivotal role in the growth of my business. through chamber events and collaborations, i’ve been able to connect with fellow entrepreneurs, forge strategic partnerships, and gain exposure within the local community.
the chamber’s dedication to supporting small businesses through volunteer efforts, such as hosting ribbon-cutting ceremonies, facilitating networking events, and advocating for local commerce, is truly commendable. their passion for community engagement and business development has made a tangible difference in my entrepreneurial journey.
i wholeheartedly encourage other small business owners to join the chamber of commerce. by becoming a member, you not only gain access to a wealth of resources and support but also have the opportunity to give back to the community and be part of a network of like-minded individuals dedicated to driving collective success. s.”christina alyea, artify marketing & design
