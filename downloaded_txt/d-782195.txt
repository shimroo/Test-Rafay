a clark just did our roof for us, we had quotes from many roofing companies around the city, many didn’t even bother to call back. a clark called back right away and sent someone out to do the quote very quickly.
they were very professional and knowledgeable. they completed our roof in less time then quoted and they didn’t leave a mess when they were done. i have and would recommend them to my family and friends as well as anyone looking for a company they can count on to get the job done well.
amber dawn










from initial request for a quote, to the prompt response from the estimator to the amazing team of guys who figured out how to get those darned shingles up onto my steep roof while navigating through a narrow infill lot, my experience with a clark roofing has been a positive one. they sent a very experienced group of roofers who know their trade and yes they really do get the whole job done in a single day. my yard and garden were left in immaculate condition and a follow up visit was made to ensure quality control. they’re a tiny bit more expensive than some contractors, but they’ve been around for a long time and guarantee their work. highly recommend them.
sharon meikle


we were very impressed with the service.







the calgary office staff was very helpful in identifying possible solutions for our “attic rain” issue last winter … without spending a lot of money!  we did have some extra venting installed at a very reasonble cost.  the work was completed when promised and they were on-site for less than one hour.  we were very impressed with the service.
gerry vankeeken


thank you a clark, you are professionals!







they gave me a fair price and a good warranty. their customer service was excellent. and the install was done promptly, site left clean, installers polite and professional, and they appear to have done a very good job! thank you a clark, you are professionals!
steven probert










i called a. clark roofing as i had an issue with water leaking out of my basement ceiling and it was an urgent situation.  i assumed it was an ice dam that was slowly melting from damaged shingles etc..  the office manager, brandy was kind and extremely helpful and had a roofing technician come out today on his day off to perform an inspection of our roof.  we learned that it was not an ice dam after all  but rather an icemaker and water dispenser malfunction on our refrigerator.  there was no charge for their inspection.  we have used them for both our house roof and garage roof and they did an excellent job and no short cuts were taken and it was perfect and never an issue.   i would highly recommend a. clark roofing for their professionalism and they stand behind the work that they do and they do excellent work.
gisele mayert













how often does a roof need to be entirely replaced?
your roof’s lifespan depends on several factors, like the material used and how well the roof has been maintained over the years. while an asphalt roof typically lasts 20 years, we recommend a routine inspection every five years.
