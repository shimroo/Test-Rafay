such helpful and warm staff. the dr was always on time, minimal waiting. staff was helpful with questions and concerns, particularly around problems and with financials. when the time comes, i will be sending all 4 of my kids to dr. katie. i could not be more pleased with my experience and the outcome.

“i brought my then 8yr old to dr. katie bales because of a huge overbite. the poor kid could not chew with his mouth closed. dr. bales and the staff were so great with him. i let my son pick out of all the orthodontist we saw and he picked katie. they really explained everything to him and were always sweet and super organized. jack had his braces removed in record time because he was able to follow their directions. i have sent 3 of my friends to this office and they love it and i have another friend with two girls that plan on going to them as well. i can not say enough. they are amazing my son has the most gorgeous smile and he feels so good about himself. they changed his life. love love love them.”

amazing! the office is super clean, staff is super friendly, and dr. katie and her dad are extremely professional. the one main feature that stands out is their trustworthiness. their attention to detail was incredible: they instructed my son on proper aftercare; they always reminded me when to come back in; they made sure my son was fully ready before switching from braces to retainers. they explored all options with my son and picked out the best one. my son went from very crooked teeth to an incredibly aligned teeth and perfect smile. 
thank you bales orthodontics!
