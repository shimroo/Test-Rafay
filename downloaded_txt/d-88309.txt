saving animals. changing lives.
our office will be closed on monday, september 2, 2024 in observance of labor day.
for adoptions, we operate by appointment so staff is available to help you find your new perfect family member. please call for details.
you can stop to walk through our animal rooms mondays through fridays noon to 3pm, and saturdays noon to 2pm.
our mission is to provide a safe, temporary shelter for dogs and cats, until placing them into their new, loving, “forever” homes.

        about us

        we strive to find the perfect fit for placement for every single one of our animals. they are fixed, vaccinated, dewormed and on monthly parasite prevention while they are with us.


        established in 1892, the society has sought to curb animal cruelty, teach compassion and proper care of animals, and for the past 30 years, operate a shelter to take in homeless dogs and
        cats, provide them with proper care, and match them permanently with loving families.

great shelter! staff was friendly and very helpful. facility was spotless. i expected a "smell" - especially in a room full of cats/kittens but there was no odor whatsoever. they obviously put a lot of effort into keeping the shelter clean and it shows!
