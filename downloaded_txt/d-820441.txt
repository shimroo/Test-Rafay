“if not for mage, i would not be effective in those [advocacy] conversations. there is a way to advocate for gifted [education]. but there is an especially particular way to advocate for gifted in massachusetts. you start from scratch.”- marcela krishnamurthi






“the beauty of having spaces/organizations like mage is that people are not alone in their journey to understand giftedness and/or twice exceptionality and the efforts that are needed to meet the needs of these kiddos. i couldn’t imagine my gifted story without mage.”- karen blumstein






“i think 50 years of not serving gifted students caused this absolute lack of even very basic understanding of who they are.”- marcela krishnamurthi






“if not for mage, i wouldn't have stepped out of my comfort zone to take opportunities to speak on my discomfort.”- maggie pinney
