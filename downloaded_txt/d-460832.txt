guru parampara
the guru parampara is a lineage of spiritual masters who have passed down the teachings of the ancient vedic tradition from one generation to the next. this sacred lineage is a channel through which the divine wisdom and blessings of the guru flow to the disciples. the guru parampara of the avadhoota datta peetham traces its origins back to lord dattatreya swami, the adi guru, who is considered the embodiment of the holy trinity – brahma, vishnu, and shiva. "guru parampara" is the combination of two words, 'guru' and 'parampara'.

sgs datta kamadhenu












    kamadhenu (the cow), kalpavriksha (the tree of fulfilment), amruta (the drink of immortality), and mother lakshmi (the godess of prosperity) all emerged at the same time in the creational process and are considered to be most splendorous embodiments of divinity. the vedas extol cow as the most sacred being condescended to be on earth to nourish the beings. the hindu scriptures emphatically declare that all devatas reside in a cow and hence a cow is a very sacred animal. therefore, as per sanatana dharma, a cow is not referred merely as a cow but reverentially called as "gomaata" (mother cow). the secretions for formation of the seven planes of existence i.e. bhu, bhuvar, suvar, mahar, jana, tapo, and satya loka emerge from kamadhenu and the related formation of creation is therefore considered by the vedic seers as the form of cow. sri swamiji has established a big goshala, an expansive shed that houses more than 50 cows in mysuru ashram and provides care and shelter to all of them. goshalas are maintained in other ashram branches of avadhoota datta peetham too.
