notice to our 
			members-friends-supporters
 and the skating 
			community at large that the tri-valley figure skating club is in a 
			one (1) year "re-organization" status due to lack of volunteers to 
			step forward in an administrative capacity. as a "club" is a 
			business in the eyes of the irs and ftb we are required to have an 
			"active" board of directors and in this area there has been zero 
			interest. we have been in negotiations with the los angeles figure 
			skating club to work with us in holding test sessions at our 
			valencia facility during this time. if you are interested in testing 
			at valencia visit the lafsc website for information or send  an 
			e-mail to vaversano@tvfsc.org with your questions or inquiry. 

 west coast championships: 
 during 
			this time of re-organization we will not be hosting west coast in 
			2014 but will revive it in 2015 with new events along with keeping 
			our cash award and critique criteria.
 please check back with us over the next year 
			to see our progress and updates. we will post our progress 
			quarterly.
on behalf of all tri-valley fsc members and 
			volunteers past and present, thank you for all your support!
