mountain gardens is a botanical garden of useful plants featuring the largest collection of native appalachian and chinese medicinal herbs in the eastern us, organically grown at the foot of the black mountains in western north carolina. our specialties include: native and oriental medicinal herbs, wild foods, perennial vegetables, craft plants and other ethnobotanicals. we offer for sale seeds, plants, fresh and dried herb material, and other preparations. we present useful information regarding the cultivation and uses of these species, as well as our philosophy of paradise gardening.



support the future of mountain gardens!mountain gardens is a registered 501(c)3 educational nonprofit, dedicated to continuing the work of our founder and teacher joe hollis. joe’s vision of a small community of gardeners, stewards, and educators who live on the land and expand on what joe accomplished is coming true in the wake of joe’s passing. we continue our recovery from the devastating fire in which we lost the old library and herb shop, as we build the foundations—physical, organizational, economic, and interpersonal—for the flourishing of mountain gardens for generations to come. we are currently raising funds to accomplish all of these crucial tasks. you can make a tax-deductible donation directly to mountain gardens (contact us mountaingardens@gmail.com) or through our gofundme below.  offline, fully-tax-deductible donations are always welcome, and can be made by writing a check to "mountain gardens, inc." and sending it to 546 shuford creek rd, burnsville, nc 28714. make sure that we have a way to send an acknowledgment/receipt for your donation if you want one (they are required for donations over $250).
