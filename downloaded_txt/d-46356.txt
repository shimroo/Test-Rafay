 rv solar system considerations
 
 why rent a motorhome or rv?


installing solar power systems on recreational vehicles is a popular way to enhance energy independence, reduce reliance on generators, and enjoy more off-grid experiences.
                  1. understanding your power needs
                    calculate daily usage: determine your daily power consumption by listing all the electrical devices you plan to use and their power ratings (in watts). estimate the hours of usage for each device.
                    total watt-hours: multiply the power rating of each device by the number of hours you plan to use it to get the total watt-hours (wh) consumed per day.
                    2. components of an rv solar system
                    solar panels: these capture sunlight and convert it into electrical energy. choose high-efficiency panels suited for limited roof space on rvs.
                    charge controller: this device regulates the voltage and current coming from the solar panels to the batteries, preventing overcharging.
                    batteries: deep cycle batteries store the energy produced by the solar panels for later use. lithium-ion batteries are popular due to their efficiency and longevity, but lead-acid batteries are also commonly used.
                    inverter: converts the dc power stored in the batteries to ac power for running standard household appliances.
                    3. sizing your solar system
                    panel size: based on your daily energy consumption, calculate the number of solar panels needed. consider the average sunlight hours per day in your region.
                    example calculation: if you need 1000wh per day and get 5 hours of sunlight, you would need about 200w of solar panels (1000wh / 5 hours = 200w).
                    battery capacity: ensure your battery bank can store enough energy to meet your needs.
                example calculation: for 1000wh of daily use, you would need a battery capacity of about 200ah at 12v (1000wh / 12v = ~83ah). to avoid deep discharges, double this capacity to 166ah or more.
 
    there are many reasons why renting a motorhome instead of purchasing may be a good solution. for the individual who has limited vacation time, a short term vacation on wheels without the long term costs associated with rv ownership may be the best option. the outright costs associated with buying an rv from a dealer include; licensing fees, insurance, storage and ongoing maintenance. couple these costs with a relatively quick depreciation rate and the motorhome rental option begins to look better by the moment.
   another reason to rent an rv is for first time buyers. try before you buy. you may not always be able to rent the exact model rv you wish to purchase but you will be able to find out the things you must have and those you can live without. one can also get an overall sense of their comfort level driving, parking and living in an rv for a time.
   
  tips to avoid hidden costs:
  read the contract: carefully review the rental agreement and ask questions about any unclear terms or potential extra charges.
  plan ahead: estimate your mileage, fuel usage, and other potential costs before renting.
  inspect the rv: conduct a thorough inspection of the rv before departure and document any existing damage.
  return on time and clean: return the rv on time, with all tanks emptied and the interior clean to avoid additional fees.use this link to find motorhome and rv rental locations.






rv tips - storage







storing an rv properly is crucial to maintaining its condition  and ensuring it's ready for your next adventure. here are some of the most  important things to consider when storing your rv:


clean thoroughly: before storing your  rv, clean both the interior and exterior thoroughly. remove all food items,  clean appliances, and vacuum or sweep the floors. clean and treat the exterior,  including the roof, to prevent dirt, debris, and moisture buildup.
check for leaks and repairs: inspect your rv for  any leaks or areas of concern. address any necessary repairs before storing the  vehicle to prevent further damage during storage.
empty and disconnect tanks: empty and flush the  holding tanks, including the black and gray water tanks. disconnect the propane  tanks and turn off all appliances.
battery care: depending on the  length of storage, consider disconnecting the rv's batteries or using a battery  disconnect switch to prevent draining. if your rv has a generator, follow  manufacturer guidelines for maintenance.
tire maintenance: inflate the tires to  the recommended pressure and consider using tire covers to protect them from uv  rays. if storing for an extended period, consider using tire chocks or blocks  to prevent flat spots.
cover or protect: use an rv cover or  invest in a climate-controlled storage facility to protect your rv from the  elements, including sun, rain, snow, and wind.
ventilation: ensure adequate  ventilation by cracking open windows or using roof vents to prevent moisture  buildup, which can lead to mold and mildew.
rodent and pest prevention: seal any openings  where rodents or pests might enter, such as gaps in doors or vents. use traps,  repellents, or other preventive measures to keep pests away.
stabilize and level: if possible, level  your rv and stabilize it using leveling blocks or jacks. this helps distribute  weight evenly and prevents stress on the tires and suspension.
interior protection: use shades, curtains,  or covers on windows to protect interior furnishings and fabrics from sun  damage. consider using moisture-absorbing products to reduce humidity inside  the rv.
regular check-ins: even if you're storing  your rv for an extended period, try to visit and inspect it periodically. this  allows you to catch any issues early and ensure the rv is in good condition.
documentation: keep a checklist of  tasks performed before storage and any maintenance or repairs done during  storage. this helps you keep track of the rv's condition and ensures you're  prepared when it's time to use it again.



remember, proper rv storage practices may vary depending on the  type of rv you have and the climate in which you're storing it. following these  guidelines will help preserve the value and functionality of your rv, ensuring  it's ready for your next adventure.
