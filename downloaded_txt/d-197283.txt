what are dental hmo's



 

hmo insurance
                  networks
                  dhmo refers to a dental health maintenance organization that
      helps you find the best...
these insurance plans, also known as "capitation plans," operate
      like their medical hmo cousins. this
      type of dental plan provides a comprehensive dental care to enrolled
      patients through designated provider office.  
a dental health
      maintenance organization (dhmo) is a common example of a capitation
      plan. the individual and family dentist is paid on a per capita (per person) basis rather than
      for actual treatment provided. 
participating
      individual and family dental offices receive
      a fixes monthly fee based on the number of patients assigned to the
      office. in addition to premiums, client co-payments may be required for
      each visit. some typical features of these plans:

- monthly premiums (some
          require you to prepay a year's worth) 

- co-payments for office
          visits 

- free preventive or routine
          care 

- you must select from an
          approved network of individual and family providers 

- may have an initial
          enrollment fee 

- annual dollar cap 

- your average monthly cost:
          $25 to $45 
- companies selling these
          plans are regulated by state insurance departments. 
                  paying the individual and family dental office

when choosing a benefits plan, it
                  is important to know who pays what to whom. dental plans can
                  be categorized into three types based on the compensation and
                  treatment provided...







understanding
          the various types of individual dental insurance and family dental insurance plans is important when trying to buy the right plan
          for you and your family.

finding the right value in
          individual dental insurance or dental plans is an important step in
          purchasing dental coverage for you and your family.

both types of individual
          dental insurance plans have advantages and disadvantages and one size does not
          fit everyone. keeping this in mind is an important rule when you shop
          for the dental plan that best fits your needs. 

we sell both individual
          and family dental insurance and dental discount plans throughout all
          50 states. here are some brief examples that may help you decide even
          in an emergency. this is helpful since some of the dental plan
          services are free which is good for you and your family.

        indemnity - individual dental insurance
this is the
        plan where you choose your own individual or family dentist. the dental insurance plan pays
        the dental office on a traditional fee-for-service basis. a
        monthly premium is paid by the client and/or the employer to an
        insurance company, which then reimburses them for
        the services rendered.  
a dental insurance
        company usually pays between 50% - 80% of the family or individual dental office
        fees for a covered procedures; the remaining 20% - 50% is paid by the
        client. these plans often have a pre-determined or set deductible
        amount which varies from plan to plan. indemnity dental plans also can limit
        the amount of services covered within a given year and pay them
        based on a variety of fee schedules. some typical features of these
        plans:



high deductibles before
            coverage begins (well-designed plans don't apply the deductible to
            preventive services) 


probationary periods on
            certain procedures that last up to a year 


annual dollar limit on
            benefits 


chose your own
            individual or family dentist 


your average monthly
            cost: $15 and up 


            companies selling these plans are regulated by state insurance
            departments.









              learning about dental ppo's


 preferred provider
      organizations
another true
      dental
      insurance plan, a preferred provider organizations ( ppo) falls somewhere
      between an indemnity plan and a dental hmo. this plan allows a particular
      group of patients to receive dental care from a defined panel of
      individual dental insurance dentists.
      this type could be used to provide dental gap insurance.
the
      participating individual or family office agrees to charge less than usual fees to this
      specific patient base, providing savings for the plan purchaser. if the
      patient chooses to see one who is not designated as a "preferred
      provider," that patient may be required to pay a greater share of the
      fee-for-service.   
a group of
      individual or family dentistry providers agrees to provide services at a deeply discounted rate, giving
      you substantial savings  as long as you stay in their network. unlike the
      more restrictive dhmo, though, you can go out of network and still receive
      some benefits. some typical features of these plans:



monthly premiums 


annual dollar cap 


you must stay within the
          approved network of individual or family dentists or pay higher deductibles and co-payments 


your average monthly cost:
          $20-25 

dental companies
          selling these plans are regulated by state insurance departments.

                  making informed choices

 
choosing an individual or family dental plan that is
                  accepted by the dental office
 dental benefits plans can be categorized by the options
                  offered for selecting one. some plans allow you the
                  freedom to choose your own...

      direct reimbursement plans
a dental
      insurance care
      plan now coming into vogue is the direct reimbursement plan. this is a
      self-funded benefit plan  not insurance  in which an employer pays for
      dental care with its own funds, rather than paying premiums to an
      insurance company or third-party administrator.  
you, the patient, pay the
      full amount directly to the individual or family dentist who accepts
      dental insurance, then get a receipt detailing services
      rendered and the cost, which you show to your employer. the employer
      reimburses you for part or all of the dental insurance costs, depending on your
      specific benefits.

      your company might reimburse 100 percent of your first $100 of dental
      expenses and then 80 percent of the next $500, and 50 percent of the next
      $2,000, with a total annual maximum benefit of $1,500. or it might
      reimburse only 50 percent of your first $1,000, resulting in a $500 yearly
      cap.
