south coast nsw, australia
this premier region of australia's premier state begins as you travel south from sydney along our spectacular coastline or south west through the southern highlands and southern tablelands towards canberra, australia's capital.
the region offers a magnificent diversity of coastal, forest, mountain and rural country. its natural, unspoiled environment provides the atmosphere for a peaceful, relaxing or adventurous visit in contact with australia's unique flora and fauna. the variety of natural experiences and the mildness of our climate identifies the south coast as an all-season destination.
the south coast also takes pride in the richness of our cultural assets. from our many festivals; our extensive and quality artistic scene; our several craft and artisan villages as well as our unique indigenous and european heritage, the region offers a much broader dimension to the visitor, to complement the attractions of our beautiful natural environment.
enjoy national parks, untouched beaches, spectacular wilderness, rivers and mountains, the rural life and big skies of the hinterland, with easy access to australia's premier snowfields and alpine wilderness or to our modern capital city with its famous parks, lakes and public buildings.
