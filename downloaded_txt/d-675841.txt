welcomewith 256 days of sunshine, the city of burlington is one of colorado’s best-kept secrets. you can find us just off interstate 70 near the colorado/kansas border. burlington is a full service city located approximately 170 miles from the denver-metro area. make plans to come for the day but don’t worry, we’re prepared for you to spend the night! colorado’s central plains hold a magic all their own with oceans of wheat and corn surrounding the roadways. agriculture and livestock operations make up the base of our economy, but we are also players in the renewable energy markets.
