all human activity takes place on a geographic stage of great diversity and constant transformation. our inquiries encompass a wide range of topics, from the economies and cultures of cities and built landscapes, to tropical climates and the flow of polar ice sheets. we combine rigorous empirical work with deeply conceptual theoretical analyses, always recognizing the importance of both spatial processes and accumulated histories. we use geographic analyses to illuminate the abiding problems of the modern world.
