what experts say





i think that emco ping monitor has a lot to offer in a crowded server monitoring space. emco stands up well in the face of its competition by offering the busy systems administrator low cost, low management overhead and reporting capability.





emco msi package builder is one of the better stand-alone msi packaging tools that i've had a chance to work with and it lets you create msi packages quickly and easily from non-silent .exe setup files.
