president’s message

it is with great excitement that i come to tdaa as your president for 2023-2025.  these can be exciting times for us.  we have seen a loss in our membership.  the past two-three years our association has seen the shut down due to covid and many members became quite anxious of attending our open meetings.  but we are now seeing things open back up and a time to get back to normal activities
your state association is here to continue to provide the dental assistant with ce that you can get that will keep you up to date on your renewing of your rda. we are also here to help your work thru any problem you might have with your rda. to do this we need you to step forward and take an active row in your local and state groups.
 i am asking my tdaa officers to also step forward a make monthly contacts with our membership. there are wonderful members out there. i myself have friends and close relationships with dental assistants that go back some 40 years. it is exciting to see these friends year after year.
best regards,marthann dafft, tdaa president
