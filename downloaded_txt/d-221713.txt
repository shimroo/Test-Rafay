welcome to the resource side of our website. 
here you will find more than 400 links to studies in a wide variety of doctrinal 
topic areas. these studies are intended to be comprehensive and to relate a step-by-step, 
reasonable analysis delving deeply into the scriptural texts. (we also offer video and audio presentations of some studies.)

 
latest podcast:



the seven-headed beast
this study series posits our interpretive model for the prophetic symbols contained in the books of revelation and daniel regarding the large-frame, geopolitical landscape of the world in the final years before jesus' return. our  model was developed in 2000 and early 2001 and focuses on hermeneutic principles to derive an exegetically-driven interpretive model that bypasses generationally trendy speculation and instead seeks to provide reliable guidance for the eventual identification of the times and nations described in these important prophetic texts. in this series includes the idea that the two-horned second beast of revelation 13 as a world power just as the ten-horned beast of revelation 13 and the beasts of daniel 7 and 8. we will also outline the particular details provided in scripture for identifying that two-horned beast, identify its six historical predecessors, discuss the seven satanic angels who preside over these earthly kingdoms, and discuss the revival of authority to one of those angelic rulers. 
the four horsemen
our study series on the four horsemen of the apocalypse is an in-depth examination of these iconic riders. join us as we explore intriguing questions like: are the four horsemen just a figurative way for the bible to tell us about coming war, famine, and death in the end-times? is the first horsemen the jesus christ, or the antichrist, or someone else? what is the significance of the bow, the crown, the balances, and the sword? is there meaning to the color of the horses? why is the fourth horseman called death? why is death capitalized? why does it say hell followed with him? does hell just mean "hell on earth"? are there four riders or five? how do these seals relate to other parts of john's vision? 
mark of the beast
is the mark of the beast a upc code? a vaccine? a computer chip? a smart card or smart phone? or something else? over the course of the weeks ahead, our new study on the mark of the beast will take a look at popular, conventional understandings as well as considering less traditional understandings as we discuss the exegetical data provided in the bible as well as what we can reasonably deduce from it.
abomination of desolation
our new abomination of desolation podcast series will provide an in-depth examination of this important end-times event by looking at the biblical terms used to describe it, historical precedents, and what may be involved.
the two witnesses of revelation
curious about the two witnesses but tired of shallow studies that only point out the obvious, self-promote, or rely on wild speculations or claims of secret prophetic knowledge? try our study. in it we take a down to earth, but comprehensive and substantive look at the biblical questions and issues using an in-depth, informed, reasoned, and bible-based approach including questions like: who are the two witnesses? are they individuals or groups? are they gentiles or jewish? are they biblical figures from the past or are they from the final generation? who are the 144,000? who is the woman of revelation 12? what is the chronology of the final week? episodes of this podcast series can be found by clicking on either of the links below.

february 13, 2025 is jesus the reason for the season? the biggest holiday of the year for many people is christmas. in our modern society christmas is traditionally considered to celebrate the birthday of jesus. and it can be frustrating for christians when the holiday is celebrated as a non-religious festival of gift-giving and santa claus. consequently, there has been an ongoing effort to "keep christ in christmas." given the important place that this holiday has in the lives of many christians perhaps it is worth looking into the history and origin of christmas and how it has come to have such significance in the church today.  
for more information on the origin and history of christmas and a biblical look at jesus' birth, please see our study entitled:  celebrating christmas 
 
q:i'm new here. where should i get started?the 
arrangement of topics to the left provides a recommended reading order. it 
is designed to reflect a step-by-step progression from more basic topics to more 
complex ones. however, it is not necessary to follow this order. those who are more familiar with certain topics may easily read whichever studies are of interest without first going through all of the earlier topics in the list.
