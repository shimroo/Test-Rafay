do you remember 5th grade? in 5th grade we all had those types of desks where the top opened up like a hinge so you could get to all your supplies and books within.  well i took it upon myself to decorate the inside of the top of my desk with a nice poster of aylssa milano.  she smiled at me when i opened my desk everyday that year of 5th grade.  who's the boss now, bitch. (just kinda felt like saying that - it doesn't really apply to anything)here are some recent pics of alyssa attending the gotham magazine party.

so... there seems to have been a void lately in my life, something missing, something not quite right.  no, its not my underwear, those are missing for a reason.  i think its my little buddy inside trying to tell me that he misses wez says and all his little blogger buddies like amera.so - im back.  well atleast for now.  what do i have to say?... not much.  in fact, maybe nothing.i'll tell you one thing that i think is funny, is just how shitty katie couric is and how major she has flopped trying to be the new face of cbs news.  check out these ratings...  she is getting piss pounded aka nobody is watching her try to read the news off a teleprompter.couric: cbs 'evening news' ratings disastermonday, oct. 16, 2006new york citywabc 7.1wnbc 5.3wcbs 3.7los angeleskabc 5.9knbc 3.1kcbs 1.5washington, dcnbc 9.3abc 7.8cbs 2.5on another note.. here are some pics of the lovely scarlett johansson from the november 06 issue of esquire.       psi never really did french kiss kelly kapowski.  now, preppy, give me back my bomber jacket.

svetlana shusterman - real world key west - fhm april 06the real world: key west’s hottest housemate has been unleashed“to see a hurricane moving at full speed, with 130 mph winds, was some scary shit,” says svetlana shusterman, the new season’s hottest resident and designated fit-thrower. the 20-year-old beauty is not new to challenges, though: she was smuggled stateside at the age of 4 from her native ukraine and is now a biology major at philadelphia’s temple university. bigger obstacles, though, face the show’s producers in their quest to keep svetlana covered for tv.“most of the time, i wear something revealing,” svetlana says. “my mentality is, it’s better to do it now than when i’m 40 years old and look weird. i have big boobs, and it’s good to show them off.”fans writing on the real world blogs have you pegged as “the crazy russian chick.” you’re ukrainian, but are you crazy?i’m absolutely out of my mind. i’m far from normal in everything i do—from going to the bathroom to just existing. i’m a big weirdo, and i love that. i’m that girl who is always in a good mood. i’ll run around naked if i have to, or if i want to. if you double-dare me, i have to do it. that’s something my roommates on the show worked out pretty quickly.give us an example.my life is like a game of truth or dare. if people are bored, they’ll ask me, “hey, svet, do you want to eat boiled eggs until you puke?” and i’ll be like, “why not?”do you bare your ample bosom on the show?i would not want my boyfriend showing his jewels to some chick, so i wasn’t going to show my titties to my roommates. i think they might have seen them, though. i’m always naked—i’m always naked and want other people to be naked with me. i did walk around my bedroom nude on the show, but not in other areas of the house. there’s no good excuse for walking into a kitchen naked.are there any good punch-ups in the series?there aren’t any physical fights, because i wasn’t allowed. there were certainly moments when i wanted to rip someone’s head off. if you really piss me off, i don’t take the intelligent route—i’d rather beat the shit out of you. i couldn’t do that, though, because i signed a contract with mtv before filming started. there were times when i was like, “if only i could choke you for 10 minutes, i’d feel so much better.” but, of course, i couldn’t do that.have you kicked a girl’s ass away from the mtv cameras?yes. it was 4 a.m. in montreal on the week of new year’s eve. it was freezing cold, and i was waiting for a cab outside. one finally came and, as i was holding the door, three girls ran into the cab and stole it before my friends and i could get in. i started banging on the window—here’s where it becomes the other chick’s fault—and she wound down the window. big mistake. my fists took over her face. i hit her with everything i had before the cab sped away. my knuckles were left swollen and bloody with teeth marks. i think she got it pretty good, which is what she deserved.finally, your 34dd breasts. are they a help or a hindrance?oh, they’re great. i love to play with my boobs.that’s understandable.what could be better than playing with boobs? i’m so blessed that i have 34dds because i’m never bored. i don’t know what it’s like to play with balls, but i’d play with them if i had them. the same goes with boobs. how could you not want to touch these boobs? they’re so much fun. seriously, i love my chest more than guys do. when my guy is touching my boobs, i’m like, “hey, that’s not fair. i want to touch them too.” i get jealous. fhm

	 	total eclipse of the heart... err.. sun.
	 	
    	


the bus is the single stupidest, fattest, slowest, most despised vehicle on the road. isn't it? you ever notice when you get behind the bus, people in your car go 'what are you doing? get away, come on.' the back of the bus is like an eclipse isn't it? people are just like 'the sun, where's the sun?' it's like this huge metal ass taking up the whole wind shield of your car. when it pulls out it even sounds like a fat uncle trying to get out of a sofa.russell (to jerry and george): we're going to have to do this some other time, so if you'll give me your number, i'll call you later. (jerry and george nod. molly takes her jacket off.)george: you know, suddenly i'm in the mood for pasta primavera myself. (jerry nudges george to sneak a peek at molly's cleavage as she bends over and looks in her backpack. jerry has a quick look, but george stares, hypnotized. russell comes up behind george.)russell (angrily): get a good look, costanza?new scene - jerry and george in jerry's apartment.jerry: what were you doing?george: well, it's not my fault. you poked me! jerry: you're supposed to just take a peek after a poke. you were like you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the empire state building.george: it's cleavage. i couldn't look away. what am i, waiting to win an oscar here? this is all i have in my life.jerry: looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun, you don't stare at it. it's too risky. you get a sense of it and then you look away.george: all right. so, he caught me in a cleavage peek, so big deal. who wouldn't look at his daughter's cleavage? she's got nice cleavage.jerry: that's why i poked.george: that's why i peeked. world treated to rare total eclipse of sun
