  highly recommend!!!    professional, efficient and easy to work with! communication was on point!  robert made scheduling easy starting with the initial bid process all the way through our 3 day project. it consisted of digging/ trenching out over 100 linear feet of 2 ft by 2 ft in an awkward terrain. then removal of the dirt. enrique and his team arrived on time and got right to it! didn't let up until it was complete. great job, guys!!! we will be calling you again should the need arise. - jay k.

  ★★★★★ this morning i had one of your trucks come to my house to pick up a bunch of yard waste i had accumulated. i can't begin to tell you how great it felt to be able to get rid of it so easily. your company is surely to be commended. the service was so prompt, as i had only called yesterday. the fact that your people called us when they were en route was wonderful. and the three guys who loaded the truck were awesome.they were fast and neat (even swept up a few rocks that fell in the driveway). they were polite and above all, the price was reasonable. believe me, i will surely call you next time i need someone. i had had another company a few years back and it was an unpleasant and almost scary ordeal. so again, many thanks for your fine service. job well done!" - linda coit

  ★★★★★ i called ah and spoke to robert and told him i needed some hauling done asap. i gave him very specific directions to where the stuff was that needed to go because i was in a different town. somehow i missed the phone call saying they were there at the house and would do the job for $100 within just a few hours of my phone call. i was disappointed that i had missed them, but when i called robert he said he had told them to go ahead and do the job. i was so pleased, gave him my cc number after the fact and appreciated that he had made that executive decision, especially in light of the fact that most of the other prices i was seeing were a minimum of $200 and even $300. they don't have a fancy truck, but it does the job just like the big fancy ones. i live in a small town and that&#8217;s how we do business, so it was nice to see that there is a company in san diego that operates on trust! thank you,robert and crew!!" - pamela m

  ★★★★★ i recently found your ad in the pennysaver and called your office to schedule a hauling job. i want you to know that i found you all to be exactly what you claim. i spoke to a person rather than an answering machine when i called, i received a rate quote over the phone and your rates were very reasonable. (because of that, i was able to increase what was hauled, and clean up even more than i had planned.) before my appointment, rob called to tell me that the driver was running slightly behind schedule, and again to let me know he was on the way. further, both the driver and his helper were friendly, professional, efficient (and very strong, i might add!) fortunately, i don't have many hauling jobs, but i will happily recommend american haul away to anyone i can.thank you very much for a pleasant experience!" - rene roberts
