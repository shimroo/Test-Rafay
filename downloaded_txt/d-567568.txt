management forum understand that different people absorb and retain information best in different ways, and how, where and when training is delivered can have a big impact on understanding new legislation and mastering new skills. for those looking for an immersive classroom experience, our face to face public training courses run twice a year in london with options around the globe including dubai, uae. those not wishing to travel can have a comparable experience by viewing the event live online or cover the course material in a self-guided format with our on-demand elearning.
for those looking for something a little different, we can deliver custom training to your tailored to your requirements, and even help you work out what those requirements are. alternatively, one of our existing courses can be delivered at your premises so you can bring the whole company up to date with new guidelines, skills or strategies at once.
