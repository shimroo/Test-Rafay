our philosophyat dolphin boat lifts, we design our boat lifts to be strong and simple. we build our boat lifts to withstand saltwater environments without sacrificing strength. there are hundreds of possible combinations of materials, components, and construction methods available. decades of experience working on new and old technology have enabled us to refine our products to be very simple and reliable. we have worked on virtually every type and brand of boat lift that has been made over the years. our experience fixing other boat lifts that don’t work and our track record of building durable and reliable boat lifts are what makes us the most qualified choice to design and build your boat lift.we don’t play sales games. we don’t rely on gimmicks. we don’t drastically change our designs every year, hoping that it works this time. we manufacture common-sense, saltwater-grade boat lifts, and we have been doing it for over 35 years. building long-lasting boat lifts has kept us in business longer than any other boat lift manufacturer in our area - since 1988. other companies may come and go. dolphin boat lifts is a company that you can count on to be here for you tomorrow.
