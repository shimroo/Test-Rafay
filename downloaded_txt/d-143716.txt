update! sep 17-19,2004

went to indy for the div 3 nhra bracket nationals.
1st time pass the dragster ran a slow 5.67 in 1/8th mile.
checked compression and found the head gasket blown.
drove back home (2hrs) pulled my engine and put a stock 400 with .480 lift 
hydraulic cam and 6x heads (8.5 cr)
i used my alcohol injection because i didn't have an electric pump or hoses to 
make the carb work.(or the time)
just made it to the one and only time run for sat.
ran a 6.76 in 1/8th with the engine laying over big time at half track.
cam wouldn't pull to my original shift chip.
changed shift chip,leaned out the injection for the small engine,
and took a wild guess at the dial-in.

ran a 6.29 getting way out of it.
oh well, at least i made it to the first round.
