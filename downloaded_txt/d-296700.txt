into mexico: it's no secret that mexico has been a a little "dicey" 
the last few years. but if you decide to go, here are a few suggestions..new 
passport regulations
you will need a passport, or a passcard to re-enter the us after a trip 
into mexico. if you have your birth certificate you will probably be allowed back 
in, but you can avoid a lot of hassle and a possible long wait while they mess 
with your head doing a "background check". 
i know that they cannot deny you entry, but they can make your life miserable 
for a while, and take a lot of time out of your day. this is one place i say to 
do as requested by the government.. get your passport or passcard. you'll thank 
me in the long run. you do not need either of these 
to fish the mexican side of the lake, just a mexican fishing license.  
get the current info you need on mexico lakes including travel tips. falcon fishing, 
zapata lodging, the scoop on real guides available who win tournaments and catch 
fish, wind-weather conditions, best eateries, maps etc.
