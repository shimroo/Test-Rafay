client testimonials







“my family has been using their services for about 10 yrs and have bought over 9 notebooks for school and business. they are very efficient and effective in meeting the various needs we have had over the years. i give them a five star rating!”
grace k.







“i’m very happy with the laptop i purchased here a few months ago. i got a reasonable price and warranty. then, my son decided to take his 12 year old rage out on my laptop and the touchpad and some of the keys stopped working!”
loann h.







“jim and the staff at thenotebookshop.com are great! it’s rare to see in a world where amazon and e-commerce is everywhere a great local store that promotes face to face interaction with their customers and welcomes giving customers a “showroom” experience.”
brian l.
