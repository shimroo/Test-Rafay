product review: hairplay salon haircare





*first off, i know it has been a while, but work and other-non-fashion blogging related duties call - i'll be back to more regular posts soon!anyway, back to the useful information, like how to keep your hair looking amazing despite humidity so thick you could probably bottle and drink the air. i recently got the chance to try hairplay salon's new eco-friendly styling products, set and seal. the first is a setting lotion that you use before blow-drying, and the second is a shine serum that you use on dry hair.now, you should be aware that i have the kind of hair that gets huge and frizzy when it is humid, so keeping it under control is not always easy. therefore, i was amazed that i experienced a mininum of unruliness when using both set and seal - the setting lotion is particularly amazing for providing hold and a little flattering volume without stickiness. my hair even looks pretty decent the next morning now, which is impressive.pick some up yourself at http://www.hairplayproducts.com/ (and i'm not just recommending cause i got to try free samples - this is something i'd actually pay for. these are also the kind of products where a little goes a long way, so a bottle will last you a while).go forth and be fabulous!

practically posh is fabulously practical





i just got the chance to review practically posh: the smart girl's guide to a glam life by robin moreno and it was really a fun little book, and the photographs/overall design were adorable.  while none of the tips are incredibly groundbreaking, it is a fun summer read (it would be great for a plane ride), and you'll probably pick up some great party/entertaining tips - that was definitely my favorite section.  and i've got to like someone who understands the pure happiness in a pitcher that is properly made sangria.order it from amazon here.robin also a fun blog, www.practicallyposh.wordpress.com.

denim or not?





in my experience, you are either a denim person or not. either you can't live without your jeans, or you can take them or leave them, if you even own a pair. i fall into the second category.therefore i don't quite get the whole designer denim thing, or even the need to own more than a couple pairs of jeans (i have probably six pairs, maybe three that i wear on a regular basis. all are at least one year old). despite the fact that i own a ridiculous amount of shoes, lots of little dresses, a pile of scarves and a big tangle of jewelry, i could care less about jeans. and yes, i have the kind of job where i can generally wear jeans to work.so therefore, denim aficionados - please explain it to me. what is the draw? is it the feeling of wearing the perfect flattering pair of jeans? are they just that comfortable? am i just trying on the wrong brands? seriously, i don't quite get it.your input is highly appreciated.

summer beauty tips from the fashionable kiffen





now that summer is in full swing and it is seriously hot and humid here in chicago (and most other places), it is time to adapt your beauty routine to the weather, if you haven't already. so without further ado, here are my favorite summer beauty tips:1. your hair will not want to be straight or sleek in the humidity. pick up a good styling cream or curling gel and go with it. headbands are your friend, and fortunately there have been a lot of cute ones around lately.2. like your hair, your eye makeup will also not want to be perfectly defined. smudgy cream shadows and smoky eyes are good; as is just throwing on some waterproof mascara and calling it a day (especially if you are at the beach/pool). i've mentioned it on this blog before, but maybelline sky high curves is the most amazing mascara i've ever used - i actually prefer it to diorshow and mac's fiberlash and other high end brands. i also like to do a bright eyeliner, like the turquoise shade from dior's diormania eyeshadow palette.3. a sheer but bright lip gloss looks amazing, especially something that leaves a sheer stain like a popsicle. nars lip lacquer in hot wired is my personal favorite for this look - it is a shocking fuschia shade that is perfect with a real or faux tan. corals and cherry-red shades are excellent choices as well.4, this one is a necessity - nice smooth, moisturized limbs, whether you decide to rock the pale look or go bronze. hell, if you don't like to shave your legs keep your skin in good condition, it makes a huge difference. in fact, if you are like me and tend to shave last minute (sometimes using hair conditioner or lotion because you forgot to buy more shave gel), try the schick quattro razor. the good people at schick were nice enough to send me one to try and it is fabulous - perfectly smooth skin and no nicks even if you are clumsy and/or trying to shave about ten minutes before you have to be out the door.5. cooling down - keep your body lotion in the fridge to cool yourself down after a long hot day. simple but effective.6. pedicures! for the love of the fashion gods, if you are going to wear sandals prep your feet first. you don't have to go to a salon (i never do), but pumice your feet and paint your toes before you wear those fantastic new sandals, otherwise you are killing the whole effect. yes, it seems painfully obvious, but i see enough "hooves" out there parading around in what would be pretty sandals to know otherwise.what are your favorite summer beauty tips?

fashion in the city: a few observations





like most women in my general demographic, i saw the sex and the city movie this weekend. now, i was never a major fan of the show - i liked it well enough, but it wasn't appointment tv for me or anything. i've always thought of it as the television equivalent of junk food: unrealistic, a little fluffy and overprocessed, but sometimes it just hits the spot.the characters' clothes, however, those i could always appreciate, and the movie did very well in that regard, at least with the four main characters. carrie's outfits were appealingly eccentric, charlotte was all luxe-preppy and perfectly put together, samantha was over-the-top and deliciously inappropriate, and they even let miranda be pretty for once!however, the side characters were kind of weak in the sartorial arena - perhaps pat field blew her load on the four girls? jennifer hudson should have had a much more interesting wardrobe, and the guys...well, they were just backup players for the women (that does make sense in the context of the show, but that doesn't mean their wardrobe had to be so bland).finally, i left the movie wishing that it was more...normal...to wear giant feathered hats/headpieces.  although if wearing feathers was normal, i probably wouldn't think they were so awesome.check back later for a more detailed write-up of my opinions on the fashion in the movie.

ode to marshall's





my shopping philosophy tends to be along the lines of "never pay full price if you can help it"; therefore, stores like tj maxx, filene's basement, and yes, marshall's tend to be regular haunts. so when marshall's invited me to come in and "check out their shoes" - their new shoe megashop, i was understandably thrilled. good deals plus awesome shoes? i'm there! it sounds like a major cliche (fashion writer loves gorgeous yet impractical high heels? gee, no one has written about that before), but the heart, it wants what it wants.so last week i took my stylish self down to marshall's (for the chicagoans playing along, the one on ontario right off michigan avenue) for some shoe shopping, despite the fact that i am possibly the last person on earth who needs another pair of shoes. anything for the store that stocked my wardrobe with many great pieces at equally great prices over the years, right? now, marshall's shoe megashop is billed as 5000 feet of fantastic shoes, and at my local marshall's there has to be at least this much space devoted to footwear. now, time and time again i've seen current pieces from brands like nine west, guess, bandolino, steve madden, enzo anglioni, and other labels around that price point at marshalls - i mean the very same shoes that are currently at full price in department stores; or if they are on sale in those stores, marshall's still offers a better deal. on this particular trip, i also noticed a few brands i hadn't seen before - giuseppe zannotti (including a great pair of embellished sandals), stuart weitzman (a steal at around $120-150 per pair), and calvin klein.my favorites? i'm a fan of guess's stripper-chic heels, particularly when worn with a more modest outfit. there were also lots of gorgeous embellished flats that made me wish i actually liked to wear flat shoes (i'm short and in denial, also, i'm so used to wearing heels that flats are kind of painful). there were also some luscious cobalt blue patent peep mary janes that were calling my name. it was kind of like being a sugar addict in a bakery - so many delicious things, so little time.the point of this post? well, thanks to marshall's for inviting me (and providing me with a gift card - although i guarantee i would have spent money at marshall's of my own accord, and i'll certainly be back - oh, who am i kidding, i've already been back), and to let my lovely readers know that if they need a cheap and dirty shoe fix, there is a store ready to fulfill their needs. seriously, very few pairs were over $50, and most were around $20-40, so you won't be out too much cash.find a store near you at http://www.marshallsonline.com/.
