existing in new york city---i'm retreating while the fascists proceed





i'm pulling back on my jabbing at enemies
politics is way beneath me these days.  the ignorant, confederate-minded, backward-thinking numbskulls currently in adorable rule of us weakling coward americans are miles beneath me in a hell of their own creation---corporate creationism.  we the people of the us are currently afraid of our own shadows.  everyone's a terrorist or a potential terrorist---and all muslims are terrorists, of course.  all thanks to that vote-stealing, lying, deceitful, sociopath, george w. "preemptive striking" bush, that little vote-stealing prick who is now living the good life down in dallas---plenty of bourbon and coke for him and plenty of high-grade pot for pickles.  what a life.  and all at the taxpayers' expense.  nobody foreclosing on his dallas home.  nobody foreclosing on his book-empty library.  nobody denying him or pickles health care.  nobody cancelling his presidential pay for the rest of his worthless life as a way for the backward-thinking republicans to cut the "entitlement" budgets.  nobody is raiding his digs at night or no dallas cops are stopping him and frisking him or no dallas cops are shooting at g.w. when he's wearing his hoodie.

 
me?  fuck all of that.  i'm retreating back into my shell.  i'm writing on a new novel.  leaving the american mythic false reality behind for my own fantasy and not that of ayn rand or milton friedman, those two jokers and deceivers.  i'm basking in my own reality.

of course i came out of my shell to yell it up for the greeks.  finally tired of germany-dominated euro-union loan sharking and imf and world bank imperialistic draconian demands on the greek people, fuck the fact that their economic failure was brought on by the big global banks like goldman sachs, those pirate bastards, or as the new minister of finance of greece, an economist, by the bye, puts it, greece was driven into bankruptcy by bankrupt banks and their derivative schemes.

we are supposed to believe the myth that crime does not pay.  that is now bullshit as we look around at all these criminals getting richer and richer by the billions.

butterflies and pig pens 

in a hovering splash
of vibrating color 
guided by instincts
it's an insect's
high-flown search
for perhaps a meal 
over the grunting
hunger of hairy
slopping monsters 
but sadly
this controversial flutter
reveals no
seductive pollen, only
a strong whiff of degradation  
and like a true monarch
it turns its naturally
divine nose
up at the reality below.

i'm wafting off to my fantasyland on the wings of a soured-stomached butterfly.

of course, i know, like huey newton said before he was murdered, everything is politics even food.

existing in new york city---the fascists are in power







the higher immorality can neither be narrowed to the political sphere nor understood as primarily a matter of corrupt men in fundamentally sound institutions. political corruption is one aspect of a more general immorality; the level of moral sensibility that now prevails is not merely a matter of corrupt men. the higher immorality is a systematic feature of the american elite; its general acceptance is an essential feature of the mass society.

of course, there may be corrupt men in sound institutions, but when institutions are corrupting, many of the men who live and work in them are necessarily corrupted. in the corporate era, economic relations become impersonal-and the executive feels less personal responsibility. within the corporate worlds of business, war-making and politics, the private conscience is attenuated-and the higher immorality is institutionalized. it is not merely a question of a corrupt administration in corporation, army, or state; it is a feature of the corporate rich, as a capitalist stratum, deeply intertwined with the politics of the military state. [c. wright mills, the power elite, 1956]

since the 60s
since the days of the hippy rebelion against the stupid vietnam war, we eccentric oddballs have been yelling our heads off about this country going fascist.  when you worship the rich and famous like we do in this country, you lose a sense of reality, a reality where everyone can't be rich.  in fact, there must be poor people for there to be rich people.
 

i'm already watching the fascist republicans going about actually ruining our federal government.  they want to privatize the world---global dominance.  a privatized world means there are no regulations at all protecting world citizens.  the republicans want us all poor don't you see because royals and feudal landlords and the privileged (those who practice conspicuous consumption ---read thorstein veblen for an explanation of "conspicuous consumption") need the poor to clean their shitcans, to prepare their meals, to wash their clothes, to wait on them hand and foot, to raise and pamper their worthless offspring (those who inherit their wealth).  it's a revolution alright, but a right-wing revolution, our betters enslaving us so that we'll do their bidding because in poverty men and women are desperate; the capitalist pig way of thinking, sees desperation as opportunity to enslave.

the trouble is, americans worship rich people.  the poor hate them, but that hate stems from jealousy and not from self-defiance and rebellion.  we see the wealthy constantly peddled before us as our mentors, as those who are blessed by the god moolah with wealth, privilege, and power.  though these power elite are criminals, they will never be convicted of a crime because they are god-blessed and the myth surrounding them is that these criminals are needed in order for our economy to grow.  bullshit!  our economy isn't growing and will die more than grow in the coming four long years because we refuse to tax the power elite and the corporations they get their power from.  we are allowing our rich and their corporations to jerk us around by the nose.  i figure in a few years, we'll build chapels to the power elites where we poor slobs can go pray to their god, moolah.  can you imagine a koch brothers chapel on park avenue in new york city (this is where they live, not in wichita) with a shrine to the three disparate brothers?  or how about the donald trump chapel where we all can go in and worship the bankruptcy champion of the usa as he basks in a wealth he inherited from his real-estate mogul father?

the fascist republicans are already at work trying to destroy our lives as we dream of living them.  they are already denying future payments to the disabled.  the fascist hate the disabled because they suck money out of the system and contribute nothing to it.  this cut will also include disabled veterans. fuck 'em, right?  that's how we treat our "military heroes" once they get their poor slob asses out of combat and intrigue and return home to nothing but fuck yous from our fascist government while hypocritically they are praising these poor slobs as heroes.  only fools join the military these days.  fools with no hope after they get out or don't get out of high school of landing any kind of good-paying job so they go join the army to save their asses.

i love a certain ad on television that's been running lately in which the jest is that a soldier coming home without any legs is now better off than he was when he had legs---for you see, the example they give is a guy who is now a champ in the disabled olympics as a wheel-chair racer.  hey, how 'bout that!  what about truncates?  heroes who lost both arms and legs?  you don't hear much about them.

these fascist republicans are so cruel, they're seriously advocating doing away with social security (it's the americans workers' money but not according to these fascist assholes), medicare, and medicaid.  can you imagine such gall?  millionaires who have the best health-care taxpayers' money can buy; millionaires who are set for life even if they lose their next election because they continue to get paid on into the future---and these old fossils live forever---look at the aging koch bros., look at old grizzled mitch "fuck you" mcconnell.  this son of the old plantation south hates the workingclass, a class he's never known in his life.  now these old bastards are going to try to drive us down to a third world nation, the very thing the neo-con manifesto called for back during the reagan years.

i worked in new york city advertising (telling lies) for tons of years.  every year i paid into social security and after i turned fifty, i started paying into medicare.  it's my money, god-dammit, and i can't see, though fools they be, the american retired (seniors they're called) workers letting these assholes get away with what they plan: the privatization of social security.  if these workers allow this, then the american people are stupider than i think they are now.  remember, the american people elected these assholes to office.  the fact that these assholes got millions of power elite and corporate money in their campaigns didn't get them elected as our media trumpets; the voters had alternatives, but, no, they in their stupidity voted the worst assholes into power.  the blacks and latinos didn't elect these draconian assholes.  the racist whites put them in power...and don't forget that when these fascist fools start fucking with you.

who will be our hitler?  will it be hillary?  or jeb?  after all, jeb's family took care of hitler's banking during his effort to conquer the world with his napoleonic complex. 

oh well. i'm a voice in the wilderness, i know.  and my words are wasted on so stupid a people as those who elected this circus of clowns as our rulers. 

world war iii sits like a cheshire cat on our horizon.

existing in new york city: chaos rules







"the suspicious mind believes more than it doubts.  it believes in a formidable and ineradicable evil lurking in every person." eric hoffer

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

the arising automaton military and the coming world war iii
i watched a pbs frontline presentation wednesday (jan. 7th) on future spying using high resolution cameras, cameras the size of the cameras we have in our cell phones that from 17,000-feet can pinpoint an area say of a city, like the corner of 34th and broadway here in new york city, whence they can then zoom down to see every moving object on that corner---from cars to pedestrians---zooming in on a human being definite enough to see him waving his arms about.  i watched this dr. argus (yes, a mad scientist) creating these high-definition cameras and being so proud of his advancements on this form of technological spying.

then the show moved on to the evolution of drones and the predicted coming of an automaton military.  drones are still not completely controllable yet---they crash more than any other aircraft around today.  so the evil scientists at mit (and other ivy league government-money-grubbers) spending oodles of pentagon free-flowing money (and now that the idiot republicans are in office and taking us over, the pentagon will be sluiced another billions or trillions of dollars) are designing and redesigning current and future drones, drones that eventually will attempt to complete the ronald-reagan-vision of world dominance through underhanded means (the new world order, folks)(the 1000 points of light old pappy bush (he's getting near a chance to meet his maker) trumpeted---1000 points of high-definition spying---i'm sorry, when it comes to the bushes, i go off my rocker.  how this sleazy bush family and the sleazy clinton gang have taken us over stunningly amazes me and how they are purposely leading us down a chaotic path of eventually human destruction makes me want to turn my back on the human race.  (a societal death wish being fulfilled by a gang of evil sociopaths.)

d.h. lawrence (i'm currently reading the plumed serpent) hated science because he said science had no soul, had no gods within it (a platonic reasoning), meaning it is simply a matter of mathematical "lifeless" conjecturing.  have you ever watched a physicist writing out a complicated math equation?  it's like a first language with him or her.  like the formula for quantum mechanics---that formula dominates the mind of the ladder-climbing physicist (like bohr, planck, heisenberg) and he can quickly jot it out for you, an equation it took decades to invent.  and that's what these humanity killing scientists are up to, the eventual moving of the human world into a chaotic free-fall situation, a situation we are currently in. 

intrigue is the key word here.  the human mind seeks intrigue in order to justify its existence.  intrigue has led us from the most primitive of mankind to what we are today, a jam-pot mess of soon 8 billion people most of whom are india indians or asians.  obama is on his way to india as i write this.  why is he going to india?  if you recall, that idiot son of pappy bush's, g.w., traded india our nuclear secrets for their mangoes.  sounds insane...and it is, but it actually happened.  so obama, under orders from the bush-clinton gang, their hands are up his ass manipulating his presidency, is going over to bring india into his trans-pacific trade agreement, a trade agreement that some pundits claim will take away all nations' sovereignty and turn us all over to an international body of corporate rulers and their own set of world courts ruled over by corporate lawyers all put in place and kept in place by fascist military units.  there is no doubt in my mind that we are now definitely a fascist nation.  when's our mussolini going to show his pompous face? 

turns out money really is the root of all evil.  a brilliant whiz-kid person studies hard and long in order to compete in this chaotic world.  the most brilliant of us get into science.  the ultra-brilliant of us, those genius scientists who are currently working on pentagon experiments of automaton warfare, who will do anything to get ahead in their fields, to me are the most evil of us.  for prestige in their fields and with all that pentagon loot under their control, they'll do anything they're told to do, like "we want you to devise a warring instrument that will eventually do away with the human race."  "yassuh, massuh," these evilly minded scientists will reply.

i truly believe these republican assholes to whom the stupid american people have just handed their lives will eventually use nuclear weapons as a part of their world-dominance-new-world-order agenda (the neo-con manifesto).  can you imagine a gathering of the evilest people on earth (and there are such gatherings going on 24/7) in order to program a genocide plan that will eliminate poor people (those who suck from the system rather than contributing to it)?  and i'm just nibbling at the corners of this world-dominance plan.

i'm evilly thrilled about all this.  i love chaos and entropy.  i've been predicting it for years now. check my earliest posts (2006)---satirical in nature though they were, they were actually pointing the direction in which this bunch of criminal political goons is taking us---i said our true god is chaos (in his material form as money) and that we will eventually be bowing down to him and sacrificing virgins to him and evangelically proclaiming him our true and only god.  god help us.  we are definitely doomed.

existing in new york city, where our police can do no wrong; where only the citizens they're supposed to protect are criminals





new york city police (under guiliani-appointed dumbass police commish) cry foul
two nypd officers were ambushed (or "bushwhacked" as my west texas friends would say) and killed by a man with a muslim-sounding name.  now the nypd is crying its eyes out over this incident.  plus, they're crying foul.  who committed the foul?  why the protesters of police killing of unarmed black men who have been tying up traffic, blocking tunnels, bridges, protesting in front of police headquarters, city hall.  g.w. bush's piece of crap administration started all of this by stamping the asses of protesters against baby bush's two illegal and economic destructive wars (both illegal since neither iraq nor afghanistan had a damn thing to do with 9/11, one of the great military invasions of all time, where 22 fanatic islam drunken nutjobs (my psychiatrist niece castigates me for using such vicious slang) using only box-cutters took over airliners and crashed them into various "political sites" (world trade center, the pentagon, the white house) around the usa in payback for pappy bush (is he near to meeting his maker?) using saudi-arabia to launch an attack against a muslim nation, which pissed off bin laden and the saudi wahhabists to the point they sought revenge against the us attempt to control the world's marketplace with the intentions of forcing us ways on what we call savage nonchristian nations.

and now, oh my god, all the nyc news flunkies are with tearfilled eyes talking about what a tragedy this is,  it's ok for cops to shoot and kill black boys and men but when one of them goes berserk and kills policeman, holy shit, the whole citizenry is blamed.  here's how our big phony liberal (liberal, hell, he's a political hack just like all of 'em) mayor deblasio had to politically word it:

"when a police officer is murdered, it tears at the foundation of our society. it is an attack on all of us," said de blasio,
 who has had a rocky relationship with rank-and-file police officers 
over what they see as his lack of support. "when they are attacked, it 
is an attack on the very concept of decency." 

oh, poor old political hack.  he forgets nyc is a republican stronghold---hell, the koch brothers live here; it's a billionaire/playboy heaven now---full of dictators out looking to take away all our constitutional rights and our long-now-dead bill of rights.  my question is, how does the killing of a police officer tear at the foundation of our society?  does that mean when the cops kill an unarmed teenage black boy or a choke a black man to death they are building up the foundation of our society?  "when they are attacked, it is an attack on the very concept of decency."  wow, that's a powerful backwards way of thinking.  if the cops kill unarmed citizens, they are really being decent about it, is that what deblasio means?

our local teevee stations telecasted live and stayed throughout the long cop-honor-b.s. and praise the lord service for slain cop, raphael ramos (they did not televise eric garner's funeral).  and according to the teevee narators, you would have thought ramos was jesus christ as they emphasized how tough it is being a policeman here in nyc and how harassed they are by protesters like the sorry low-lifes protesting the legal killings of michael brown in ferguson and eric garner on staten island.  michael brown, according to our teevee mourners, cockily defied the ferguson cops and deserved being blown away even though he was unarmed and committed no crime---he was killed because he was a black man.  or they said eric garner was a sorry bastard of a black man who deserved to be choked to death because after all he was selling loose cigarettes, which meant the sorry bastard was not paying taxes on these cigarettes.  i agreed wholeheartedly after my teevee "newsspeakers" explained the cops side of that choking that led to this criminal's death and gave the boyz in blue a big tip of the hat, shouting, "good job, men.  blow the fucking black bastards away at will.  i confess my communist leanings and renounce them to now favor a fascist state where the police are meant to protect the rights of the rich and blow away any aggravating and protesting lefties, and that includes all blacks and latinos as well as hippy whites---blow 'em away with impunity.  amen.  the cops are right and we the citizens of nyc are wrong.  case closed.

there will be i'm sure (and already are) other black men and boys gunned down by cops probably before the end of this year and certainly all during 2015.  cops are not guilty of any crimes because they have a 007 attitude about why they carry powerful sidearms and akas and tear gas and pepper spray.  they truly are taught they have a god-given right as cops to blow away anybody they suspect of being a threat to them.  our poor police.  i think we should let them rule us.  afterall, cops are there to protect us and serve us.  what mythical bullshit, eh?

our national hypocrisies go marching on.  we live in a mythical world.  there's nothing real about it except human beings are through the human race's death wish trying to kill the real world with their mythological belief systems.

existing in new york city: is that anarchy i smell in the air?





in the still of the night
i was already in bed reading lawrence's the plumed serpent when a sound outside my opened window caught my attention.  you know how you hear something and at first you know what it sounds like but you're not quite definite about it yet?  that's what happened with me.  i heard this sound and knew what it sounded like but thought no that can't be what it sounds like.  then, as if on cue, i heard a helicopter flying low and noisy over my building--i'm on the top floor so i got a bird's eye view of it with its exhaust belching out its annoying presence. and then it hit me.  it was what i thought it was.  it was the noise of people in the streets, of people chanting forcefully in that inspiring unison that then i knew was ringing all about my neighborhood as these protesters marched up broadway toward times square.  i immediately turned on the 11 o'clock news (news i normally don't ever watch except during catastrophes or mass protests, those sorts of things).  i was wide awake to first a fairly fair reportage by the local cbs news of what was going on (the local nbc news was sarcastic and pro-police in their reportage).

this all started when al sharpton (i don't call him reverend...that's a bullshit title) announced a televised press conference in which he was going to discuss the day-before exonerating of the cop who choked poor old eric garner to death with him hollering "i can't breathe" eleven times--it was all captured on an i-camera by a dude standing right at the edge of the action.

no problem, saith our pious police.  this big black devil was selling loose cigarettes trying to make a little street money to support his wife and 6 kids.  tough shit, black man.  the nypd can't tolerate such law breakers.  why not shoot this crooked son of a bitch?  cops know nothing's gonna happen to 'em if they shoot someone in the "line of duty."

since i've lived in new york city, almost every few weeks the cops shoot and kill someone, usually, a black man, though, hell, if you remember mrs. bumpers (she was wielding a butcher knife for protection when cops broke down her door and invaded her home), they'll shoot to kill women, too.

here's a huffington post article on a history of the new york police shooting unarmed black men.
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/18/killed-by-the-nypd-black-men_n_5600045.html 

cops are basically cowards.  cowards carrying high-powered sidearms, wearing bullet-proof vests (they have to buy their own), harnessed in huge leather attire that holds handcuffs, billy club (nightstick they call it), automatic pistol, bullets, pepper spray, and their intercommunication devices (if they are in their swat paraphernalia then they are in military garb carrying aka assault rifles) .  when watching 9/11 on television, while the nyfd did their duty and marched into the falling straight down world trade centers 1 and 2 to their possible doom, the big fat overloaded cops were running like hell away from the falling buildings.  cowards, don't you see.

and, yes, it is dangerous to call an nyp officer a coward.   yet they are.  why, for instance, does it take five or six officers to take down one human being who if he or she resists arrest or asks the wrong questions about why they're being arrested or they turn and run when they see the cops, they get blown away without their side of the story or a chance to defend themselves in court)?  remember back to the famous rodney king case how 5 or 6 lapd beat the living crap out of the man and then said he resisted arrest (those cops were cleared of any wrongdoing by a bunch of white jurists).

no, all cops kill with impunity.  watch the cop shows on teevee where during the course of an hour, these teevee cops shoot and kill upwards of at least 3 or 4 people per episode.  some of these phony cops are brought to bear by what these shows call internal affairs if they've shot and killed a suspect.  but, praise the lord, even these phony cops end up with impunity in killing the evil enemies of law and order.  remember when the republicans trumpeted "law and order" as their main concern while participating in local, state, and federal elections.  i remember when swat teams came into being.  cop shows have always been popular, especially with males because males are taught to be competitive by playing imaginary games of good and evil, like "cowboys and indians," "cops and robbers," "bad guys and good guys."  (little girls are taught to want to be princesses and live in fairy tale kingdoms with handsome rich princes a la disney's concept of utopia.)

but get used to cops ruling the roost for the neo-con capitalists for many years to come, capitalism being our true enemy but like we can't deny a god, we can't deny capitalism is a worn-out, unfair, british-designed, imperialist economic tool.  am i promoting socialism or communism?  nope!  not at all.  i'm promoting reality. i'm promoting thinking positively in a mathematical/dialectical sense.  i'm promoting studying history and how it never changes until the peasants get tired of being run over by the robber barons' carriages and whipped at the post by one of the boss's goons or beaten in an alley by an anti-union goon.  they revolt when they get beaten down enough.  when they start gathering in the streets...well, you get my drift.

so now do you understand why we need a militarized police force?

our aristocratic congress is voting on declaring war on isis.  hot damn.  a chaotic world.  obama speaks backward-thinking speak by being anti-keystone xl pipeline on colbert's teevee show, which to me means it could be approved any day now.

existing in new york city: gotta learn how to think like a republican





into the republican mind
hi, y'all.  i'm crispy chris righteous (not my real name), a representative from the great confederate state of...er-ah, what'd i say? well, dammit, it is a confederate state, by god, and i proudly call the great state of south carolina a confederate state.  that rebel spirit still lives on in our souls.  in our white souls, i might also proudly add, 'cause after all, folks, it was rich white folks, rich white plantation moguls, rich conniving representatives of both dutch and british private equity and joint venture companies that set this country on its amazing course to rising from a british colony that had been civilized by god-fearing and god-ordained fundamentalist christian exiles.  like the brave and wily puritans and pilgrims and their believing that god had sent them to this great land to civilize it, to save it from the wildness of the savages who fought madly like wild dogs over the exploitations meant as a gift from the god jehovah to the coming civilized and god-fearing humble but meanly sincere white men...er-ah, i don't mean to leave the gals out here, but as we men all know, some of the gals need civilizing worse than the worse savage indian. [he waits for the guffawing laughter to die down.]

with the republicans kicking ass in the recent midterm elections, i was swept to a big victory over my communist-socialist-democrat-terrorist-asskissing opponent, that bitch, mary peeples, a lying dog protester who'll protest anything to get her mug in the media, especially on television where she tried to use her perky carnal appearance, and granted she is a perky little piece of charm, to make a monkey out of me, but with the help of god and the good white citizens of poll tax county, south carolina, i put her in her place...and i wanna thank our gracious secretary of state for removing 20,000 nigger votes...er-ah, what'd i say now?  did i say nigger?  i said 'knee-grow'--in yore prejudiced mind i said nigger, but in reality i said knee-grow, a proper white way of pronouncing that designation...why, hell, folks, i gotta admit i likes knee-grows.  they can be very funny characters sometimes, but, on the other hand, they can be some contrary sons'a bitches, too...and, dammit, folks, i'm sorry, but if you see a knee-grow teen in one of them defiant hoodies, you damn right, you stand your ground just as our white hero george zimmerman did, 'cause over in the great southern state of florida you can legally carry a concealed weapon...hey, folks, i carry one, and so does my wife, and i'll tell you the truth, i wish i could give my two boys, 12 and 14, sidearms so they could protect themselves from these crazy islamic bastards who under the edicts of mohammed are out to kill all americans.  so i say, if they're out to blow you away, you blow them away first.  that's the american way.  that's how the white people were able to conquer this savage land and civilize it.  why, hell, folks, look how we civilized our faithful slaves.  look at that snooty, dichty, nose-in-the-air obama, a nigger man...er-ah, what say?  i said nigger.  my friend, what've i gotta do to convince you knee-grow sounds like nigger to you.  let's change the subject anyway.

let's talk about why rich folks shouldn't pay one god-damn dime in taxes. [there are "amens" reverberating through the audience.] rich people are our mentors.  they are rich because they are smarter than the average bubba and some of the best of them, like the koch brothers and warren buffett, both middle-american, silent-majority true capitalists, were bubbas who pulled themselves up by their bootstraps. these are the same bootstraps that the family of that great neo-con president, the great and spiteful g.w. bush, pulled themselves up by...ok, so the family got beaucoup rich taking care of adolph hitler's finances.  hitler, by the way, wasn't as bad a guy as the communists, socialists, secularists, and atheists have made him out to be...plus, my fellow white folks, there's no real proof there was such a thing as this so-called holocaust.  even if there was a holocaust, the jews brought it on themselves.  do i hear an 'amen' on that?  [multitudes of amens fill the room.]

back in the glorious days before left-wing lbj forced the civil rights act on us, we called those left-wingers who came down to the south and tried to enforce that civil rights act on us "outside agitators," which is exactly what they were.  all protesters are ninnies, cowards, left-wingers, communists, atheists, coming from another part of the country, usually the north, yankeeland, new york city (jew york city), to agitate against the things that made the south great.  first of all, the old south had the cheapest labor there is in a capitalist society: slavery.  you see, folks, there's nothing wrong with slavery when it's working.  most great civilizations were built on the backs of slaves, mainly nigger...er-ah, knee-grows.  you see, folks, we white christians know from reading and studying god's word, the holy christian bible, that the sons and daughters of ham, noah's son who looked upon his father's nakedness, a mortal sin in those days, according to god's laws, which are the only laws i respect, would be servants to the white man for eternity.  they were banned by god to suffer living in what is now ethiopia.  old christians used to call niggertowns out of respect for biblical fairness, ethiopiantowns.

i got into libertarianism after meeting ludwig von mises in alabama and what a great thinker he was.  on coming to the us, he was considered a liberal in austria, but convinced that liberalism was too close to socialism and communism, he found retreat in the john birch society and the teachings of ayn rand and then especially after meeting her, promoting her philosophy as a companion way of thinking with libertarianism, of which von mises along with frederick hayak were the founders.  i consider these guys next to god.

libertarianism believes that governments are unnecessary except for maintaining an army and a navy.  each individual, according to libertarians, is his own government, his property being his domain, his regulations of himself being the only regulations and "laws" he needs, because in practice, only the laws of the god are the laws he follows.

i'll end my statement by saying, and i think the majority of americans agree with me, since we have the greatest armed forces ever known, why aren't we using them to their full power? i mean, folks, stop and think about it, one nuclear bomb dropped on the borders of iraq, syria, and iran would solve that crisis in a matter of minutes.  remember, how tough the japs were until we creamed 'em with a couple of a-bombs and think how many lives we'd save by eliminating that middle-east cesspool of islamic fanatics.  just my thoughts but i think most americans secretly agree with me.  i mean, why have these weapons if we're not going to use them?

i must admit, i'm a radical republican, a libertarian first, a conservative always.  what's best for this country is discipline.  why should an employer, for instance, be responsible for his workers' health?  should the workers on their own provide their own health care?  and this social security mess, too.  shouldn't old people provide for their own retirement?  successful people don't need social security only the poor and unhealthy need it and i say, hey, pull yourself up by your own bootstraps; that's what made this country great.

existing in new york city: calling the us population stupid as a whole





from objectivist sociologist, william ogden: "my worship
of statistics has a somewhat religious nature, " he noted in his
journal at a time when his enthusiasm was fading. statistics had been
his god. "but god only meets an emotional need which has little to do
with reason." 

calling the american people stupid
i just read a piece by dean baker (he calls himself the following: "macroeconomist and co-director of the center for economic and policy research
 in washington, dc. he previously worked as a senior economist at the 
economic policy institute and an assistant professor at bucknell 
university.") in which he condemns a fellow mit economist, johnathan gruber, for calling the american people stupid, in gruber's sense having to do with the affordable care act.

baker starts out defending the american people as not being stupid but rather simply just  "ill-informed."  i was immediately hollering bullshit as i read the article, which in a way turned into a defense of economists. as i have written for six years on this blog, economics is not a science; it was once studied under sociology departments as a tool for measuring wealth and poverty in a society using "fact"-gathering observations and statistical conclusions based on "guesstimations."

[what is an macroeconomist?  well, here's the wikipedia definition: "macroeconomists study aggregated indicators such as gdp, unemployment rates, and price indexes
 to understand how the whole economy functions. macroeconomists develop 
models that explain the relationship between such factors as national income, output, consumption, unemployment, inflation, savings, investment, international trade and international finance. in contrast, microeconomics is primarily focused on the actions of individual agents, such as firms and consumers, and how their behavior determines prices and quantities in specific markets."] 

do you understand the role of statistics in this profession?  the first course i took in economics, before 101, was a course in statistics.  the first book i was given to read in statistics was entitled, how to lie with statistics.  in those days before economics broke away from sociology to become a part of the schools of business, all sociology and economics majors depended on calculators (the old fashion kind) to crunch numbers in their statistical studies.  for my first statistical problem, i did a paper on "the infant death rate in texas." my conclusions in this paper were based on guesstimations as to what was behind the infant death rate and what was the solution to lowering the infant death rate neither of which i supplied in my "rigged" paper.

my point: i have called the american people "stupid" for many years now.  and they are stupid, i don't care if they have 6 degrees from harvard and 3 from mit.  most americans are stupid not because they aren't smart--there's a difference to me--but because they are full of bullshit reasoning based on their believing in the american dream (nothing comes from a dream but confusion), believing in gods that don't exist (except in fables, myths, holy bibles, and fairy tales), believing we are an exceptional nation, believing that we are a democracy, believing that rich people are the smartest people on earth because they are rich...you know, dumb thinking like that.  i call a person stupid who believes in lies over truth (reality is the only truth). intelligence unused leaves the intelligent one stupid, doesn't it?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
the following is an excerpt from a current counterpunch article by ismael hossein-zadeh  explaining how classical economic theories are "old-fashioned" (out of date) in terms of what modern economists are calling fire (financial investing and real estate), where investors are investing in financial markets and real estate rather than reinvesting their profits in capital improvements, borrowing to invest in the real economy, the economy of the classical economists. in classical economics, money is considered merely a means of exchange.  it was in the late 80s with the advent of desktop computing, that money became a commodity.

"the following are a few additional examples of the 
astronomical growth of the fire sector during the past three decades or 
so: between 1980 and 2005, profits in the financial sector increased by 
800%, more than three times the growth in non-financial sectors. in the 
early 1990s there existed only a couple of hedge funds; by 2007, their 
number had grown to 10,000. the number of mortgage brokers, replacing 
old-style savings & loans and regional banks, has likewise 
mushroomed in recent years/decades: 50,000 thousand of them, employing 
nearly 400,000 brokers, more than the whole u.s. textile industry [emphasis is mine]. 
as the (unusually candid) manager of the hedge fund raymond dalio of 
bridgewater associates bluntly put it: “the money that’s made from 
manufacturing stuff is a pittance in comparison to the amount of money 
made from shuffling money around. forty-four percent of all corporate 
profits in the u.s. come from the financial sector compared with only 10
 percent from the manufacturing sector."

"as noted earlier, the neoclassical “circular flow” and/or “general 
equilibrium” model/theory is built on the basis of a near-barter 
economic paradigm, that is, an economy where money is implicitly treated
 as largely a means of exchange or circulation, not as an ideal or 
ultimate repository of the accumulated or concentrated wealth. in this 
model, financial cycles neatly follow real cycles: they expand when real
 cycles expand, and contract when they contract. as such, there is 
hardly any possibility for financial bubbles to emerge and expand 
independent of the real sector of the economy—the financial sector is 
treated essentially as a service or subsidiary sector to the real 
sector.
the circular flow model (like most other models) can, of course, 
serve as a useful tool or concept for analytical purposes. it is 
designed to show what happens when/if the circuit, or circular flow, 
breaks down, and what to do about it. the problem is that mainstream 
economists seem to have been stuck in the abstract model, in the earlier
 stages of capitalism, unable to see how in the era of giant banks and 
other colossal financial institutions finance capital can (and does) 
grow independent of industrial capital, thereby leading to financial 
inflations, followed by implosions.

"it might be argued: who cares whether a financial bubble follows a 
real sector expansion or whether it is formed ab-ovo, i.e., in the 
absence of such an expansion. such a distinction, however, is critically
 important to an understanding of how in the age of advanced financial 
markets finance capital has become largely independent of industrial 
capital, and how it has therefore undermined the neoclassical concepts 
of general equilibrium, of circular flow mechanism and of national 
savings as the main source of supply of money—in short, how it has 
rendered the neoclassical economists’ theory of credit creation, of 
investment financing and of money supply obsolete. sucking financial 
resources from the rest of the economy, as well as generating fictitious
 capital out of thin air through speculation/gambling, parasitic finance
 capital feeds on itself—just like a real parasite. neoclassical 
economists have not, so far, been able to reconcile the financial sector
 with their circular flow and/or general equilibrium model. sadly, 
instead of trying to incorporate the financial sector into their real 
sector model, they have chosen to ignore it lest it should disturb their
 shipshape, convenient model."
ismael hossein-zadeh is professor emeritus of economics (drake university).

have you noticed?
my old friend and colleague barabbas munn-dayne noted this to me about how since the republican sweep of the midterm elections, koch industries (yes, that's the evil koch brothers) ads are appearing on teevee by the droves.  these ads glorify koch industries as a great job source, as fueling the rebirth of the american economy, and as providing research and scholarship in promoting new ideas and industries.  i happened to catch one the other day during a college football game.  it was sickening.  what a bunch of self-promoting bullshit.  of course, the autocratic koch brothers don't write these commercials, a bunch of silly souls like i once was (in advertising for over 30 years in nyc) brain-storming away in the war rooms of the biggest advertising agencies in the country.  "how can we make these aristocrat assholes look benevolent?" the account exec swoons.  "how 'bout a pack of lies emphasizing the wonders these benevolent brothers do?"

i say, "fuck the koch brothers," but then they are filthy rich so they must be righteous priests in the money theology game, the worship of the great god moolah.  money is the koch brothers' god; hell, money is the god of us all.
