drafts generally fall into two different catergories.  the short, around 16 hands, stocky "farm chuck" type that is wide and flat.  the taller, 17+ hands, narrower hitch type.  we carry products for both sizes. however, some drafts and draft crosses, just don't fit into either category. don't worry, we can help you too!  do you own a drafty horse, like a friesian or a gypsy?  we can help you too!  quarter horse, mustang, and twh owners with a hard to fit horse, we can help you too!  we have searched high and low, and we have gathered many hard to find draft items. feel free to ask questions, or give suggestions for products you wished we already carried. we love getting pictures of your drafts wearing our products
please send them, they might end up on drafttack.  just make sure we have the horse's and your names.  a little interesting information about your wonderful horse may get printed, too, if you tell us.
