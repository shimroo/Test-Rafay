thank you so much for teaching me your side posture pull this past weekend at the seminar. i have been practicing chiropractic for 21 years now, and it is an honor to be one of your students. i appreciate everything you have done for the chiropractic profession. your lifetime of dedication to gonstead and to the seminars has made a profound difference in many people’s lives, including my own.
