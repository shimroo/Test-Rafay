easton's beach repair information
â€‹Â  take the survey!Â Â 

as one of the cityâ€™s most popular attractions, easton's beach has been a centerpiece of newport's summers for generations. however over the years the site has experienced a considerable amount of development and destruction. reimagined time and again, eastonâ€™s beach has had many iterations, at one point featuring a rollercoaster, saltwater pool, boardwalk, and an ornate spired pavilion similar to those found along the coastlines of new york and new jersey.

what's remained constant is that mother nature has always had other designs, with storm after storm taking its toll and reshaping both the landscape and the amenities that newporters have enjoyed.

with the snack bar and carousel building recently taken down, and funding approved as part of the 2024 infrastructure bond, the city is once again looking to chart a new vision for the beach, with sea level rise and resilience at its core.

if you're interested in learning more about the current state of the beach and would like to help shape its future, then please be sure to visit www.cityofnewport.com/futurebeach to get involved.
