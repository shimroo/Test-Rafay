testimonials 










						steven laird & his legal staff were always diligently supportive with their professional staff! this was an exceedingly drawn-out case lasting close to three years. stephen articulately met every challenge from the defense’s legal counsel. i am grateful to have contracted stephen’s law firm! 					


former clientinjury victim 






						i could not have been happier with steve laird and his firm. i had lost my wife of almost forty-four years in a horrific auto accident. a well-respected ft. worth attorney, who is a personal friend, referred me to steve. he felt steve was one of the very best in the country at handling cases such as mine. strictly because of his endorsement, we chose steve. 					


former clientinjury victim 






						my case went all the way to trial and the attorneys on the other side battled against us every step of the way, but steve fought harder. in my opinion, steve’s experience in trial, his hard work, and his wisdom made the difference.  

steve is also a genuinely caring person. he puts forth the effort to check in on you throughout the process to make sure you are okay. he is honest and i believe that he really cares about his clients. 					


former clientinjury victim 






						my case was not a big case, yet they treated me like i was $1 million case. seth is very personable, compassionate and caring. thank you so much for all your help.
