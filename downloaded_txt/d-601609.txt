dive into the vibrant world of hotel des arts, where contemporary art meets funky vibes! with 51 uniquely designed rooms sprawled across 5 floors, each a canvas of creativity, guests are in for an immersive experience like no other.

nestled in san francisco’s lively french quarter, our hotel is a stone's throw from union square, the financial district, and the bustling gates of chinatown. whether you're here for business or leisure, you're in the heart of the action.

leisure guests will dig the nearby shopping, dining hotspots, art galleries, parks, and even the iconic cable car, all within easy reach.

and for business travelers, major convention centers like the moscone center are just a hop, skip, and a jump away.

forget the traditional front desk—our self check-in/out via smart lock technology ensures your arrival and departure are as smooth as silk. need a caffeine fix? swing by our breakfast room for complimentary tea and coffee. just a heads up, breakfast isn't on the menu, but the good vibes are.

but wait, there's more! get ready to groove at harlan records, our in-house cocktail bar known for its funky beats and killer drinks, adding an extra splash of cool to your stay.

at hotel des arts, it's not just accommodation; it's a funky, artsy adventure right in the heart of san francisco's historical downtown. get ready to paint the town red (or any color you fancy)! welcome to the funky side of hospitality at hotel des arts!
