       just got off the ice... wow! i can dedicate more of my focus  on positioning and tracking the puck rather than basic movements. my  mobility is at least doubled. for garage league goalies this should be an  absolute no-brainer. thanks! ben
        
what's updec. '24

dec.12/24. i posted another video, this one looks at injury, as well as a number of other issues to keep things lively. hope you like it. what's next is part 2 of the second video, but i think i had better post install videos and clean up the site a bit. 
 
btw. i'm not on any social media and do not plan on it. sorry, but there are only so many hours in a day, and they all go towards work. however, my phone number is up above, so don't hesitate to call or text, because i always have time to talk  goaltending or the blade. if i'm on the ice or busy, leave a message and i'll get back to you quickly.

the menu is hiding to the left and floats as you scroll. e-mail me and put 'the blade' in the header so it doesn't sneak into my spam folder.

1 pair of (either) blades is c$30.00, 2 pairs (of either) are c$50.00. the ordering page has  details. for  etransfer, use my  only email address: overdrive@overdriveblade.com

 the second of  my  youtube videos is now up. all of them will  focus on a main topic but sometimes veer off on a goaltending tangent.



video #1 is on the rvh, etc. at 33 minutes.

 video #2 is on injuries, your landing gear, skates, etc. at 55 minutes. 




i've been using overdrive on my cowlingless skates (bauer elites)  and they work great together. i am amazed at how much lower i can get my skate  and still get a good, solid push, or just hold a wide, stable butterfly.  took maybe five minutes to get accustomed to using them. everything works  so well. in addition to getting super easy side-to-side pushes, i've noticed  that my legs are not as tired. was really worried about so many factors with  the new skates, like the thinner blades and a lack of the traditional wraparound  cowlings. your blade's performance was really not a concern, as i was positive  it would help save me from an injury. but the blade really makes it so much  easier to get the push. didn't expect it to help out so well.  installation went without a hitch, and was exactly as you laid out on the  website.
      and later.... it is much more of a game changer on the cowlingless skates. i think it helped more with injury prevention on the older style skates and less of a performance enhancement. on the cowlingless skates, it does help with injury reduction, but the performance help is incredible. i've actually been using the overdrive blade to tease forwards behind the net with the puck. make them think they can beat me to the other post, but i push with both pads low and slam the door shut on them. your product combined with the cowlingless skates and new pads have improved my game immensely.(goaliejim@gmail.com) 




overdrive=mobility+safety
 mobility:
all  i hear now from goalies who haven't used overdrive is that if you wear the new no-cowling skates you don't need  it. when i  launched overdrive, everyone who hadn't tried the  blade was telling me you didn't need it. they were guessing. they were wrong then.  they're wrong now.
        you  will always need overdrive because you can never have enough angle of attack.  the new skates removed the cowling and raised the blade, improving the angle  of attack from 45â° down to about 30â°, which is nice but not enough. you  can easily reach that angle by:
âwidening  out to 30â°,
        ârolling  your ankle down to 30â°,
        âangling  your leg down to 30â°,
        âor  by a combination of all 3, which is  what usually happens, leaving you out of edge and needing more. you'll either have  to stop the move or boot out and possibly strain something. 
with  overdrive, you get edge down to about 10â° for solid pushes on every move you make, on your feet or while down. for  decades now, overdrive has been used by thousands of goalies at all levels, from  beginners needing help with their edges right up to pros with extremely  demanding moves.  today, goaltending  has never been so intense, and with forwards always innovating, you can't just  game up, you have to get ahead. be there with overdrive to make the move.



safety:
goaltending is bad for your body. the widening-out   moves  inevitably cause injury because the legs and hips are built  to swing forward and back. goaltending moves go against this natural motion to stress body parts not built for heavy action. for example, the groin muscles are  made to be stabilizers that keep the legs in line, but goaltending forces them to  become  load-bearing and endure constant use. breakdown anywhere from the hips  to the knees will happen because goalies widen out explosively, thousands of times a year. in addition, goalie  skates do not offer secure footing on these moves. as you widen out, the ball of the foot is driven into the ice and can lever the blade up, causing a bootout, a sudden slipping of the foot that widens you even more.
to the right  is a good example of a bootout. it's quick's injury on  oct. 13/16, with his right leg booting  out as he tries to push off while down. the injury ruined his season, and he has not been the same since, with only occasional  flashes of  his all-star form.        goalie injuries   often result from an accumulation  of minor strains, ending with a full-scale injury on a seemingly simple move. here, the bootout  isn't    bad because  not a  lot of weight is on his right leg when  it slides out - he's  on his knees and the left knee is taking most  of his weight. injuries like this are  the  result of a long process, with  the damage having developed   through constant widening out. get a grip.
 overdrive  gives you rock-solid safety by securing  your footing to reduce or even eliminate   bootouts. it also  allows  you to control your widening out and even not to  use it by keeping you on your feet, thereby limiting   the cumulative wear and tear that leads to injury from your core down to your knees. only overdrive protects you  as you widen out.
0verdrive  is still outlawed in the pros, so franchise goalies are still going down, still  having their careers shortened by the same old injuries.
