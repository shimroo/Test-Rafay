books
"there has been plenty written about the darker side of warren's life. 
i think the good outweighs the bad. a lot of people had a lot of wonderful times 
with him.
this book celebrates those times and the man warren was when he was 
not in combat with his demons. his humor and biting wit were a splendid thing 
to be around. the bad may have sold papers and intrigued folks, but the good side 
of wz is far more interesting. people often comment that they wished that the 
media covered more good news and stories of unique humans doing interesting things. 
well, this is one of those good news stories that needs to told, hence, this book. 
warren had a multitude of friends that have countless stories of fun, creative 
and hilarious times with him. this is one of them. i spent a little over five 
years with warren; five years that he says were some of the best days of his life, 
and mine too. after perusing this book you'll have a bit more insight into the 
wonderful, fun loving and complex individual that was warren william zevon. enjoy 
the ride, we did."
