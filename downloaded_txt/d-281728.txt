new electricity choice program to launch in june 2024 for canton residents and businessesclick here for our press releasethe town of canton is pleased to announce the launch of canton electricity choice, a type of group electricity buying program from the town that gives residents and businesses more choice and control over the electricity they buy. canton joins nearly 170 other massachusetts communities that have this type of electricity program, including milton, sharon and walpole.through canton electricity choice and the collective buying power of the community, canton electricity customers will get more of their electricity from renewable sources for a price that is lower than eversource’s current residential basic service price, though future savings compared with eversource cannot be guaranteed. canton received state regulatory approval for the program in december 2023, and the program will launch in june 2024.for additional information on next steps as well as information on canton electricity choice and answers to frequently asked questions, please visit the new program website at cantonelectricitychoice.com or call customer support with the town’s program consultants at 1-844-202-6101.final water bill requestto request a final water bill, please click here to complete the online form and then e-mail a picture of the reading.
