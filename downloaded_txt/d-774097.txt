              teaching!
            

             the portrayal of teacher jaime escalante in the movie, stand and deliver is what inspired me to pursue an academic career. the best part of being a professor is teaching and training the next generation of software developers. i thrive on being creative, providing practical and real world projects, and building an environment of successful learning with industry-pertinent rigor. throughout my career, i have implemented innovative practices including flipping the classroom, detailed weekly checklists, creating instructor-led videos, combining courses, providing cohort experiences, and (most recently) utilizing reflective assessment coupled with an apprenticeship model approach in pursuit of greater student mastery. as educators, we must be committed to constantly improving our courses to benefit student learning.

              reflective assessment
            

            in spring 2022, i piloted a 'reflective assessment' approach in my programming classes coupled with a move to an apprenticeship format in which i provide my solution to every project as a video code review. student success more than doubled. most students felt they learned better than with traditonal methodologies of being graded on assignments and they felt less stress. as the instructor, i loved the enhanced communication with my students.
