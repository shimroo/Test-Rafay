celestrak is now a 
501(c)(3) non-profit
and we need your help. celestrak's mission remains focused on making data
and other resources freely available to the space community to facilitate
understanding of our orbital environment and how to use it safely and
responsibly. we are committed to enhancing our current visualization tools and
upgrading socrates to integrate with those tools. and we hope that many of you,
who share our passion, will be willing to make a small monthly donation to help
us achieve our vision. i look forward to continuing this journey together.
we can't do it without you! even as little as $1/year helps! ‑ t.s. kelso
