    learn about our mission & work
  
























advancing freedom through nonviolent actionthe albert einstein institution (aei) is a nonprofit organization founded by dr. gene sharp in 1983 to advance the study and use of strategic nonviolent action in conflict. for over 40 years, we have been committed to the defense of freedom, democracy and the reduction of political violence through the use of nonviolent action. our goals are to understand the dynamics of nonviolent action in conflicts, explore its policy potential, and communicate this through publications and other multimedia resources, consultations, and educational workshops.
