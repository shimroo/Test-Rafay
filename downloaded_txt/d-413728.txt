                                    activate changed my whole mindset about getting fit. the coaches will adapt the workouts for you. they always make you feel comfortable in whatever you are doing. all i want to do now is to get fitter, stronger and faster and that's all down to this place. thanks guys!

                                    when i crossed the door into activate i was very unfit. brian talked me through what to expect at activate and showed me that i would be able to do a scaled version of whatever the workout was. i joined the prep course programmeme and after a couple of weeks joined regular classes where i always felt welcome and capable and best of all it was fun.

                                    fantastic gym! great facilities and brilliant coaches who are unbelievably welcoming. their knowledge is top quality & second to none. personally, i had never done pt's or anything like crossfit before and i was made to feel welcome & comfortable from the word go.
