news around school














dr. martin luther king jr. peace program
in 1993, grace’s middle school held an assembly to honor the life and legacy of dr. martin luther king jr. during the three plus decades since, the martin luther king jr. peace program, as it has come to be known, has evolved into an interdisciplinary school-wide event featuring performances, assemblies, guest speakers, workshops, artmaking, and service learning opportunities.
