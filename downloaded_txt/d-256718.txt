“
rick watson is a realtor that works for you on every detail of a buy or sell.  he has now worked with me on two property purchases and i will use him every time on real estate matters at the forgotten coast.  he is a fun guy too. 


dave m. - florida




“
jean has been showing me homes and properties for quite some time.  i was unable to make a decision until recently i finally decided on a lot in the plantation on the island and she was right there to help me with every detail.  she and gary have both been great by giving me details of cost of remodeling if i were to purchase a home or building cost if i purchased a lot.  jean handled everything so thoroughly as if she were purchasing for herself.  they are both very patient and knowledgeable which makes the process of searching for that "right spot" way more comfortable.  i can't wait to start building!


anjie w. - albany, georgia




“
this is the second home we have bought through marilyn bean (and mason helped too!).  her knowledge of the island was invaluable to us.  this was especially critical for us as we live out of state, so our time on the island searching for homes was limited.  i would recommend marilyn strongly to everyone!


will f. - mckinney, texas
