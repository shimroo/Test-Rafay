toi opened in 1986 at sunset & gardner in the heart of hollywood's music store district. the food is bangkok homestyle cooking. this thai kitchen is the fastest in town and our chefs are all from thailand.
 
toi serves almost all the top dishes found in thailand.(check out our top 10 hits) we also pioneered an eclectic variety of veggie thai food and special tofu dishes to satisfy the vast crowd of vegetarians in la with something "more" than just a typical dish. we did this over 20 years ago.
 
you'll find our buddha chili is still one of toi's most popular picks! dishes are reasonably priced and orders may be placed to-go or ask for free delivery!
