“bre has introduced me to a new and incredibly effective way of healing from life‘s traumas. i have tried many other methods over the years, including extensive counseling, and i have found the breath work to be most effective in really getting in touch with the intense emotions that accompany the traumas that we all experience in our lifetime, especially buried experiences and childhood traumas. as a result of this quick and intense way of connecting to these emotions, i found myself able to let go, quickly. much of my chronic pain has been alleviated. i find it affective to continue with this healing path, making sure to have sessions at least every three months. bre is incredibly talented and gifted. she is following her chosen path. one is blessed to encounter such a healer.”—gail l.
























“i didn’t know what to expect, (and i could mention that i was in a very fragile state (emotionally/mentally) at this time. bre, with your presence and knowledge i felt safe, relaxed and at ease. i’m so thankful for this, much more than i can express. immediately after our session, that evening and the days to follow i felt a great sense of peace within myself. this is something that surely helped save me. i felt more connected to myself spiritually. i felt clearer in my thoughts. my personal breathwork experience helped me feel calm and content at a time when i was feeling wound up and confused. i felt a natural sense of me slowing down and it was very necessary. something i don’t think i could’ve achieved on my own. it felt good. i’m so grateful for this.”—julie ann
