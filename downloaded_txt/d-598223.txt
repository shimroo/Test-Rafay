        who had survived. instead, i wrote about a survivor who had
        triumphed . . .
        burk survived by reaching deep inside himself to a place he
        never knew existed
        and finding an energy he never knew he had. it is a place he has
        tapped many
        times since the crash. with characteristic courage, enthusiasm,
        and compassion,
        burk shares his story, so that we may find our special place,
        too."

about the author
who is george burk? in 1998, captain george burk's usaf (ret.)
        story of his
        experience as a plane crash and burn survivor, the bridge never
        crosseda
        survivors search for meaning, generated an outburst of praise
        from everyone
        who read it. on may 4, 1970, george was the sole survivor of 14
        air force
        personnel in a military plane crash. he suffered extensive
        burns, and multiple
        internal injuries. this motivational speaker and author returns
        with an-other
        book presenting many of the lessons and principles of life
        learned as a
        survivor and overcomer. george burk is a highly decorated
        military officer
        and public servant who presently resides in scottsdale, arizona.
        he is a
        nationally recognized motivational speaker, trainer and writer
        whose mission is
        to entertain, inform, inspire and persuade. as a plane crash
        and burn
        survivor, george burk shares with you his experiences,
        principles, and values
        you can use on your journey; they are valid and work because
        george uses them
        in his own life. whether you are a professional immersed in a
        search for
        organizational change, excellence, and quality improvement, or
        an individual
        looking for ways to improve your personal life, you will find
        invaluable
        information in captain burk's writings and speeches. in a
        refreshingly straightforward
        and sometimes humorous style, george burk shares his unique
        insights and
        perspectives into effective leadership, meaningful change, core
        values, and
        what it takes to be an effective leader. he offers the
        suggestion, based on his
        unique experiences, that for any change to be effective, it must
        be sequential,
        that is inside outnot outside in. george writes that life is
        filled with joy
        and adversity. it is adversity which is part of lifes test,
        which makes us
        stronger. these adversities include obstacles, challenges and
        sufferings. he
        shares with you the idea that failure is not falling down, but
        staying down.
        the reader will learn the importance of a positive attitude, and
        how honesty,
        integrity and the deeply embedded desire to live play in a
        person's journey
        through life. captain george burk p.o. box 6392 scottsdale az
