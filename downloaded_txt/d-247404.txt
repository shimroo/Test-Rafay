so an unexpected turn of events for this blog, twelve years in: your humble author is the new lead visual designer at cyan! i‚Äôm probably gonna keep this blog going in perpetuity, because why not, but this doesn‚Äôt mean any future posts are officially endorsed by cyan or something.‚Ä¶or are they üòé(they are not)
