about me





robert drake


philadelphia, pennsylvania
everything old is good again.

i began spinning the new wave sounds when they were new wave sounds , working in various underground clubs in philadelphia during the gritty era of 1981-1990. from off-radar spots like the love club to commanding nights at philly's premier alternative hotspots the kennel club, omni's and a few special nights at danceteria in nyc, the rock of the 80s became my passion.

since 2003, i've helped shape philly's nightlife scene by introducing the genre to a whole new generation of ears with my monthly sex dwarf party every first friday at fluid to hosting land of the lost; a monthly 4-hour block of the rock of the 80s on wxpn-fm in philadelphia, to bringing authentic 80s bands back to the city for live concerts... it's all about the music!
