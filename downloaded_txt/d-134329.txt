“klorane strives to sustainably preserve natural environments as we harness their power for our dermo-cosmetic brand. our continued partnership with rainforest rescue allows us to deploy our group climate strategy in australia and is an excellent demonstration of klorane's environmental commitment at a local level. we are proud to contribute to the valiant conservation efforts to protect the daintree rainforest, and promote tangible change in rejuvenating native plants and wildlife and supporting first nations communities in care and ownership of their traditional lands” 
laurent-emmanuel saffré, ceo, klorane australia

“we sleep so much better at night knowing that we have partners like rainforest rescue doing so much amazing work to protect our rainforest and planet. our customers continue to be inspired by the difference you’re making and thank us for donating to your work.” 
mike halligan, co-founder, scratch

“partnering with rainforest rescue has become more than an extension of our environmental mission—it has allowed us to amplify the positive impact we can achieve. while our core focus remains on sustainable innovations within our products and operations, working with rainforest rescue lets us step beyond our own boundaries. through this collaboration, we contribute to lasting conservation and support credible, impactful rainforest restoration efforts. together, we’re not just protecting land; we’re preserving biodiversity and creating a legacy for future generations.” 
richard fine, founder & sustainability director, biopak

“i think business is about a lot more than just making money. a big part of it for me is to make sure we are helping to make the world a better place. 
our customers love that their purchase is making a tangible difference to the world around them.” 
justin snyder, founder, forest super foods

“we’re a global travel business operating in all parts of the globe. more than that, however, is the fact that critical wildlife areas know no border, and so nor do we when searching for strong, impactful projects in support of nature and biodiversity. several of our travel brands, contiki, aat kings and adventure world, have passionate teams based in australia with long histories of doing business there, and so it all came together to be a wonderful fit. our commitment to reaching net zero as a group means that alongside our focus on decarbonization, we must prioritize and support solutions that work with nature’s own technologies to mitigate climate change. we are so proud to be able to support the restoration of the daintree rainforest and its wildlife corridors through rainforest rescue’s efforts.” 
shannon guihan, chief sustainability officer & head of treadright

the cassowary’s role in the dispersal of rainforest seeds is one of a great significance here in the daintree 🌱🌱.⁠⁠once the fruit has passed through the birds digestive system, most of the fleshy part has been removed from the seed leaving it ready to germinate in a lovely pile of compost 💩. ⁠⁠one such fruit is from the blushwood tree (fontainea picrosperma)🌲. the fruit it toxic for humans to eat but there have been trials occurring in the medical field regarding the potential healing properties of this species.⁠⁠many amazing plants and trees rely on cassowaries, and these majestic birds need plants and trees to sustain themselves. one simply cannot exist without the other 💚.⁠⁠do you know any other cassowary food trees? comment below 👇️.⁠⁠📷: g. sankowsky⁠⁠#southerncassowary #daintree #daintreerainforest #daintreebirds #rainforestgardener #farnorthqueensland #rainforestguardian #cassowary #fnq #tropicalrainforest #australianrainforest #ancientrainforest #plantmoretree #protectrainforestsforever #supportnotforprofits #donate #dinobirds #treesofinstagram #treesmatter @birdlifeoz @birdsinbackyards @birdsofaustralia

🌍🌳💧 world wetlands day 2025: protecting wetlands for our common future 💧🌳🌍⁠⁠today, we pause to honour the critical role wetlands play in our planet`s health. from providing clean water to supporting biodiversity, wetlands are essential ecosystems - yet, according to the secretariat of the convention on wetlands, we’ve lost nearly 90% of them since the 1700s. it`s time to take action before it’s too late 🌱💧.⁠⁠in regions like the daintree, the effects of environmental degradation are already being felt. recently, david white, founder of @solar_whisper , shared a firsthand account of how rising floodwaters are eroding the riverbanks and wiping out vital wildlife habitats.⁠⁠this world wetlands day, let’s reflect on the urgent need for action. from local efforts to global commitments, it`s clear that protecting wetlands is essential for both nature and communities 🌳🌍.⁠⁠👉 read david’s powerful reflections on the daintree and how we can all play a part in restoring these vital ecosystems www.rainforestrescue.org.au/beyond-the-banks-daintree-river (link in bio).⁠⁠📷: martin stringer ⁠⁠#worldwetlandsday #wetlandsconservation #daintree #climateaction #biodiversity #ecotourism #rainforestrescue #protectourplanet #sustainablefuture #wetlandsmatter #daintreerainforest #wettropics

tucked away in the remote northeast of tasmania, forest lodge is an untouched pocket of ancient cool temperate rainforest—over 3,500 km away from the daintree rainforest in far-north queensland, yet equally deserving of protection 🌏. the reasons for rescuing this property back in 2011 were eerily similar to those affecting the daintree at the time. it’s these parallels that continue to inspire us, and why forest lodge remains a well-loved (if a little distant) part of rainforest rescue’s mission 💚.home to endangered species like the tasmanian devil and spotted-tailed quoll, forest lodge has been safeguarded thanks to supporters of rainforest rescue 🌳.learn more: www.rainforestrescue.org.au/left-out-in-the-wilderness (link in bio) 💚.📷: lesley nicklason#rainforestrescue #forestlodge #tasmania #conservation #protectnature #wilderness #climateaction #biodiversity #ancientrainforest #endangeredspecies #fromdaintreetotasmania #treesaretheanswer
