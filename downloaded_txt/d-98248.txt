            attentionever since the original and "only authentic" tintype of billy the 
            kid sold for 2.3 million dollars in 2011, there has been an epidemic 
            of alleged photographs of billy the kid. this plague is just a vain 
            attempt for people to make money. it takes more than just "looking 
            like" billy the kid, there has to be strong documented provenance to 
            support the alleged photo. these purported photos have not been 
            confirmed by real billy the kid historians and experts because they 
            lack the provenance and the historical facts to support it. 
            yet these purported photos are being 
            presented to the public as authenticated based entirely on opinion 
            and false information by unaccredited parties. do not be fooled by these bogus 
            claims. the only known photograph in existence of billy the kid is 
            the one above.

no other historical figure from the old west has stirred up more controversy 
    and eluded historians and biographers than billy 
    the kid alias william h. bonney. this young man in his short life has established his place in 
    history and legend, but there is more to the myth there's the man, which in 
    my opinion is far more interesting. on this website you'll find plenty of 
    information and learn who billy 
    the kid really was and how he became a legend in his own 
    time.
