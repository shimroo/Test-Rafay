    an archive of lds history
 
for several years, the demand for rare and out-of-print lds history books has continually increased. older writings have not only been unaffordable for the average reader but have been difficult to locate. sensing the mounting demand for early historical church literature, archive publishers has collected (and continually adds to) a library of lds history books such as doctrinal, historical and faith-promoting writings for the layman as well as the researcher. these lds history books are an excellent addition to the home library, those who home school, and anyone interested in early lds writings.

   personal accounts of history
our selection of lds history books tell the stories of the lds church's growth through its formative years from the vantage point of those who lived through the events. they are "first-hand" accounts by the makers of history - not scholarly syntheses of other writings. these accounts are generally more personalized and told with greater passion. likewise, doctrinal expositions were often written by early latter-day saints who stood close to the prophet joseph smith and amplify their initial understandings and concerns.
