new research from rhode island provides new insights into female woodcock nesting habits


for more than a decade, our team has focused on studying male scolopax minor (american woodcock) in rhode island. during this time, we recognized a significant gap in knowledge about female s. minor, particularly regarding nest site selection and brood survival, due to a lack of data from this region.

tracking barred owls night and day in baton rouge: why studying the entire diel cycle matters for understanding bird habitat


it’s strange to think that a paper about strix varia (barred owl) in louisiana would begin in jamaica more than 15 years ago. but that’s where this story starts.
