i’m robert arthur, and i’d like to show you my home… 




my harbour island. 










 

























my ancestors helped build this place. i grew up  in new york, miami, and the bahamas. i was blessed with early success in tv and film. when it came time to raise a family, my wife and i were drawn back to harbour island… drawn by village life, historic homes, and a quirky but friendly mix of people.
 























we run arthur’s bakery, where we’re known for our key lime tarts and jalapeno cheese bread. but i’m also the local rep for coldwell banker realty. so this may be the only place you can buy banana pancakes and a beach house.
