vision for the future
 
 
"sow for yourselves righteousness,
reap the fruit of unfailing love,
and break up your unploughed ground;
for it is time to seek the lord,
until he comes and showers
righteousness on you."
 
 
hosea 10:12 (niv)
 
 
mission is an essential part of the 
christian life, it is the compassion
of a loving god reaching out to a 
needy world, evangelism is mission's
cutting edge, we are either doing it,
planning it, living it, evaluating 
it or dying for the lack of it. taking
the good news of jesus christ relevently
to the people's of the world is a 
crucial aspect of the churches existence, 
it is just as vital as feeding the
hungry and rescuing the oppressed.
therefore, we should not apologise
for its message but we should deliver
it with tact, integrity and 
conviction, respecting people's right
to respond to it positively or
negatively.  to sit in silence is
not an option.

	 encounters with jesus: writing in the sand
	 
    




i am absolutely thrilled that my book, encounters with jesus: writing in the sand, is now available for sale on amazon. 

http://www.amazon.co.uk/encounters-jesus-writing-sand-ebook/dp/b00f8g0a2o/ref=la_b00ff4jh2s_1_1?s=books&ie=utf8&qid=1380184681&sr=1-1

 this is the preface from the book:



this book began as a set of bible studies in the late 1990s.
it was designed to be used as a set of daily talks while i was the guest
speaker on a variety of summer and winter christian holidays. thanks to the
holiday company i learned to sail and ski but more importantly these stories of
jesus were received with enthusiasm and excitement. it is my hope that in
publishing these stories they will enable others to share in the joy of
encountering jesus.
this book is aimed at: 
·        those who want to go slightly
deeper into gospel stories but are not sure how.
·        those who want to meditate and
imagine that they were really there. to smell the salt in the air and hear the
banter of the disciples.
·        providing resources for
preachers, leaders and small groups.
each chapter is broken down into three sections; the story,
study and questions.  i had in mind something that would bring the bible
alive, empower discussion and provide thought provoking questions that were
open ended, accessible to all and at times be slightly uncomfortable
i hope and pray that this book will help and challenge young
and old to look again at the gospels and in so doing find refreshment and
direction.
i have enclosed a detailed bibliography at the rear of this
book which reflects not only my influences but also the period in which this
book was conceived and developed. 


 the paperback is only £5 in the uk, but the us $ price is very reasonable too.
