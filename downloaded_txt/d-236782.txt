“...the power of puccini came through — the closing moments hit home very effectively — and that this production (boasting a diverse cast and attracting a diverse audience, btw) reconfirmed the continuing need, desire and potential for opera in the community.”

building community through opera 



opera baltimore is thrilled to be in its 16th season of fully-staged opera, concert opera, civic practice programs, free community concerts, and educational programs for all ages.



who we are        opera baltimore creates a thrilling, meaningful shared experience between our artists and audiences. our vision to build community through opera takes us everywhere from the large opera stage to outdoor venues, and everywhere in between. founded in 2009 as baltimore concert opera, the company was renamed opera baltimore in 2022, establishing a new commitment to expanded offerings which include fully staged opera in addition to our already successful concert operas, audience development and education programs.       dedicated to diversity, equity and inclusion, and recognizing that a person’s first time at the opera is as important as their thousandth, opera baltimore goes beyond artistic excellence to focus on the experience the patron has from the moment they buy a ticket until the moment they leave the theater. opera baltimore thrives, regularly selling out performances. our track record of success, paired with a commitment to strong organizational structure and top quality artistry, set the stage for continued advancement.



“treat yourself to the unfiltered beauty of the human voice.”
