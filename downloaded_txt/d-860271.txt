			since 1997, disc dogs in southern california (dâ²i.s.c.) is a group of disc 
			dog fanatics whose main purpose is to have fun while promoting 
			canine disc as a great way to keep family pets happy, healthy, and 
			in shape. we organize a series of informal playdays and clinics 
			throughout the year where our members and prospective members 
			exchange training ideas. we also hold several competitions which are 
			a great place to have fun and strut your stuff. we perform a variety 
			of shows for dog related charities, humane societies, sporting 
			events, and schools throughout the year. several of our members are 
			regional, national, and world finalists in competition, so our 
			events are a great place to learn the ropes from some of the top 
			teams in the country. check out our event schedule, and we hope to 
			see you at the park soon!
