class creator has developed a great platform to help build your class reunion site. i wish that they would accommodate other payment methods for classmates beyond credit cards, cash or check ... specifically zelle payments and paypal.

we built our site to reconnect our class for a 55th reunion. we've decided to keep it going and try to connect even more of our alumni for more than just a reunion but to rekindle friendships and enable new ones. classcreator is simple to use and feature rich. i can't wait to see how it evolves.

class creator provides the tools and framework necessary for us to host our own class-run website. we are free to create our own content, while the detail classmate listings and profiles are largely handled by the underlying structure. class creator also provides tools for event management such as class reunions, including financial tools and ticket sales.

site is easy to negotiate and construct. adding separate event pictures from our coffee & conversation sessions needs improvement so suggestions would be appreciated. thanks for your comments, dan clark, web site guy

so far we have been very pleased with classcreator. we did a lot of research before choosing to host our site here, and we were sure we'd be satisfied before we even started to build. for administrators, the forum and the support are both excellent. thank you for what you do.
