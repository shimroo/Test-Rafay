first christian church of granbury, 
                texas


 





overdrive productions inc., recently 
                  replaced an existing sound system 
                  with bose 402 series loudspeakers 
                  and bose mb4 subs. the previous sound 
                  system at first christian church of 
                  granbury detracted from the custom 
                  stonework and the cross. the new bose 
                  sound system sounds one hundred times 
                  better and the new speakers do not 
                  detract from anything. first christian 
                  church of granbury is thrilled with 
                  the life-like sound of the new bose 
                  sound system and also love the way 
                  they compliment their beautiful sanctuary.

dear steve:
 in behalf of the 
              first christian church in granbury i am 
              taking this means of thanking you and 
              your associates for a job well done in 
              furnishing and installing the new sound 
              system in our chancel and sanctuary. the 
              professionalism and pleasantness exhibited 
              was exemplary throughout and appreciated 
              by all of us. -
 cordially, 
              a. warren morey aia

dear steve,
as we get close to 
              finishing up redoing the sanctuary sound 
              system i wanted to write you and let you 
              you know what a great job overdrive has 
              done for first united methodist church 
              dallas. when we started this project a 
              year ago we didn't know who to use. our 
              experience with sound companies in the 
              past has been less that stellar! you did 
              what you said that you would do, you came 
              in on budget and you showed up on time. 
              these are qualities that most sound companies 
              don't have. thank you for your advise 
              and help. we will use overdrive to do 
              all our work and when we need to buy equipment 
              we will go thru you. you have become a 
              friend. thanks rob
