sd, la, lv recap





corny but it was a life changing experience. most especially, i got to bond with my cousin kris whom i call "the guru" and i wouldn't change a thing. fun from day 1 to 5. 3 cities in 4 1/2 days. had one of the best nights of my life. ever.wednesday, 4/1--the flight was long since i didn't sleep during it. landed in sd, kris picked me up. ate a big ass carne asada burrito from an authentic mexican spot. nothing much to it at first but we headed up to la that night. took about an hour and a half? we stopped by silverlake first and got some jollibee. they had an actual jollibee restaurant there. how g is that. ate some spicy chickenjoy because the one in woodside didn't have any! ate, figured out where to stay at and did so economically of course. ended up at the ramada in koreatown. got ready and skated to the sunset strip. saw places i used to just see on e! like the viper room, the roxy, whiskey-a-gogo and the likes. it was a wednesday so it must not have been jumping. skated to la cienega, tried to get in to this club called "area" but didn't. guestlist only. went to some bar but didn't really dig the vibe. drove around and ended up guess where.........................................not just any old titty bar but the best strip club ever. all natural, mostly latinas, except i wanted a lap dance from this half german/half filipino woman. but some douche had to snag her and get up in her office. nonetheless, it was fun-----drinking red bulls with the guru. nowhere else to skate to plus parking was bad so went back to the telly, did some pushups, watched the suns lose, and called it a night.thursday, 4/2--woke up, decided to pass on the 5 dollar continental breakfast rip off, skated to denny's a block down. it was surprisingly chilly. housed the food down and thought of what to do. hence, went back then skated to fairfax and rosewood aka the infamous streetwear block blah blah blah. can't front i wanted to see what i used to just see on blogs. got there, about half of the stores that were there were gone---i guess that industry ain't recession proof. wanted to see slb but i guess that closed down too??? the hundreds was small, wasn't like i was gonna buy anything there bc their shit is wack but i enjoy the blog nonetheless. peeped supreme la. nothing like ny. afterwards, we headed up to hollywood. thought i'd go see the walk of fame and mann's chinese theater. got there, saw hollywood and vine. didn't really like it. saw the hollywood sign but that was the only highlight. found out the following day that hannah montana was gonna have a premiere there. damn it i missed out.................not. didn't really get to go to the better part where all the celebs hang out at so......la sucked imo. wasn't sure what the big deal was. dipped up outta there and headed up to las vegas. the drive through the desert blew...it was tedious as hell. my foot must've slept a couple times. plus i couldn't speed up. but waahhh didn't complain.--vegas: got some carl's jr. ate my cousin's house in lv. chilled with the cousins that i had missed. chilled in the cut since it was such a long drive. by 9 we headed out to the strip. drank henny and pepsi. not a problem. i forgot where the tao nightclub is but we went there after walking along the strip. no line. paid 20 no biggie. got in but it wasn't open yet. went all the way up to tao beach. place was nice. the restroom was far. i was blasted already. i'm an angry drunk. people were itching to dance since no one was politicking. club finally opened, went downstairs. the fun began. drank some more. and all i can say is: las vegas shows mad love! canadians, some from cali, from the air force, some from back east, some from vegas and of course, rode ass and we couldn't remember not one name. got plastered further nothing new. got pissed bc they played reggae in the other room. ended the night with some jack in the box. good night.friday, 4/3--no hangovers. ate some ribs for breakfast, that was the theme during the trip: ate as unhealthy as possible. had about 6 burgers the whole trip. anyway, we chilled for a bit and picked up my cousin from school. me and kris went up to where the students were at... haha looking like some pedophiles wtf. bounced, went to the jollibee in las vegas and had a burger. there were homos in front of us true story. they were just flaming. got done with that, went to undefeated on paradise road. some streetwear thugs stared me down, sizing me up, acting like they was about to do something to the kid. (notice how i just got hood all of a sudden?) whatevs. nothing happened i walked in front of them. waah. went home and slept. the weather was nippy as hell but it was the best nap weather. henny and pepsi again nothing new. visited the palms wanted to check out the hart and huntington tat place and it turned out it was closed until spring. waah. headed up to the strip all tips. walked around and sight-saw. finally went to pure and saw a goddamn crowd outside. we go fall in line to where the guestlist people were bc we had done so 2 nights before. but the fuckers decide to let the general admission people in? although the ladies had their own line which was wassup. me and guru wait there, talked to this couple from long island and these 2 broads with tats. at this point, we weren't sure if we were even getting in. that is until, i met this woman who just happened to be with her friends. we found out her gf was having a bachelorette party and they had a reservation. so we met all her gf's who just happened to be all southern belles from north carolina! haha jokingly she asked which team i was rooting for for the final four, and of course i had to say tar heels. not a problem they were all nice about getting us in. chilled in the vip section where the girls were. next thing you know the pussycat dolls perform. what the? shit was fun. so we go leave the girls at first to scope out the dance floor, had some vodka nothing new, danced with a few. kris started talking to these canadians who were bad as hell. coincidentally they were having a bachelorette thing too. the guru aka kris ended up giving the bride-to-be a lap dance. lol. ended up partying with them for a bit. some douches had to try throwing salt in our game so they left while we did too. went back to the nc girls. starting pollying nothing new. hiphop songs came on, particularly "doin it" by ll cool j and lo and behold, the nc girls knew the lyrics! did i mention they were white??? not hood white, but like j. crew white. hahaha i had a blast!!! they knew every single hiphop song that came on! even montell jordan's "this is how we do it" that junk made my night. one of them even told me that her favorite group was once bone thugs. hahaha. so we party with them, everyone was looking at us bc we were doing our thing. even the girls next to our table were trying to party with us hahaah bc danced with all the girls. we had to, i mean they got us in. at some point, these douches were trying to get in the joint and they begged us to keep them away which we did haha. the bachelorette had fun since kris gave 'em lap dances and got plastered. then they all had to skate, but they were all sweet and thanked me and the guru for partying with them. mission cleared. drank the left over vodka and skated towards the other end of the club. danced and danced nothing new. the guru bagged this chick from the les. supposed to go to a titty bar but her friend was acting up. so that was that. went home, jack in the box. the end.saturday, 4/4--not hung over again. got up. said peace to the fam. got some in-n-out finally. headed back to cali. the drive wasn't that bad. decided to stop by laguna beach before going back to san marcos. got to laguna, and simply put: the place was amaze. the beach was just dope, the sand, the vibe, the girls of course. it was too pretty. haha "crusing lang parang walang problema" (crusing like we ain't have no problems) left lb didnt see lc though. or lo. haha. went back to san marcos for a second. then left for pacific beach which is equivalent to hoboken but with better parties. picked up the best girl to party with francesca aka "vegassssss" got started early with vodka tonics. must've had 11 all night. danced with the girls nothing new. met this dope hawaiian broad with an outline of a half sleeve. cutie. met these thai girls....who didn't speak a word of english. wtf? this older woman was digging the guru hard as hell to the point of following him. and some chick came up to us and whispered to both of us saying we were cute ahahhaha. whatevs nig. must be the swag. had a blast with fran. she's a trooper. but didn't get drunk? what the? got some carl's jr. in the end. slept over fran's place on carlsbad. woke up after 2 hours and watched twilight the rest of the night. it turned out good. what the?sunday, 4/5--waaaahh last day. left carlsbad for san marcos. all my stuff were packed anyway so we dipped out. went to national city where all the filipinos were at. ate at jollibee. not much over there. went downtown sd. not much over there neither. until we got to coronado..that beach was just as awesome as lb. the houses were nice as hell just like the weather. had about an hour left, so we went to some mall before i got dropped off at the airport. the whole time the guru and i bonded and had heart to heart talks and funny tagalog sayings like "yari" and "kabihasnan" haha. sad to leave the kid but i think im making the move out west. during the flight marley and me was the movie and it turned out to be really good. a nigga had to shed some tears ahahah i really tried to fight it. it wasn't only me! it was these 2 other dudes infront of me haha. ahhh the flight was long and now i'm back. wahhhh. it was all worth it.peace.*for pics, check out facebook.

the truth will set you free





it's not emo, but my heart's voice inunciatesthe very translation of my vague emotions: tough to punctuatethus it frustrates, me as to why this thing has become too much weightfor me everyday, my actions illustratethe passiveness, the looking back to the past successyet now i've turned into someone passionless.lookout for what the current fashion isi wear it on my sleeve, though i haven't gone completelysadomasochist.can't stand the arrogance, and the resonancecuz what the fuck are you frontin for?it's a rhetorical question to my ego that's got me wanting more.it's something that not one can cure,something that i won't ignore,like a drug addict, i need something pure.fine at 40:

time for another flog





--as much as i didn't like the commute in high school, i truly miss those days. mostly, the basketball practices...and how easy everything was. my friend u.g. and i enjoy reminiscing on those fun days...cheating on exams, the weird people in school, the girls, the basketball games, the people we were really cool with, the girls, the bus rides to games, lunch time, how he and i met, the talent show when we sang 'water runs dry' to our then girlfriends, the girls, the dances, the teachers, choir practice, punk city, the parties of course, and so on. i enjoyed every single minute of them but i don't intend to relive it."it ain't over til' it's over" --lenny kravitz

just because i felt like it





--this morning i was watching "the view," don't ask why...i didn't feel like watching anymore maury or sportscenter. anyway, whoopi goldberg, sherri shepherd, joy behar, and elizabeth hasselbeck were talking about the obama and hillary and their current beef. i noticed that whoopi, joy, and sherri seemed to always gang up on little ol' liz...probably cuz republican oozes out of her pores. whoopi is smart, she seems to know what she is saying. joy is comical, although in denial about being democrat and pro-obama. sherri...wtf? all she did was announce. elizabeth for the most part was vocal about her support for mccain.....so why all the hate? it just didn't seem fair what these broads were doing to her. i mean, how can you hate on this:--on another note, vh1's miss rap supreme is kind of entertaining. all i can say is, yoyo still got it going on....mmhmm.
