xevision - your smart choice











xevision high-intensity led and hid  lighting products for aerospace, military and industry
 

manufactured using premium quality d1s bulbs, xevision proprietary ballasts, and metal reflectors.
leds and led optics are cutting-edge european and usa products.



hid forward lighting  for  aerospace & aviation

                    	we are proud to present our line of xevision  hid forward lighting products for aircraft - fixed-wing a/c and helicopters alike - the perfect match of safety and performance. all of our aviation hid d1s bulb systems and xestrikeâ¢ digital ballasts  comply with do-160e standards (emc and hf interference limits).
                    

                    	our forward hid xenon lamps and lighting systems are suitable to replace existing exterior landing and taxi aircraft lighting systems. we offer hid conversion kits for incandescent lamps which are 'plug & play hid kits' as well as special oval and rectangular shaped designs for extremely small spaces as in wingtips and wing leading edges. all lamps are available in 12/14 vdc and 24/28 vdc with standard 35, 50, and application-specific 75 w lamp output power and feature parabolic or free-form metal reflectors.
                    

                    	hand in hand with our hid landing lights and hid taxi lights goes our patented xevision pulsing system using xevision's proprietary xestrikeâ¢ ballast series and our xepulseâ¢ 1 or xepulseâ¢ 2 pulsing module. it allows reliable pulsing or wig-wag and dimming with any combination of one or more of our hid landing and taxi lights without degrading bulb life.
                    a perfect and indispensable solution to  help 'see and be seen'. we believe: the sun is our only competitor.

led and hid lighting  for industry & military

                    	xevision hid xenon lamp and lighting systems are well established as a perfect solution in many extreme environments. they are used in search & rescue operations, border patrol support, and workspace applications. military and law enforcement agencies make use of our powerful hid lighting systems - airborne as well as ground-based.
					

our hid lamps find a niche in railroad and boating transportation, contributing to substantially increased safety at night as well as daytime, "see and be seen" not only applies to aviation.
