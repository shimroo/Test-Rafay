boys' night out
from the soulful hits of otis redding to such classics as "summertime," the music of boys’ night out has been putting east tennessee audiences on their feet for more than thirty years.boys’ night out was organized in 1983 with the goal of recreating the authentic performances of the rhythm and blues (r&b) music that had been extremely popular with teenagers in the south during the late 1960s. boys’ night out's first public performance was at the oak ridge azalea festival on may 5, 1984, and they have played a busy schedule ever since.the 13-member group brings a new richness to the classics of the mid-1960s with their original arrangements of the hits of such superstars as james brown, the temptations, the four tops, the blues brothers, sam & dave, legendary roadhouse rocker delbert mcclinton, and the late great otis redding, to name a few. the band features three lead vocalists, and the group’s horn section includes three trumpets, three saxophones, and a trombone.boys’ night out have established a loyal following among audiences looking for the very best in soul, rhythm & blues, and carolina beach music.
