learn cantonese! 




  this site contains thousands of print-friendly chinese reference sheets, tests,
  revision aids and a unique
chinese dictionary called cantodict. it is aimed to help you speak, read and write hong kong
  chinese.  as such,
  the pronunciation given is not mandarin 'pinyin' or 'putonghua', it is cantonese
  'lshk' or 'jyutping'.  
having said that, many of the sheets,  flashcards
  and  tests
  will also help you learn mandarin, as chinese writing is the same in both
  mandarin and cantonese. also cantodict can run in both cantonese and mandarin
  modes.  
  please see our discussion forums to either ask questions or help answer existing ones.

    well time has flown and lots has happened with my life.
    
    i am now a proud father and as such site updates have been impacted i'm afraid!
    
    cantodict is still going strong though and i hope to find time for some useful updates soon.
    
    on a less positive note, we are currently undergoing a spam attack, so please bear with us while we try and deal with this.

re: what it meant to be cantonese in china and america, 1850–1900 12:50 by ♭♫   [+-][www.nyhistory.org]the "chinese american" aimed to educate and inform the chinese american community about the economic and political happenings of their city and the world, information that chinese immigrants were not privy to due to the language barriers. in the 4th section of the newspaper, with the heading “the confession from chinese american publisher,” wong describes the purpose of this newspaper, which is to establish “communication between chinese and americans.” wong followed through with his promises made in the 4th section of the newspaper and published several articles relaying important information about the world to the ny chinese american community. for instance, the 6th section of the newspaper, with the heading “the situation in new york,” provides statistics regarding the number of certain chinese-owned businesses, wong details that “there are about ten grocery stores, five or six pharmacies, and four or five hotels.” wong provides an optimistic outlook on the economic future of chinese immigrants in new york, boldly proclaiming that new york “will reach the level of hong kong and canton.” in a city where chinese immigrants were often alienated from local markets, the article highlights the successes of chinese-owned businesses and outlines a hopeful future. to give readers a more worldwide perspective, the 5th section of the newspaper, with the heading “telegram from hong kong,” explores japan’s imperialistic endeavors and its takeover of the ryukyu islands with the help of western powers. chinese immigrants were almost entirely cut off from international news if they did not know how to read english, and wong's newspaper served as one of the only gateways to learn about critical happenings overseas.the "chinese american" provided chinese immigrants access to local and global news in chinese characters. wong revolutionized the chinese immigrant experience by making the news accessible for all chinese immigrants, while they were being oppressed by legislation and in the media. the newspaper provided chinese immigrants an outlet to be informed of their local communities in the face of being discriminated against in every facet of their life in the united states. wong even was the first to coin the term “chinese american” which is still used to identify a group of over 5 million people in the united states.
re: a glimpse of washington dc chinatown 12:30 by ♭♫   [+-][georgetownvoice.com]“revitalization” or a “death sentence”? activists and residents push back on city’s chinatown plans“we want to make it clear that we are not against increased investment in chinatown. but the city has made absolutely no plans to invest in community alongside all of these investments they’re making to developers and new businesses,” he said. “they have said nothing about how these businesses would be asian, asian-owned or owned by residents, or that they would hire residents.”
re: "lie flat" movement has spread to business owners...it is a passive resistance movement against the ccp 10:15 by ♭♫   [+-]the "lie flat" movement is spreading within hong kong.[youtu.be]in one july 2024 survey, over a third of hong kong youths who are not working or studying had no intention to find a job. there is a term for them - neets - people not in education, employment or training. at the same time, a growing number are content with part-time or gig work, eschewing longer-term stability. the youth's ennui can be linked to hong kong's economic doldrums, high real estate prices and political apathy.but there is also a mismatch between gen zs’ perception of labour and hong kong's prevailing work culture. over 40% of young workers often think about quitting. are hong kong's youth checking out of work, and what will that mean for the special administrative region's future?
re: racism..experiences anyone who would like to share? 08:11 by ♭♫   [+-][youtu.be]asian men are one of the few remaining people society can mock and discriminate against without any meaningful pushback - and it's no accident. several unique yet interconnected factors have been normalizing rage and racism against asian men for over a century. and in this video, we will expose the key factors perpetuating hate against asian men (such as aunty lus, boba liberals and uncle chans) and come up with a plan to empower asian men. it's time we asian men stopped being everyone's punching bag.

re: cantonese opera listed as world heritage 00:55 by ♭♫   [+-]wencun is in taishan county.[www.sixthtone.com]spring festival operas tend to be light affairs, telling stories of reunion and good fortune. but for their performers — tasked with preserving their art in the hollowed-out countryside — they’re serious business.sixth tone’s wu huiyuan went to wencun, guangdong province, to document the artists and communities who are keeping the traditional cantonese new year alive.
re: what it meant to be cantonese in china and america, 1850–1900 02/15/2025 by ♭♫   [+-][www.theguardian.com]wong’s case is not entirely a story of legal triumph for a harshly maligned racial group. even after the supreme court ruling, the government continued to deny his citizenship. in 1901, less than four years after the decision, an immigration official in el paso arrested wong, who had been in mexico, and tried to deport him on grounds of violating the chinese exclusion act, according to frost’s research. it took wong four months to prove his citizenship and return home. in 1910, wong’s oldest son was detained, and soon deported, upon arriving in san francisco because immigration officials refused to believe he was related to wong. decades later, wong himself returned to china, though some of his descendants still live in california.quote♭♫

[abc7news.com]even though wong kim ark was born in the u.s., his citizenship was questioned.in 1895, as he was coming back from a visit to china, he was detained at the port of san francisco."they say, look, you might have been born in san francisco, but that doesn't make you a u.s. citizen. yes, black people, white people, everybody else who's born in the united states is a u.s. citizen, but not chinese. so, he's kept out," said gabriel chin, professor of law at uc davis.wong kim ark was in his early 20s at the time.
re: what it meant to be cantonese in china and america, 1850–1900 02/15/2025 by ♭♫   [+-]劉 is phoneticized as "lau" in cantonese but it is also phoneticized as "lew" or "liu" or "liao" in taishanese by the immigration officers.[hoodline.com]finally, lau's family history reflects the broader narrative of asian immigrants in america. the random anglicization of their last names by immigration officials—a flip of a coin that decided whether one was a lau or a lowe—is a poignant detail that demonstrates the historical haphazardness that affected the identities of countless families.
re: because russia illegally annexed crimea , the us will turn a blind eye if china reunites outer manchuria by force. (nudge nudge wink wink) that opportunity may not happen again... 02/15/2025 by ♭♫   [+-]if europe starts to arm ukraine to the teeth now and defeat russia and watch russia dissolve like the ussr did, then they will not have to worry about their future security if the us leaves nato as negotiations between putin and trump will be rendered null and void. once the gremlin in the kremlin is deposed, xi jinping will also be weakened with no more friends and the us will no longer have a need to annex greenland. that's a triple threat win for world peace. europe needs to refocus that the war to end wars starts and ends with ukrainian sovereignty. war criminals like the gremlins in the kremlin need to face the music and taste a dose of their own novichok. finally, it is not in america's best interest if it gave ukraine's key resources and assets in russian-occupied territories away to russia because that will eliminate ukraine's ability to compensate america for previous aid packages especially since the grinch in the white house does not believe in giving away anything for 🆓.[youtu.be]the big question: will washington step in or let russia collapse?quote♭♫
europe needs to stop complaining about trump sidelining their lack of action/financial support and start sending boots on the ground in ukraine before trump makes a deal with putin if they want a seat at the bargaining table. the longer putin is in power, the more expensive it will be for europe to defend itself. it is cheaper now for europe to defeat russia while putin is at its weakest as separatist movements are brewing inside russia. ukraine will reward whoever with rare earths for protecting their sovereignty and all the fascists including trump will be humiliated for putting on a show that went flat. with the way russian military hardware and weapons are performing, i would have guessed that they were "made in china". their nuclear arsenal appears to be duds.disclaimer: i did not vote for trump.[youtu.be]trump and putin's latest phone call has triggered concerns across europe, with zelensky reportedly in a panic. russia mocks the western response, urging calm. what did the leaders discuss that caused such alarm?
