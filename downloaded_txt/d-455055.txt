whey the aqua specialists team opened my pool - the pump was leaking. these gentlemen worked so hard to fix the problem. they replaced several parts to get it done. i watched them do the work - it was like an orchestra of activities. required great physical strength also. incredibly competent. the bill was a bit higher due to the extra-time to fix the leak, but i am sure i would have paid many hundreds more if this team wasn't so determined and committed. they'll have to punch me in the mouth and knock out a few teeth if they want to lose my business - and even then - i'll probably stay with aqua specialists. teeth can be replaced, but fantastic craftsmanship is much harder to find.- brett s.
