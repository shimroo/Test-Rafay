	 so long, and thanks for all the fish
	 
    


the title of this posting is flippant, but the sentiments are heartfelt. ten years ago today i began blogging here at ts. today i'm really and finally calling it quits.

i'm deeply grateful for you who visited, commented, and supported me through the years. this blog allowed me to enjoy virtual fellowship during times when i sometimes felt very alone in my face-to-face ministry. i'm especially grateful for the handful of you with whom i developed more than virtual relationships--either by postal mail, phone, or in person.

i won't be deleting the site, but i almost certainly won't be posting here again, either (although i haven't ruled out updating this post). right now i want to unplug a little bit, regroup, get some rest and do some thinking. i may start writing online again one day, but it won't be here.

it's been a wonderful ride. thanks for the encouragement and especially the prayers.

	 recharging
	 
    


it's not a coincidence that a fall-off in posting here has coincided with my wife and my youngest son's going off to college. this month, for the first time in 28 years, we don't have at least one son living at home with us. we're happy for our sons, of course, but getting used to an empty nest takes some mental and emotional adjustment. apparently that means i don't have a lot of energy left over for blogging.

it's possible that my once again slacking off on blogging may disappoint both my regular readers, but i do plan to be back at it soon. thanks again to both of  you for visiting.

	 changing circumstances
	 
    


royce ogle reflects on the wrong way to pray:

often we pray for god to change our circumstances. i have done it and you have too. 

meanwhile, god might have orchestrated your circumstances so he can change you. so, instead of asking for things to change so we can be happy, maybe we should ask, "lord help me to see how i need to change in my present circumstances."
indeed. i recommend royce's whole article.

	 truths about the advance of the islamic state
	 
    


votm persecution blog has a helpful post on five truths to keep in mind as is advances in iraq. i like these two the best:

2. god always finds a way to encourage, grow, and build his church. he's just looking for those willing to count the cost. . . .5. the battle is already decided.have you read the book of revelation? we know who will ultimately win the battle—the lord jesus christ. until that day, when jesus makes his final return to take his rightful place, you can stand with your persecuted family by choosing to fellowship with them through your prayers and actions.
amen.

	 'broken by the process'
	 
    


i don't know how to link to single entries on dave black's weblog, but his 8/14/14, 8:20 a.m. entry on marriage and the recent loss of his own wife is very much worth reading, even if you have to do some scrolling or searching to find it.

	 contextual meaning of genesis 1 & 2
	 
    


jim mcguiggan has a way of packing a lot of meaning into his weekly reflections. this week's essay shines light on the ot world, especially in relation to genesis 1 & 2:

the business of the biblical witness is not to tell us about the historical, cultural, religious, political or literary climate of the day though in the process of doing what it does it reveals a lot of that. for example, genesis 1 & 2 sets itself against its environment in which the gods of the nations whose stories are told in the enuma elish or the baal cycle or the many myths of sumeria and egypt. in the bible god as god has no mythology—he isn’t created, he doesn’t war against other gods to become the chief god nor does he die or be killed and somehow come to life again. stories like that occur in the mythology of the polytheistic world to explain their experience with nature. 
jim's little essay is loaded with insights, and i recommend reading the whole thing.

	 light on conflict in gaza
	 
    


christians, it's good to be clear-eyed about what's going on in the world, especially when so many news organizations are not particularly helpful in that regard. thanks to mike leake for pointing to this link: nine things you should know about hamas.

	 mead on preaching and paradigms
	 
    


question: could peter mead's essay on preaching and paradigms possibly be good enough to sustain this powerhouse opening:

when we preach, we don’t simply present a truth, make an offer, or demonstrate the relevance of an ancient text.  every biblical passage is a heavenly assault on the unquestioned assumptions of a fallen world.
answer: yes. i recommend reading peter's whole article. plus, this week's series on who is listening is also worth reading on the biblical preaching home page.

	 insightful expositors: gempf & leithart
	 
    


when i first began this weblog in 2005, i frequently linked to gems of expositional treasure at nt scholar conrad gempf's now-defunct weblog, not quite art, not quite living. from what i can tell, dr. gempf is no longer posting daily notes for his bible students, but today it was good to read his thoughts this month on mark 12:28-34.

another scholar whose biblical insights i treasure is the extraordinarily prolific peter leithart. one of his latest expositional posts is on the great sword in revelation 6:4.

	  spirit and magic
	 
    


after looking at the confusion of magic and god's power in acts 19:11-20, matt dabbs wonders if preachers are falling into a similar trap as the scevason brothers:

how often do we have the same sort of magical thinking when it comes to faith…that if we say the right words or do worship just so that god will have to bless us or that we will make a great name for ourselves or that the worldly standards of success will be satisfied. 

it just doesn’t work that way.
no, it doesn't.

	  good news, indeed
	 
    


royce ogle: "the gospel, or 'good news,' about christ is very, very good news because the truth about human beings without him is so horribly bad."

	 seeing connections
	 
    


the book of james has been described as a "string of pearls" for containing so many disjointed little gems of biblical wisdom. but craig keener writes about how the book of james fits together. and in case you missed it, dr. keener's post on the unifying theme of romans is even better.
