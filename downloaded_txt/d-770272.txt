a-list colourist louise galvin has tended the beautiful locks of many beauties, including sophie dahl and patsy kensit and her carbon neutral, natural ingredients haircare product line is now available.  




“i love louise’s hair products because i always choose everything natural anyway and you can really feel the difference with these products. usually, other hair products create this need to wash more and condition more and the hair gets heavier and heavier with all the chemicals but louise galvin’s products are so natural, it leaves the hair really clean and soft without any rubbish. they all smell really yummy too. and don’t harm the environment. just my style. thanks louise.”

  n0  silcone,sls, petrochemicals, parabens, synthetic fragrance and polymershealthy hair is literally in my roots i started my own haircare range to create a truly healthy range of products. i banished all "nasties" first- absolutely no silicone, sodium lauryl sulphate or propylene glycol, parabens and synthetic polymers. instead i sought out the finest chemists to help me create special formulas containing ethical and environmentally friendly natural and naturally derived ingredients. chemical ingredients such as silicone undermine and destroy our hairs natural ability to shine. they literally strip the hair shaft of all natural oils and then coat it in plastic-like materials. not healthy at all! take a look at the labels on your shampoo and consider what you are putting on your hair. as i always say "healthy scalp- healthy hair' be kind to your hair -and yourself -today
