						we stayed here for our first trip with our dog, the villas are nice and separate for extra privacy and roomy! our dog felt at home and really enjoyed her stay. we booked another visit as we checked out!

						great place to stay. helpful staff.close to the beach.we saw a school of dolphins and a whale while there. so relaxing you won't give "a damn".					


the unknown mystery— from google reviews 






						clean rooms and ocean view. while the rooms are a little small, we were there to be on the beach. the lovely deck afforded ocean views and rocking chairs for relaxation. and at the price, it really is a great value.					


rob bennett— from google reviews 






						this is right on the beach. all the motel rooms look into the ocean. i wish the windows could open to let the breeze in and i will bring a microwave oven next time. i definitely will stay again. it's cute and fun. i liked the clientele and the office and housekeepers.
