happy new year to everyone!as most have heard there is no longer a 1 piece  suit in figure. due to the high expense involved in competing this will help make competing a little cheaper. we are starting to recieve a few orders but with girls only needing 1 suit we can take on more customers than before. feel free to contact lisa atlisa@miles-of-fitness.comalso check out our myspace pagewww.myspace.com/stylesbylisamileswe update the myspace page frequently since it is fast and easy to do.also we will be tanning people for local shows in the columbus area again this year. we are stocked up on jan tana on stage and ready to go! the price is $75 to get you as dark as you want. it is fast,no streaking and goes on even without any blotching. craig and lisa are available to suit your individual needs.stay healthy and train hard!

we have had a few questions about tanning. we use jan tana on-stage competition color which gives a great color that does not look dirty like other products. it also wears off evenly and does not get splotchy. we use an airbrush to apply it,1 coat only takes a few minutes and there is no streaking. most people look best with 3 coats depending on skin tone. the charge is $50. for local shows we apply the tan at our condo in gahanna. some shows will allow us to set up at the show but it is not likely. it is by appointment only.lisa@miles-of-fitness.comcraig@miles-of-fitness.com

a new year is upon us with new suit business pouring in for styles by miles. we have started the year off with the largest amount of orders we have ever received! thank you all for your business and support.craig has started a new direction in his life and begun a career with ups. he has been there since last november and has decided to leave personal training behind him. within the year he hopes to have his own route and be a driver.neither one of us have any plans as of now to compete this year. but we are still offering tanning for local shows. if you are interested in tanning or suits please contact us atlisa@miles-of-fitness.com orcraig@miles-of-fitness.com

well,the 2007 season is now over. it has been a bittersweet year for both of us. although we have gone farther and placed better than we ever have , we also met with alot of dissapointment. some of the judging just left us scratching our heads wondering if they mixed up competitor numbers or did not calculate scores correctly. the judging is based only on the opinion of a small group of people, unlike a real sporting event. all and all we had a great year. i got my first win and placed on the national level. lisa won the arnold so it wasn't all bad! we are now taking time off from competing to get our life back in order and let our bodies heal. thinking about suits for the 2008 season? get your orders in early. we keep having people contact us just a few weeks before their shows and it always dissapoints us that we can't help them because they didn't plan ahead.  please allow 12-15 weeks notice or we might not be able to fit you into our schedule. we expect 2008 to be our busiest, most succesful year yet.wishing everyone a great holiday season! take time away from the gym to spend with your family,in the end the gym will always be there.................check out our new ads for xenadrine in most fitness magazines,thanks again to cytodyne and jen hofheins for believing in us and allowing us the opportunity to represent them.until next time train hard but be smart.

well the arnold has come and gone and it was a great weekend. lisa won the figure "d" class which was a great achievement and more than she had hoped for.her goal was to make the top 5. i placed 6th and had a blast at the md cyber classic! look forr me in an upcoming issue, i did a photoshoot for md with one of the best photographers out there per bernal.our cytodyne ads are coming out this month,i just saw myself in the ad for the first time. i gotta say that i got emotional over it because we have taken this further than what we thought was possible. i have always struggled with my weight and just dreamed about how cool it would be to actually compete and make a living in the fitness industry. it is a reality now and i wouldn't have it any other way!lisa is swamped with suit orders through june. she is taking orders for shows in july or later in the fall. we want to help as many people as we can so lease give us plent of notice if you are thinking of getting a suit.also, we are going to be spray tanning again the friday before most local shows at our condo in gahanna. we use jan tana on stage color. the cost is $50 and we will get you as dark as you like. we will be at julie palmers show as the official tanning crew. friday night at the host hotel and sat morning at the venue. feel free to contact us if you have a show coming up and want tanned!until next time- train hard!
