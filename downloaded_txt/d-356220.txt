top 5 reasons to raft grand canyon as soon as possible!


experience the natural wonder
grand canyon is one of the most beautiful natural wonders in the world. it‚Äôs one of the few places left in the world that is still completely disconnected from cell phone service too! rafting down the colorado river is one of the best ways to experience the true majesty of grand canyon. it‚Äôs one thing to see it from either the south rim or north rim, but it‚Äôs a whole other view and experience from the river looking up. you‚Äôll see stunning views, cascading waterfalls (yes, waterfalls in the desert!), towering cliffs, natural history left behind from those who came before you, and amazing flora and fauna.
adventure and excitement
whitewater rafting through grand canyon is an exhilarating adventure that‚Äôs sure to get your adrenaline pumping. you‚Äôll be navigating rapids and taking on challenging terrain, making it a thrilling experience you won‚Äôt soon forget.
learn about history and geology
grand canyon is a treasure trove of geological history and cultural significance, from the original river runners all the way back to the original peoples that called grand canyon home (11 native american tribes are associated with grand canyon national park). a grand canyon trip provides an opportunity to learn about both geology and human history that you likely wouldn‚Äôt learn just from a day trip to grand canyon national park. you‚Äôll get to see the layers of rock that tell the story of the canyon‚Äôs formation, and you‚Äôll watch it grow and subside around you in a truly remarkable way that few get to experience.
unplug and disconnect
grand canyon rafting trips offer a very unique chance to completely unplug from the distractions of modern life. this is so rare in our world today, and it is truly one of the best reasons to do this grand canyon river trip. you‚Äôll be off the grid, surrounded by stunning scenery, without your phone pinging at you every two seconds, and without the daily distractions of life. our days cause us to be so distracted, but to truly disconnect from it all brings us back to nature, to our most simple selves, and provides us the opportunity to get to know ourselves better.
make memories
finally, taking a grand canyon rafting trip down the colorado river provides you with memories that will last a lifetime. it‚Äôs an adventure you‚Äôll look back on fondly for years to come, whether you‚Äôre traveling with friends, family, or solo, it‚Äôs an experience you won‚Äôt want to miss.


which grand canyon rafting trip is best for me?


between our three different colorado river rafting trip options, you‚Äôre sure to find the best one for you! we have a handy trip comparison guide to read all the details, but below are some bullet points of each of our trip types to help you start considering the best option for you.
our classic adventure
this grand canyon whitewater trip offers the most diverse craft type of all of our adventures. you‚Äôll have three length options and typically three different boats to choose from each day.
if you have 14-16 days, our full canyon river trips are a great option as you will get to see all 226 river miles from lees ferry to diamond creek. if you have only a week or so and are capable of a strenuous and very difficult hike on the bright angel trail, our 6-7 day upper canyon trips are a great choice, as well as our 9-10 day lower canyon trips. you will miss one portion or another when choosing either of these options, but you can‚Äôt go wrong on either half. and many times, when our guests choose to do just an upper or just a lower, they will come back to do the other half.
if you are looking for some excellent grand canyon whitewater experience, our classic adventures are the way to go because of all the different boat options you can choose from each day. if you‚Äôre feeling adventurous and want to really feel the river move below you, choose our paddle raft and help maneuver the raft down river with 5 other paddlers and an expert river guide steering and commanding the boat. if you‚Äôd like time to sit back and take in all the scenery, choose one of the 4-5 oar boats while one of your river guides rows you down river. when available, we‚Äôll send a hard-sided dory boat on this adventure as well, which is a fun and different ride than the other rubberized rafts. it adds a whole new level to the experience as you feel every wave and every riffle rock the boat.
our motor adventure
our 8 or 10 day motorized adventures are a great opportunity to see the entire 226 river mile stretch in a little over a week. this trip does not require a hike in or out of grand canyon either so is an excellent option for those who have less time but are apprehensive of hiking bright angel trail. these grand canyon river adventures feature one or two 37 foot motorized rafts, powered by 4 stroke engines. these rafts make for a secure feel for those a little more leery about the whitewater you‚Äôll experience on these trips, as they sit high off the water, and flips and unexpected swimmers are much less likely. our motor trips have a younger recommended minimum age of 10, which allows multi-generational families to experience grand canyon together.
our all-paddle adventures
if you‚Äôre ready for the most active grand canyon whitewater experience we have to offer, this is your trip. you are required to participate on the paddle raft every day to help get the trip down river from lee‚Äôs ferry to diamond creek. this grand canyon rafting trip features 3-4 paddle rafts and 3 support oar rafts carrying gear down river.
you‚Äôll be able to choose a 14 day full canyon option, a 6 day upper canyon option, or a 9 day lower canyon option. please note that the 6 day upper canyon and 9 day lower canyon options require a hike on bright angel trail, a strenuous and difficult 7.5 mile hike with a mile elevation change.


where our grand canyon raft trips start and end


full canyon travel logistics
you‚Äôll start and end your trip in flagstaff, az, where we‚Äôll meet you the night before your launch date for an orientation at 7 pm to go over all the logistics you need to pack up for your grand canyon whitewater rafting adventure. bright and early the day of launch, we‚Äôll pick you up by bus, transport you to lees ferry, where you‚Äôll meet your guides and start your adventure! on the last day of your trip, you‚Äôll pull into diamond creek, where we‚Äôll meet you by bus and transport you back to flagstaff where you started.
if you are reserved on our motor adventure, our 14-16 day classic adventure, or our 14 day all-paddle adventure, you‚Äôll start at lees ferry and travel 226 river miles down stream to diamond creek. our trips do not go to pearce ferry unless diamond creek is washed out from flooding because we believe it‚Äôs best to maximize your amount of time in grand canyon national park than spend a whole extra day traveling through a less exciting and mostly sediment-filled stretch of the river. lake mead sediments have caused the disappearance of most rapids, and the best hikes and rapids are all upstream of this section. we prefer to utilize that extra day to hike along the main grand canyon river corridor.
partial canyon travel logistics
upper canyon
if you‚Äôre on our 6-7 day upper canyon classic adventure or our 6 day upper canyon all-paddle adventure, you will meet us in flagstaff, az the night before your trip for an orientation to help you pack for your trip. bright and early the day of your launch, we‚Äôll meet you at the hotel, pick you up by bus and transport you to lees ferry, where you‚Äôll meet your guides and go down river! on the last day of your trip, you will hike out on the bright angel trail from pipe creek (not phantom ranch, as this will cut 2 miles off of your hike by starting at pipe creek). once you hike out, you‚Äôll be at the south rim village of grand canyon, where we do not provide transportation. we recommend you stay the night at the south rim that evening so you‚Äôre not having to rush out of the canyon, and can experience the beauty of bright angel trail. it‚Äôs also really nice to take a shower after your river trip and your hike out!
lower canyon
if you‚Äôre on our 9-10 day lower canyon classic adventure or our 9 day lower canyon all-paddle adventure, you will meet us at the south rim village the night before your trip for an orientation with your hiking guide. transportation to the south rim is not included, but there are plenty of options for getting yourself there, which will be sent to you upon making your reservation. the day of your hike in, you‚Äôll start your descent down the bright angel trail as the sun is rising, which makes for a glorious introduction to grand canyon. you‚Äôll meet your guides at pipe creek beach, and you‚Äôll start your river trip! on the last day, you‚Äôll pull into diamond creek, where you‚Äôll help unload all the rafts, and we‚Äôll have a bus waiting for you to take you to flagstaff, az.
why we don‚Äôt end our trips at pearce ferry or whitmore wash
we fundamentally believe that the longer you can spend time in grand canyon national park proper, the more you‚Äôll be able to explore the most phenomenal side canyons, water falls and scenery available to rafters. going to pearce ferry adds a whole day to our trips, and ultimately doesn‚Äôt add much to the adventure. it would in fact, take precious hiking time away.
ending at whitmore wash would cut 1-2 days off your adventure. sure, that might help you in your vacation time-line planning, but we really find it important to be down in the canyon as long as you can. the longer you‚Äôre down there, the more settled into river life you become, and the more you can immerse yourself in the disconnected world.
our length of trips allows us to offer a pace that is comfortable, and not rushed, but also provides ample opportunity to get off the rafts and hike and explore grand canyon by foot, and not just by raft. if you‚Äôre excited to hike while on your trip, azra is known as the biggest hiking company in grand canyon, and it would be our pleasure to share this magical place with you!
