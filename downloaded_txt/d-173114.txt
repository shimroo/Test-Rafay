“yellowjackets fans for the past couple decades have come to know that there’s no categorizing the music.”— new york daily news














"...a perfectly combustible electric-acoustic outfit whose smart, often challenging and unpredictable compositions draw from fusion, postbop and contemporary jazz."— jazz times














"their sound has always been a combination of upbeat and complex, with the various members contributing tunes that have tricky time signatures, rippling runs, and sunny explosions of energy.”— popmatters on a rise in the road (mack avenue, 2013)














"...it delivers a bracing new approach and a renewed sense of swinging adventure."— itunes














"the band has always worked creatively inside the niche it created for itself within the broader jazz world, and this new album suggests that the creative well within that niche is far from dry.”— buffalo news














  	 		 		 	 	 		 			 				 					  	 		 		 	 	 		 			 				 	"melodically seductive throughout..."— jazz times
