guest reviews 



 










						i took my 4 grandchildren and daughter in laws for 4 days of christmas fun. we stayed at the grand oaks in the grand oaks suite. the hotel is extremely clean, friendly staff, the pool and hot tub were nice and the pool area was as clean as the rest of the hotel. the breakfast was better than most free breakfast at hotels. i would highly recommend this.
