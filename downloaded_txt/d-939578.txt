navigating life's storms
good stress





the 
							secret to good stress is found in the alignment of 
							mental, emotional, spiritual, and physical 
							capacities, combined with work/rest cycles at home 
							and at work. the backdrop of this unique technology 
							stems from merging sports science, biotelemetry, 
							predictive analytics and performance psychology in 
							ways that yield quantifiable results. 
							stress must always be put in the proper 
							context of its metaphorical stormâ¦.the corporate 
							world calls these storms stress, the sports world 
							calls them competition, and families simply call 
							them chaos. 

dr. lylesâ 
							research and clinical experience has isolated the 
							common elements of stress in order to ultimately 
							help people get better at whatever they do. 
							others seek to minimize the damage stress has 
							on their clients life, job or sport.  
							dr. lyles believes we can use stress to focus 
							and direct energy to thrive in our performance and 
							mind/body alignment. a simple definition of stress 
							could be described as "any opposing force, 
							potentially limiting forward progress."
thus dr lyles 
							has introduced âinnervitalsâ inner body cameras to 
							provide information so top athletes, musicians and 
							even everyday gamers can better harmonize their mind 
							and body. this technology was launched before millions at the indy 500 on may 24 2015.

for the first time indy 500 telecast used bio 
							telemetry to show driverâs heart rate and calories 
							burned 
							to enhance the fan experience. 










									 





this 
							integrative philosophy brings an entirely different 
							definition and response to good stress, athletic 
							performance, and everyday life. top athletes utilize 
							our âinnervitalsâ body cameras and stress 
							optimization techniques, now you can too. learn to 
							harness the power of total body mind synchronicity 
							and showcase your talent and skill under pressure!

					 inner vitals bio


human performance measurement in the field of 
					sport science is well documented. merging biotelemetry and 
					psycho-telemetry is the foundation for dr. lylesâ approach 
					that has yielded quantifiable results with elite athletes 
					worldwide many times over the last 20 years.  
understanding the limits of the human body and how 
					to maximize and conserve energy levels before, during, and 
					after performance is the key to consistent results. it is 
					also fascinating to observe and hold entertainment value as 
					was evidenced in 2015's 99th running of the 
					indy 500 where tlc's "innervitals" were featured live before 
					millions of fans on abc, the worldwide leader in sports. 
for the athlete, optimizing performance means 
					learning how to harmonize the mind/body experience, or go 
					in the zone at will under pressure, and with consistent 
					results. 
rituals before, during and after performance must 
					be coupled with oscillatory stress/recovery cycles that 
					align specifically for each performance. this is best 
					obtained with a performance coach to direct and hold 
					accountable for a training duration. using a performance 
					coach can shorten the learning curve for healthy change, and 
					secure the desired results that elite performers worldwide 
					expect and deserve. dr. lyles has worked with 
					nascar's evernham motorsports, richard petty motorsports, 
					nhraâs snap-on sponsored doug herbert racing, and sports car 
					rolex series daytona 24 champion john pew. team penske, 
					disney, abc and espn.
