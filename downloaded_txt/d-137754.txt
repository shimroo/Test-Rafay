these sneakers were a collaboration between sportswear brand puma and fashion icon dapper dan. in 1982, dapper dan opened his boutique in harlem, new york city. he quickly developed his trademark style of incorporating the logos of high-end brands such as gucci and fendi in his custom designs. his work catered to many prominent black consumers who had long been ignored by the high fashion world. throughout his career, he dressed notable figures including ll cool j, diane dixon, and jam master jay. eventually, the high fashion world took notice with brands such as gucci collaborating with dapper dan in 2017. this puma clyde sneaker was released in 2022 and features a monogram print specially designed by dapper dan. see these shoes on display in our behind the scenes gallery.

the word ‚Äòsneaker‚Äô was used in the 19th century in both england and the us to describe criminals and others of ill repute. however, in the us, the term sneaker was also used for rubber-soled athletic footwear because the soles allowed wearers to walk around noiselessly. a rather curious interview in a news article from 1887 quoted chicago mugger patrick kent, recommending that if one wished to be a successful criminal, ‚Äúyou must wear rubber shoes, then you can sneak up when [a victim‚Äôs] back is turned.‚Äùperfection high tops, american, early 20th century

this pair of bespoke shoes was designed by roger vivier for princess lilian of belgium. vivier cleverly played with the motif of the fabric used to make these shoes by ornamenting the throat with a three-dimensional leaf decoration that seems to spring to life out of the leafy patterned silk. these shoes were probably designed to complement an entire ensemble designed by christian dior for the princess.  these shoes were bespoke, meaning that they were specifically designed and made to fit only the princess‚Äôs feet, and therefore feature proportions like the wide toe-box, which were suited to her.roger vivier for delman-christian diorfrench 1953-1955

in the spirit of respect and friendship, the bata shoe museum recognizes that the land on which we are situated has been the ancestral home of many nations, including the wendat, the anishnaabeg, the haudenosaunee, and the mississaugas of the credit, since time immemorial. today, this area remains home to many, diverse indigenous communities, including first nations, inuit and metis peoples. as a staff, we at the bata shoe museum are grateful to have the opportunity to meet, work and learn together on this land.
