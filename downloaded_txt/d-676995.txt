who's loving you? cllct is.





still toying with if/how to restart the blog, but i needed to check in with a link to yet another fun collective family (cllct) tribute project: our bad: a michael jackson tribute compilation, which you can download at that page. it features the work of few of my favorite songwriting/songsharing-obsessed internet (and somewhat beyond) friends, james eric, tinyfolk, iron like nylon and more. if you hear anything you like, you might want to spend a little time (mintues, hours, days, weeks, months?) checking out the work of those featuring their music on cllct. i know i have and consider it a great resource for good free music by people who love to write and share music. long live bedroom rock. or folk. or whatever. all of it.also: james eric and erin vogel cover wilco's yankee hotel foxtrot.

question for fellow blogger types who've abandoned blogger.





i'm thinking of moving the site away from blogger before restarting because i hear that, even in cases where permission has been granted to host an mp3, they've removed them. where should i look to move and/or what program can i use with my own domain/host that has similarly easy-to-navigate templates and less big brotherism?

it lives?





cough, cough. is this thing on?just more than a year ago i stopped blogging here in the hope that my life would move me in a direction to decide whether i was going to start up again or not. i stopped the blog because it seemed a little frivolous in light of the real-life crap that was going on in my life. and a lot was going on then and even more went on. i was sick, i was underemployed, i eventually relocated from chicago to bloomington, in, in the hope of assisting my ill father who died a few weeks later, in april my best friend committed suicide. my health is better, but i'm still underemployed and have lost two of my favorite people in the world. but i'm doing fine. better than fine, most days.so, yeah, life just continues to throw shit at me and i'm taking it pretty well, i think, and now it seems kind of silly not to have a fun, cover-filled diversion. i'm currently deciding if the potentially revived copy, right? will be just as it was or if i'll reinvent it somehow. admittedly, i have been too preoccupied with all of the aforementioned stuff to even pay attention to cover songs or my fellow cover bloggers in the past year or more so i might not be cutting-edge. i can live with that. i still have tens of thousands of covers piled up i've never shared, and i'm sure there are a slew of awful and/or awesome gems in there.aaaaaanyhow, i'm thinking a return is imminent, probably by the beginning of july. keep your eyes peeled.eta: apologies in advance if every old c,r? post shows up in your blogroll/feed reader in the next few days. i'm unhiding them. and, no, i unfortunately cannot reupload the hundreds of songs i'd posted back in the day. sorry.

look for the rainbow in every storm.





it is with a heavy heart that i write this post—which is out of the blue and spur of the moment and a slew of other idioms meaning spontaneous—but i'm thinking my tenure here at copy, right? is at an end.i feel i've had a good run. i've been doing this more than four years now. i am stunned and flattered at the positive attention i've received and similarly shocked at how little of the attention has been negative. i feel very appreciative of every reader who has encouraged me via comments, donations and publicity in the past. you've all been wonderful.i suppose there is a good chance that i might get antsy and wish to start blogging about music (or something else) again, and should that happen, i will definitely update this site with information.again, i have very much enjoyed doing what i do here and appreciate you all very much. in my absence, i highly recommend you check out the blogs, cover-focused and otherwise, listed to the right.thank you all so much for your attention these past few years. it's been very fulfilling for me, and i hope you feel the same.thanks one more time for everything.love, liza

yeah, i'm alive.





sarah gregg millman (of the girl guides) "oooh this love is so" (al b. sure cover)words cannot express how excited i was to see this covered. sigh. al b.the chipmunks "good girls don't" (the knack cover)i still can't believe that such a dirty song was reworked (and barely, at that) for a kids album.the gwen stacys "alive" (oasis cover)tiffany "panic (hang the dj)" (the smiths cover)yes, that tiffany. and, yes, those smiths.julie c "breathe" (pink floyd cover)the vibrators "liza" (nofx cover)if i meet someone and he or she hears my name and makes an immediate nofx reference, i never know whether to smile politely or run the other way. in retrospect of the times it's happened and the people who've done it, i'm wishing i'd have chosen the latter more frequently.watch the men fall "venus in furs" (the velvet underground cover)the dollyrots "be my baby" (the ronettes cover)los chicros "changes" (david bowie cover)the bam bams "kids in america"(kim wilde cover)olive "my sharona" (the knack cover)numbers "cry" (the birthday party cover)

please don't stop the music.





yeah, i fell off the face of the earth for a second. new post up by wednesday.speaking of wednesday, before then, chicagoans who love live music, theatre, comedy and the arts in general should contact their alderman (alderperson?) and tell them to vote no to the proposed promoter's ordinance. you can also sign the petition against it here.if it passes, our access to the things we love will be severely stifled.update: if you're willing to go to the city council meeting tomorrow at 10 am in protest, sign up here.another update: thanks to public outcry from promoters, performers and fans, the ordinance has been tabled for now for reevaluation purposes.

disclaimers/reminders:

1. mp3s on this blog are available for a short time and are here for sampling purposes only.  my only goal is to share my love/hate relationship with cover songs and to turn readers on to artists of whom they might not have otherwise been aware.  if you are the creator or copyright owner of a song or anything else that might be posted here, please contact me by sending an e-mail (see above) if you wish to have it removed.2. please don't direct link to any individual tracks. if you like an artist you hear here (either the original artist or the one performing the cover), you should definitely do your best to take the knowledge you gain here and go out and buy their albums.3.  i very rarely, if ever, repost songs.  if you missed something, i apologize, but i get lots of e-mails from people asking me to repost things.  if i actually reposted all the tracks people wanted me to, i'd never get a chance to post anything new.  that said, if there is a track or two you feel you desperately need, feel free to drop me a line at liza.copyright @ gmail.com (sans spaces) and i'll do my best to get it to you.  but please keep in mind that it might not be instantaneous, as i get approximately 600 e-mails a week.4.  if you read my updates via an rss feed aggregator or via a livejournal feed, there will be times when old posts will suddenly appear with non-working links, which happens as a result of my going back to an older entry to remove the links or to update or edit the post in any way.  again, i apologize if you missed these posts initially, but i cannot repost the songs.  lately i've been keeping songs up for two weeks to a month and i feel that should be plenty of time for you to get the songs.  if you don't read your feeds often and regularly miss tracks, i suggest you bookmark the site and check it once a week or so.5.  i do not generally take requests nor do i guarantee that songs submitted to me will appear here.  you're welcome to send me a track or two, but it might not hit the blog.  also, i get lots of e-mail so submissions sent via sites like yousendit or dropload.com often expire by the time i get to them.  please attach your files to the actual e-mail if you want to ensure i get it.  similarly, i'd really appreciate it if those of you sending mp3s to my inbox would check to see whether or not i've already posted the tracks first.  there is a search bar in the upper left corner of the site that should assist you in said endeavor.  granted, chances are good that even if i've not posted it, i already have it, but at least there's a chance i don't.6.  if you're looking for a few suggestions on beginning your own cover hunts, here is an old entry that might prove helpful.7.  if you are a member or agent of a band, please keep in mind that i only post cover songs.  similarly, i do not "review" albums.  i will most likely delete and ignore any communication from you that shows you do not understand this.thanks for listening,liza.
