i would not trade this agency for the world. caregivers are well-trained, always courteous, professional and pleasant to deal with. 

— e.m, sarasota, fl







as a family member of someone who required significant assistance, the staff at thekey helped myself as well as my sister (the client). i would highly recommend the key to any family who needs assistance for their family member.

frequently asked home care questions








what’s the best home care?

the best home care is provided by reliable, professional caregivers who are trained and backed by a home care agency that’s insured, providing oversight, care guidance, and back-up caregivers as needed.








how do i find the best caregiver for my loved one?

the best caregiver is an experienced professional who has the training and skills to support your loved one’s care needs.it’s also important to find a caregiver who’s extremely reliable, —has back-up if necessary, —and is a good fit in terms of personality and shared interests.








is home care better than moving to assisted living?

nine out of ten older adults would prefer to live independently in the home they know and love rather than moving to a facility or assisted living community.with the right level of support, most people can continue to live safely and comfortably at home even as they age with a progressive illness or condition.








how much does home care cost?

home care is typically billed by the hour, so the cost depends on the number of care hours per week and can vary slightly by region. most families pay out-of-pocket for their care or use long-term care insurance.








is a home care agency better than hiring a private caregiver?

if you value safety, security, and reliability, yes. a quality home care agency is insured and also manages the performance and scheduling of its caregivers, handles billing and payroll, and has back-up caregivers to fill in when needed.with a private hire caregiver, you’re responsible for setting up payroll and withholding taxes, caregiver vetting and background checks, and purchasing sufficient liability insurance to cover any accidents or injuries in the home.
