check this out!


when our niece, kristen dattolico, was only twelve years old she entered a local singing competition, and from her demo tape she was picked to be among a small group to perform live in the contest finals before the local kelly clarkson concert. how cool is that? we've all been listening to kristen sing since she was a tiny tot and we've all known she has a special gift with her voice. if you have a way to listen to mp3 files on your computer, you can hear her demo recording here. if you encounter a problem playing it directly from the link, simply right click on it and choose "save target as" and save it to your desktop and play it from there. 


listen to kristen
