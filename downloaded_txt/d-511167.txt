grampian ownersâ€™ marina 


aug 18 (2024!). update!
hello everyone.
i have disabled the forum due to an enormous increase in difficult-to-counter spambots, causing very high bandwidth and disk space costs.
non-spambot traffic to the site has dropped significantly and i believe the grampian facebook group is probably a more up-to-date source of information on grampian boats these days. i recommend visiting the facebook group if youâ€™d like to interact with other grampian boat owners. this site seems best fit as an archive. 
i will continue to keep the site here for archival purposes but between the low traffic and extremely busy career, i canâ€™t commit much time to the site for the near future.
i still own my grampian discovery 7.9 lee island, but sheâ€™s been on the hard for two years now and i donâ€™t have a trailer capable of getting her to me here in pei. if anyone has a lead on sailboat trailers that could handle the trip from ontario, please reach out. i have a douglas 31 that needs to be moved as well, so iâ€™m looking for a beefy trailer, or boat mover..!
any donations to assist with the site maintenance are appreciated â€“ it costs about $50 per year out of pocket to keep the site up and domain registered.

hi all! 
one of my biggest goals for this site was to revive the active community and get grampian owners talking to each other. iâ€™d really appreciate if you could register on the forum and help us concentrate grampian knowledge here ðŸ™‚
the site cannot survive without active participants and contributors, so please join up and post, even if itâ€™s just to tell us that you went for a sail in your grampian today ðŸ™‚ 


owners registry request â€“ hull numbers
iâ€™m afraid i canâ€™t update boats in the new ownersâ€™ registry unless you also submit the hull number â€“ there are thousands of boats on the site and recently most boats are being submitted without a hull number. itâ€™s very difficult for me to find your boat without the hull number. please also be sure to include your detailed engine specs (i.e. johnson 9.9 outboard).


about james
iâ€™m james burke. ken corbett, the previous webmaster, graciously handed me the reins to the site in summer of 2020. i own a discovery 7.9, a modernized version of the grampian 26 based at port whitby marina near toronto. 
i work full time so updates happen when iâ€™ve got the time, but my hope is to update all of the old site pages to wordpress format as my time allows ðŸ™‚
