the sounds resonating through our bodies (i use high quality headphones for full binaural effect) is so healthy ... i feel my heart area open and soften during the sound bath ... your offering to us goes far beyond "thank you" ... healing is a high calling ... jahna your ethereal voice adds a remarkable dimension to this experience! wow.

i have attended two sonic sundays now.  i noticed that during each i felt asleep easily.  i have had struggles with insomnia for years, and so i asked if i could purchase a recording of the last one.  well, wouldn't you know, the recording was just as effective as in person 😀.  i will be attending them on the regular (and purchasing the recordings too)

i recommend jahna's guided meditations to anyone who is starting out on the inward journey. she is gentle, kind, and completely helpful in setting the tone for the voyage. the bowls are a delicious taste of what happens when the mind shifts to "off."

the dome dimensionthe journey is a 360 immersive experience designed to inspire and enchant audiences with beautiful, sublime music and visuals as we travel through fantastical worlds. the show uses the transformative power of ancient tibetan singing bowls, ethereal vocals, gorgeous full dome visuals and inspiring poetic narrative to evoke positive emotions and contemplative states of consciousness. the journey follows the metaphoric experience of life from formlessness into form and then back into formlessness once again.






































the journey movie



michael and jahna are also composers, co-writers and co-producers of the award-winning 360 immersive music-and-art short film, “the journey”, which won the audience choice award at domefestwest, and has been chosen as the official selection for seven international film festivals in germany, canada, us and australia. “the journey” is created to inspire and enchant audiences with transformative, sublime music (imbued with healing tones) and visuals as the viewer travels through fantastical worlds.



the immersive film incorporates the same music and sound components as in michael and jahna’s live shows, plus gorgeous fulldome visuals with an inspiring poetic narrative to evoke positive emotions and contemplative states of consciousness. the film metaphorically follows the experience of life from formlessness into form and then back into formlessness once again.
