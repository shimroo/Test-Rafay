    client reviews




   
"freeport garage door just did a great job at repairing my commerical door opener.  the door was stopping before it closed all the way and they had work hard to diagnose the problem which was tricky. the technician was knowledgable, professional and couresous. the price was very fair and the job was completed and the door works fine."- charles t.

 
"highly recommend!! we had a new garage door installed years ago by them and just recently called to have an electric door opener installed. they set up the appointment in two days. a very polite man named shaun came out to do the installation. he was prompt, polite, neat and went thoroughly went over everything i needed to know about our new opener. i will continue to recommend freeport garage door!"- kristina p.

 
"i highly recommend freeport garage, fantastic and quick service! wow! the track was bent and the garage door kept getting stuck. michael fixed it and replaced the door bumper too, quickly. he was so respectful of my elderly father who 'supervised'. karen from the office helped us schedule the service and was wonderful. freeport garage service takes pride in their work and truly cares about customers!"- emily b
