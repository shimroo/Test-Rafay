what our clients say 










some words from our clients based on our performed services. 

















						"technologyxperts (txi) laid out a full it implementation plan for the first three to five years of our relationship. txi let us choose what we wanted to do and at what pace. i really like the it procurement process from proposal, to approval, to implementation. with txi you have full access to the whole team, from top to bottom, no one is unreachable! txi is very happy and willing to sit down and discuss any it issues you might have."					


christopher nortonadministrator at anna maria of aurora 






						"though there are many benefits to partnering with txi, the most obvious is the response time to our needs. txi’s communication is top notch, and our issues are corrected in an extreme timely manner. txi’s their response time and follow-up are obviously key priorities of txi in maintaining excellent customer service to their clients. txi is one of the most professional companies i’ve ever worked with."					


joann porembaoffice manager at anna maria of aurora 






						"txi gives us peace of mind in a complex area of our business. txi provides fast and positive customer service and has a good relationship with the owner. txi keeps us on the cutting edge of technology and security. i have been exceedingly satisfied with txi’s service and would encourage any company to hire them. highly recommend! one of our company’s best vendor partnerships."					


christian ohmanadministrator at briar hill healthcare 






						"since moving to txi, our single biggest benefit is better technology solutions for the right price. txi provides better service than any other i.t. firm we have worked with in the past."					


joshua wallacevp of growth strategies at ohman family living 






						"we’ve enjoyed our relationship with txi and one of the biggest benefits is knowing that we have someone we can turn to who is consistently available and knowledgeable to address our ongoing needs. we couldn’t accomplish that in-house at our size. txi does a great job at addressing the things we need, when we need them. if someone was on the fence, one of the best value propositions is that few msps would have the combination of competence within the team while still being able to know the owner personally."					


kurt ingersollvp of operations at holly hill healthcare 






						"the single biggest benefit has been knowing that if a problem arises with our network, we can rely on txi to quickly address the problem."
