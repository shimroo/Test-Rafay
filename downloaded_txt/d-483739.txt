																														    american alligator (alligator mississippiensis) the american alligator is a member of the crocodile family. it can be differentiated from a crocodile by its wider snout and its bottom teeth which do not show when its jaw is closed. alligators are found throughout the southeast in wetlands from the carolinas to texas and as far north as arkansas. they consume fish, turtles and snails as well as small animals that come to the water's edge to drink. young alligators feed primarily on insects, crustaceans, snails, and fish. alligators benefit the marsh ecosystem by digging holes that hold fresh water during the dry season for fish, insects, crustaceans, snakes, turtles, birds and other animals. older males may live 30 years or more and reach lengths of 14 feet, and weights of 1,000 pounds. thirty years ago alligators were depleted from many parts of their range by market hunting and loss of habitat. many people believed this reptile could never recover. in 1967, this species was listed as an endangered species which prohibited alligator hunting. their numbers were monitored and by 1987 the american alligator was considered fully recovered and was subsequently removed from the endangered species list. however, trade in alligator skins or derived products is still regulated since some related species -- such as crocodiles and caimans
