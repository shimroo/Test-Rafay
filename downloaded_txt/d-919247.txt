covid-19 continues to ravage our community since the outbreak of covid-19 so many of our friends and colleagues have contracted the virus. live theater continues to be one of the most dangerous activities for performers, with almost no social safety net for those who get sick and contract long-covid. we have chosen to continue to avoid risking the health and safety of our casts, directors, and volunteers by producing large indoor gatherings ourselves. we are still watching the emerging science and look forward to producing events in the future where the health and safety of everyone involved in live theater can be assured. thank you for your continued understanding, and we look forward to our next covid-safe production. 

 

congratulations sag-aftra and wga on winning new contracts!as you know un-scripted was in full support of the 2023 sag-aftra/wga strikes. now that the both unions have won contracts for their members, the entertainment industry can begin to rebuild as everyone returns to work. unfortunately the greed, cruelty, and hubris of the amptp has cost the california economy and estimated $5 billion. it’s in times like these when the entertainment community fund becomes a lifeline for so many in the industry. so many artists rely on this service in times of hardship, and 2023 was unprecedented in that regard. if you are looking for ways to support artists in need, please consider donating to the entertainment community fund which is still supporting so many throughout the industry. it takes a long time for productions to get underway, and this is a great way you can help people make ends meet.donate to the entertainment community fund.  formerly the actors fund, the ecf’s emergency financial assistance program offers emergency financial assistance to support performing arts workers who are unable to pay their basic living expenses. this includes housing, food, utility bills and healthcare.
