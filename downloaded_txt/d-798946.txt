woman pays $1.75 for house in ebay auction





woman pays $1.75 for house in ebay auction"the credit crunch is responsible for reducing house prices all over the world, but surely not to this extent!

a 30-year-old woman has paid just $1.75 for a house in an online auction on ebay.

the abandoned property in saginaw, michigan, attracted eight bidders but no-one could match joanne smith’s meagre offering.

michigan newspaper the saginaw news reports there is a notice on the door of the home saying a foreclosure hearing is pending and that $850 in back taxes and yard cleanup costs must be paid.

according to the associated press, smith has no plans to visit her house and intends to resell it." 
  
lets start with this lame article shall we!? now thats a bit cheap if you ask me,i mean come on! even the land must cost more that, now hold on $1.75, that's almost $2 right? that's serious economical crisis.
anyway it's getting late so i gotta go jump on my bed and                                                
i'll blog with you guys tomorrow (if there is anyone,if not then i'll just blog alone haha) 
  
 peace out homiezzz! :)
