“if you tell me christian commitment is a kind of thing that has happened to you once and for all like some kind of spiritual plastic surgery, i say go to, go to, you’re either pulling the wool over your own eyes or trying to pull it over mine. every morning you should wake up in your bed and ask yourself: “can i believe it all again today?” no, better still, don’t ask it till after you’ve read the new york times, till after you’ve studied that daily record of the world’s brokenness and corruption, which should always stand side by side with your bible. then ask yourself if you can believe in the gospel of jesus christ again for that particular day. if your answer’s always yes, then you probably don’t know what believing means. at least five times out of ten the answer should be no because the no is as important as the yes, maybe more so. the no is what proves you’re human in case you should ever doubt it. and then if some morning the answer happens to be really yes, it should be a yes that’s choked with confession and tears and…great laughter.”

thou shall not covet thy neighbor’s wife
this would seem to mean – by implication – that one should covet his own wife, no?

what’s taking you to iceland?
asked our minister when he saw us buying warm clothes at a sporting-goods store.i paused trying to decide whether to say “a jumbo jet” or “delta airlines.”“luke’s always wanted to go,” replied my wife answering the intent of the question. it has been a nearly five-year thought of mine to go to iceland. who knows why certain thoughts and goals become lodged in our minds?melville1 speaks of an island “not down in any map; true places never are.” iceland seems a similar place. yes, there are maps of it and gps devices and in many ways it’s as modern a country as there is. but iceland has a certain mystique about it; similar to texas and italy and memphis. a place whose remoteness and wonder make it seem like a “true place.”anyone who listens to the beauty and quirkiness of sigur rós and björk ought to wonder what kind of country could nurture such creativity. the countless photos of inexpressibly beautiful scenery with an other-worldliness about it, descriptions of lava fields, hidden people, countless raging waterfalls, active glaciers and volcanos, and the beautiful desolateness of it all draw me in.and puffins.puffins have captivated me years. something about their clownish faces and squatty bodies and orange beaks. yes, there are puffins in newfoundland and the faroes and norway, but they do not compare with the prospect of seeing one in iceland. photographing a puffin in the wild is on my bucket list.that’s what’s taking me to iceland. a vision of a magical place my imagination and soul seeks.(that and zeppelin’s iceland-inspired immigrant song)moby dick, chapter 12, speaking of the fictitious rokovoko. melville had the good fortune to live in a time before pervasive maps and satellite images took some of the wonder from the world. ↩︎

“three maxims on knowledge, belief, actiondon’t claim to know what you merely believe even on good evidence.don’t claim to believe what you are not prepared to act upon.don’t let insufficient evidence prevent you from believing what you are better off believing in the long run than not believing in the long run.”

“and this raises one of life’s greatest mysteries.  why do some of us value good books above bread while others of us are indifferent to them?  a harsh answer tempts me: the latter are human only in a biological sense.  but i warn myself not to succumb to misanthropy.”

“man is godlike and therefore proud.  he becomes even more godlike when he humbles himself.the central thought of christianity, true or not, is one so repellent to the natural human pride of life that one ought at least to entertain the unlikelihood of its having a merely human origin.  the thought is that god humbled himself to the point of entering the world in the miserably helpless and indigent way we in fact do, inter faeces et urinam [between feces and urine], and to the point of leaving it  in the most horrendous way the brutal romans could devise, and from a most undistinguished spot, a hill  in an obscure desert outpost of their empire.”

“we have reasoned our way to uniformly conditional relationships. this is at the very center of the crisis of the family, since the word means, if it means anything, that certain people exist on special terms which each other, which terms are more of less unconditional. we have instead decided to respect our parents, maybe, if they meet our stringent standards of deserving. just so do our children respect us, maybe.”

“at the heart of these incredulous statements about the poor decisions poor people make is a belief that we would never be like them. we would know better. we would know to save our money, eschew status symbols, cut coupons, practice puritanical sacrifice to amass a million dollars. there is a regular news story of a lunch lady who, unbeknownst to all who knew her, died rich and leaves it all to a cat or a charity or some such. books about the modest lives of the rich like to tell us how they drive buicks instead of bmws. what we forget, if we ever know, is that what we know now about status and wealth creation and sacrifice are predicated on who we are, i.e. not poor. if you change the conditions of your not-poor status, you change everything you know as a result of being a not-poor. you have no idea what you would do if you were poor until you are poor. and not intermittently poor or formerly not-poor, but born poor, expected to be poor and treated by bureaucracies, gatekeepers and well-meaning respectability authorities as inherently poor. then, and only then, will you understand the relative value of a ridiculous status symbol to someone who intuits that they cannot afford to not have it.”

love means never having to say you’re not forgiven
it’s been said that you don’t really know someone until you’ve had a fight with them. it may also be true that you don’t know if you love someone until you’ve had to forgive them.much is made in christian circles about how forgiveness should take place: do we forgive and forget? forgive but not forget? forget and not forgive? eschew these modern distinctions?the specifics of forgiveness may be up for debate. the requirement for forgiveness is not. we are to forgive as we’ve been forgiven 490 times whenever a brother asks.so what’s with christian marriages?why do so many marriages between christians fail? some spouses abandon their faith along with their marriage, but for those who don’t the disconnect between the clear teaching of jesus on the issue of forgiveness and the dysfunction of so many christian relationships is puzzling.christians are obligated to love one another - even if they are married. - hauerwaswhile the command is simple and frequent, the application is by no means easy. but the idea that love (even of the marital kind) and discipleship should be easy is at best misleading and at most destructive. what better way to mirror the redemptive love and divine forgiveness than in stories and examples of radical, relationship-changing love that confounds expectations? what better witness to a broken world than the repair of marriages through forgiveness? what better way to encourage the growth and development of your spouse and marriage than creating a culture where forgiveness is assumed — though not taken for granted — and people are free to be who they are and better themselves.that christians should love their neighbor is paramount and well known. unfortunately many find it easier to forgive people they don’t have frequent contact with and a more difficult time showing love through forgiveness to those closest to them.we are to love our neighbor. most of us don’t have a more constant neighbor than the person we’re married to. - dale hartmanlove means that the desire to forgive needs to overwhelm the desire to feel right or to feel wronged. this may take time – years perhaps – but it’s what we’re called to do.i close with some parting advice a 90-year-old grandmother shared on the health of her marriage.my cousin asked, “grandma, what’s the best thing you ever did for your marriage?”she thought about it for a minute and then said, “each night, before we fell asleep, we would turn to each other and say, ‘i’m sorry if i hurt you today. i love you.’”the initial point about not knowing if you love someone until you need to forgive them is up for debate. it could be that we have to forgive others, and strangers, for not meeting our expectations of who they should be. it could be that some have to forgive god for not being or doing what they’d like. it could be that the whole point is wrong.

“marriage is increasingly the big sociological divide in american life. getting and staying married makes you part of a privileged elite.as charles murray documents in his 2012 book “coming apart,” that divide tracks the income divide, with low-income whites much less likely to be married than their high-income counterparts. (i criticized a different aspect of murray’s book in this column.) the causality is debatable. maybe poorer people have a harder time getting married. maybe being married makes it easier to earn more. maybe some third factor causes both phenomena. but what is clear is that you’re most likely to have a better life if you’re married — even if, it turns out, you get cancer.”
