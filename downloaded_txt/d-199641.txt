exceptional customer service
having bought and built a unit from the guildford store i couldnt get the bottom drawer to close so went back to the shop for advice. the assistant took out all of the drawers in the display unit so i could check how the rails were supposed to look on the inside and by a process of elimination worked...

tatami mats 
bought a pair of tatami mats to fit in an ikea tarva bed. they fit perfectly in the size double  and provide a great platform for my shikifuton. mats seem well made and will hopefully last a long while. the mats have a smell similar to grain when new, but should mellow out in time.

really easy to order the fabric samples…
really easy to order the fabric samples and to see what they would look like in our room. we ordered sofa covers and it has transformed our tired looking futon to look like a new piece of furniture.

futon company oak wide stacking cube
excellent product at a really good price.
it's hard to find lp holder made of real wood at a reasonable price. i then came across these stacking cubes made from real oak which fitted the space i had and big enough to hold my lps comfortably.
16 january 2025







really knowledgeable and helpful
really knowledgeable and helpful, ensuring you buy the best and right product for you.  one off putting moment was having one member of staff begin to assist, which was then taken over by the owner (understable as they were more experience and knowledgeable so knew more to provide advice), and then another...
