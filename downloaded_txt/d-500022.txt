shorten homes celebrates #1 builder status
with a commitment to customer satisfaction and a forward-thinking approach, shorten homes has not only earned accolades but also the trust and admiration of our customers across pennsylvania, new york and new jersey. our most recent successes in 2022 and 2023 is a testament to our dedication to excellence and innovation in the field of modular home construction.  
known for cutting-edge design, quality building practices, and unparalleled craftsmanship, shorten homes has revolutionized the concept of modular homes. our homes are not only aesthetically pleasing but also highly functional, energy-efficient, and tailored to meet the diverse needs of modern homeowners. 




























what we do
everything from start to finish






tailor madewe specialize in creating, designing, and building plans from the ground up. we will bring your dream home to life in a few months – only possible because of our sales team with a combined 60 years of experience. no matter how complex, shorten homes has built countless custom homes over the years in state-of-the-art indoor factories.



options overloadwe know firsthand how overwhelming, yet exciting, building a new home can be. whether structural or cosmetic, options are often the most important element to you. we will guide you along the way through our huge catalog of kitchen, bathroom, exterior, and interior materials and designs to ensure we build you the perfect home.



worry-free warrantyeach and every one of our homes comes with a 10-year protection plan, covering you from any major structural defects over the course of the warranty period. we have always stood behind our product, and this plan is not something you get from any other builder.





superior wallswe exclusively use superior walls®, a corporation that excels in world class, patented foundations in 4, 8, 9, and 10 foot heights. these walls are pre-cast and built in a controlled facility, and are fully insulated, prepped for both drywall and electrical tie ins. there isn’t a better foundation out there, and better yet – they are installed on-site in less than one day.



turnkey experiencewe always give you the option of completing your own sitework and applying for your building and zoning permits. most of the time however, we take care of everything from start to finish. rather than buy an existing fixer-upper or manage the day-to-day operations on a construction site, you take ownership of a brand-new, custom-built home that is move in ready in a few short months



exceptional serviceour commitment to service starts the moment you step through our doors. it continues throughout your home buying process, during the construction phase, and we always complete a thorough walkthrough of your home with you right before you move in. we extend this service to you long after you move in, taking care of any issues or defects, free of charge.
