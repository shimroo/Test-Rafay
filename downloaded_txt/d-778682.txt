effective january 1, 2017, new laws in the state of california permit the construction of accessory dwelling units (adus), or "granny flats" as they are commonly known. this means that those who own a home, and have sufficient space in their yard, or accommodating structural area, are able to invest in a second residential unit on their existing premises. as an investment, this could mean several thousand dollars in easy monthly incomeâa welcome addition to anybody's retirement fund, or even to help defray the substantial mortgage payments on today's housing. mulholland institute provides outreach and educational services to cities. call us for more information: 818-712-9500
