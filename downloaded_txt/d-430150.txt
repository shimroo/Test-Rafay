the disabled workers co-operative is a registered charity that helps disabled people to help themselves. our aim is twofold - to raise the independence of disabled people  by enabling them to take an active role in the economy and achieve a greater sense of self-worth and also to raise awareness of the contribution that disabled people can make to society. 
the disabled workers co-operative receives no central or government funds and is dependent on donations to keep its projects going. if you have found our services useful please consider supporting the work we are doing by making a donation.
on-line database of the skills, services and products disabled people have to offer. disabled individuals and companies or organisations employing a significant number of disabled people in meaningful employment are able to register the skills, products or services they have to offer free on the disabled workers database. the database is free for anyone to use.
