											where can i see the best swimsuit designs in action?
									 	

olympians always know where it's at
if it is a summer olympics year, then you are sure to find what is hot in the swimsuit fashion world. swimwear designers know that the athletes will bring their line a lot of attention, so many request that their suits be worn. men's swimwear changes more than you'd think from one year to the next. divers and swimmers are always dressed in the finest brand names. trends in women's swimwear are evident during the olympics, too, just like tennis divas show us what's hot in athletic wear.

											what is in style this season with women's swimwear?
									 	

retro is the way to go
this year, look for women's swimsuits to be modeled after 1950's glam. the retro look has been spotted all over hollywood, with movie starlets opting for vintage dior and the like. swimwear is no exception. polka dots, halter tops, skirted suits, you name it. the great news for many women is that plus size swimsuits look great in a retro style. sexy women were fuller figured back then, like marilyn monroe and betty page. everyone wins with retro bathing suits!

											where can i find last season's designer swimsuits?
									 	

you can find anything on ebay
looking for designer swim suits that you admired two seasons ago? no, it's not a fashion faux pas, it's retro! but where to find it when it has left all retail stores and outlets? go online. think of the internet as a vintage shop for your designer swimwear shopping needs. if you've had your eye on that zebra pattern armani wrap it's entirely possible you'll find it online or on an online auction site.

											what brand can the whole family wear to the beach or pool?
									 	

long live the speedo!
speedos aren't strictly reserved for olympic swimmers. in fact, the speedo line offers a vast array of products for women, children, and men. you will also find designer accessories such as sunglasses, swimming caps, and goggles. women have a selection of one-piece swim suits and bikinis, as well as wraps and covers. men will have just as big of a selection in accessories… and yes, the tiny little briefs, too.

											what kind of plus size swimsuits are available?
									 	

plus size can be just as hip and sexy
if you're a plus size man or woman and are concerned about modeling a swimsuit this season, have no fear; there are plenty of designers who make swimwear suitable and flattering for plus size women and men. search online for plus size swimwear, or if you're comfortable with one particular designer, search for their recent swimwear designs.
