“i can’t say enough good things about camp ballibay. my kids have made amazing friends, look forward to going back each year, eat healthier than they do at home, and come back inspired, relaxed, happy and more mature. i don’t know how they do it… i’m just glad they do…and honored that my kids get to go. it will be one of the things i look back on as a parent, pat myself on the back, and say, “you did good by your kids.”— parent
