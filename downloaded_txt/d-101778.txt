forum support
if you need assistance of any kind please email april.boudreau@allbrands.com. i generally respond within 24-48 hours but will always respond. if you do not receive a response your email probably came back to me as undeliverable. spam filters set on high often reject emails from forum programs.  you will have to set your settings lower to receive my responses.
