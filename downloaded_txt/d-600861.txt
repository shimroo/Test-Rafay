event report by slip n’ slide
helmingham hall 2016
last weekend sxoc attended a car show within the exquisite grounds of helmingham hall.






























































the stand was full and nothing failed to disappoint! it was scorching weather with amazing cars from ferrari’s to 200sx’s!
as you may have seen, the club was on form with the banter. this time it was daz’s turn as usual to be the “butt” of the joke, as couple of members decided to decorate his car as a welcome back initiation, after almost 3 years of it being off the road  – click here for his project thread. – http://sxoc.com/vbb/showthread.php?441292-my-s14a-build/
here are some of the pictures of our tomfoolery.














there was plenty to see and do as always, a concourse run for a few cars with the owners speaking about each one, a country dancing display and a falconry show where, as per every year, one of the birds wouldn’t come down from a tree! something for all the family and trade stands too.
i along with others got majorly sunburnt so let ‘the boy’ chill out in the shade (aka the boot).
by 4pm most people had left apart from a few hardcore show goers that went for a stroll around the acres of gardens.
thanks to all that came and of course to helmingham hall who were as always amazing hosts and a credit to car events, it all ran very smoothly. until next year, helmingham.
see you there!

japfest 2016
japfest 2016 at silverstone. it was the first big show of 2016 and besides the nightmare of a new ticket system that chris had to deal with, what an awesome start to the show season for the club.
sxoc at japfest 2016
 
considering the date being a month earlier than usual we pulled together and managed to have over 30 cars on show and some extremely nice examples at that!

it was good to see a nice mix of s-bodies including s13’s, s14’s, s14a’s, a ps13, a sil80 and an s15.
we even had the pleasure of def’s rx8!!!
silverstone did a great job of hosting the event and the bdc drifters put on some incredible drift demo’s so a huge thanks to them.
thank you all for attending and hope to see you all again at more events throughout the year. and a massive thanks to chriscooke for organising as it wouldn’t of happened without you.
cheers,
rich aka pointz
