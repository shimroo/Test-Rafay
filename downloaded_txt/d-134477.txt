what makes a saint leo education so transformative?let our community tell you!










"saint leo's online mba program in supply chain management provided me the opportunity for flexible learning alongside other supply chain professionals in my industry. with this mba, i expanded upon educational and professional abilities within the field of supply chain operations."

paige holt- mba student specializing in supply chain managementpaige is one of our mba students who has taken full advantage of the opportunities offered by saint leo's online mba program in supply chain management.

















“learning ignites my passion to seek and find information that intrigues my soul, spirit, and mind. education at saint leo university has had an extremely positive influence on my life and my development as a person. it has made me more confident and enabled me to steer into my destiny. saint leo university has provided me with different learning experiences that has enabled me to branch out and work with people effectively. it has helped me develop a great amount of self-discipline and, aside from teaching me some very important life skills, saint leo university has opened many doors for my future.” 

karen sislava reyes - master of science in accounting karen came to saint leo from flagler college where she earned her undergraduate accounting degree.  karen has worked as an intern for cliftonlarsonallen. she plans on sitting for the cpa exam this year and will then pursue a doctorate degree.

















''as a graduate now pursuing my masters of science in accounting, i’m even more thankful for how well saint leo equipped me and not just educationally but as a leader, student, and even on a personal level. it is truly a privilege to have been taught by professors whose efforts go beyond the classroom.”

tayhana taylor - undergrad bachelor of science- accountingtayhana has completed four prestigious internships, including two with the big 4 cpa firms of ernst & young and deloitte in new york city. these internships were highly competitive, and tayhana engaged in both audit and tax while in these roles, gaining experience with leading-edge accounting protocols. she has been offered a full-time position with deloitte in 2025. tayhana has published three articles with faculty in the tapia college of business. the most recent titled, "the impact of covid-19 on the airline industry," was published in the journal of finance and accountancy in fall 2023

















saint leo university has truly been a stepping stone for me. when i entered this university 4 years ago, i was unaware of what i’d be like when i left. now, 3 weeks away from graduating, i am so thankful that i was a student here. your time at saint leo university is what you make of it, and saint leo students are provided with so much opportunity to succeed.

o'shea williams - bachelor of arts developmental psychology

















“saint leo is not just an academic institution, it’s a formation institution. saint leo embraced me for who i am, showed faith that i could be my best, and solidified the light that was shining within me.”

charles onyeneke ’17 university campus, theology

















“as a child, my great-grandmother taught me how to pray and to lean on god. saint leo inspired us all to learn with compassion and reminded me to keep the faith.”

brent patterson ’21 center for online learning, religious studies
