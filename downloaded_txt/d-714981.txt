best dek tip:
brings 'em to life! 
					        flock heads & tails -flock has the same light reflecting properties of feathers.

					        white paint under uv light, looks black. white flocking holds its color.

why buy aero products?


aero's quest is to provide 
							   products to increase waterfowlers success; 
							  to finish off ducks and geese more efficiently,
							  
							  due to the realism in the innovative, unique 
							  products. 
							  especially late season wary birds.
