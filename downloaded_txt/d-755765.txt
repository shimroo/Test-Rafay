the black cow coffee co. 

  

a community gathering place












 


















the heart of the community since 1995



 

michael and peggy grant opened the black cow on a wing and a prayer in 1995. they had two young children at the time, peggy was working as a nurse and michael as a contractor, and there were more than a few people who thought they were a little crazy to believe they could make a living selling cups of coffee. but they were able to do that and so much more. since opening, the black cow has become the heart of our community in croton, and has expanded to build more community in pleasantville and at phelps hospital. after twenty five years, michael and peggy have retired to vermont to live out their other dream of doing nothing in a bucolic setting, and they are passing the torch on to close family and dear friends. in croton, zoe (their youngest child) has returned to carry on the tradition of early morning cups and warm conversations. in pleasantville, michele (long time manager and face of the store) is nurturing the family of customers there as she has been doing for the past few years. and at phelps hospital, amanda (michael’s niece and forever friendly face at all the stores) is carrying on with the tight knit community she has built among the hospital staff. no matter the faces behind the counter, our goal will continue to be, as it has always been, to take care of and nourish these communities that we love so much.
