 we are
brinkers food b.v.
brinkers food b.v. was founded by bernardus brinkers in 1889 and was originally a small margarine trading company. in those days, margarine was a new product used as a replacement for the more expensive butter. in 1927, brinkers’ first margarine factory was opened.
shortly after the second world war, one of brinkers’ sons started a new venture introducing a brand new product: a chilled cocoa butter, carrying the brand name choba. this product was the first chocolate spread ever on the market. today, choba is still a well-known product on the dutch market. in the early sixties, choba was followed by nusco, the now classic hazelnut chocolate spread. in 1993, a new factory was built in enschede, holland, introducing the latest technology available and complying with the highest quality standards. in 2019, brinkers’ realized its new distribution centre, creating 2.500 square meter of warehouse capacity.
