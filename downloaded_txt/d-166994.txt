freshwater free solarheating chlorine-free swimming lifetime guarantees



















â© 21 nov 2024













    a swimming pool is basically
"a hole in the ground filled with water"
it's up to you to decide how to contain the water
...

    * spray-concrete
    pools have strong, traditional looks
    ... but can be very expensive, 

    * fibreglass pools are nice looking ...
    - but limited to sizes and floor shapes  that don't suit everybody ...

cascade pools have:

* 
      a lifetime expectation
* amazing non-slip interior
  * large colour choice interior 
    * reasonable middle-range costs
    * unlimited shape & size - your choice
    *     both chemical chlorine-free swimming
    * are trouble-free and maintenance-free
    * high-density reinforced concrete shells    
    *
    attractive-looking alternative to fiberglass
    * fifty-three years of building home swimming pools
   
* twenty-five thousand new pools and refurbs over the years! 


    and ...



 
1. engineered hybrid construction 
      and custom shapes that last, 

2. with size & depths to your needs, 
        
        reasonably priced, cascade pool sizes 
are measured water wall-to-wall 

3. pools twice as long as the width ...
        the cascade "golden rectangles" look right...
        standard pool sizes: 
        (in meters)


3.0 x 6.0 


3.6 x 7.2


4.8 x 9.6


5.6 x 11.2 


7.2 x 14.4


19.6 x 39.2


        ... or "whatever size and depth you want"!
        


4. our insulated pools trap 
        "free" solar heat, 


      5. lowest owner maintenance, 
and family chlorine-free swimming!

          a natural process "uv" oxidisation
 eliminates bacteria & germs, salt, and vastly 
         reduces the need 
         for nasty pool chemicals. 



         it's not very well known 
         that a mineral or salt water pool
         ... is actually a "chlorine" pool?
         and that in 1972 ... 
         cascade industries introduced 
         
         to new zealand
         and the world 
         the first mass-produced home pool         
         "salt water chlorinators"!
 
         a kiwi first!

         but since 2002, cascade  switched to uv pools 
         that 
         don't have the         "chlorine smell"         or 
            bleached hair, 



- just ...
    


    yes! a chemical-free swimming pool!

here's some information from the founders 
                      of cascade swimming pools (nz) ltd..



                      laurence e (larry) ogden and robert rankin smith (uk)  in 1973

discussing how to cope with the rush of kiwis wanting to get a cascade pool
                     rob went back to the uk in 1979 and my family and i have been providing kiwi's 
                    home swimming pools ever since - 54 years!

tens of thousands of cascade swimming pools!





since november 1971, cascade swimming pool's installations in auckland and new zealand 
                     total tens of thousand of home pools (more than 25,000 in fact), so its fair to say that 
                     probably no other new zealand pool construction company has more experience 
                    building home swimming pools than us!
                    


our incredible aquagenie skimmer system combined with 
                      ozone-max water sterilisation, 
                     ozone assist algaecide and 90mm infillfoam 
                     refrigeration grade insulation which 
                     ensures that new zealand's predominant free heat source 
                     
                     (i.e. the sun) virtually gives you a 
                     free solar power boost to your pool heating.
                     our hybrid-concrete pool structure 
                     and long-lasting 
                     aqua-flex interior is the 
                     best you can get in a home swimming pool!

                     ozone and ozone assist algaecide are simple to use 
                     
                     - and 0800 cascade telephone tips 
                     from the cascade experts on pool service,
minimise or eliminate the need for any sanitizer 
                     - for months at a time. 
                     
                     just 
                     occasional shock treatments, (aka super chlorination) 
                     is all you need. 
                     and free membership 
                     of our on-line pool owner's club
                    explains a lot. 

                  thanks for reading ...

                     kind regards,
