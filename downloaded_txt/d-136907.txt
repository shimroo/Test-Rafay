crowe's controversial "aloha" co-stars hawaiian independence leader hollywood progressive, june 6, 2015       "oh, honest americans, as christians hear me for my downtrodden people! their form of government is as dear to them as yours is as precious to you. quite warmly as you love your country, so they love theirs. with all your goodly possessions, covering a territory so immense that there yet remain parts unexplored, possessing islands that, although new at hand, had to be neutral ground in time of war, do not covet the little vineyard of naboth's, so far from your shores, lest the punishment of ahab fall upon you, if not in your day, in that of your children, for"be not deceived, god is not mocked." the people to whom your fathers told of the living god, and taught to call "father," and now whom the sons now seek to despoil and destroy, are crying aloud to him in their time of trouble; and he will keep his promise, and will listen to the voices of his hawaiian children lamenting for their homes."  - lili`uokalani, last queen of hawai`i  "the united states is just - a land of liberty. the people there are the friends - the great friends of the weak. let us tell them - let us show them that as they love their country and would suffer much before giving it up, so do we love our country, our hawai'i, and pray that they do not take it from us."  - mrs. emma nawahi,
