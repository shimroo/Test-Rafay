 			brian and cassie literally worked together to save my life. i was looking at a minimum of 10 years and up to 25 years in prison. i was a repeat offender who struggled with mental health illness and substance abuse disorder. i was ready to give up on life. however, they chose to believe in me and see the good in me. thanks to their efforts i was given treatment via mental health court rather than prison. i‚Äôm now 2 1/2 years clean. i travel the country meeting with state agencies and legislators on the importance of restorative justice. i work with lawmakers to find viable solutions that work to rehabilitate rather than just punish. there isn‚Äôt any other attorney you would rather have to fight your case. every single dollar was well spent. if you‚Äôre looking for an attorney that will offer you up to the state because they are cheaper, then this isn‚Äôt your team. but if you want someone who is prepared to fight for you in the trenches then this is who you want. i‚Äôve been in and out of the system my entire life with over 10 years in the florida department of corrections. never have i had counsel who fought for me as hard as they did. they believed in me when i didn‚Äôt believe in myself. brian and cassie are top notch. i promise you will not be disappointed.			read moreread less

 			case dismissed! that was the great news i received two days ago from brian. i'd heard he's good, but this news exceeded all expectations. i was arrested and charged with possession of methamphetamine when the police found it in my glove compartment. i was floored, because i was certain i had not placed it there. i had a nagging feeling i knew who did, but couldn't prove it. the car is in my name. i knew i needed an attorney, but not just any attorney. i had been to prison before and this would be serious if i was convicted. i researched the reviews of several attorney's, and was impressed by what former clients had said about brian and his legal assistant cassandra. i took the plunge. it was one of the best decisions i've ever made. i called and spoke first with cassandra. had she not identified herself as brian's legal assistant, i'd have sworn i was speaking to an attorney. smart and sharp, competent and thorough. she is who sold me on this incredible team. upon hiring them, cassandra wasted no time diving in to every aspect and detail of my case. she called me often with questions regarding the traffic stop. she watched the body cam videos, researched controlling case law on point with how long the stop was allowed to take, then handed over her findings to brian. brian reviewed the evidence and found several ways the ft. pierce police department had bungled the traffic stop and subsequent investigation of my case. he wrote an incredible suppression motion on my behalf that the state attorney would have a hard time responding to. in fact, in the end, they didn't respond at all. they capitulated. they knew they couldn't win. they dismissed my case. look, this what i really want prospective clients to understand. you can hire an attorney who will save you a few bucks, or go with one of the several legal mills who will do little work and sell you out for the best deal they can get you. but when that happens remember i warned you. lastly, but far from a footnote to this story, is the hidden gem in the office. her name is heather. she is the office administrative assistant. she is the backbone. heather is a competent multitasker who coordinates all the tedious nuances and smoothes out the headaches, seemingly effortlessly, which makes the office run like a well oiled machine. it is because of heather that brian and cassandra are free to plow forward with your case. take heed to all i've said. you won't regret your decision. hire team brian before it's too late!			read moreread less

 			brian, cassandra. and heather were a blessing from the lord! we have spoken to several different attorneys throughout this ordeal, but none have been as profesional and yet courteous and understanding as they. you cannot ask a question that they will not try their best to address, and they will in no way make one feel uncomfortable or inferior. they made a difficult situation much more bearable, and they are easily accesible and promptly respond to calls. emails, etc... we never once felt like they were treating our loved one like another "case" but that they were committed to do everything legally possible to ensure the best outcome one could expect. finding a profesional who loves people and their work, more than a paycheck in these days is not an easy task, but we are convinced that god put it all together! so brian, we thank you for your expertise, and sincerity from day one. we would not hesitate to recommend you to anyone. cassandra, we almost felt like we knew you when it was over, sad in a way, because we considered you a friend. such a joy to deal with, always answering calls or emails, going out of your way to help our loved one! heather, you brighten any day because you are always positive and cordial, and never once answered in an abrasive or unkind way. not much more we say other than, "thank you all so much!" any person who finds himself/herself in a bad place with the law would be making a wise decision by reaching out to brian h. mallonee!			read moreread less
