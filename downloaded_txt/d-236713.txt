mountains of love: please help  if you can!





a go fund me campaign
            from melissa weezy hughes, a friend of billy bob

click here to make a donation.



my hometown of marion, nc (30 miles east of asheville) was greatly impacted by hurricane helene. the surrounding areas to include asheville, black mountain, chimney rock, and spruce pine are all destroyed. the devastation is completely unbelievable and people’s lives are greatly impacted.








              the media has not reported on this situation properly. this disaster should be highlighted and funding and resources should be readily available to help the thousands upon thousands that are stranded without power, water, and necessities. the death toll is higher than what is being reported; thousands are still missing. western nc needs your help!








            tom and i have met so many people in this country and around this world. i am asking for your help now. i realize the economic situation for most americans is dire. i wouldn’t ask if i didn’t personally know the places that were once so beautiful and prospering. (our communities had worked so incredibly hard over the years to strengthen and offer multitudes of tourists a chance to visit these beautiful mountains i call home.)







            this is not a situation from which will take months to recover, it will take years. these proceeds will go to supplies, home and business repair, families in need, and a multitude of other outlets to help. one hundred percent of these donations will be applied toward this cause.







            i thank you from the bottom of my heart for every penny received. if we can give “mountains of love” to people in need, it only makes us and this world a better place.❤️
