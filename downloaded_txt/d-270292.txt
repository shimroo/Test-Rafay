"studio visit"





 not long ago lynda keeler invited me to her studio to see her new suite of oil paintings "between the sun & the moon." before i left i wrote a poem. i guess she liked it because when i got to her opening tonite at janssen art space i saw that she wrote it out by hand on a wall between her work.now that's a thrill.

alice ripley





 when alice ripley was a student at kent state i was a special collections librarian. i saw her in many shows on campus. & since i've always been a collector i had all those programs. so after her cabaret 88 performance last nite i got to visit her in her dressing room where i gave her those programs.

bat shit crazy





 the rfk jr. hearings have put this term into constant replay. it had me wondering what it's origin is.we have bats on property & they usually delight. abt 6 years ago i startd a poem calld "nite swim" like this:            little draculas            swoop down            toward pool            but            i feel            no menacei simply don't know what abt bat excrement is crazy. i began searching. there is much speculation abt the term's origin. it seems to derive from "bats in the belfry" which traces to circa 1900. however that doesn't answer the shit element of the expression. there is "anecdotal evidence" that is dates to the 1950s where it appears in the us military. the oed has a confusing entry putting it at 1950 but as another term for "bullshit." others give credit to various writers & a cartoonist.whatever its birth & precise meaning the term has a certain power & current daily usage concerning what's happening in washington.

cabaret 88





 we have this fabulous series at the theater at our art museum. talent from broadway comes to town to perform. & instead of that large theater space the stage is convertd into the kind of boîte i remember from years ago in nyc.the other nite i heard noah j. ricketts (currently in "the great gatsby"). you may remember him from "fellow travelers." he's as good at storytelling as singing. & he was in a drop-dead suit. & then yesterday i encounterd him in town & got a photo together.
