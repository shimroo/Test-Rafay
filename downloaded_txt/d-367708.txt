welcome to peppertree rescue
founded in 1999, peppertree rescue is a 501(c)3 nonprofit corporation that finds homes for dogs in need that have the character and temperament commonly associated with the friendly and peaceful nature of golden retrievers.
while we are a recognized golden retriever rescue and member of the golden retriever club of america national rescue committee, we do not focus on goldens alone - we are an all breed rescue dedicated to finding good dogs good homes - regardless of breed, age, size or health.
whether you are visiting our site in hopes of adopting, volunteering, or donating – welcome and thank you for your support!
