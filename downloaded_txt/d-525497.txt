somatyping is a system of classifying human body types and shapes. developed by william sheldon, american psychologist and author of the atlas of man, the system classifies humans by the natural, genetically predetermined body build, appearance and temperament.

eight weeks into your 'diet', even though your abs were beginning to show, your energy levels are a lot lower than they used to be. plus, your mind is starting to think about 'food'. not chicken, sweet potatoes, or green beans, but of dipping a chocolate bar into a bowl of ice-cream!

as you and i know we have all been blessed with different body types. some may think of their derrière as a blessing, while other would rather say their rear is a curse!

you know that you have to eat several times, so why is that that so many people leave their meal planning to the last minute and wonder why they can never follow a healthy nutrient rich diet?
