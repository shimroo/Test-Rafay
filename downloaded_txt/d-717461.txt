our pastors 











 







“calvary baptist church seeks to honor god and love others.” 



we believe a church is a place to know and be known, to find models for you to follow, to allow others to see how you’ve had victory and learn from your experiences how better to glorify god. at calvary, we are seeking to be that kind of a place, to be that kind of a people. join us as we seek to exalt jesus… together!lead pastor greg linscott associate pastor jonathan eads
