inspiring confidence and respectthe mission of abby’s closet, an oregon-based nonprofit, is to inspire confidence and respect in high school women by providing free formal dresses for prom or other memorable events.  we’re more than a dress – or really, more than the 40,000 dresses we’ve given away so far – because we’re just as focused on sequins and satin as we are on education, confidence, and inclusiveness.
