brock lesnar: bio


 


	glory to the conqueror, the beast incarnate, the anomaly or whatever godlike title you choose to bestow upon brock lesnar. surely, this creature fits each and every one of them.

	possessing the type of staggering strength and frightening intensity seen only among superman villains, this 6-foot-3, 266-pound freak of nature from minneapolis, minn., has forced his way to the top of every major combat sport. he won the ncaa division i collegiate wrestling championship as a senior at the university of minnesota, the wwe championship within six months of his debut and the ufc heavyweight title in his fourth professional mma fight. he also became the one in 21-1. plain and simple, the man was built to destroy.

	first scouted by wwe officials while smashing his way through the college wrestling ranks, lesnar debuted on raw march 18, 2002, and singlehandedly destroyed a ring full of unfortunate superstars. from that night on, the domination was unrepentant. with the sinister paul heyman guiding his career, “the next big thing” won the king of the ring tournament and beat the rock to win the wwe title — becoming the youngest wwe champion in history at that time and the fastest-rising star sports-entertainment had ever seen.

	the freight-train momentum of lesnar didn’t stall one bit after a layoff of nearly 10 years. when the beast’s sojourn in ufc ended, he returned to wwe in 2012 firing on all cylinders, battling the very best wwe has to offer and achieving the impossible at wrestlemania 30 when he became the first superstar to defeat the undertaker on the grandest stage of them all. countless monumental wins followed, as lesnar wrecked john cena at summerslam 2014, decisively defeated randy orton via tko at summerslam 2016, goldberg at wrestlemania 33, roman reigns at wrestlemania 34 and longtime rival cain velasquez at wwe crown jewel. 

	brock lesnar is the man who conquered the streak. and john cena. and randy orton. and seth rollins. and many, many more to come.
