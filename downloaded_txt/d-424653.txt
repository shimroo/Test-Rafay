“ luxury rental accomodations in scottsdale & phoenix ”

 







creative condo is the perfect alternative to extended stay hotels.



world class golf  & resorts are close by.


furnished condos are just like a regular apartment or condo except that they come with furnishings and appliances. they are similar to hotels, though they are typically more "homey" and comfortable. unlike hotels which may only have a kitchenette, furnished condos do have a full room dedicated as a kitchen.
when it comes down to it, a furnished condo is less expensive than a hotel room, and it offers more of a comfortable setting. this can be very important to those traveling on business or families who are on vacation. if cost, comfort and security are important to you, a furnished condo is your best option.
visit or vacation the valley of the sun and stay in one of our luxurious furnished rentals.

great views and location. i loved the fact that i could go for a run and walk on the trail next to the golf course. close to shopping, hiking, and biking. i spent 4 months here before buying a home. highly recommend working with michael. he is very responsive.

i needed to be in arizona for work over the summer. it was super hot, but anasazi and michael made my stay super cool! the centrally located complex is in the heart of everything, walking or driving. one minor maintenance issue was handled immediately and with care. a real class operation.

lovely, comfortable condo! enjoyed our long-term stay immensely, with tremendous service from the rental agent. super location near the mall and many, many other services. beautiful complex with many trees. highest recommendation!!

													pam w

												




i spent 3 months at this property for a temporary work assignment, and i was very happy with the accommodation. the location was very convenient, with freeway access a few blocks away and major shopping complexes within a block or 2. the property manager was extremely helpful, with an immediate response to any question i had. i would definitely stay here again!
