our philosophythe hanna fenichel center for child development, founded in 1975, advocates for the primacy of play-based learning as a vital conduit for children to construct their own understanding of the world. we perceive the child not merely as a learner but as an active protagonist in their educational journey. through rich social interactions and project-based investigations, our educators adeptly facilitate the exploration of children's innate curiosities. our educational philosophy is deeply influenced by the esteemed reggio emilia approach, which underscores the interconnectedness of social, emotional, intellectual, creative, and physical development in fostering the overall well-being of young children. we are committed to creating an enriching environment that honors and nurtures these diverse facets of growth, ensuring that each child's unique path to knowledge is not only recognized but celebrated.
