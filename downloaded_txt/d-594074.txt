posted on february 2, 2025sundance film festival:  local motion:  interview with destiny 

by katharine elizabeth monahan huntley

the self-proclaimed “queen of sundance”  rhoslc:  lisa barlow
when you’ve made arrangements in years past to attend the park city film festivals (sundance, slamdance, x-dance, et cetera) over the martin luther king, jr. holiday weekend, it might not occur to you to check the current year’s dates until well after you’ve made your reservations and it’s much too late to change.
upon horrified realization of your park city faux pas, the only thing to do is your finest hayley mill’s pollyanna impression and go.
the following is a 2005 interview with the vibrant destiny grose (and brief interjection by dennis wong), in a quest to find out how utah’s historic silver mining town and world-renowned ski resort prepares for ten days of film fanaticism. destiny is the theater critic for the park city record and president of the park city film series board, her self-deprecating claim to fame is “destiny’s 10 days in the dark” — film festival reviews on local radio station kpcw.
lines: how did your moniker come about?
destiny: the one year i saw fifty-five films in the ten days . . . i will never do that again. at sundance, viewing 5+ films a day isn’t that uncommon, but day after day it’s a killer. there is talk of an energy drink sponsor following me around. the pitch would be that only by consuming the “_____” energy drink could it be accomplished. with my luck i’d die of a heart attack from all that caffeine!
lines: how does park city prep for the attack of the la/ny people in black (pibs)?
destiny: tons of water is ordered. and sushi. one year, a laundromat in town ran a special on all black loads. wash at a reduced price — just a way to joke around and get the employees psyched.
dennis: the high school students pay $50 for annual parking passes. during sundance, a few entrepreneurs sell their passes for $250.
lines: how do the locals feel about the film festivals?
destiny: people that embrace the film festival are in for an exciting time — it’s one of the major cinematic moments in the world. i advise locals to go see ten, or at least two, movies. there are star sightings in the grocery store. if you see someone wearing a dangling pass, ask if they have a movie in the festival. you’ll feel part of it, even if you don’t have the opportunity to screen one. get into the spirit of sundance. hang out on main street. there are masses of people — it’s alive, exhilarating. i would prefer nine months of sundance people to the two months of summer tourists. unfortunately, this year i’m seeing fewer movies.
lines: why is that?
destiny: it’s getting harder and harder to buy tickets. just look on ebay. tickets for this year’s the upside of anger are offered at $500. on the plus side, there’s more time to hang out on main street — go to the sundance house, or an alt festival like x-dance. see what’s going on.  one year an rv held a soft-core porn fest — pasties on the headlights — just one example of the many rogue film festivals you can find in park city.
lines: what happens after the festivals leave town?
destiny: a couple of days afterwards, the sundance institute screens a few of the festival films which is great for residents to catch up on what they might have missed. they also show films in the summertime (about six from previous festivals) on an outdoor screen in the city park. another thing they do is work in conjunction with the park city film series (which is a separate entity) to bring a documentary from the festivals on the first thursday of the month.
it’s also great for festival-goers who arrive in town too early . . . at the park city library, we caught mike leigh’s perfectly bleak period piece vera drake. the titular character, her comfortable countenance secured by a home permanent wave, helps out girls who find themselves “in a bit of trouble.” a film set in britain’s 1950s, it is every bit as relevant in current scare tactics america. followed by cheeseburgers, chips, and guinness draughts at o’shucks — who needs sundance fancy?

pretty & darn quick reviews by various & sundry rabble rousers
“. . . she’s not even reviewing a film, she’s telling you how clever she is.”— all that jazz

• about a boy charming: the boy marcus. disarming: the boyish hugh. alarming: junior high, “lorena bobbit for surgeon general,” and the mournful mama marcus has on suicide watch. barmy brits and karmic bits make it “smooth and winning.”
• about schmidt another comedic lecture in professor payne’s american social studies course, or an overlong infomercial? i found it disconcerting that a commercial for childreach, the international child sponsorship organization that is jack nicholson’s character’s salvation, aired in the movie theater right before the critically lauded film began. admirable indeed, to “promote the rights and interests of the world’s children,” but, just as i like to choose my movies, i like to choose my charities.
that said, about schmidt offers an idiosyncratic look into middle-class middle american lives—character studies made unforgettable with an excellent ensemble cast àla citizen ruth and election.
• across the universe “have you seen it? it’s great. they’ve got stuff.” — eddie izzard for the benefit of mr. kite.
• adaptation “do i have an original thought?” when writer charlie kaufman questions his genius, the answer comes back in the form of a pastiche perfect follow-up to he and fellow original thinker spike jonze’ being john malkovich. catherine keener plays boggle!—an apt metaphor for kaufman and jonze’ mind game antics.
• alpha dog the ballad of jesse james hollywood: mama, don’t let your babies grow up to be drugstore cowboys.
• amélie a perfect parisian ensemble of innocence and cynicism.• arrested development step behind the orange curtain for a delicious balboa bar and a gob bluth bon mot: “these are lawyers. that’s latin for liar.”
• australia baz in oz. great expectations, punctured by over-inflation.
• babel the way of the gun.
• barton fink “i can’t start listening to the critics, and i can’t kid myself about my own work. a writer writes from his gut. his gut tells him what’s good, and what’s merely “adequate. . . . if i ran off to hollywood now, i’d be making money, going to parties, meeting the big shots, but i’d be cutting myself off . . . from the common man.”
• big fish fresh, charming, delightful. suspend your disbelief, (as we must do in our lives). as balanchine said: “non-reality is the real thing.”
• big love (polygamous ring around the rosie) and saved! (jc grl and her girl gang for jesus) both use the beach boys’ “god only knows” for a theme song. acdc’s “dirty deeds done dirt cheap” might be more àpropos.
• the big picture this 1989 gem should be required viewing for every film school grad. once again, writer/director christopher guest proves he is ahead of his time:
building manager: you know who used to live here?nick: no, i don’t.building manager: take a guess. very famous.nick: clark gable?building manager: nope. guess again.nick: marilyn monroe?building manager: nope.nick: errol flynn?building manager: you give up?nick: i give up.building manager: chuck barris. the gong show guy.
• blades of glory boxers, briefs, or spectacular spandex?it’s no ice castles, or zoolander for that matter, still and all, just the concept of (ex) married couple will arnett and amy poehler playing brother and sister is comedy gold.
• blue crush: north shore, but with girls.
• boarding house: north shore punch drunk love.
• the bourne identity ready. set. go! ms. potente sprints through run lola run, then dashes with the dashing matt damon in doug liman’s stylin’ international thriller. next film out, franka says relax! or at least she should.• carnivàle there’s no biz like showbiz, even amidst titanic rust colored dust storms in depression era oklahoma:samson: i’m about to make you the offer of a lifetime. . . . how would you like a  career in showbizness?ben: what’s the wages?samson: nothing at first . . .tales told of the curious carnies’ code. divine duvall. john savage. john doe. samson the magnificent. god and babylon. . . . yes, join this circus.• catch me if you can runs long. the film’s trailer and titles con you into believing it’s a keen comic flick—a nifty 60s biopic of the fumbling fbi and a scam(p) on the lam. at its core, however, is a melancholy tap dance between father and son. still and all—a swell spin across 2 hours and 20.
• chicago bob fosse’s all that jazz is a rapturous musical feast—chicago, written by bill condon and directed by rob marshall (based on fosse’s stage version), is the razzmatazz cocktail to swill beforehand.
• cold mountain beautiful scenery, fantastic music, especially in church’s “space” singing. renee got all of the good lines (and the oscar). horrific battle scenes. a great diatribe against war, and what it can make normal people do, and it certainly exacerbates the already nastiness of terrible people. minghella talks of “tribalism” north vs south, and, even after all of these years, i found myself disliking southerners, despite my own southern roots.
• confessions of a dangerous mind with his latest endeavor, george clooney proves he possesses more than bankable good looks—he also has an uncanny talent for directing. utilizing genre-specific film techniques, clooney escorts the audience through the adventures of chuck barris’ life. there is a surprising subtlety to the tone and performances in this picture given the strange and often fantastic events therein. are the incidents real? viewers won’t care—they’ll just be happy to have been privy to the confessions.
• the curious case of benjamin button time-ravaged brad, ravishing timeless cate, moments borrowed from forrest galump, stolen moments from magnolia. it’s small fry in a big fish pond.
• the darjeeling limited if you must pack your bags for a guilt trip, you might as well have matching marc jacobs (for louis vuitton) monogrammed suitcases. and a laminator. all that’s missing is a tea set for frances.
• the dark knight christopher nolan’s sleek, yet long and winding road of a film is hijacked by heath, the rare avis behind the jocund joker — and gotham’s mighty maelstrom: “i believe what doesn’t kill you makes you stranger.” sigh.
• a decade under the influence auteurs articulate recollections of 70s films that were not just “canaries in a cage” — but viable life forces that effected cultural change. prescient to what would happen once they hit the big time are found in an exchange between peter fonda and dennis hopper’s characters in easy rider:peter: you know billy . . . we blew it.billy: what? . . . that’s what it’s all about, man. . . . i mean, you go for the big money and you’re free, you dig?peter: we blew it.gracious is the wish these “easy riders raging bulls” hold for the new generation of filmmakers who interview the filmmakers for the decade documentary: that is to continue to follow their dreams on the path of independence.
• donnie darko graham greene’s short story the destructors is the thematic thread tied to writer/director richard kelly ii’s exceptional indie film. to the purpose in these dark times.• down with love ewan mcgregor as catcher block may act like a dog in his hounds-tooth jacket, but he really is the cat’s pajamas in this spritz of a film that winks at the war between the sexes while it works its 60s fashion sense.
• dreamgirls jennifer holliday or jennifer hudson? each imbue girl group standout effie: one singular sensation.
• eight legged freaks add arachnophobia and tremors, subtract all campy humor and kevin bacon and you end up with eight legged freaks. a poor excuse for a “camp classic,” it has little going for it other than a stylized marketing campaign. the most entertaining thing about the entire ninety minutes was the guy who sat behind me interjecting comments like: “they cocooned his ass.” if only someone would have cocooned the asses of the filmmakers, i would have been spared this lame mutant spider mess.
• 8 mile director curtis hanson may have indulged in risky business hiring eminem as the imitation of the real slim shady’s life, but he sure played it safe with writer scott silver’s formulaic script. eminem acquits himself nicely as an actor, and is particularly good in the rare moments of humor (check out he and mekhi phifer’s rap to the tune of lynyrd skynyrd’s “sweet home alabama”). lacks the idiosyncratic characters of the fabulous wonder boys and the dark complexities of l.a. confidential, but you sure can’t beat the authenticity of the slammin’ soundtrack.
• entourage: one day in the valleydrama: vince, you know my policy. except for work, i only go to the valley november through march. and even then, only to sushi row.vince: c’mon johnny, go for me.drama: i’d better hydrate.by the episode’s end, drama realizes what all of us valley girls already know: “yeah, the valley ain’t so bad.”
• fantastic mr. fox truly scrumptious.
• far from heaven gorgeous costumes, technicolor-coordinated with the 1957 sets (julianne moore’s speckled winter coat matching the movie theater’s granite foyer is a stylish storytelling touch), illuminate ugly issues that have yet to be resolved. many women in this millennium either do not recall, or recognize, the feminist movement. ms. has reverted to mrs. without anyone batting a false eyelash. now that’s a real tearjerker.
• finding nemo disney’s dementia division: when pixar’s kids are bad, they’re horrid; remember vicious sid in toy story? dental (im)patient darla’s no darling in nemo; she and ditzy dory swim away with this undersea story.
• flight of the conchords watch this absurdist kiwi comedy, and you will burst into song, just like jemaine and bret: “you’re so beautiful, you could be an air hostess in the sixties.”
• glee “well, if you want to sing out, sing out/and if you want to be free, be free.”— cat stevens as featured in hal ashby’s harold and maude.  william mckinley the go-to school for glee and the e.l. konigsburg classic, jennifer, hecate, macbeth, william mckinley, and me, elizabeth.
• good night and good luck you stay classy george clooney.
• kathy griffin: my life on the d-list funny girl kathy is just like us. my case in point, in season 1, episode 5, the new york times photographer stephanie diani arrives to shoot the star for griffin’s “the red carpet’s bête noire” 2/27/05 article. stephanie okays the crooked tiara, suggests messy hair, and politely turns down kathy’s “any chance you can retouch the photo” entreaty — just as she did when i whined about the photo for oπe® & my “tivo, cable or satellite? choose that smart tv wisely” 9/5/04 interview (written by ken belson). not to worry, stephanie “baby, make me a star” diani does just that with her elegant eye and egalitarian camera.• gran torino cliché driven.
• the great gatsby (as referenced in best laid plans)bryce: so we have survey courses to start, american lit, brit lit, everything that should be taught in high school: hawthorne, james, fitzgerald.nick: “so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly with the past.” f. scott. great gatsby. that’s a book he wrote.bryce: we don’t actually read anything we teach. the department chair gives us cliff’s notes at the beginning of the semester, and we just say whatever’s in those.
• the grim reaper according to tv cult show dead like me, alice sebold’s the lovely bones, and woody’s latest scoop — the sweet hereafter ain’t so sweet. unresolved issues, investigations, and menial jobs take up valuable resting time. thank god for the black humor death informs.
• grindhouse guns, gals, ghouls, and gore a gogo! robert rodriguez and quentin tarantino’s double feature issues the following warnings:don’t blaspheme.don’t call a kiwi an aussie.don’t take rides from strangers.don’t mess with texas.(do, however, see planet terror and death proof, they’re supersonic.)• hamlet 2 “the play’s the thing” becomes more playful with a snackatorium and cricket in times square.
• harry potter and the chamber of secrets the trouble with harry potter isn’t harry at all—it is the action and events that transpire without enough exposition in a story that, ironically, is far too long. dobby, the jar jar binks-ish character, is an elfish irritant. moaning myrtle haunting the loo and kenneth branagh’s love affair with himself, however, are magical fun.
• heist david mamet’s capable caper flick. it’s not wordplay — it’s wordspar.
• the hoax richard gere moves with his gigolo groove but it’s alfred molina who really pulls off the hoax.
• holes dig it.
• hot fuzz with both barrels blazing, the brits bust the buddy cop genre to bits. bloody good!
• i love your work louis: he’s not a stalker, he’s a fan. gray: and mark chapman just loved the white album. louis: well, it was a good album.
• inglourious basterds proving to schoolchildren everywhere: you can misspell and still write well.
• insomnia these are the questions that keep me wide-awake. what happened to paul dooley? he disappears at some point in the movie. why did hilary swank go to an only just released suspect’s home without backup? why do grown men reference star wars in daily conversation? (okay, nicky katt’s obi wan bit is funny.)
• iron man it may be robert downey jr.’s rodeo, but to fans of susan pickett (not limited just to annie liebovitz and rc mcgowan), it’s her visual effects show.
• juno screenwriter diablo cody knows who wears short shorts: michael cera! superbad.
• keen eddie starring american actor, mark valley, as a u.s. police detective working in london with scotland yard. quirky and quick; valley is beautifully supported by topflight (is there any other kind?) british “character” actors.inspector monty pippin: you, see, the key to understanding the english is not what they say, but the inflection. . . . the inflection implies the intention.detective eddie arlette: well, give me a for instance.inspector monty pippin: when sir edward asked how my brother tom was getting along, what he really meant was, i know where you live, you bastard. you and your brother will be living in a rubbish bin by the time i’m through with the lot you . . .

• rabbit-proof fence a beautiful film—handled with unusual cultural sensitivity. kenneth branagh is his superb self, playing an insensitive civil servant (who genuinely thinks he’s civilized and sensitive), the rest of the cast, for the most part, are aboriginal young people with no prior acting experience. the result, filmed against an arresting australian background, is a stunning triumph of the human spirit. the rabbit proof fence is a metaphor for the walls that separate the aboriginal people from the white invaders of their ancestral land. another example of colonial imperialism gone awry.

posted on august 14, 2024hang loose: why i love the movie north shore 

by leigh godfrey

okay, first off, i don’t know anything about surfing. never done it, don’t care about it, and until about three years ago, i wouldn’t even swim in the ocean (related to a traumatic experience seeing the movie jaws when i was seven years old, but that’s another story). so right off the bat, i have to tell you that the reason i love the movie north shore has nothing to do with the surfing. so as long as we’ve got that out of the way, we can get started.
north shore follows the tried and true formula (which, incidentally, i appreciate very much) of the underdog overcoming all odds to reach his goal, and perhaps learning a little something along the way. in north shore, our hapless protagonist visits hawaii, learns to surf and falls in love with a local girl, thereby wreaking havoc on the tried and true ways of the island. but, think less like romeo and juliet—more like the karate kid.
but with waves.
given that north shore has a story by randal kleiser, who brought us the blue lagoon with a script co-written by tim mccanlies, who is responsible for the iron giant, you can only guess what kind of a movie you’re getting yourself into.
our story opens and i, for one, am immediately sucked in by the hot action shots of dudes surfing radical waves to the tune of a pseudo echo song. our hero rick kane (matt adler) is one of these surfers, and lo and behold! he wins the big surf contest. that’s right, a groovy silver belt buckle and five hundred bucks. when asked what he’s going to do with his $500 prize, rick shouts out: “i’m going to hawaii to surf the big waves of the north shore!” this of course seems like an excellent plan until we realize the contest rick has won took place in a wave tank in arizona! but you’ve got to love his ambition.
after a quick confab with his mom, we realize that rick is not only going to hawaii with just $500, no real surfing experience, and not knowing a soul, but he’s also forgoing his dream of becoming a graphic designer. now, name me another movie where the main character is a graphic designer and a surfer. go on, i dare you.
naïve rick alights in honolulu and a few extraneous things happen obviously inserted into the film to show the various sides of life in hawaii. briefly, rick gets into a cab and asks to be taken to an address that was given to him by some drifter that stopped by the wave tank one day. rick seems to think this guy will give him a place to stay. so we see him cruising the main drag of waikiki, where neon lights and prostitutes abound. the address turns out to be a strip bar—the hubba hubba room. first, rick is hit on by a hooker who wants him to buy her a $20 glass of champagne, next, he’s dissed by his “friend,” and last, gets himself into a bar brawl.
hawaii sure ain’t like arizona, rick is thinking.
this leads to rick jumping into a jeep with two randy australian surfers who were at the strip club. they turn out to be professional surfers alex rogers (played by robbie page) and mark occhillipo (that’s “occy” to you). for no apparent reason, these two immediately take rick through a burning sugar cane field and make him jump out and pick some, until rick is chased by some locals with machetes—perhaps to show the audience the truth about the hawaiian sugar industry? who knows? it really has no place in a surfing film, but then again, this is so much more than a surfing film.
anyway, after all this, they end up back at a beach house heavily populated with hot babes, and it just so happens to be owned by surfing legend and rick’s personal hero lance burkhart (portrayed by surf pro laird hamilton). this is where one of the many fine lines uttered in the film occurs: when occy tells alex to get into the hot tub with him, and alex says (please put on broad aussie accent): “right, i love skin diving.” classic. just as an aside, these two surfers are obviously gay, but throughout the film they are constantly surrounded by babes, therefore taking away the subplot of big gay love that might have otherwise taken place.
the next morning, rick goes out to catch his first big wave of the north shore. the first sign this is a mistake is when occy looks at rick’s board (surfboard, that is) and says “twinnies? no one rides twinnies here, mate.” a twinnie being a twin-finned surfboard. rick says he’ll be okay, but poor rick is clearly so dumb about surfing he doesn’t stand a chance. after all he doesn’t know how to “duck dive” and when he finally catches a wave it’s just “a ripple.” as alex says: “where’d you learn to surf, in a bathtub?” then, rick commits the cardinal sin of all sins; he pisses off the hui (pronounced “hooey”). that’s right, rick causes the hui to wipeout and all hell breaks loose.
he returns to the beach to find “those guys in the black trunks” have stolen his stuff. realizing they’ve hooked up with a loser, alex and occy quickly ditch rick, and as he wanders aimlessly about with his board, he runs into a local surfer dude, which brings us to the main reason why i love the movie north shore — turtle.
turtle, played by john philbin with true surfer aplomb (he also starred in that other notorious surfing film, point break), is rick’s entrée into the surfing world of the north shore. it’s turtle who informs rick in no uncertain terms that those guys in the black trunks are the hui, and the hui are not to be trifled with. in fact, his exact words are: “they’re the hui. nobody messes with the hui.”
turtle is so endearing, even though he goes against everything i find attractive in a man, i can’t help but have a crush on him. he is also responsible for 90% of the great lines in this film, which, when i quote them here, must be imagined in a surfer dude accent, often ending in the word brah or a hang loose sign, or both. if you don’t know what that sounds like, please visit scott’s north shore page where you can hear the actual lines themselves.
on their way to a happening halloween party, turtle begins to teach haole rick a few important lessons about hawaiian slang:
“what’s a haole?” asks rick.
“it’s the local word for tourist,” explains turtle.rick: “i’m not a tourist.”
turtle: “whatever, barney.”rick: “what’s a barney?”turtle: “it’s like barno, barnyard. a haole to the max. a kook, in and out of the water, yeah?”yeah. that sums up rick. to the max.rick meets cute local girl kiani at the party, but unfortunately she happens to be head hui vince moaloaka’s cousin. so you know that’s going to be trouble. since rick doesn’t have a place to stay, he asks turtle if he can crash at the shaping shack where turtle works, sanding surfboards for the enigmatic chandler, master board shaper and “soul surfer,” who is played by gregory harrison. best known for his role as dr. “gonzo” gates in the ’70s tv series trapper john m.d., this is one of only a handful of films you’ll see harrison in that aren’t movie-of-the week related.lance burkhart shows up at the party looking like rocky from the rocky horror picture show and demands chandler have his surfboard ready by the next morning, so turtle and rick return to the shaping shack to sand lance burkhart’s board.the next day, the waves are really cranking at pipeline so turtle and rick hit the surf with disastrous results, even though turtle had given rick all the info he needed to know about surfing pipeline: “there’s a reef that starts here and goes all the way down there. so when the wave breaks here, don’t be there . . . or you’re gonna get drilled.”rick, of course, bites it big time, breaks his board and scrapes up his back on the reef. kiani comes riding up the beach at this inauspicious moment and exclaims: “you’ll get reef rash if you don’t put something on those cuts.”if you’re unaware of the dangers of reef rash, rest assured that a little aloe will cure you.at this point, everyone is pretty much embarrassed by rick, and now that his surfboard is busted and the hui stole all of his stuff, he hasn’t got a lot left. he goes back to the shaping shack with turtle. chandler walks in toting a set of drawing pencils, which he has just purchased at a pawnshop. rick exclaims they are the ones stolen from him by the hui, and proves it by showing chandler a watercolor he did of a dude surfing the big waves of the north shore. chandler agrees to give rick a place to stay and a job sweeping up the shaping shack in exchange for the painting, which he then gives to his wife. awww.after discovering rick is pretty much a menace to surfing society, chandler decides to teach him about the waves, so he can become a true “soul surfer.” rick learns to surf in a brief montage set to some lame song that sounds not unlike that song played over the karate contest montage in the karate kid. i’d like to interject here, what is it about these 80s movies soundtracks? any movie geared toward teenagers that was made in the 80s had the worst music. obviously, the concept of licensing popular songs for soundtracks was not thought of back then, with john hughes being the lone possible exception. and even he had a few major missteps (belouis some, anyone?).back to rick’s learning to surf montage. it is intercut with scenes of rick sketching various drafts for chandler surfboards’ new logo. apparently, as his surfing improves, so do his design skills. after going through many incarnations, the logo ends up looking exactly like the painting rick had given to chandler in the first place, so i’m not quite sure why he went to all the trouble.while rick is learning to surf, this creepy guy with a floppy canvas hat takes a bunch of pictures of him and convinces rick that he can be as successful as lance burkhart. naturally, he’ll have to enter and do well in a big surf contest such as the conveniently located pipeline classic. in the meantime, rick has managed to hitch a ride out to some remote part of the island where kiani lives. while there he indulges in some hawaiian activities. he attends a luau, watches kiani hula dance and gets into a fight with the hui who stole his stuff, thereby regaining his honor and his cool silver surfboarder belt buckle. kiani and rick have a little love scene on the beach, and head hui vince decides rick isn’t such a bad haole after all.at this point, you may be wondering (as am i) where the heck is turtle? well, poor turtle is sanding away for chandler, all the while nurturing his own ambitions to be a master shaper. he even has a “big gun” tucked away in a closet, that he’s made all by himself, but is too afraid to show to chandler. and his bitter resentment of favorite son rick is growing stronger:turtle: “i hear chandler’s trying to teach you how to shape.”(rick nods)turtle (sullenly): “i’ve been his sander for five years, chandler teach me how to shape? not even. chandler ask me home for dinner? not. coach me how to big wave surf? no way.”rick: “look, maybe it’s because we have this design thing in common.”turtle (scoffing): “yeah, right — design thing. design me out of the picture, haole. here on the north shore we treat friends mo betta.”poor turtle!back at the beach, rick decides to enter the pipeline classic, much to the chagrin of mentor chandler, who derisively exclaims: “go ahead. go shred.” (i once again ask you to recall the karate kid, and how arnold from happy days was really upset that ralph macchio wanted to enter that karate contest to fight the guys from the cobra kai. it’s just like that.) see, chandler’s 60s surfing sensibility doesn’t jibe with the 80s “hot-doggers” like the lance burkhart’s of the world. but rick needs to find his balance (just like ralph macchio) so he first rectifies the situation between turtle and chandler by stealing turtle’s surfboard and giving it to chandler. chandler is so impressed, he goes surfing with it and we get to see some of gregory harrison’s big moves. creepy guy in floppy hat asks turtle: “who’s that?” and turtle proudly replies, “chandler. on my board. that i made.”i often wondered why we never get to see turtle surf. he only surfs once, in the beginning, then after that he is either sanding or on the beach. we do, however, get to see him without his shirt on, a lot, so i guess i have to be satisfied with that.so turtle, chandler, and kiani all come out to see rick surf the big contest. the soul surfing pays off and he makes it all the way to the finals and has to surf against his former idol lance burkhart. they match each other wave for wave, but finally, a cheating lance burkhart steals rick’s final wave and foils his chances of winning. it doesn’t matter though, because rick now knows he can hold his own with the best. and of course, lance gets his comeuppance, as creepy guy in floppy hat has taken photos of the whole thing and lance is humiliated in the local press the very next day.which, incidentally, is the day that rick says goodbye to turtle, chandler, kiani, and the big waves of the north shore to go to new york and pursue his dream of graphic art. kiani tells rick she prayed to the kahunas that rick would come back to the north shore. but she’s no prophet, because the film didn’t do well enough for a sequel.alas.
editor’s note:  there is, however, the punch drunk love of boarding house: north shore.author’s note: apparently, turtle gives surfing lessons in malibu. guess where i’ll be this summer?

posted on august 5, 2024eilish: interview w/ charmed’s costume designer 

by katharine elizabeth monahan huntley

“every garment worn in a theatrical production is a costume. before an actor speaks, their wardrobe has already spoken for them. from the most obvious and flamboyant show clothing, to contemporary clothes using subtle design language, costume design plays an integral part in every television and film production. it is an ancient theatrical craft and the process today is identical to when euripides was writing long ago. costume design is a vital tool for storytelling.”—the costume designers guild
eilish floats out of her boudoir, tanned and trim in a skin-tight white leotard and gauzy skirt. “it’s my schlep around thing. all pieces of taffeta, embroidered by hand. it zips into a miniskirt.”
of course it does. it’s the exact sort of garb aaron spelling’s chic costume designer would wear to lounge around the manor. with an irish lilt, she offers: “tea, or perhaps a mimosa?” followed by: “i have miniature lemon muffins baking in the oven.”
charmed, i’m sure.
irish eilishone of nine children, eilish mcnulty, an irish catholic living in belfast, ireland, was taught in st. catherine’s convent by dominican nuns. she excelled in the domestic arts.
eilish: i would make my own clothes. i designed my first dress when i was nine years old. turquoise with white dots the size of quarters. polka dots. a peter pan collar with short sleeves and a full gathered skirt with two big patch pockets. as a teenager i would buy fabric saturday morning for the dress to wear to the dance that evening. this may surprise you, but to this day, ireland is ahead of u.s. fashion by at least six months. great fashion comes out of europe.
eilish, nominated for two emmys for murder she wrote, prepares to costume angela lansbury for the actor’s latest project—in ireland. any notion of eilish “lounging around” while on hiatus from cult fave charmed is pure fabrication.
eilish in camelot“film is the great collaborative art. the design triumvirate—the director of cinematography, the production designer, and the costume designer—struggle to create an invented world to help the director tell their story. a film is one gigantic jigsaw puzzle. a movie is an enormous architectural endeavor of sets and lighting and costumes for one time and one purpose. this minutely crafted kingdom must sit lightly on the shoulders of the narrative.”—cdgeilish immigrated to the united states at the age of twenty. after a short stint as a governess in toluca lake, and a whirlwind romance with tony zebrasky whom she married (very aaron spelling), she became a seamstress for warner bros. eilish began sewing in the tailor shop, and soon thereafter was promoted to the finishing end of the costuming department, which led to—eilish: my first film was camelot.
under john truscott’s extravagant and artistic direction, camelot went on to win the 1967 academy award for best costume design. eilish went on to collaborate with glamour gurus bob mackie and nolan miller. she’s dressed glamour girls from the vintage beauties: ann baxter, elizabeth taylor, lana turner, miss bette davis, to young hollywood: shannen doherty, holly marie combs, alyssa milano, rose mcgowan. perhaps it is eilish’s celtic heritage that has fated the costume designer to hone her craft on shows about angels (charlie’s angels), vampires (the kindred), and witches (charmed).

eilish: i started working for aaron spelling in 79 or 80. charlie’s angels, love boat, vega$, hart to hart, hotel . . . . the 80s were big shoulder pads and men’s pantsuits. street kids with colored hair, cutting off tee shirts and ripping them up. i worked on dynasty for ten years. joan collins, high fashion, and hats. at one point i was overseeing seven shows.wbtl: i’m an unabashed fan of spellingvision. i’ll never forget the pilot episode of dynasty. fallon (pamela sue martin) biting the wedding cake bride’s head right off. i was instantly hooked.eilish: television is different from real life. aaron’s shows are exciting, contemporary.
and, whereas spelling television is camp, eilish is class. read: eilish doesn’t dish. alas.
charming eilish“when a costume designer receives a script, the process of developing the visual shorthand for each character begins. costume sketches, fashion research and actual garments are used to help costume designers, directors, and actors develop a common language for the development of each character. sometimes a glamorous entrance may be inappropriate and destructive to a scene. the costume designer must first serve the story and the director.”—cdg

eilish affectionately refers to the halliwell sisters—phoebe, piper, and paige, as “my girls.” phoebe (alyssa milano) is clearly her favorite. i imagine eilish as a kind of mary poppins amongst the mischievous vixens.
eilish: my girls have a unique look; there is a new wardrobe for every performance. i take into account the shade of their eyes, hair tint, and skin tone. although the cast is color coordinated, i’m careful the actors are never in the same color at the same time. nor do they have the same neckline.“the more specific and articulate a costume is, the more effective it will be with an audience. minute details loved by actors often enhance their performances in imperceptible ways. many actors credit their costume as a guide to the discovery of their characters. actors sometimes need sensitive costume design for imperfect bodies. flattering figures, camouflaging flaws, and enhancing inadequacies are part of the job description.”—cdg
wbtl: is there undo emphasis on the body beautiful?eilish: their bodies need to be a slim shape. that’s what they’re paid for.wbtl: do you dress the actor or character?eilish: a bit of both. for a guest star, i definitely dress the character. for the girls, it’s best to dress them in clothes in which they’re more comfortable. holly likes solids, alyssa—carefree and could care less, rose’s signature color is red. rose wouldn’t wear in her personal life what she wears on the show. not for a minute.
stylish eilish“costumes have always had enormous influence on world fashion. when a star captures the public’s imagination, a film or television role has catapulted him or her there. a style cycle begins as this role is recreated in retail fashion to the delight and demand of fans. the exposure this celebrity brings to a costume generates millions of dollars for the fashion business. when a film engages the public’s psyche, it is a powerful selling tool for a clothing manufacturer. costume designers receive tremendous pride from seeing their efforts reproduced on a global scale, but little recognition and no remuneration for setting worldwide trends.”—cdg
wbtl: how do you keep fashion in fashion?eilish: i buy garments up to six weeks ahead. that’s really the window of time.

wbtl: where do you shop for charmed?eilish: fred segal on melrose. bleu has fabulous clothes. yellow dog. traffic. little boutiques carry eclectic styles. the saks 6th floor is super trendy. the dilemma with the boutique designers is, once i’ve decided on one outfit—i need to purchase five of the same because of the stunts! two for alyssa and three for the stunt girls. my budget is high-end—$20,0000 a week. the outfits are expensive, but you do get what you pay for. the fit has to be great; they have to walk right into their clothes.

wbtl: action figures!eilish: i outfitted alyssa in black pencil pants with an overskirt, so she could do her kicks. then we saw everyone putting skirts over pants—jeans with a chiffon skirt.wbtl: what do you like to wear?eilish: a lot of black. white. a little pink, a little red. i organize my closet according to color. no floral prints.wbtl: fashion tips?eilish: just because they’re showing hot pinks, oranges, and reds, it doesn’t mean you should wear it. dress in colors that make you feel good, feel at ease. a smart woman dresses for herself, doesn’t try to be the latest thing. black never goes out of fashion. the little black dress never ever goes out of fashion. hiphugger jeans—very few women can get away with them. of paramount importance are shoes! shoes make or break the outfit. my friend nolan miller insists a full-length mirror is essential, and i concur. study your body. say to yourself: how do i look? how do i feel?
luck of the eilish“costume designers are passionate storytellers, historians, social commentators, humorists, psychologists, trendsetters and magicians who can conjure glamour and codify icons. costume designers are project managers who have to juggle ever-decreasing wardrobe budgets and battle the economic realities of film [and television] production. costume designers are artists with pen and paper, form, fabric and the human figure.”—cdg
wbtl: have you ever thought of designing a personal line?eilish: i’ve been so fortunate with my career—it’s kept me much too busy to consider my own line. and the money is incredible.wbtl: career versus family conundrum?eilish: every friday night when my son mark was a little boy, i would leave the warner brothers’ lot and stop off at a toy store. one evening i was too late. the store was closed. and i walked into the house and mark asked: where’s my present? . . . [sigh] . . . . he would play baseball, and teetering in my high heels i would be sneaking into the bleachers from the back so he couldn’t see i was late . . . . if you juggle being the perfect wife, mother, friend, and career woman—you often end up feeling like a failure. but i’ve been blessed with a husband who fully supports my choices. if i were delayed, he would take over the household when i couldn’t be there—giving mark dinner, his bath. even now, i come home from the set tony has dinner on the table—the wine is poured . . .
i glance around eilish’s spacious home as we exchange farewells. the elegant white-washed dining room where she and tony sip their spirits opens out to a glittering view of the san fernando valley. she then packs me off, warm muffins in hand. gracious eilish. leads a charmed life.

when irish eyes are smilingmark zebrasky, the adored only child of eilish and tony, was known as “mr. z” at saint robert bellarmine where he taught 2nd grade. a snappy dresser (and occasional charmed extra), he was a great favorite among all the children, and in particular, of two irish laddies, macguinness and killian monahan huntley.
