about us 



award winning cotons since 1992


ofa and cerf cleared




welcome and thank you for visiting us at coton dog! coton de tulear of tara has been proudly breeding award winning cotons de tulear puppies and dogs since 1992. tara is located in burleson, texas, and my original cotons de tulears were acquired from the leading kennels in belgium, france, denmark, and finland. my goal is to enhance this breed by breeding dogs and puppies that exhibit only the best traits and produce the very best coton de tulear puppies. i feel that each future generation of puppy must be better than the present, and i will not breed more puppies than there is a demand for.
