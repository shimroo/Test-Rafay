in 1908, marie c. bolden, an ohio-born african-american teenager, became the first-ever national spelling bee champion in the u.s., overcoming tricky words like “acquiesce”, “descendant”, and “millinery” on her way to the top. but her achievement was quickly eclipsed by racial prejudice, and her story rarely told. please join us to hear west bloomfield stories rarely told.

as gilded-age robber barons manipulated their beef industry headquartered in chicago, the rest of the united states–including jewish communities–experienced distressing ripple effects.  in detroit in 1910, working-class orthodox women were no longer able to afford kosher meat.  under the direction of 20-year-old rebecka possner, jewish women took to the streets, fighting to stabilize prices and the community. hear jhsm executive director catherine cangany, phd retell this remarkable and forgotten moment in michigan history. sponsored with west bloomfield library.
