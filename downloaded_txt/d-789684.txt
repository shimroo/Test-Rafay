family fun on the frio since 1939
tom & ethel holmes started camp live oak in 1939, with cabins one through four, plus the bath house. in approximately 1950, cabins five and six were added. the holmes' ran the family oriented camp until they closed it in 1969.
fast forward to 2001, when the grandchildren of tom & ethel beganâ  renovating cabins one through six and added cabins seven and eight. it was a dream come true for camp live oak to be reopened and have the same feel-good atmosphere, with a relaxed frio river ambience, that it held so many years ago when their grandparents originally established camp live oak. to this day, the camp is still owned and operated by the same family.
there is a lot to do at camp live oak, in leakey, and in the surrounding texas hill country.â  whether you are here to relax on the river, watch the birds, ride motorcycles, or photograph the area wildflowers and wildlife, we hope you have a great visit and come back often. the hills change with every season!
