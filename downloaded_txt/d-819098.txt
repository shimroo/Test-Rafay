    here’s what some of our previous
guests have to say

   
hudr
first time to oak lake lodge. their online web site is accurate and up to date. fishing for walleye in september is hot.
40 to 60 fish per day is common.
﻿nice size fish. then throw in an occasional northern and the fun never stops. our guide robert is great. the cabins are well appointed and immaculately clean. the food is absolutely fantastic. over all john and may run a top notch operation. he has put 19 years in building a class act operation. most impressive, every staff person from guides to house keeping to cooks to john and may all are consistently smiling.

 
 brad k.

we had 21 very happy buddies for life this august! oak lake’s staff handled all of us - from breakfast, to shore lunch to guides!
﻿we have made our pilgrimage to oak lake every year since 2002 and are already booked for 2019! the fishing is some of the finest in the world regardless of weather. excellence in serving oak lake’s guests is paramount. in 2019 we are bringing our sons and daughters to experience.

 
zeke z.
this was my third visit to oak lake lodge in 6 years. john naimian (owner) continues to provide outstanding fishing experience and accommodations. i have doubled my attendee list with each visit to include a tournament called zfinc (zeke's fly in canadian) fishing tourney. we give traveling trophies for longest fish and most fish. over 300+ fish were caught by the 6 of us over 2 1/2 days. first class fishing experience. can't wait to zfinc 2021!






    

 the
fishing brought you here,
but our
staff will keep you coming back

our goal is to blend the remote, rustic relaxation of fly-in fishing with the highest level of customer service and comfort. we’re very proud that the majority of our guests are return visitors. it means that we did a good job. but there’s nothing like watching people’s faces the first time they land on the lake and realizing that the pictures didn’t do it justice.whether it’s your first time or you're a returning guest — we can’t wait to see you at oak lake. learn more about the oak lake lodge team below.
