we’ve been disrupted!
megabus, a scottish company, has now entered the cville market and as a result we will end regularly scheduled service to and from new york effective immediately.
anyone who has purchased a ticket for the future will be refunded automatically, fully and immediately.
it has been a great 15 years of serving our hometown with scheduled service but we will now focus on our bus charter/rental business.
if you need to rent a bus for a wedding, greek event or school - call us first.
we have the largest and newest bus fleet in cville and we want and need the business to keep our hometown staff employed and continue to recycle your money locally.
thank you for a wonderful 15 years and we look forward to another 30 of serving charlottesville as a charter company.
