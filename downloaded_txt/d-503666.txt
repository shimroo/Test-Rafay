          tim alcorn, radio voice of the cleveland cavaliers                

when i walk into a lormet branch, i feel as if i have a relationship with the staff. there’s a sense that you’re part of the family, part of their community. just the way they talk to you, the way they treat you. it’s a very personal service.

          bob setlock                

we’ve been banking in many different states and many different communities throughout the years, this is the best one we’ve ever belonged to, it really has made a difference. for people out there who maybe want to make a change, i really recommend lormet because of what i perceive to be a very positive culture that has seemed to have grown here, the people are very nice and it makes all the difference in the world.

          cindy lafortune                

if you want that personal touch, and that feeling that people care about you here, they do. and irene was so good about explaining everything and making sure that i had a good experience. i don’t think i’ve ever experienced going into a bank and having that.

          marilyn bombac                

i was looking at cds, being involved with a trust, so there were a lot of different things that i was trying to get some professional advice on. irene was not only competent and extremely knowledgeable but she was compassionate, caring, and wanted us to succeed, it was apparent. those are the kind of things you cant buy, those are the kind of things that make an organization worth people coming back to.
