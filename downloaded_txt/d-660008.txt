centre for maritime research
 

mare is an interdisciplinary social science organisation interested in the use and management of marine resources. its objective is to provide a stimulating intellectual climate for academics and policymakers working on topics related to coasts and seas. although mare limits its action radius to the social sciences, it seeks active collaboration with other disciplines. it strives to maintain a balanced mix of academic and policy-oriented research. mare takes a global perspective, emphasising the coastal zones of europe, asia, and africa. it covers a broad spectrum of topics, drawing on expertise from fields such as law, history, economics, political science, public administration, anthropology, and geography.
mare organises international courses, conferences and seminars on specific maritime topics.
mare hosts a publication series as well as a specialised maritime journal called maritime studies (mast).
