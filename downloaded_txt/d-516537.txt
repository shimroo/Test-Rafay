the wisdom on the laceweb
  website has been drawn from the grassroots people of the oceania east asia
  australasia region. vast numbers of grassroots folk in the region have
  contributed their experience and competence. indigenous and small minority
  people and resonant other folk from academic to professor level have been
  involved and evolved. everything in this vast resource is from practical
  wisdom in action – a collection of what’s worked well, and at
  times contexts that have not worked so well - for learning better ways. this
  homepage was available on the internet during the 1990s through to 2006. as
  from may 2014 it is back on the internet in a much expanded way. you may want
  to bookmark this page and send a link to it to people you know. it’s a window
  to a massive resource. in rewriting and re-launching laceweb, initially some
  hyperlinks may not be working. these will progressively be adjusted in the
  coming weeks
