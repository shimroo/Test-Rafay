welcome to the north carolina capital area metropolitan planning organization (campo)

what is an mpo?
according to the federal aid highway act of 1962, areas considered by the federal census to be urban in nature with a population of at least 50,000 must have a continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive (“3c”) transportation planning process.  in order to receive funding from the federal government in the state of north carolina, this process is carried out by metropolitan planning organizations (mpo). members from each of the mpos make up the north carolina association of metropolitan planning organizations (ncampo). currently, there are 19 mpos in north carolina. -- nc association of mpos  
meetings
the mpo's technical coordinating committee meets on the first thursday of each month at 10:00 a.m. the executive board meets on the third wednesday of each month at 4:00 p.m. occasionally, meetings are held on an alternate date so please check the calendar below for the current dates. agendas and meeting minutes are typically posted one week before the meeting. information on meeting location, how to sign up to speak during public comment, can be found on our meeting details webpage.
