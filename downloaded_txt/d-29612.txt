cleaning tips
when it comes to cleaning, we've been there, done that, now serving 492 tips in 24 categories ranging from answer user questions to window cleaning.











what are the healthiest cleaning products?
unfortunately, many of the store bought cleaning products under your sink contain chemicals and additives that have been proven to have negative effects on your health as well as the environment. luckily, there are many safe, effective (and edible!) cleaning supplies already in your pantry. the following is a quick look at the best natural cleaning products.
baking soda
baking soda has been known as an all-purpose cleaner for generations. it does a fantastic job on glassware, coffee pots, and even on the removal of red-wine spots from carpet. it also gets rid of stains from saucers, cups, and stainless steel, leaving them sparkling clean.
coarse salt
use coarse salt to scrub copper pans and scour cookware. simply sprinkle salt directly onto the cookware and wipe clean. for more stubborn stains, apply the salt, then squirt lemon or lime over the area. wait several hours, and rinse clean.
essential oils
mix essential oils like rose, lavendar or tea tree oil with water, and then spray the solution on bathroom and kitchen surfaces. their anti-bacterial properties ensure your surfaces are clean and your family is healthy.
olive oil
use olive oil to polish wood furniture or lubricate squeaky door hinges. you'll notice the results immidiately.
boiling water
use hot water on a weekly basis to flush away dirt in your drains. this helps avoid clogs and build-ups that may end up being costly to fix.
ideally, the kind of cleaning products that you use should be nontoxic, efficient, and effective. natural cleaning products are therefore the healthiest tools in keeping your home immaculately clean and healthy.

how to make your own silver polish
making your own silver polish is easy to do. all you need are some basic household materials to remove tarnish from your silver pieces.
toothpaste
one way to make silver polish is to use toothpaste. select plain toothpaste without any bleaching agents, as they can damage the silver. apply the toothpaste directly to your silver and use a clean cloth to polish. for intricate pieces, use a soft bristled toothbrush to get into any crevices. make sure to run the silver piece under warm water to remove the toothpaste, and then dry thoroughly with a clean cloth.
water, salt, and baking soda
place your silver pieces along the bottom of an aluminum pot. pour enough water into the pot to cover your pieces, and add one teaspoon baking soda and one teaspoon salt. bring to a boil; allow the water to boil for three minutes. remove from heat. once the water has cooled off, move the silver pieces to warm, soapy water. polish the pieces by scrubbing them with a clean cloth, and then drying them with another fresh cloth. alternately, you can line a glass pan with aluminum foil (dull-side down) and lay the silver pieces out on top of the foil; add one quart of boiling water on top of the silver and add two teaspoons of baking soda. allow the silver to soak until the water is cool enough to touch; remove the silver and polish with a dry, clean cloth.

how to make your own deodorant
making your own deodorant is friendly on your wallet, your skin, as well as the environment. homemade deodorants are inexpensive, natural and have no side effects on the user. there are no harsh chemicals nor irritating fragrances. follow the steps below to make your own deodorant out of items you may already have in your pantry.
ingredients 
 50 grams of baking soda 32 grams of cornstarch 10 drops of tea tree oil 2 table spoonfuls of melted coconut oil
steps
 thoroughly mix the baking soda, tea tree oil and cornstarch in a bowl. next add the coconut oil and stir until the mixture is smooth. pour the mixture into a container for easy access- an old deodorant stick or a small glass container, for example. give it a couple days to harden.
note: you can make different scents simply by varying the use of essential oils. rather than tea tree oil, try rose, lavender, sandalwood or eucalyptus. these are ideal choices as they have the same anti-bacterial properties as tea tree oil. you can also opt for chamomile, which is a good skin soother. start by adding just a few drops and continue progressively until you achieve your desired scent.

how to make your own soap
making your own soap is a fantastic way to incorporate an all natural product into your daily routine. it's also a great way to save some money on your household budget. considering how often you and your family use soap, ensuring it's made from healthy ingredients is a smart idea for everyone.
follow these easy steps to make your own soap.
ingredients
 3 cups of water 1 clean glass plastic gloves goggles 12 oz.can of lye 3 lb lard or 48 oz.olive oil plastic 10-by-12 inch pan
procedure
 store the 3 cups of water in the fridge overnight for the proper temperature. pour the water into the glass. put on the goggles and plastic gloves. double check that there are no holes in your safety gear. using a non-metal stirring utensil, add the lye to the glass slowly, stirring carefully as you pour. do not allow the vapor to come into contact with your skin or airways. let the mixture cool in a safe place for at least an hour. as it cools, unwrap the lard and warm it to room temperature in the plastic pan. do not use metal. if using olive oil, pour into pan and allow it to settle. pour the lye mixture slowly into the pan containing the lard or olive oil. be careful not to let it come in contact with your skin. now mix thoroughly for at least 15 minutes until it has the consistency of thick pudding. allow the mixture 24 hours to set. after hardening, cut into bars or large chips and let it harden for several more days, then wrap with plastic. if you used olive oil, let the mixture harden for roughly one week, then wrap with plastic.
your skin will thank you!

save money by making your own laundry detergent
making your own laundry detergent is a simple process and an easy way to save money. there area various recipes for homemade laundry detergent, but they also use the same basic ingredients. you can buy everything you need to make your own laundry detergent for less than the cost of most brands of detergent, and have enough homemade detergent to last a year or more.
homemade laundry detergent is made of three components, soap, washing soda and borax. you can use a specific laundry soap if you like, such as fels naptha, or a bar of body soap, like ivory. washing soda is found in the laundry section of your grocery store. it is sodium carbonate and is useful for removing smells from your laundry. borax is the commercially available form of the natural mineral sodium borate, and whitens and deodorizes your laundry.
dump one-third to one-half of your soap, chopped or grated, into a large saucepan. add 6 cups of water and heat, stirring occasionally, until the soap melts. stir in one-half of a cup each of the washing soda and borax, continuing to stir until the powders are dissolved.
fill a two gallon bucket with about one-half gallon of hot water. add the soap mixture and stir until blended. fill the bucket the rest of the way with water, stirring to blend. let the soap set for 24 hours before you use it. use one-half cup per load.

how to clean your tv
making sure you have a clean television set is essential in ensuring you have a pleasant viewing experience. whether you have the latest and greatest tv mounted proudly on your wall or the same old set you've been carting around since college, a clean screen can make a huge difference in picture quality. follow these tips below to clean your tv.
 unplug your television from the power socket or wall to avoid any form of electrocution while cleaning your television. the television screen is delicate, so wipe it gently using a dry microfiber cloth. always avoid using a paper based cloth such as tissue paper as this may leave marks or scratches on your screen. in case you encounter stubborn stains or spots on the screen that are not easily removable by a dry cloth, use a commercial cleaning solution that is approved by the tv's manufacturer. a good rule of thumb is to use a product without the following agents: alcohol, benzene, ammonia, and paint thinner
any remaining moisture from the screen can be wiped out with a dry microfiber cloth. make sure the television screen is completely dry before plugging it back in.
remember safety is important when cleaning your television set. take precautions to avoid being exposed to potential electrocution.
