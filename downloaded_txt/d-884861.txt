when evening falls/ so hard.





three villanelles. love the form. (and, no, i don't find it stilted.)the first one's auden. the second, bishop. the last one's an old plath favourite that's stuck with me through the years. comes from the image of esther greenwood writing villanelles and sonnets in mr. manzi's chemistry class, i guess.if i could tell youwh audentime will say nothing but i told you so,time only knows the price we have to pay;if i could tell you i would let you know.if we should weep when clowns put on their show,if we should stumble when musicians play,time will say nothing but i told you so.there are no fortunes to be told, although,because i love you more than i can say,if i could tell you i would let you know.the winds must come from somewhere when they blow,there must be reasons why the leaves decay;time will say nothing but i told you so.perhaps the roses really want to grow,the vision seriously intends to stay;if i could tell you i would let you know.suppose the lions all get up and go,and all the brooks and soldiers run away?will time say nothing but i told you so?if i could tell you i would let you know.one artelizabeth bishopthe art of losing isn't hard to master;so many things seem filled with the intentto be lost that their loss is no disaster.lose something everyday. accept the flusterof lost door keys, the hour badly spent.the art of losing isn't hard to master.then practice losing further, losing faster:places and names, and where it was you meantto travel. none of these will bring disaster.i lost my mother's watch. and look! my last, ornext-to-last, of three loved houses went.the art of losing isn't hard to master.i lost two cities, lovely ones. and, vaster,some realms i owned, two rivers, a continent.i miss them, but it wasn't a disaster.--even losing you (the joking voice, a gesturei love) i shan't have lied. it's evidentthe art of losing's not too hard to masterthough it may look like (write it!) like disaster.the mad girl's love songsylvia plathi shut my eyes and all the world drops dead;i lift my lids and all is born again.(i think i made you up inside my head.)the stars go waltzing out in blue and red,and arbitrary blackness gallops in:i shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.i dreamed that you bewitched me into bedand sung me moon-struck, kissed me quite insane.(i think i made you up inside my head.)god topples from the sky, hell's fires fade:exit seraphim and satan's men:i shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.i fancied you'd return the way you said,but i grow old and i forget your name.(i think i made you up inside my head.)i should have loved a thunderbird instead;at least when spring comes they roar back again.i shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.(i think i made you up inside my head.)

right here, right now/ watching the world wake up/ from history.





five months of no writing, a little reading, and a lot of insanity. my efforts at fixing the first one led to these:three on writing.bad language. mslexia. and bbc get writing.three on advertising.mark fenske. hog blog. and creative skirts.and three for the road.museum of hoaxes. jackson pollock. and ask a ninja.
