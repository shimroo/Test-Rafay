spring is soon approaching, a season that may ignite the artistic side in many of us. poetry is a great compliment to this wonderful time of the year: the greek ‘poiesis’ (ποίησις), from ποιέω ‘to make’, reflects the rejuvenation many of us feel during springtime. see below for a couple of ways to access poetry through ibiblio!

please enjoy this springtime poem by gerard manley hopkins. happy reading!
spring
nothing is so beautiful as spring—
when weeds, in wheels, shoot long and lovely and lush;
thrush’s eggs look little low heavens, and thrush
through the echoing timber does so rinse and wring
the ear, it strikes like lightnings to hear him sing;
the glassy peartree leaves and blooms, they brush
the descending blue; that blue is all in a rush
with richness; the racing lambs too have fair their fling.
what is all this juice and all this joy?
a strain of the earth’s sweet being in the beginning
in eden garden. have, get, before it cloy,
before it cloud, christ, lord, and sour with sinning,
innocent mind and mayday in girl and boy,
most, o maid’s child, thy choice and worthy the
winning.

soundexchange and digital audio streaming 

ibiblio hosts several digital audio streams, all of which broadcast copyrighted material regularly. you may have wondered, “how are intellectual property owners paid when their recordings are broadcast online?” in the usa, royalties are owed to intellectual property owners each time a sound recording is played. an organization that centralizes management of these these rights for public radio stations that stream online is soundexchange. additionally, soundexchange provides payments to artists and intellectual property owners when their music is broadcast online. to ensure an equitable distribution of royalties, data associated with the sound recording is processed, and a payment is collected from the statutory licensee. then, shares are allocated, processed, and distributed to the intellectual property owners. you can follow this link to visit soundexchange’s official website. additionally, you can learn more about soundexchange’s history and purpose via the associated wikipedia page.
soundexchange compliance helps to ensure that royalties from broadcast sound recordings are distributed properly. each audio stream we host must send soundexchange reports to ensure royalties are properly distributed. one of the most important things this report includes is the total number of times a recording is received by a unique listener. this is known as the actual total performances, or more colloquially as “per play, per listener.” our audio streams produce logs which we can then compile into a report for soundexchange. actual total performances is used to calculate the amount owed by a radio station to the intellectual property owners.
equitable distribution of royalties helps keep the digital audio streams we host sustainable. you can visit some of these radio stations and access their online streams for your music listening pleasure. here are a few of the radio stations we host:



concierto – spanish/english classical music produced by wdav
wcpe, the classical station
wxyc – unc-chapel hill’s student radio station
