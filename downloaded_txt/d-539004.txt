data encryption software 
comprehensive solution to protect sensitive data on any windows pc, desktop, laptop, hard
                            disk or removable drive such as usb flash drive, memory stick, etc.







cypherixâ® is tightly focused on cryptography and data security. we leverage our expertise to deliver
                state-of-the-art, world-class encryption software packages, not bound by any restrictions.
we develop several products which address a range of data storage security needs for personal use, small business or enterprise including stand-alone usb drives and encrypted storage for cloud accounts. 
high-grade encryption is the ideal way to protect your sensitive data like
files, folder and databases, as it scrambles the information making it
unreadable without the correct passcode. cypherix products create
encrypted vaults which are invisible to intruding eyes. click here  to learn more.

"when you want any files or folders hidden from prying eyes, highlight them and click the
                                unload button in cypherix le. they'll suddenly vanish. to make them appear, click the
                                load button, and they're back after you type in a password. only those with access to
                                the password will be able see them. the software is also useful for those who use small
                                usb flash drives to carry around data." 
- information week







"...for the simplest all-round solution i suggest a freeware program called cypherix
                                mobile, which is included with cypherix le... any file you put inside the folder is
                                protected. if you did lose it, only the best-resourced spooks and villains could read
                                your files." 
- the telegraph, uk







"encrypt files the easy way using cypherix le. keep your sensitive data private with this
