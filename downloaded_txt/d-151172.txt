  "communication is great, everything and anything that needs to be handled is taken care of in a professional matter and that means a lot these days. i personally live 6 hours away from my property and have not had to make a trip to the property for any reason unless i wanted too!"

  "we were renters from wainwright for about 4 years now and they've always been prompt and courteous with their service and responses to us. they've known our names and which house we were living in so they make it a point to know their renters and i appreciate that. "

  "my journey with wainwright realty began with one agent and then i was seemlessly transitioned to another without issue. they have extremely professional  and responsive to any questions or issues that i may had while managing my property. i am really appreciative for everything that they have done for me. i am in the military and i have had to take a few overseas tours and worrying about my property and its tenants was one less thing thanks to wainwright realty. keep up the awesome work."
