				vance delivers a historic defense of free speech in europe			



			february 15, 2025		

			no comments		

if you haven’t listened to jd vance’s blistering 19 minute talk to the european union, it is certainly worth a listen. see the youtube of his talk below.
jonathan turley, one of the most respected reporters and commentators today, wrote a brilliant review of vance’s lecture. his review is a must-read as well. he explains how vance hit the eu right where they needed it. turley wrote,
“in perhaps the greatest single declaration uttered by an american leader since john f. kennedy in germany declared “ich bin ein berliner,” he added: “if you are running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing america can do for you. nor, for that matter, is there anything that you can do for the american people that elected me and elected president trump.”
you can read turley’s brilliant article here:

                    a good quote from the catholic thing about those who claim to be "spiritual but not religious".

"our longing for the supernatural is also grounded in human nature: we are hardwired to seek things higher than ourselves, and to bend our knees in worship of them. religion guides…
