we are hosting a free online radius conference.  the conference is march 13, 2025.  there will be a number of talks related to radius security, along with talks focussed on the isp, enterprise, and education use-case.  there will be talks from alan dekok (freeradius leader), along with other industry experts such as klass weirenga (eduroam), bruno thomas (wba), and many others.
freeradius is the most widely used radius server in the world.  it powers most major internet service providers and telecommunications companies world-wide and is one of the key technologies behind eduroam, the international wi-fi education roaming service.  it is the radius server used by all cloud identity providers and is embedded in products from network equipment vendors and token card manufacturers.
the freeradius product suite includes a server, radius client, development libraries, and numerous additional radius and ip address-related utilities.  it is fundamental to the working of the internet around the world, and is responsible for authenticating hundreds of millions of users every day.

view full release notes












this is the freeradius project, the open source implementation of radius, an ietf protocol for aaa (authorisation, authentication, and accounting).
the freeradius project maintains the following components: a multi protocol policy server (radiusd) that implements radius, dhcp, bfd, and arp; a bsd licensed radius client library; a radius pam library; and an apache radius module.
we provide a step-by-step guide to radiusd -x. the guide breaks down the different pieces of the debug output, and explains what they mean.  often you can just look for error or warning to solve many problems.





freeradius is responsible for authenticating one third of all users on the internet.
