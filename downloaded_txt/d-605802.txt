pvra membership 
								2024
 
pvra has kept the dues stable for approximately the 
							last 10 years.  due to the current inflation 
							pressure our income is not keeping up with our 
							expenses. therefore, at the last meeting a vote was 
							taken to reluctantly increase the dues going 
							forward.
the membership dues will be:  
								$60.00 
							for a regular membership, $50.00 for retirees, and 
							$20.00 for under 18.
your dues support over 15 reliable repeaters including 
							irlp & echolink.
the linked repeaters provide continuous coverage 
							on i-84 from the new york border to the massachusetts 
							border.
pvra is at the leading edge of digital voice with 
							d-star and dmr repeaters with more dmr repeaters 
							planned.
							memberships renew april 1st.  you will 
							receive a bill in late february.you can renew 
								on-line or by 
								mail. 
								
as a reminder, the 
								repeaters and networks provided by the pvra are 
								made available to all ham radio operators free 
								of charge, but the cost of upkeep and 
								maintenance is significant. we encourage anyone 
								who enjoys using our systems to consider joining 
								the pvra. your membership dues directly support 
								the continued operation and improvement of our 
								repeaters, ensuring we can maintain the highest 
								quality service for the ham community across 
								southern new england. 

								to join, or for more information, please visit 
								our website
								
								join pvra.net or contact a club 
								representative. your support is greatly 
								appreciated!

note:  dmr 
							change!
								due to circumstances beyond our control the pvra 
							talk group has been changed from 310991 to 
							31093 on the brandmeister connected dmr 
							repeaters. you will need to update your code plugs.

important bill for radio amateurs - passed!
state senator tony guglielmo introduced a bill about 
							hams having the legal right to use our mobile ham radios 
							while driving in ct. as it was, there was no clear ruling 
							and police departments could more or less enforce as 
							they see fit based on the cell phone regulations - hams 
							could be included in these regulations and be cited.
the bill was signed into law by the governor on may 
							31, 2012 and now excludes amateur radio licensees.


							senate bill 61: an act exempting amateur radio operators 
							using hand-held radios from the prohibition on using 
							hand-held mobile telephones and mobile electronic devices 
							while driving.
connecticut general assembly bill info
just a suggestion, we should always carry a license 
							or copy with us in the vehicle. a lot of hard work went 
							into this by a lot of people. many thanks to senator 
							guglielmo, his staff, bruce marcus n1xg and his staff, 
							steve dube ka1rla and all other folks we don't know 
							about who were involved.   
update:
due to pressure from the fed's the law was subsequently 
							revised to read "only in case of emergencies".

bit of pvra history:

							the pvra membership list from 1972



halloween snow storm alfred

							notice that during the recent storm, when power was 
							out for much of the state and cell phone coverage was 
							spotty or non-existent, the pvra repeater system worked 
							as expected.

							pvra is fortunate to have our repeaters located at top 
							quality sites with battery and generator backup. box 
							mountain is the home of 146.79 &145.41 repeaters 
							and it is the hub for the linked repeaters and the dstar 
							system. the cost for propane just for box mountain was 
							about $3000 both for storm alfred and storm irene. while 
							our landlord (marcus communcations), does not charge 
							pvra for these costs, we must still maintain our equipment.
help ensure that pvra repeaters will be continue 
							to be top quality.
							join pvra and 
							ask your friends to join.
							donations are 
							gratefully accepted.

the new naugatuck valley

							site is easily accessible for maintenance. so once again
