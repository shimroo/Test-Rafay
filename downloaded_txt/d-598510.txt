mystic arts gathering and information circle
m.a.g.i.c.





a federally recognized 501-c3 non-profit, eclectic mysticism, earth-loving, peace promoting, non-patriarchal eclectic group that holds events on an irregular basis, ordains clergy with legal standing, and serves the community in times of need.
we honor all belief systems and hope to share more marginalized beliefs with the public for a greater understanding.

here there be dragons auction




why an auction?
in fall of 2025, we will be joining forces with other pagan groups to present an immersive theatrical ceremonial experience called “here there be dragons” on a property called ffynnon in vernonia, oregon. in order to help fund the props, sets, and costumes, we are auctioning these hand-made crocheted and stuffed cuddly dragons.
