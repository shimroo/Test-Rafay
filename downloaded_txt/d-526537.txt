building careers since 1999



wade artist management was founded in 1999 to provide a diverse pool of outstanding talent to arts organizations while offering artists a nurturing, career-building approach to management. achieving these goals in an atmosphere of trust and respect is our primary objective. wam is proud to present both emerging young artists garnering attention and momentum, as well as more experienced singers, conductors, stage directors, and instrumentalists already enjoying exciting careers at major music institutions.
