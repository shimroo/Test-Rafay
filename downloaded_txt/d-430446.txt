frequently asked questions






                  what is a retreat?
                


a retreat is an opportunity to be away from the distractions of daily living for a couple of days, usually a weekend (though some groups hold retreats 
                  during the week), in order to devote time to spiritual recovery from alcoholism. a retreat brings together a group of recovering alcoholics in a setting that promotes
                  fellowship and sharing throughout the weekend. most retreats focus on one broad topic for the weekend. a retreat master(s), who is usually both a recovering alcoholic 
                  and a member of the clergy, gives conferences about the topic several times during the weekend. just as an alcohol counselor who also is recovering has valuable 
                  insights into the mental part of alcoholism and its treatment, so a member of the clergy who is recovering brings valuable insights into the spiritual part of alcoholism.





                  must i be catholic to attend a matt talbot retreat?
                


no. matt talbot retreats are open to recovering alcoholics regardless of religion, sex, race, color or creed. 
                  there are separate retreat groups for men, women, and married couples (both of whom must be recovering alcoholics). we are not affiliated with any organized religion.





                  is there a price to attend a matt talbot retreat?
