the terrace public library is proud to acknowledge that we gather, celebrate, and play on the traditional la̱xyuubm ts’msyen (tsimshian territories). this beautiful land we call home was, and always will be, their rightful homeland.  we acknowledge the people of kitselas to the east, and kitsumkalum to the west, both communities of the ts’msyen nation.


it's essential to acknowledge their continued presence, perseverance, and resilience as a reminder that we share this land and its resources.


we believe that by acknowledging the ts’msyen peoples' history and ongoing contribution to this land, we can build a relationship of trust, łoomsk (respect), and genuine partnership.
