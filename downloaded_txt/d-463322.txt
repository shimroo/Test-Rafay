globix history


					the globix story begins in 1989 with the formation of naft international ltd., an apple value added reseller 
					(var) which grew to become new york cityâs largest publishing var.  four years later stellar graphics was 
					created as a newspaper print broker and pre-production facility, printing over 60 newspapers a week.  
					in 1994, following his passion for gaming, marc bell created gamenet, the first multiplayer online service 
					dedicated to macintosh games.
					

					advances in technology and increased demand for business internet applications led to the formation of new 
					businesses in 1995.  naft computer services corp. was a service, support and training operation that also 
					provided depot and on-site repair services, the largest computer repair facility of its kind in nyc.  
					pfm communications, whose business became the main business of globix later on, offered sophisticated internet 
					connectivity for direct, high-speed internet connections and hosting at a state-of-the-art network operations 
					center.  bluestreak (formerly stellar graphics) produced broadcast quality 2d and 3d animation, interactive cd-rom 
					presentations and high-impact web sites.  
					

					in 1996 bell technology was formed as the parent company for all of marc bellâs holdings.  
					an initial public offering raised net proceeds of approximately $7.4 million.  rapid expansion 
					mirrored the rapid growth of the internet as an essential business tool.  the company became globix 
					in 1998 and completed a $160 million debt financing to fund the expansion of facilities and acquisitions.  
					the headquarters was moved from the puck building to 139 centre street, new york city.
					
  
					internet data centers were opened in california and london, paving the way for global expansion.  
					a public offering of 16 million shares of its common stock, resulted in net proceeds of $137 million.  
					by 2000 globix had over 28,000 miles of fiber around the world and over 1 million square feet of internet 
					data center space â it was the worldâs largest logical peer with a market cap in excess of $2.5 billion.
