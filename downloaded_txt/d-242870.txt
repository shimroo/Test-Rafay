about cach

      the central applications clearing house (cach) service provides an opportunity to learners who have not yet received a place to study at a post-school higher education institution.
      
      the cach service is free and aims to match applicants' national senior certificate exam results (which is received directly from the department of basic education) and study preferences with places that need to be filled. this service guarantees that applicant data will be made available to all possible institutions in the pset system.
      

      for more information visit  https://cach.cas.ac.za/
