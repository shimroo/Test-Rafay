tel-chai nation
israel, much like the fortress of tel-chai that jospeh trumpeldor fought to defend against arab conquerors in 1920, finds itself beseiged by enemies both within and without. terrorists, would-be friends inside and outside israel, and even bad government officials. here are the discussions of one proud zionist resident on the state of the nation and abroad.

3 more hostages free


news comes in on 3 more hostages of hamas who were released:
sagui dekel-chen (36), alexander (sasha) troufanov (29), and yair horn (46), who were held hostage in gaza for 498 days, arrived in israel on saturday.

all three were kidnapped during the october 7 massacre.

avital, wife of sagui dekel-chen, shared her emotions ahead of the moving meeting with her husband: "my breath came back, i'm very emotional. he's so handsome. there's an enormous amount of relief that he's in the idf's hands."

ruth horn, mother of yair, who was released saturday, and eitan, who is still captive in gaza, responded to yair's release and thanked those who supported the family since the october 7 massacre.
these 3 are also fortunate to have survived.labels: anti-semitism, islam, israel, jihad, knesset, military, misogyny, racism, sexual violence, terrorism, war on terror

afghan infiltrator committed terrorist attack in munich


just shortly before a planned security conference in germany, an afghan jihadist committed a terrorist attack with a car:
the driver behind the car-ramming attack in munich that left more than 30 people injured appears to have had an “islamist motivation” authorities said friday.

they qualified the observation by claiming there’s no evidence the suspect – named locally as 24-year-old farhad n – was involved with any radical network, rather he appeared to be a lone terror operative.

as breitbart news reported, the 24-year-old afghan, who arrived in germany as an asylum-seeker in 2016 and lived in munich, was arrested after sending his mini cooper careering into the back of a labor union demonstration in the bavarian city on thursday.

farhad n previously had his asylum application rejected but his deportation was suspended.

police officers pulled him out of the car after firing a shot at the vehicle, which didn’t hit him, and arrested him.

ap reports prosecutor gabriele tilmann said the suspect cried “allahu akbar,” or “god is great,” to police and then prayed after his arrest — which prompted a department that investigates extremism and terror to take on the case immediately.

in questioning, the perpetrator admitted deliberately driving into the demonstration and “gave an explanation that i would summarize as religious motivation,” tilmann said.
tragically, what's been revealed will surely be swept under the rug by the orwellian crowd, and the german authorities never deported him as he should've been a number of years ago. we can only hope all diplomats who care will attend the security conference and address this issue.labels: afghanistan, dhimmitude, germany, immigration, islam, jihad, misogyny, political corruption, racism, terrorism

wallace shawn is one of the most hateful self-haters around


the actor/playwright wallace shawn, a man who's of israeli ancestry, hates his ethnicity so much he's compared israeli to national socialists, works with the repellent jewish voice for peace, and clearly turns a deaf ear and blind eye to all that's wrong with islam:
jewish actor wallace shawn, who is most famous for his roles in “clueless,” the “toy story” franchise, and “the princess bride,” compared israel’s military actions in the gaza strip during the israel-hamas war to the war crimes committed by nazis against jews during world war ii.

the new york-born actor and playwright, 81, said during an appearance on the podcast “the katie halper show” on monday that israel is “doing evil just as great as what the nazis did.”

“the israelis invaded someone else’s territory. they took people’s homes and they did many of the things that the nazis did to the jews,” he claimed while speaking to halper, a jewish comedian and author. “and now they’re really doing it. you can’t be more evil than what they’re doing.”

“and in some ways it’s worse, because they kind of boast about it,” shawn added. “hitler had the decency to try to keep it secret. for some reason, hitler didn’t want people to know he was doing these things to the jews. the israelis are almost proud of it, and it’s demonically evil. you can’t be more evil. and anybody who doesn’t recognize that it’s evil, i can’t properly communicate with that person. that might be temporary insanity.”

the “young sheldon” star has been a longtime critic of israel and its military actions in gaza during the war against hamas terrorists controlling the enclave who orchestrated the deadly terrorist attack across southern israel on oct. 7, 2023. after the massacre, he signed a letter from artists4ceasefire calling on former us president joe biden to push for an immediate ceasefire between israel and hamas to end the war.

shawn has repeatedly criticized us support for the jewish state during the israel-hamas war. he accused israel of “brutal occupation,” and of “massacring innocent people” and inflicting “deliberate cruelties” on palestinians in gaza. he has participated in rallies and events organized by the anti-israel groups if not now and jewish voice for peace, and is also a member of jvp’s advisory board.
repulsive. i'll never be able watch movies with him again for a long time, unless he's in a villainous role, like he was in the princess bride. he's one of the worst examples of hollywood's scoundrels, and if he believes israelis are forbidden to even live in gaza, that too is abominable.

jordan's king agrees to take in gazans


it looks like donald trump's efforts to get a country like jordan to take in gazans is beginning to bear fruit:
king abdullah ii of jordan visited president donald trump at the white house on tuesday, where the jordanian king agreed to accept refugees into his country.

the meeting comes after trump made repeated demands for jordan and egypt to take in refugees, despite both countries declining. trump and abdullah met to discuss issues including trump’s gaza proposal, the israeli-palestinian conflict, isis and al-qaeda, and economic cooperation.

the king and crown prince of jordan arrived at the white house around noon tuesday afternoon, where they both attended a bilateral meeting and lunch with the president. secretary of state marco rubio also attended the meeting — the first official encounter between the king of jordan and the president of the united states since hamas and israel agreed to a ceasefire. [...]

king abdullah said he is open to coming up with solutions that serve the interests of all parties.

“i think the point is how do we make this work in a way that is good for everybody. obviously, we have to look at the best interests of the united states, of the people in the region, and especially my people of jordan.”

abdullah offered to take 2,000 sick children from the gaza strip almost immediately.

trump called the gesture “beautiful.”

“we really appreciate it,” trump said. “it’s music to my ears.”

king abdullah said he wants to wait for the egyptians to present their plan on how to address the challenges in gaza.

trump said he believes there is a 99% chance he will work something out with egypt. the president previously threatened to withhold aid to the two countries unless a deal could be made, but backed down during the meeting, stating “i do think we’re above that.”
so far, egypt's premier, al-sisi, has been balking at cooperating. but hopefully, that too will be worked out, and egypt should by all means start accepting muslims in gaza into their country. and if aid needs to be withheld to make clear what they should do, then perhaps that's the best thing to do.labels: anti-americanism, anti-semitism, egypt, islam, israel, jihad, jordan, military, misogyny, political corruption, racism, sexual violence, state dept, terrorism, united states, war on terror, white house

the issue of birthright citizenship


the usa public sides with donald trump on the need to restrict birthright citizenship, which has been abused by bad apples for too long:
according to the latest numbers from one of america’s most consistently accurate pollsters, a majority of the public sides with president trump on the issue of limiting birthright citizenship.

rasmussen reports surveyed 1,196 likely voters on february 6, 9, and 10, and found majority support to finally put  an end to how birthright citizenship is currently defined — which is that if you are born on united states soil you are automatically an american citizen. this stupid and suicidal constitutional interpretation allows the children of non-citizens, including those whose parents are in our country illegally, to win american citizenship for that child simply because they happened to be born here.

in fact, this stupid and suicidal interpretation of the constitution has created something called “birthright tourism,” where people from all over the world time their trips to america to ensure their child is born here.

for obvious reasons, trump wants to end this nonsense and signed an executive order to that effect on his first day in office last month. it will now make its way through the courts, which was almost certainly trump’s intent all along.

the good news is that the people are with him…

when asked, “do you support or oppose the united states changing its current practice of granting u.s. citizenship to births to tourists and other foreign visitors,” 51 percent said they supported the change while 47 percent said they opposed it. this includes 54 percent of black american and 53 percent of hispanic support.

when asked, “do you support or oppose limiting automatic birthright citizenship to births where at least one parent is a u.s. citizen or legal permanent resident,” a wide majority of 56 percent said they support this change compared to only 45 percent who said they would oppose it. this includes 61 percent of black voters and 50 percent of hispanic support.
it certainly is time for this serious flaw to be dealt with, especially in europe. let's hope it is modified accordingly soon.labels: immigration, political corruption, united states, white house

trump losing patience with hamas after observing how freed hostages look similar to holocaust survivors


here's what donald trump had to say following the release of a few more hostages this week:
president donald trump on saturday expressed dismay over the appearance of three israeli hostages who emerged from hamas captivity looking “like holocaust survivors.”

“i watched the hostages come back today, and they looked like holocaust survivors,” trump said upon the release of or levy, ohad ben ami, and eli sharabi.

“they were in horrible condition, they were emaciated. it looked like many years ago, the holocaust survivors. i don’t know how much longer we can take that.”

trump expressed concern and frustration with hamas over the men’s condition, noting that, under the current ceasefire’s first phase, hostages are slowly being released.
making matters worse is that the hamas has now halted their releases:
hamas has announced that it is suspending the release of hostages planned for saturday until further notice due to "israeli violations".

israel has rejected the accusations, stating, "the one who committed the violations is the terrorist organization. members of the delegation who returned this morning from qatar claimed that hamas' conduct endangers the continuation of the deal."

the prime minister has convened a situational assessment to review the implications of the announcement, with the participation of chief of staff herzi halevi and incoming chief of staff eyal zamir. egyptian sources commented to reuters that they believe the deal is in danger of collapse.

defense minister israel katz responded to hamas' announcement of the cessation of the release of the hostages and said that it was a complete violation of the ceasefire agreement and the deal for their release.
if the israeli army doesn't respond to this, it will not be good.

something else we should be losing patience with is far-left municipalities in europe naming streets after terrorist leaders:
barghouti is an honorary citizen of the city of palermo. the city of mafia massacres honored a murderer who sent young tanzim to kill jews (and priests). obviously in the name of "peace" and "two states for two peoples", right?

in france, many cities have named streets and squares after barghouti, such as valenton. a square in his name was inaugurated in coulounieix-chamiers. the socialist municipality voted by a large majority for the proposal to name the square of the castle of izards in honor of the palestinian arab terrorist. a photo of barghouti was displayed at the stains town hall. the arch-terrorist was granted honorary citizenship by twenty french cities, including ivry-sur-seine. and then gennevilliers, la courneuve, pierrefitte-sur-seine, la verrière, vitry-sur-seine.

left-wing french mps also went to pay homage to barghouti in prison. members of the belgian parliament have launched a campaign to nominate barghouti for the nobel peace prize.

in the french town of bezons, among the honorary citizens there is also majdi al rimawi, leader of the terrorist cell that killed the israeli minister of tourism, rehavam ze’evi.

in cities that name streets after barghouti, mega mosques financed by qatar are being built. in aubervilliers, a city with a muslim majority, where barghouti became an honorary citizen just 48 hours after the slaughter of father jacques hamel, they throw molotov cocktails at jewish schools.

these are cities from which jews have fled in recent years. in stains, jewish families have gone from 250 to 50, in la courneuve from 300 to 80…

like in gaza: since 2005 there have been no more jews and the only ones are those in the hamas tunnels.
this is very bad too, and cannot be taken lightly by anybody in france who's worried about this leftist dhimmitude.labels: anti-americanism, anti-semitism, belgium, dhimmitude, france, islam, israel, italy, jihad, knesset, military, misogyny, racism, sexual violence, terrorism, united states, war on terror, white house

burger chain carl's jr. returns to sexy advertising


a burger business in the usa is doing the right thing (via the daily caller):
carl’s jr. has updated its old sexualized marketing strategy with an ad starring influencer alix earle, years after the burger chain stopped making suggestive ads and promised to focus more on its food.

earle wears little clothing as she promotes a bulging new “hangover burger” in the super bowl-themed ad, reprising the role once played in carl’s jr. campaigns by such names as paris hilton and kim kardashian—but now with some self-referential humor from a tiktok star tossed in.

the new twist on the brand’s once-signature style mirrors a cultural about-face that coincides with president trump’s return to office, according to tim calkins, clinical professor of marketing and associate chair of the marketing department at northwestern’s kellogg school of management.

“i think it does reflect a shift in how the country is feeling,” said calkins. “clearly with the new administration … what is acceptable conduct is changing, and i think you’re seeing carl’s jr. jump right on that trend as one of the first brands that’s really pushing the edge on things like this.”

this ad almost certainly wouldn’t have run several years ago, when american culture focused more intently on matters of gender equality and diversity, calkins said.

the new campaign is intended to evoke nostalgia for its predecessors while adding humor to target a core audience of gen z consumers who live—and order hamburgers—online, said jennifer tate, chief marketing officer at carl’s jr. parent company cke restaurants, which also owns the restaurant chain hardee’s.

a carwash featured early in the video, for example, is a subtle nod to a 2005 paris hilton commercial in the original wave of ads.

earle’s appeal lies in her ability to feature both the highlights and foibles of her life online, tate said, referring to the influencer’s “unapologetic, bold style.”

“this is the new world with new rules and new rulers. alix earle is a social media empress,” tate said in a statement. “carl’s jr. is having so much fun doing things other brands are too timid to do.”

‘bikinis and burgers’

carl’s jr. began its shift away from its racy ads in 2017, saying the strategy was distracting from the chain’s food.

“since premiering our now iconic ad starring paris hilton 12 years ago, carl’s jr. and hardee’s have become synonymous with two things: bikinis and burgers,” said brad haley, then the cmo at cke restaurants, in a press release that year. that made it difficult to tell a broader story about menu quality, haley said.

even before that, carl’s jr. had defended its steamy ads in a defiant 2011 press release that has since been removed from cke restaurants’ web site.

“we believe in putting hot models in our commercials, because ugly ones don’t sell burgers,” the release read, according to a copy archived online. “that’s just the way it is.”

for the second year in a row, carl’s jr. is promoting its loyalty program by offering free burgers to members the day after the super bowl. the company will gauge this campaign’s success by monitoring sign-ups and online sales, as well as bricks-and-mortar foot traffic, tate said.

like past campaigns tied to the super bowl, this one also aims to attract an outsize share of attention—but without costing the company the millions of dollars in media fees that an actual national super bowl commercial would cost. the ad will run on traditional and streaming tv only in some markets, and not in-game, said tate.

the campaign will also lean heavily on social media, tate said. earle shared the ad with her 7.2 million tiktok followers on wednesday.

the brand will release more material with earle later this year, tate said.
well i'm glad they're reversing that previous, hysterical capitulation to wokeness, which was cowardice, and even here, any leftists who did similar things only ended up doing what ultra-orthodox extremists would want, just as much as the lgbt cultists. the only drawback for me when it comes to the food served at carl's jr. is that i want kosher ingredients. but until that can be resolved, the sight of the women is definitely worth the price of admission for now.labels: communications, lgbt cultism, misogyny, moonbattery, showbiz, united states

if the ncaa wanted to, they could've kept men out of women's sports


kylie griswold makes an important point about how, if the ncaa wanted to, they could've said no to men in women's sports long ago:
the national collegiate athletic association announced an about-face on its 2022 “participation policy” for transgender-identifying athletes this week: no longer are men allowed to self-identify their way into women’s sports.

“the new policy limits competition in women’s sports to student-athletes assigned female at birth only,” the ncaa said in a press release, forced to acknowledge the genetic differences between men and women while bitterly clinging to the anti-science trans-speak “assigned at birth,” as if chromosomal makeup is arbitrary.

regardless of the continued language manipulation, however, the policy change stands — and it’s a direct result of female athletes demonstrating the myriad ways male athletes have harmed them, plus a strong leader in the white house who is willing to listen and act.

on wednesday, just one day before the ncaa policy reversal, president donald trump signed an executive order (titled simply “keeping men out of women’s sports“) that stripped all funding from educational programs that let men and boys infiltrate women’s and girls’ athletics. “it shall also be the policy of the united states to oppose male competitive participation in women’s sports more broadly,” the order reads, not only for reasons of “safety” and “fairness,” but also to preserve “dignity, and truth.”

the ncaa allowing males to compete against females “is demeaning, unfair, and dangerous to women and girls, and denies women and girls the equal opportunity to participate and excel in competitive sports,” trump’s order says.
absolutely correct, and it's a shame it takes a conservative/responsible leader to convince the ncaa to retreat from their previous position. they should be able to do it themselves, and unfortunately, it took 4 years for them to cut it out. that they only stopped now just makes clear it's only because somebody like trump was elected, not because they actually recognize the wrongs in their prior standings. if a democrat is elected again, will they boomerang? well that's why it's time to replace outfits like the ncaa with outfits whose leaderships actually care.

the ncaa will also have to present awards previously given to men-in-blackface to the women who actually won the competitions in focus. that's another matter that must be resolved, and soon.labels: anti-americanism, lgbt cultism, misogyny, moonbattery, political corruption, sexual violence, showbiz, united states, white house

6 year old girl rescued from lev tahor


the islamized haredi cult may still be operating in guatemala, but fortunately, there have been proper efforts to extract children from their clutches:
a 6-year-old girl was rescued from the lev tahor cult in guatemala and transferred to the custody of her grandmother, who came especially from israel.

this is the third case in recent weeks of children being reunited with their families.

guatemala's attorney general's office confirmed that the girl was handed over to her grandmother after a comprehensive background check was conducted on the family. the grandmother will remain in guatemala until the legal proceedings have been completed.

this rescue follows recent successes in closing down the cult. last week, a hasidic couple fled to the us with their children, and about three weeks ago, another family escaped from the cult.

this operation follows the authorities' raid last december on the cult compound, in which 160 abused and neglected minors were rescued. the children are still residing in the local welfare facilities.
one of the most angering things about lev tahor is that clans like them take away attention from more serious issues involving islamofascism. one more reason why they must be dispersed altogether.labels: dhimmitude, haredi corruption, islam, israel, latin america, misogyny, sexual violence

3 hostages of hamas were kept underground


new details of 3 more hostages freed from the captivity of hamas tells of the horrible situation they were in:
what happened to the hostages during 491 days in hell of gaza? with the return of ohad ben ami, ori levi, and eli sharabi from hamas captivity on saturday, new details are emerging about their harrowing ordeal, both psychologically and physically, as evidenced by the images that shocked the world.

the three hostages were held in severe conditions, according to their testimonies. for most of their captivity, they were given very little food kept in underground tunnels without exposure to daylight. they stated that they had no way of knowing whether it was summer or winter outside.

their access to media was extremely limited, with al jazeera being the primary source of news they were exposed to. they were given very little food, and even when they did receive meals, the nutrition provided was insufficient to meet their bodily needs, leading to extreme weight loss.

the hostages recounted that in the days leading up to their release, they were given slightly more food in an apparent attempt to create the illusion that their captivity conditions had been adequate. however, when they emerged, they appeared frail and emaciated, reflecting the true reality of their ordeal.

according to a source at sheba medical center, levi and sharabi were unaware that their family members had been murdered. levi's wife, einav, was killed in the "death shelter" at the nova festival, while sharabi's wife and three daughters were also murdered. the body of his brother, yossi, is still in gaza. the two were informed of their loved ones' fate by psychologists who spoke to them at the reception point in re'im.
it's all absolutely abominable.labels: anti-semitism, dhimmitude, islam, israel, jihad, knesset, military, misogyny, racism, sexual violence, terrorism, war on terror
