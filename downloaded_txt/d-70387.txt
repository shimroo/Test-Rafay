i’ve sailed three times with victoria cruise lines down the yangtze river, and enjoyed a wonderful adventure on every occasion. with a fleet of well-maintained ships and a top-notch staff, victoria is second to none.âjohn shors, bestselling author of unbound: a novel of the great wall of china




we have cruised up and down the yangtze river numerous times with victoria cruise lines, and have enjoyed the scenery, the shore excursions and the cruise experience greatly. the accommodations, the meals, and crew entertainment made our time on board a truly great experience. we have found all the staff and crew from the captain down to be very professional and courteous, treating all passengers equally at all times, and making us feel like family members. the river guide and the cruise director were very experienced and helpful from the time we arrived.we have gained many happy and lasting memories from our many cruises with victoria. we would recommend victoria cruise lines to anybody thinking of cruising the yangtze river.âdawn and malcolm mc gregor, australia




excellent service, care and attention from the staff, particularly those in the dining area. meals offered a wide and pleasing selection.the room was clean and comfortable.all in all the yangtze cruise with its breathtaking scenery was one of the high points of our visit to china.âsandra ayoung-khan, trinidad & tobago, west indies
