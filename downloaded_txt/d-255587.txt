artist c. w. slade








      born in los angeles, ca, c. w. slade is a contemporary mixed media artist working in a variety of mediums including painting, collage and printmaking.  she incorporates her travels, philosophy, and poetry into her own unique artistic language.  she is a storyteller using the artistic process as a means of exploring lifes mysteries.  beneath the surface of each painting are evocative suggestions of color form and language that reflect the artists process.  her paintings allow the viewer freedom to participate in the process by offering clues, messages and fragments of meaning.  recognizable images are gracefully integrated within the abstract composition thus creating a bridge into the painters territory.
