emerging leaders
the emerging leaders program helps young members gain leadership experience and make connections in our chapters, on our committees and on our board.









 

as a young officer, i joined afcea, and it helped me rise to the next level of my professional excellence by understanding the cyber information, information assurance and all the various technologies. it connected me with people who understood the business, and we could make everything better for the air force and the nation."

we need to encourage our junior officers to get involved like my boss encouraged me 13 years ago. i look back on the effect [membership] had on me to build confidence and being able to engage and to have professional discussions about what we’re doing not only inside the army, but jointly with service partners and what we’re doing with industry.”
