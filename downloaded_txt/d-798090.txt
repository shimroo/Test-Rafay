integrated servo motors
clearpath includes a brushless, permanent magnet motor, high-resolution encoder, drive, and motion controller in one package (plus a 3-year warranty).


industrial i/o and motion controller
clearlink is an ethernet/ip industrial i/o and motion controller, which can control 4 axes of stepper/servo motion and 13 points of analog/digital i/o.
hudson bldc servo motors
teknic's hudson servo motors are designed to excel in the most demanding oem applications, and provide benefits including:
reduce motor footprint and maximize power output with optimized magnet shape, motor skew, and rotor geometry.
improve machine reliability with a brushless servo motor designed with oversized bearings, class h windings, and 3-year warranty
increase machine performance with hudson's high torque density and fast electrical time constant
designed, built, and tested in the usa







product overview
specs and pricingmeridian integrated controllers
meridian is an integrated motion controller and digital servo drive that is capable of controlling servos, linear motors, and steppers. benefits include:
reduce machine vibration and increase throughput with g-stop™ anti-resonance
use the accelerated prototyping system™ to diagnose machine performance, reduce development time, and get your machine to market faster
improve stepper motor smoothness and increase power output with meridian's vector sinewave commutation
meridian's "sfoundation" is a source code library that provides the majority of the motion functions you'll need to get your system up and running quickly
3-year warranty






product overvieweclipse digital servo drives
eclipse is a state-of-the-art digital brushless servo drive capable of controlling brushed and brushless servo motors. benefits include:
reduce move and settling time, audible noise, mechanical wear, and more with the ras motion smoothing algorithm
eliminate overshoot and improve machine performance with teknic's proprietary servo algorithms
reduce development time with quickset's digital oscilloscope and move generator
3-year warranty







product overviewmotor brakesspring applied power-off (or fail-safe) brakes are used in applications that require the axis to stay in position, even if the machine loses power or is turned off (this is common for vertical applications or when additional safety measures are required).
front mount compatible with any nema 23 or nema 34 motor frames
24vdc input for easy actuation
nema 23 pricing starting at $219 and nema 34 at $296
buy online; 90-day satisfaction guarantee; 3-year warranty







product overviewipc dc power supplies
the amazon™ intelligent power center (ipc) is designed and built specifically for motion control applications.
high output capacitance and built-in regen control system prevents over-voltage shutdowns and the need for external regeneration control and load resistor
high peak power drastically reduces power supply droop during motor acceleration
buy online, starting at $199
built in the usa; 3-year warranty

product overview
specs and pricingteknic legacy productsteknic continues to advance the state-of-the-art in servo motion control. as a result, new products are engineered to provide greater performance, reliability, and value. products that are eventually displaced by the introduction of new technology are not simply discontinued—the components continue to be manufactured and supported for as long as parts are reasonably available.when products are forced into end of life, teknic's factory engineers work with customers who desire to extend the life of their legacy machines with newer servo components. some of teknic's legacy products were available for nearly 30 years before they moved to end of life status.
