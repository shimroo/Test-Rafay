michael mccafferty



advisor to entrepreneurs




ok, here's the short story: i'm a 6x serial entrepreneur, retired. one claim to fame is inventing and programming telemagic, the first #crm (customer relationship management) software product, in 1985. of course, back then there were no other products like it so the category name crm didn't exist. that changed fast, and now there are lots of products in that category. 

	i built a company around the software, and it grew quickly, but eventually the stress got to me so i sold the company on october 2, 1992. then i bought an open-cockpit biplane and became an adventure aviator for the next 7 years and wrote a book about it. 
	
		today i'm well rested and live quietly by the sea in del mar, california, where i love helping startup entrepreneurs. i also love to shoot pool, and play freestyle beach frisbee. i'm now a minimalist, so the biplane is gone, but i do have a nice bicycle! for the last seven years i've been working with a skilled and passionate team building the iphone app tobewise pro. 



i started building this website when the internet was just getting going, and since i like to write, there are lots of pages and topics here. check the keyword index below to help find something of interest, or use the search bar. thanks for stopping by.
