entry requirements
    adulttoyreviews.com is not a pornographic or erotic site. if you want porn, you need to look elsewhere.
    adulttoyreviews.com is an independent consumer activist web site devoted to reviewing and comparing the tens of thousands of adult sex toys available on the market (we’re slowing building towards completeness).
    we do provide links for sources on the web for purchasing toys (we clearly label the cases where we receive an affiliate payment, which helps support the costs of maintaining the web site), but you can print out web pages of interest and make your purchases through mail order, at adult boutiques or bookstores, or from private toy parties.
    all information provided by retailers or manufacturers is clearly labelled. the important part of the site is the comments shared by consumers. we use a manual system for posting your comments to the web site. this filters out “junk” messages, spam, and hate speech, but sometimes results in a posting delay.
    we’re working hard to provide the kind of independent consumer review that has been missing from the adult toy industry. we need your help. in addition to sharing your experiences (good or bad) with specific toys, we also need your feedback on how to make the web site better. contact us at toyreviews@adulttoyreviews.com.
