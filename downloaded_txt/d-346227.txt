connect 
                            with the unique spirit of molokai with useable art 
                            
                              designed by popular island artist, linda johnston. 
                              
                            all the products feature her work and are made with 
                            aloha in hawaii.

                            her art depicts memories and scenes of molokai in 
                            passionate tropical colors. 
                            vibrant florals, landscapes and hula dancers capture 
                            the warm allure 
                            of molokai that draws people back to the "most 
                            hawaiian" of all the islands.

                            a lively sense of humor comes through in her molokai-kine 
                            t-shirts
                            that poke affectionate fun at life on molokai. 
in hawaiian, 
                            it is said that molokai "no ka heke "
(nothing better!)


so, 
                            aloha - and slow down ... 
                            this is molokai...

 artist's tribute 
                            to hula kahiko - 
the ancient traditional 
                            hula



the dog dance 
                            performed circa 1991 in molokai 
performed 
                            at the first ka hula piko near coconut grove, this 
                            dance was performed by a member of legendary kumu 
                            john ka'imikaua's hula halau. the artist, greatly 
                            inspired by the dance, studied hula for many years 
                            before she felt ready to complete the painting. both 
                            figures are the same dancer, shown in animation as 
                            she bounds forward to the beat of the hawaiian pahu 
                            drum, practically shape-shifting into a canine. in 
                            2010, the artist had the privilege of being introduced 
                            to the dancer who is still active in the halau. the 
                            original painting is not for sale.
