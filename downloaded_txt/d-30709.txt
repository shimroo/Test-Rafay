    tsunami alert partly lifted after aceh quake
    
   








a tsunami watch declared after two major earthquakes off the coast of indonesia's aceh province has now been partly lifted, the pacific tsunami warning center (pwtc) says.

a quake with a magnitude of 8.6 triggered the initial warning, which was renewed after another quake a few hours later measuring 8.3.

alerts remain in place for indonesia, india and the islands.

there have been no immediate reports of damage or casualties.

the region is regularly hit by earthquakes. the indian ocean tsunami of 2004 killed 170,000 people in aceh alone and some 250,000 around the region.

the us geological survey (usgs), which documents quakes worldwide, said the first aceh quake was centred at a depth of 33km (20 miles), about 495km from banda aceh, the provincial capital.

    solomon islands: six dead from tsunami
    
   





from the cnn"at least six people died in the solomon islands monday after two earthquakes and a tsunami hit the western part of the island-chain nation, the country's chief spokesman said.....the united states geological survey said the first earthquake took place at 6:40 a.m. (2040 gmt on sunday) and was centered 25 miles south-southeast of gizo, new georgia islands, and 1,330 miles north-northeast of brisbane, australia.a second quake of 6.7 magnitude hit a few minutes later, according to the usgs. it was centered 75 miles west-southwest of chirovanga, choiseul, solomon islands, and 1,410 miles north of brisbane, australia.the quakes led to a tsunami warning for a huge part of the pacific. australia and indonesia were among the areas named in a warning from the pacific tsunami warning center, as were papua new guinea and several other islands in the region.a watch was issued for some other parts of the pacific, including new zealand, the philippines, american samoa, guam and fiji.initially, hawaii was put under an advisory, but not a watch or warning. by evening, the advisory was lifted. the solomon islands are popular with international tourists. most homes in the mountainous islands are constructed of timber and bamboo, with villagers relying on fishing and logging for employment."labels: news, solomonislands, tsunami

    swedish survivors, 14 months on
    
   





press release received this week:when asked, one quarter of swedes who were in southeast asia during the tsunami reported impaired mental well-being fourteen months after the disaster. this is shown in a comprehensive follow-up carried out at the national center for disaster psychiatry at uppsala university in sweden, in collaboration with representatives from the stockholm county council and the karolinska institute.the report also shows that relatives, friends, workmates, and neighbors provided the most important help when the travelers returned home. a large proportion (78%) of those who responded were in a place hit by the tsunami. among these individuals, 41 percent perceived their situation as life-threatening, and 27 wound up in the water. the most common explanation for why they each survived is that it was simply happenstance, that they were lucky.nearly all of them report that they were afraid another tsunami wave would come. one fourth were experiencing disturbances in their mental well-being at the time of the questionnaire. in total, ten percent show signs of post-traumatic stress reactions such as recurrent memories, nightmares, avoidance behavior, concentration problems, and sleeping problems.this proportion increases among individuals who had had their lives threatened, been physically injured, or lost a loved one. this latter group will be specially targeted in coming reports. the assistance these people were most satisfied with before leaving southeast asia was provided by the local people, close friends and relatives, other disaster victims, local health-care staff, and swedish volunteers. they were less satisfied with aid efforts from the swedish authorities.after returning to sweden, alongside their own resources, what was the most important factor in coping with the stress was support from close friends and relatives. if individuals actively sought help, it was primarily from crisis groups and family doctors, as well as social workers and psychologists at care centers. only a few turned to psychiatry. private psychotherapy and support from ministers was especially appreciated.the respondents also report that they were highly satisfied with the support offered at arlanda airport and the reception provided to those who lost loved ones at ärna airport in connection with the return of the remains of victims. many individuals were also satisfied with the support they received from insurance companies. these results constitute a first report, based on responses from nearly 5,000 individuals.they answered a questionnaire sent to more than 10,000 people fourteen months after the tsunami. the study was performed by the three largest county councils/regions: stockholm, western götaland (surrounding göteborg), and region skåne (surrounding malmö) as well as seven other county councils. the response rate was highest in blekinge.the study was carried out by the national center for disaster psychiatry at uppsala university in collaboration with the unit for crisis and disaster psychology at the stockholm county council and the department of medical epidemiology and statistics at the karolinska institute.the report can be read (in swedish) at: http://www.katastrofpsykiatri.uu.se/rapporttsunami061204.pdf

a tsunami warning system covering the indian ocean region is now "up and running", unesco has said. the un organisation, which has overseen the project, says the whole region can now receive and distribute warnings of possible tsunamis.the system is in place 18 months after the devastating tsunami of december 2004 that killed more than 200,000. the pacific region has had a system for 40 years and others are planned for the atlantic, mediterranean and caribbean.koichiro matsuura, director-general of the un's scientific and cultural organisation, said the nations involved should be "justly proud of having done all this and much more".there are 26 national tsunami information centres receiving information from 25 new seismographic stations. there are also three deep-ocean sensors to detect and report tsunamis. read the full article at bbc newsread the unesco press release

    help needed in the andamans
    
   





this in from a friend in the andamans.i don't know if this blog is still active but i need help...i've recently started work, with prayas andaman & nicobar, in one of the worst affected areas during the tsunami of 26th december 2004. my organisation has been here since the relief phase, and we basically work with child rights and ensuring that children are restored to their pre-tsunami (or even better by peaking any pre-tsunami acmes)states of life.life here is difficult but the work... is endless...!the relief work has long stopped and we are in the process of rehabilitation and rebuilding... and this is as equally crucial a phase as the relief phase...we need the world not to forget us...!the reason i'm posting here is to seek help with getting medical (peadiatric, ent, opth, dermatology, nursing, first-aid etc) and education (teachers and teacher-trainers) specialists over to the islands, with the view of conducting camps and workshops (orientation, refresher and capacity-building)here.i still am in the process of formulating an overall plan and would appreciate tips and ideas.if anyone has anything for me i'm contactable at vijay dot jivay2003 at gmail dot comthanksvijay

    remembrance week - 26th december, 2005 - 1st january, 2006
    
   





last year, on the 26th december, an earthquake, and then a tsunami, killed, wounded, or impoverished hundreds of thousands of people in south asia.during the course of the year, other disasters took their toll too. most devastating of them: hurricanes katrina and rita on the south-east coast of the usa; and another enormous earthquake near pakistan's border with india.these disasters took their immediate toll, and, each time, the world tried to help. but as calamity piled upon calamity, there has been a certain amount of fatigue. perhaps people's stock of goodwill has run low. perhaps seeing too much suffering hardens us.but, the fact is, the suffering from those disasters has not ceased. parts of south asia have still not recovered from december 26th, 2004. in the usa, normalcy hasn't returned to new orleans. in pakistan, thousands are still homeless, and may not survive the harsh himalayan winter.they need your help.last december and this january, the online community came together as never before to help in the aid efforts in south-east asia. the lessons learned there were put to use, and improved upon, when the other tragic events of the year unfolded.can we harness that goodwill, that togetherness, that willingness to help once more?the worldwidehelp group would like you to join us in remembrance week. here's what we suggest you do.use your blogs, your home pages, your wikis, your newsletters. link to your favourite charities and ngos, write a paragraph about them and the work they are doing, and ask your readers to make a donation. (if you'd like to find some more charities and ngos, please take a look at this page on our tsunamihelp wiki, this one on our katrinahelp wiki, or this one on our quakehelp wiki.)please link back to this page to help pass the word. you can use the image above.please use this technorati tag: disaster remembrance week.here's the code:<a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/disaster%20remembrance%20week" rel="tag">disaster remembrance week</a>in this post, we have a few more banners and buttons, with intructions on the code you must post to use them.

    800 tsunami bodies remain unnamed
    
   





almost a year on and australian experts are still on the ground in thailand dealing with the appalling aftermath of the tsunami.  the australian federal police forensic team said yesterday another 800 bodies in thailand are yet to be identified. many never will be. afp disaster victim identification teams rushed to thailand after the waves hit, putting to work their experience gained in identifying bodies in tropical climates during the aftermath of the bali bombings. once established, the afp found itself co-ordinating a crack forensic squad made up of experts from 30 countries.though the horrific mess left behind by the tsunami is today in the back of most australians' minds, the afp dvi teams are still confronted with the horror on a daily basis, working in conditions that are hot and uncomfortable. the afp will wind back its commitment to thailand in february, but only after teaching the royal thai police the latest scientific techniques in identifying bodies. australia will also leave behind a $50,000 trailer kitted-out with the latest forensic equipment.  about 5000 people died in thailand when the tsunami smashed into the coast on boxing day.  read more....source: herald sun

    most of japan's bilateral tsunami aid remains untouched
    
   





more than two thirds of the bilateral aid japan offered after the indian ocean tsunami remains untouched, raising questions on whether the massive assistance met victims' needs, a report said monday. japan was one of the biggest donors amid the outpouring of global sympathy following the dec. 26, 2004 tsunami, disbursing us$ 500 million to governments of affected countries and international aid groups.but nearly 70 percent of the 24.6 billion yen ($204 million) in bilateral aid to indonesia, the maldives and sri lanka remains unused nearly a year later, the asahi shimbun reported. indonesia, the biggest aid recipient at 14.6 billion yen, did not start using the money until may 4 and as of nov. 10 had withdrawn only 15.8 percent of the funds, the newspaper said.japan, the world's biggest aid donor in dollar terms after the united states, usually offers low-interest loans rather than grants and attaches the money to specific projects. but after the tsunami, japan broke with its usual practice by giving cash handouts and letting governments choose what to spend the money on, although their plans still had to be approved by tokyo. by contrast, japan offered $20 million in aid after kashmir's earthquake in october.source: the jakarta post

    the tsunami: living in transition
    
   





just under half a million sri lankan people were displaced by the tsunami that hit the island's coastline on the morning of 26 december 2004. nearly a year on, many are still living in refugee camps, waiting for government and aid agency help to rebuild their homes. they have been told they may have to stay in transitional shelter for up to three years, while the estimated 100,000 homes to house them are built.save the children sri lanka has funded photovoice, a london non-profit organisation, to run a five-week intensive photojournalism training workshops near matara, in the island's southern province, to let children document their lives a year after the tsunami. journalists david gill and annie dare are teaching eight children between the ages of 12 to 18 from the coastal village of kamburagamuwa.some of the group lost family members, some lost friends, some lost belongings and some lost homes. as the anniversary of the tsunami approaches, each of these children is lucky enough to have a permanent house to call his or her own. for the next fortnight, they are partnering families from the nearby fishing community of talaramba. here they are gathering stories from and photographing the daily lives of people forced to live in an overpopulated transitional shelter made of wood and corrugated tar sheets.in the coming weeks, annie and david will also be training children living in the transitional camps in photography, so that they too can tell their stories. the next update on the bbc news website will include these pictures. an exhibition of the final body of work will be exhibited in sri lanka at the beginning of december and also at save the children in london ec1 from 19 december. if you are interested in finding out more about this project or the resulting exhibition please contact anna at photovoice.orgsource: bbc news via servesrilanka

    magnitude 6.5 quake hits off indonesia
    
   





a magnitude 6.5 quake rattled two islands off the coast of sumatra on saturday, triggering a tsunami alert and panicking some residents, officials said. there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties. the quake's epicenter was located off simeulue island, about 160 miles southwest of medan on sumatra's west coast, according to the u.s. geological survey. it struck just after 9 p.m. local time.the island is near the epicenter of the dec. 26 quake that caused a massive tsunami, killing at least 180,000 people. indonesia's meteorology and geophysics agency put the magnitude at 6.2, saying it was centered 19 miles under the indian ocean seabed, about 40 miles southwest of sinabang, the main town on simeulue island.rusdi, a resident of sinabang contacted by the associated press, said the quake was felt there, but did not cause any widespread panic in the town. he uses only one name. the quake strongly jolted nearby nias island and was felt in medan, said subagio, an official at the meteorology and geophysics agency's jakarta office who goes by a single name. agus mendrofa, the deputy mayor of nias, told el shinta radio station that some people momentarily fled their houses when the temblor struck."it was pretty strong because it was the first time in the past months that people ran out of houses because of a quake," mendrofa said from the island's main town of gunung sitoli.he said he had received no reports of damage elsewhere on the island. saturday's tsunami alert was issued by the pacific tsunami warning center in hawaii.source: bbc news | abc news | cbc

    fearing aftershocks, pakistan hospital treats wounded outdoors
    
   





lying on makeshift beds on a hospital lawn in this northwestern pakistani hill town, some screaming in pain, hundreds of men, women and children wait for help. but they have to stay there for now, because doctors say the monster earthquake that rumbled through the region early saturday could have made the building dangerous."we feel it is unsafe to keep patients inside," amir shah, a senior doctor at the ayub hospital in abbotabad, told afp.already at breaking point because of the flood of victims and a shortage of supplies, vilent aftershocks added to the worry."our doctors and paramedical staff are scared to go in. the building has already developed cracks," shah said.abbotabad is on the road towards the epicentre of the quake and is just miles (kilometres) from the worst affected area, where thousands of people are feared to have died. in the nearby districts of mansehra and malakand in north west frontier province police said the up to 600 had perished, while pakistani-controlled kashmir was thought to have suffered even bigger casualties. some of the injured interviewed by afp at ayub hospital said they saw entire villages razed."i was working in the field close to a building when i felt the jolt and saw houses tumbling down to the ground," one of the injured, wali rehman, from ugi village in north west frontier province, told afp."i know my mother and my family have died," he said, weeping.another victim from near balakot town in kashmir said at least 200 homes in his village were flattened. "it was complete devastation all around," jehanzib khan told afp.as ambulances and vans continually ferried injured people to the hospital, the lawn became more crowded with patients. a hailstorm as night fell a hailstorm added to their discomfort. dozens of people, mainly workers from the local al-khidmat private aid service, had gathered at the hospital, trying to arrange medicines, food and blood for the injured. they also brought food for victims to break their fast as the third day of the muslim holy month of ramadan came to a close. but doctors feared they have only treated a fraction of the victims from the earthquake. many affected areas have been cut off by landslides and it will take people hours or even days to get to abbotabad."we need medicines, blood and equipment to treat the stream of wounded people," said doctor nadeem gohar.source: reliefweb
