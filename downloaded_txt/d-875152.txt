research






at harris college, we consider how human behavior relates to health in our research.
                              that’s why our research focuses on the scholarship of teaching and learning for health
                              care, behavioral intervention and wellness, health care disparities as they relate
                              to social determinants of health, and clinical organizations and practices. we engage
                              in innovative research by maintaining a close connection between students and the
                              community and equipping students to think like clinical scientists.
