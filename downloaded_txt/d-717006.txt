set a schedule

setting a schedule is crucial for effective studying. it helps you prioritize tasks, manage time efficiently, and reduce stress levels. to set up an effective schedule, start by creating a to-do list of all the tasks that need to be completed within a certain timeframe. if you take long on making your homework, you should know how to start doing your homework faster. next, divide your study sessions into manageable chunks of time. this will help prevent burnout and improve retention rates. be sure to include breaks between study sessions as well – this will allow you to recharge and return more focused and refreshed.
when setting up your schedule, consider the optimal times for studying based on personal preferences and energy levels. for example, if you’re a morning person, try scheduling longer study sessions in the morning when you feel most alert. remember that schedules aren’t set in stone – they can always be adjusted as needed. the key is to find what works best for you and stick with it consistently over time. so grab a planner or calendar app and start mapping out your study schedule today.
find a study space

another factor to consider is lighting and temperature. make sure the lighting is adequate for reading and writing and that the room temperature is comfortable enough for long study sessions. it’s also helpful to have all necessary materials within reach, such as textbooks, notes, or stationary supplies, so that you don’t have to keep getting up every now and then just to grab something. don’t forget about ergonomics. sitting down hunched over your desk can lead to back problems later on, so make sure that you are seated comfortably with good posture.

homeschooling, or also known as home education, is giving education to children at home, rather than in a formal or personal school. behind this concept are incredibly different reasons, such as dissatisfaction with the available curriculum, as education experts feel that children are not progressing with the conventional school building? on the other hand, according to authority.org, parents in south carolina agree that homeschooling is not considered an excellent solution for their children. however, other regions believe that it is on the rise and gaining a lot of attention. let’s take a look at the pros and cons below.

advantages of homeschooling
according to parents opting to homeschool are some of the benefits of being able to closely monitor their child’s education, along with the ability to understand potential learning problems. for many of them, regular schools no longer offer the benefits of one-on-one care and support. homeschooling also offers a lot of opportunities to protect children from bullying. many parents report that their children face bullying and pressure in schools they did not want to see. time flexibility can be seen as a benefit. children’s interest in things they don’t need or consider decreases.
few educational institutions provide quality education, and children may not have to study in certain classes and schools. going to places they don’t like can lead to negative emotions and poor academic performance. residential learning is a way to get rid of all problematic situations. in a comfortable environment, children gain knowledge without interrupting their studies. children have more opportunities to make overall progress with homeschooling. with this type of instruction, students can delve deeper into areas that interest them.
disadvantages of homeschooling
considering all the points that have led to a variety of homeschooling, it should be noted that this approach also has some negative points. the first is that the enrollment process is the responsibility of the school. it is completed step by step, while this procedure cannot be followed throughout the home school construction. every parent should be able to prepare learning materials for their child, but it lacks learning goals and success in the curriculum, unlike schools. another thing to consider is that when a child is raised at home, they have little contact with other children at that time. they can’t experience classrooms and do projects at school, they can’t have lunch with friends, they have dynamics in addition to other faculty events.
students cannot ask their friends for help with homework because they are not in school. it doesn’t necessarily mean that children who go home to do research cannot communicate well, but they forget about the little things that other children enjoy, except that they can work harder and increase their skills. homeschooled children do not have the same opportunities in the job market as children who attend serious institutions. as someone who has undergone interactive and experiential learning, it is unlikely that this individual will have the same specific psychological development, mental development, and psychological disorders. …

due to lock down many people are staying at home and bored. that is why they are looking for activities that can relieve the boredom they feel. most people prefer to play board games, because they are brain games that can help you get through quarantine. aside from it being fun to play, it is also educational.

chess
it simulates two countries at war and fighting against each other until a king is cornered. what i love about this game is that it is a test of intelligence and strategy. there is no component of luck or chance. in this era, it is easy to find directions online, but chess rarely came with most of the documentation. to learn, an individual must be educated by someone who must learn from someone, and so on. i think it’s a legacy that connects the past, distinctly fashionable.
ticket to ride
each participant puts a color chip on a track and receives 45 cards of one color. a table with a map of america is placed in the middle of the dining room table. there are cities, each connected by some railways. these lines consist of only one and are only one of eight colors: gray, yellow, black, white, purple, blue, brown, green, and red. the deck of cards is shuffled, and three cards are dealt with each opposing player. players can choose to lose any one of these cards, but they must keep at least some of them.

clue
a clue is an exciting mystery game designed for three or six players. hasbro publishes it. the object of the game is to find out who killed the game’s victim, mr. boddy. you’ll have to decide which weapon was used in the murder and where. i remember playing this game, and i remember how much fun it was and how i grew up once. if there are new versions of cluedo available now, i prefer the cluedo version. the “murder weapons” are made of excellent material and the playing cards and the board. i would recommend this product to anyone who enjoys solving a fantastic puzzle.…

tips to help you play better in scrabble

suppose you’re trying to improve your scrabble game, here is the list of scrabble. it’s been years since you last played, and you want some clues about how to play. here are some scrabble tips to help you play better with your friends.
learn to the letter q
you can see if someone is pulling the q. attract a look of horror and a smile. the distinction between these two players is understandable. if you don’t remember them all, a q shouldn’t be a cause for concern, because the word “iq” can be played almost anywhere. if you are blessed, you can put it on a card. this will give you a score of 74 points for two letters. not bad, right? but do you think the letter q can be admired?
watch for prefixes
it’s often easy to overlook the use of prefixes after playing scrabble. finding prefixes such as un, re, dis, and anti will advance your game. it’s a fantastic concept. it will help you prepare your mind for analysis. be aware of the possibility of suffixes, er, est, or ly. these tiles must be moved to the side of the board.
master the two-letter words
would you play it? use them. because they allow you to form words that are not on your board, they open up many possibilities. you can discover these words, like to, which you use every day, be, can, my, you, and find a set of words to bring into your arsenal of hooks if you don’t want to because you don’t need to know how important they are. they are ideal, or perhaps practical, to put at the beginning or end of a sentence.
make compound words
can you remember what a sentence is? it’s words like “close-up,” “table door,” two sentences that mix to form a whole. keep your eyes open on the board for compound words. whenever someone touches a phrase, review the vocabulary, and see if there are words you can amplify at the end of the beginning of this word to form a second word. this is one of the reasons.
depending on who you’re playing against, you may think you’ve played smart, assuming you can add an s or even a d from the final letter, in which case a so. they are more capable of prolonging a drama than together, knowing that they left you open when they are likely to take their word. the look on their face can be precious when you do it. it will probably happen in the same round before, and after a note – two final scores may overlap if done correctly.
play defensively
it’s irrelevant if you leave the competition and get a score. your opponent may have one in hand if you are aware that you have never achieved a high score. do not leave them an attractive business card.
swap your letters
do not resist tile replacement. a tray full of consonants or vowels is loaded, …

as we know that education is one of the important to have a great career and a better life. many methods applied to tech, such as online english school focuses on thai children. in this way, children will get better learn in english. there is nothing more harmful than uneducated or unemployed men and women. furthermore, the aims of education and objectives have changed with every production. here is some point why children need education
education system
education could be achieved by identifying the educational system and the training system. the education is not a privilege of a group or a neighborhood. this fact has been accepted by all countries.
but the question here is whether this is implemented. for this to happen and to create this system in these countries, four aspects must be guaranteed, there are extensive, efficiency, equal rights, employability
everybody has the right to get a better education
in applying the structure and purpose of education, the demography of the nation, policymakers, and educational actors must take factors into account. they must be able to make education attractive to all taxpayers in the contributory age group.
a country’s system must, therefore, be proportionately comprehensive. gardens, schools, colleges should be defined in percentage terms. no candidate should be denied the right to education. the expansion has become the title of this game.
for centuries education has been limited to one type of community, individual, or village. there is equality. enough people have been excluded from finding the opportunity for education. however, it is a factor – equality for education. all taxpayers, regardless of the type of social, financial, and political barriers, should have. today we are given the opportunity to address the tradition of education. or it is this nation that is called a budget collapse. it is the responsibility of this country to ensure that the gross enrolment rate (ger) is similarly proportional to the specific age category of the country.
while almost all countries have focused on areas such as awareness-raising and equity in education, there is one thing they have overlooked or focused little on the benefits. this training has been given at their level. the level of education has become secondary for all the decisions that have been taken on the number of students. it could meet people’s needs, so one wonders if education is meaningless. this will lead to a mass of educated but unemployed men and women. this will be solved by us, where we will use it. if a nation’s school education never matches the skills expected of associations or businesses, then these efforts to improve the machine or the requirements of a country’s needs are probably pointless.
get a good job
duty has been questioned by thinkers. almost all companies have expressed concern, and most graduates are unfit for work. even if you discover job opportunities, there is a shortage of skilled workers for the job. this raises the question. here is the answer: you have to identify …

if you’re reading this, you understand english to a certain extent. you speak well and read well, but something is missing. you’d like to compose. you’ve tried to raise your writing, and you feel like you’re walking in a circle. you run because the backup does not seem local – your customers and a company leave your website. you have created a website, and people are continually complaining that they don’t understand your grammar. even if you keep trying to correct your work, it doesn’t seem to make any difference. your writing will be unnatural for speakers.
writing is not natural. it is a skill that is difficult because it uses the left and right sides of the mind. you have to think and apply the grammar and punctuation rules of the language creatively. fortunately, these problems can be solved entirely. lots and lots of practice. in addition to writing, more practice is needed. writing is one of the skills that require more than this—having the ability to want to learn to read in a certain way, even to bring the audience’s ideas, and also the ability to consider a particular way of reading.
the latest technological achievements and apps like grammarly claim to challenge and offer precisely what seems impossible: an advanced english grammar time corrector who reads and corrects our biblical composition with just a few clicks. in recent decades the use of word processing and copywriting options has increased.

can it make life easier for us?
manual correction
automatic detection of paragraph structure problems neglected by manual correction. we can probably count on unique advantages that are not covered. this web marketing technique is continually evolving and brings us new ideas and additional options that help us improve our english editing and writing skills.
basic grammar
thanks to this english grammar time corrector, we were able to treat one of these regions of a language – this can be “grammar.” undoubtedly, this type of intellect and experienced editors cannot keep up, but this could help individuals. although accessible, we can expect this exciting technology to continue to develop on its own, with one goal in mind: writing is one of the essential tools that can help us in many of our daily tasks at home, at school, or even in the office.…

why do students need to work part time? 



						may 18, 2020

working students are familiar, and each student has their reason why they choose to do it. either they want to support themselves by having a part-time job, or they want to spend their holiday more productively through summer jobs. whatever the reason, working students probably know that they have more advantages in the job market after graduation. however, not all these students understand how to make the most of their work experience. for better job records, students need to recognize these five elements that will help them win a dream job:
develop reactive skills
being knowledgeable is not enough to be a competent worker. act reactively to ensure that you know what you are doing. sharp your skills to be more responsive to anticipate problems and know how to deal with them. 
an employee who is successful in this first aspect could adapt faster and optimize productivity. of course, a company loves these demonstrated skills and work ethics of a candidate. those errors, failures, accidents, and problems that might arise are things that put a strain on the employees. if a student wants to exercise better in being reactive, gain experience as much as possible while at work.
gain actual job experience

a recruited company would not pay much attention to your class performance. they would see and learn more about the student’s performance in the workplace. be it your work fulfillment, achievement, or execution; the company would love to hear it from the previous student employers. the better the comments, the higher chances they are interested in the student.
learn responsibility and reliability
being responsible and reliable is essential to get the job done. it would also help you to work effectively. if you are always ready to accomplish the task given, even unsupervised, and do the job well, your employer can see you are trustworthy. it would make them happier if you could exceed the requirements of quantity, quality, and punctuality they have set and expected.
improve social engagement
the workplace is not only about the job. as a worker, you also need to get engaged with your co-worker. the company would be interested in working students who are valued by people in the workplace. it is well-perceived that a workplace requires collaboration, teamwork, and collaboration to get the job done well. 
so, maintain a relationship with your colleagues during your working student time is also essential. there is a chance that you get crucial information about the training you need through your colleagues. try integrating into their professional network, too. if they are satisfied with your excellent performance, they would gladly give references, or even a job offer when you graduate.
make your resume stand out
it is no doubt that all working students have these last criteria. being able to help the company earning money, customer trust, and create balance and efficiency products are what working students know well. highlight these achievements in your resume would help you earn points.
indeed, student job … 


virtual work 

the perks of a virtual job

more and more people are seeking virtual work, and they have all the right reasons. in 2018, mathematics and economics, insurance, real estate, engineering, and marketing were a few of the many fields of expertise that had experienced a robust increase of virtually employed workers. with more companies joining the virtual bandwagon, so are workers outdoing each other for the positions these virtual companies are looking to fill in.
this trend has no signs of slowing down. with the benefits it gives to companies, such as increased productivity and savings from operational costs, other businesses will surely be shifting to this kind of set-up in the future. as for workers, the following are enough reasons to leave their 8-hour job and become virtual employees working in the comforts of their homes.
convenience
working while not having to leave our homes is indeed very convenient for every homemaker. when you work at home, you do not have to beat the rush hour to escape the traffic by walking up early, and you don’t have to wear those tiring heels for eight long hours as you do in a normal to have that ‘pleasing personality.’ basically, virtual work requires no supervision; you work independently to achieve the results you are expected to come up within a timeline. indeed, you are you when you work in your home.
higher compensation
one of the primary reasons why many are shifting to remote work is that virtual companies offer higher salaries. in a 2012 survey, the yearly average income of regular employees in the us is around 52,000 dollars. although it must have increased by now, regular office employees do not enjoy what virtual workers are entitled to, a good-paying job while comfortably working at home.
more opportunities to save on money
working at home can save you from spending on somethings that are required of you when you work in an office. you do not have to pay for your fare when you commute. your gas expenses will also inevitably dip because you will not be using your car every day, and you will not be spending on your lunch. indeed, there are many expenditures that you can get rid of like budgeting on apparel, make-ups, and other things.
doing home chores in between
virtual work is not only for those who want to have higher salaries and savings, but it is more attractive to homemakers who think they have a lot to do in their homes, but not actually. working at home means that you can juggle from your virtual work to do some home chores. you still can prepare meals for your family by managing your schedules properly. one apparent advantage of virtual work is you can have time for everything if you use your time management skills to the fullest.
indeed, there is more breathing space when working as a virtual worker. freedom, who does not desire it?…

after reading the job posting and you think you are qualified, the next thing to do is write your resume. resumes should be a masterpiece that will create the best positive impression of an applicant. when the reader, usually the hr head or the hiring manager, is impressed, you must have booked yourself an interview, for sure. but you are not an english major graduate. right? your problem, undoubtedly, is you are not a writer, and you cannot even write an average curriculum vitae.
these days, that is not a problem anymore. the other applicants to the same position you are applying for may have also hired resume makers to do their curriculum vitae. yes, you need not worry about how your resume will look like because there are resume maker services online.
the real problem lies now on who makes the best curriculum vitae. that is for you to solve. but we can help you with the following tips.
 

shows interest in you
the ideal cv writer should be interested in his topic, and that is you. honestly, your made-to-order cv can only do justice to your profile until the writers know you well. he should always go out on his way to interact with you, ask clarifications, and to know you on a personal level. in that way, he will be able to write your resume as if you were the one who wrote it. your cv should have the personal touch that reflects your personality.
experience and flexibility
an experienced cv writer does not only count the years he has been in the business or how many clients he served. his expertise should include how well he understands the industries around him, the nature of hiring companies, and the current trends that affect employment. this being said, a cv should be flexible so that each cv he makes will fit the preferences of intended employers, the profile of his clients, and the position being applied for. as he can make a top-of-the-line cv for an engineer applying for a job in the reputable construction firm, he can also make a resume for a senior high school drop-out seeking for a part-time job in a fastfood chain.
strong communication style
it is a given that all who are into cv writing have excellent communication skills. the resume should always be considered as a promotional tool for the applicant. thus a cv writer should have a convincing communication style to be able to impress and satisfy the hr or the hiring manager for that matter.
emphatic and sincere
an ideal cv writer does not only know you by the profile that you provided, or through the answers that you gave to his questions, but he can see what is beyond. he knows what qualities you have, even if you did not write it. this makes him sincere about his intentions of helping you land the job.
in all honesty, a good resume made by a cv writer can …
