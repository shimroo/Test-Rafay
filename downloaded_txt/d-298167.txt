national women’s political caucus - california state branch



a woman’s place is on the ballotfounded in 1973, the national women’s political caucus of california (nwpc ca) is one of the longest-standing, grassroots organizations that recruits, trains and supports pro-choice women candidates who support our “bottom line issues” for elected and appointed offices at all levels of government regardless of party affiliation.














thank you to our golden circle members!
