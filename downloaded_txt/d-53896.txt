30/01/2025 - keith (bugsey) memorial track day

keith (bugsey) hornsey memorial track day 2025
 
it was indeed very special to attend the recent track day at the collie motorplex to honour a great friend keith “bugsey” hornsey from the great southern.
being a very mild sunny day, a large crowd had assembled at the venue. bugsey was a long-term active member of the great southern street machine association. he was also a great supporter of our club and members, attending our club track days for many years. he was always willing to help out on our day and would rally his club members to attend.
 
the track day attracted a full list of entrants and a variety of cars lined up for action on the track. many friends and families attended to mark this special occasion coming from many parts of the state as we all remembered and farewelled bugsey.  
all of bugsey’s family were in attendance, together with his faithful number 63 studebaker which was out on the track doing consistent laps being driven by his son. this was a great tribute to bugsey and his #63 race car.
at lunch time a parade lap was arranged for all in attendance to do a lap of the track.           
at three locations around the track bugsey’s ashes were scattered along the side by his family with his many friends and drivers looking on and remembering the great person he was. that was his lasting wish and it means he will always be at the track with his family and friends.
anna (collie motorplex) announced that this memorial track day will now become an annual event.
