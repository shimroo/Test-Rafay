breast surgery

body contouring

aging, pregnancy, and weight changes can leave you with areas of excess skin and fat. if you want a slimmer, firmer figure, dr. sanders can perform one of several body contouring procedures to give you fitter-looking features. his plastic surgery patients in the san fernando valley typically focus on tummy tuck and liposuction for their midsection. dr. sanders can also tighten a patient’s thighs, remove skin and fat from the arms, and address other sites as needed.

facial surgery

the best facial plastic surgery provides a youthful and attractive appearance, maintains natural expression, and restores your features to an earlier state — in short, it doesn’t alter your physical identity. dr. sanders is an expert in facial rejuvenation procedures that meet these criteria. his work includes facelift, neck lift, macs lift, and brow and eyelid surgery. patients can also target changes to a specific facial feature with rhinoplasty, ear surgery, and chin surgery.

“your adornment must not be merely external–braiding the hair and wearing gold jewelry, or putting on garments, but let it be the hidden person of the heart..”
this statement was made by the apostle peter nearly 2000 years ago, but it remains just as true today as it was then.
on this website you will find information about achieving external beauty, but true beauty arises from within. may inner beauty be the greater pursuit for each of you.
