about me
once i entered high school, i knew what program i would pick when the time comes. it was a ph.d. program in education at stanford university – this dream later became a reality which i still find one of my biggest achievements. this choice of mine was mainly made because one time, i met a professor who was teaching a course there, and we talked a lot about the education system in the usa and how it can be improved to be more affordable for all the students around the country. i worked in several learning institutions after my graduation and saw that the majority of students i met couldn’t find balance in their lives. i wanted to help them and found what i could do for people too frustrated with all the things going around. i consider the work of an essay writer as a way to support students and help them fulfill their dreams while also living full lives with proper social connections, career start, etc.
