update on the field



while there is construction underway on our expansion project, we want to assure you that the field of dreams movie site will remain open to the public from april 1-oct. 31. the work being done is on the other side of our expansive 300-acre site, and will not cause safety concerns or impede your enjoyment of all the field has to offer. while the dekalb corn is the star of the field of dreams, it is planted and harvested according to what is best for the success of the crop. we cannot guarantee the presence of corn at the beginning or at the end of our season.
