what our customers say









 
everything was perfect, the limo, the driver (mike, very kind) the reverend who take the time to listen to us and explain how the wedding will be, the wedding coordinator, the photographer, maria, the chapel, everything.


sandra & frank
 /  letter to chapel











 
we got wed at viva las vegas wedding chapel, the best choice we could make. 2 days before we walked along all chapels and this one was perfect. we came especially from the netherlands to have our wedding in vegas. not only the people at the chapel were super kind to us, also the rest of the day we spent on the strip was great.


arno and lisz
 /  yelp!











 
we found out the chapel we booked originally was seriously homophobic. we canceled our wedding there and found so many more options, better options and queer-positivity at viva las vegas. we were proud to be wed here, all of our guests felt welcome, it was a day of fun and togetherness. 10/10

if you are already married, renew your vows in vegas. viva las vegas wedding chapel has several “themed” weddings to choose from. we were married by elvis. my wife did not tell me we were going to do this, so it was a shock to see him up there. yes, it could be considered tacky, but it is also great fun, especially if you truly love someone.

it was a second marriage for both of us. the first time, i had been married by a catholic priest, a presbyterian minister and a unitarian minister. it didn’t work out so i figured elvis was the way to go. i was right and we’re a very happy couple. we do a vow renewal at the viva las vegas wedding chapel every five years with a different elvis. fifteen is coming up in 2019. i want the hawaiian elvis.

so we went with a star wars themed wedding with darth vader as master of ceremony, and it went great. darth was excellent and led to a memorable experience. the photographer was a really nice lady who did a great job and was very good at prepping us for what was to come. the limo driver who brought us over was a cool cat. the whole experience was great.
