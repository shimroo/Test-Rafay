the creation of your furniture or custom kitchen cabinets starts off with your thoughts and ideas. usually we work with your drawings or your designerâs drawings to produce our shop drawings. before we build your handcrafted piece, we will ask you a number of questions to make sure that our past experience gives you the best fit and function to meet your specific needs. we provide you with sample stains on various woods and give you a door sample to make sure that we all agree on your requirements. you will appreciate the attention to detail and the old world quality of our dovetailed drawers. at the end of the process your custom kitchen cabinet or custom one of kind furniture will be signed and dated.
we believe that you should be able to think outside of the box. there is no reason or need for you to try to fit your needs into a production piece of furniture or kitchen cabinet. we make high quality premium furniture and custom cabinets to fit you and your needs for a reasonable price.
