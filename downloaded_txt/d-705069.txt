it’s fall, so time for some home made chili!

//
october 3, 2016

as fall arrives and the temperatures begin to cool a bit, it always brings with it cravings for warmer, heartier foods. one of my favorite and easiest meals i like to make at this time of year is home made slow cooker chili.
i made my first batch of chili probably 8 years ago, thanks to my friend beau yarbrough.  he posted a  basic recipe for chili on facebook that didn’t intimidate me. here’s that recipe.

over the past six months i’ve taken a renewed interest in photography. i’ve spent most of my time with my new canon 7d, traveling around the world trying to capture those moments one at a time.
in addition to the canon, i’ve been itching to play with my (new to me, but) old widelux f7 film camera, built in 1978.

america’s got talent season 11 finale report (and geek out!)

america's got talent, television

last night i had the opportunity to see one of my favorite shows on television – “america’s got talent” – taped live at the dolby theatre in hollywood!
sharon, kevin and i at the conclusion of the america’s got talent season 11 finale.
i’ve been watching the show since season two and seen it taped twice before, but this time was different. for one, season 11 has showcased it’s greatest selection of talent ever! secondly, this time i was going to see the show taped as a guest of my friend kevin, who’s worked with agt judge howie mandel. kevin’s also a massive agt fan as well, so the two of us and my sister sharon made our way to the dolby theater to see the final 10 acts of season 11 give the performance of their lives for an opportunity to win $1 million dollars and a las vegas show!

25 years ago, i attended my very first los angeles clippers nba game and i’ve been a basketball fan ever since.
around that time i also got my first personalized license plate: la clipr. it lived proudly on my car until 2001. at that time i was broke and had to buy a new car – talk about bad timing. when it came time to decide whether or not to transfer the plates from my previous car — which was a lease in my father’s name (this detail will be important later) — i opted not to. i just couldn’t afford anything extra.

welcome to the new jonahweiland.com. whadaya think?
following the sale of comic book resources, which i founded and ran for 21 years, my life’s direction has changed – dramatically! which means i finally have time to return to a bit of blogging.
what’s next? if you’re asking me about what sort of work i’d like to do, i honestly don’t know yet. there’s a lot of things i’d like to do, but for me right now the focus isn’t on the next job, it’s on crafting the life i want to live!
