the stories collection brent mason telecaster celebrates the nashville studio ace’s legendary tele with a seymour duncan pickup trio, specialized control set, glaser bender and more. few players have a sound and style so revered that even their guitar mods are famous. but such is the case with nashville session king brent mason, whose personalized ’67 fender telecaster, equipped with three pickups, a third control knob and specialized wiring, is the stuff of legend — so much so that his distinctive alterations have become known amongst fans as the “brent mason mod.”now his beloved custom model has been reborn as the stories collection brent mason telecaster. this new guitar recreates the prized instrument mason discovered in a nashville guitar shop in the early ’80s, and per mason’s specifications it features a unique (and very un-tele-like) seymour duncan pickup trio: a vintage stack® tele® stk-t3b in the bridge position, a hot stack® strat® stk-s2 in the bridge position and a vintage mini hb in the neck position. controls consist of a distinct three-knob layout including master volume, master tone (with push/pull for middle pickup activation) and middle pickup volume — plus a three-position blade switch.
