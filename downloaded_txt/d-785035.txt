2021 nordic fest update


the nordic fest board is excited to announce that nordic fest 2021 will be held this summer, july 22-24.
this year’s theme is skål nordic fest: the festival with heart. after reviewing the projections for the pandemic and nordic fest’s economic impact on the area, the nordic fest board voted to move forward with this summer’s fest plans. the board will work with a variety of local partners to collaborate on best practices and safety protocols to have in place for volunteers and visitors alike. all involved continue to look ahead with optimism and creativity to make nordic fest 2021 a great and safe community celebration.
this summer will celebrate nordic fest’s 54 th year. we hope you will join as we toast (skål) our community, the visitors who travel to join us and the fest tradition that allows us to celebrate together. nordic fest is made possible thanks to the generous support of members and sponsors, as well as the hard work of numerous volunteers, organizations, entertainers, and businesses. it truly is a festival that showcases the heart of our community, as well as the greater driftless region.
