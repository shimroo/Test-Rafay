more from issue 403 - february 2025

 
cover of the february 2025 issue of antiquity, featuring a scots pine tree marked with several crosses and geometric patterns. these types of symbols on trees are affiliated with the sámi of northern fennoscandia and north-west russia. incised trees and an archaeological and ethnohistoric interpretive framework have been employed to explore the significance of such markings in sámi landscapes. the research is timely because intensive forestry is destroying culturally modified trees at an alarming rate, and their significance as the bearers of culture and history is being stripped from the region. for more information, see ‘x-marked trees: carriers of indigenous sámi traditions’ by ingela bergman, olle zackrisson & lars östlund in this issue (photography by lars östlund).
