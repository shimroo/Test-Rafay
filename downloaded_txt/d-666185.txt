				pipe & slab leaks			

pinhole pipe leak
a pinhole pipe leak is a minuscule leak in a copper pipe, small enough to be comparable to the size of a pinhole. these leaks can appear anywhere in your home’s plumbing system and might manifest as solitary leaks, in groups, or spread along a section of piping.
causes of pinhole leaks
several factors can lead to the development of pinhole leaks in copper pipes, and often, it’s a combination of issues that result in these leaks.

erosion due to elevated chlorine levels in the water supply
rust formation in the water heater
an imbalance in water ph levels, indicating either too much acidity or alkalinity
presence of bacteria in the water or surrounding soil, leading to microbial corrosion

slab leaks
a slab leak is a type of plumbing leak that happens beneath the concrete foundation of a house. while some slab leaks begin as pinhole leaks in copper plumbing, not all pinhole leaks escalate to slab leaks, and vice versa. a slab leak might also stem from a pipe that’s either cracked or entirely broken.
causes of slab leaks
slab leaks can arise from a variety of issues, which might include:

faulty installation practices
earth movements that lead to cracked slabs
pipe corrosion
friction and wear from pipes rubbing against concrete, gravel, or other materials

remediation for slab leaks
in cases where a slab leak is detected, the solution often involves rerouting the plumbing. new pipes are installed through the ceilings, attics, and walls of the home, effectively avoiding the need to deal with leaks under the slab in the future. this approach ensures homeowners can have peace of mind without worrying about future slab leaks.

				fixing water quality problems			

causes of discolored water and poor quality
several factors contribute to the degradation of water quality in residential plumbing systems, making repiping a consideration for homeowners:

corrosion and decay in old pipes: as metal pipes age, they can corrode and rust, releasing particles into the water, which can cause discoloration and a metallic taste.
buildup of sediments and minerals: accumulation of minerals and other sediments in the pipes can restrict water flow and affect water clarity, sometimes introducing harmful substances into the water.
biofilm formation: bacterial and microbial growth within pipes can lead to biofilm formation, which can affect water taste and potentially pose health risks.

impact of poor water quality
the presence of discolored water and diminished quality can have several adverse effects:

health risks: contaminants and bacteria in the water can pose health risks, particularly for individuals with compromised immune systems.
aesthetic and usage issues: discolored water is unappealing for drinking and cooking and can stain clothes, fixtures, and appliances.
potential for increased metal intake: consuming water with high levels of metals from corroded pipes can contribute to health problems over time


solution: repiping your home
repiping involves replacing old, problematic pipes with new ones made from safer, more durable materials like pex or copper. this process directly addresses the root cause of discolored water and improves overall water quality.
benefits of repiping with pex

resistance to corrosion: pex does not corrode, reducing the chances of discoloration and particles in your water.
flexibility: the flexible nature of pex makes it less susceptible to breaks and leaks, ensuring a cleaner water supply.

benefits of repiping with copper

longevity and durability: copper pipes have a long lifespan and are resistant to corrosion, contributing to cleaner water.
natural antibacterial properties: copper can inhibit bacterial growth, helping to ensure the water supply remains clean and safe.

richard was responsive every step of the way. his workers are specialists in what they do–re-piping and the subsequent patchwork. they show up when promised. richard honored his quoted price when it turned out that my house needed more time to complete than originally envisioned. and because repiping is all they do, their pricing is much more competitive than your average local plumber’s price. because i was referred to henrik by my sister, richard threw in a free shower faucet set for me. i now have a 50-year copper re-pipe warranty and know i will never have to worry about leaks or burst pipes again. highly recommend!

5/5 would use their services again. henrik is a great plumber but more importantly he’s a good person!! i lost my debit card at the gas station next door from henrik. i couldn’t find the gas station phone number so i called his business which is nearby. i asked if he could go check at the register if i had left my card. henrik found my card and hung on to it for an hour before i got back to la to pick it up. forever thankful !!!

				save money with repiping			

elimination of leaks help save money

immediate reduction in water waste: old, corroded, or damaged pipes can leak continuously, wasting water 24/7. even small leaks add up, significantly increasing your water bill. repiping replaces old pipes with new, leak-free ones, instantly stopping these leaks and preventing water waste.
focus on prevention: by removing the source of leaks, repiping with new pex or copper pipes prevents future leaks, ensuring that you’re not paying for water that’s literally going down the drain.

improved efficiency in water delivery

restored water pressure: old pipes can have buildup or corrosion inside them, reducing water pressure. this inefficiency often leads to running the water longer to achieve the same result (e.g., filling a pot or taking a shower), thus using more water than necessary. new pipes maintain optimal water pressure, reducing the need to use excess water.
consistent performance: new plumbing systems are designed for efficient water delivery, minimizing waste and reducing the amount of water used in daily activities.

reduction in energy costs

hot water efficiency: repiping can also improve the efficiency of hot water delivery. leaky or inefficient pipes waste not only water but also the energy used to heat that water. by ensuring that hot water is delivered more efficiently, repiping reduces the energy needed, which can also lower your water heating bills.

avoidance of costly water damage and subsequent repairs

preventive savings: while not a direct reduction in the water bill, preventing leaks with new piping also avoids costly water damage repair to your home’s structure and possessions, which can be a significant hidden “cost” associated with old, leaky pipes.
durable materials: both pex and copper have long lifespans, with less need for repairs and replacements. this long-term approach ensures that your plumbing system remains efficient and leak-free for many years, continuously contributing to lower water bills.
