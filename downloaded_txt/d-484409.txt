community gardens and city farms are places where people come together to grow fresh food, to learn, relax and make new friends.
community gardens australia (cga) connects city farms and community gardens around australia. it is a community-based organisation linking people interested in city farming and community gardening across australia.
 cga is a registered charity.
cga acknowledges the traditional owners and custodians of the lands upon which we live and garden, lands that have never been ceded, and we pay our respects to elders past, present, and emerging.
