about ink cartridges

the increase in the use of printers in the home and in small offices has led 
to an upsurge in the sale of printer ink cartridges in the uk. there is a wide 
range of products on the market and you can buy inks from retail outlets or from 
online stores. most reputable suppliers will sell genuine ink cartridges and 
many sell either re-manufactured or compatible ink cartridges as well. the price 
of the products is often governed by the make of the printer and some are more 
expensive than others. for example, genuine ink cartridges for a lexmark printer 
will be pricier than those for a more popular printer from a company like epson. 
many people choose compatible hp ink cartridges as these are considerably more 
economical than the original manufacturers equipment. when choosing a printer, 
many people factor in the cost of consumables such as paper and ink. companies 
will often exaggerate the print speed times and the cost per page so it is a 
good idea to check out some reviews before deciding which printer to buy. the 
popularity of remanufactured ink cartridges has declined as compatible inks have 
become sold at much cheaper prices in recent years. 





inks & printers

there are two kinds of inks used with printers. dye based inks are the type most frequently used for text documents and these come in either individual colour ink cartridges or a cartridge that holds three basic colours i.e. yellow, magenta and cyan (blue). these three colours combine to produce the whole spectrum of colour that is needed for graphics and photographs. the other cartridge that is used in conjunction with a tri-colour holds purely black ink. dye based inks take a few seconds to dry but produce very intense deep blacks.
the other type of printer ink is pigment based and this is the best kind for photographic prints as it dries very quickly. some companies like kodak sell special pigment based ink cartridges in a tri-colour and separate black and these combine to deliver lab quality photographs. the faster drying time of pigment based inks means that there is little chance of smudging. the latest technology from companies like brother has produced inks that make waterproof prints which will not fade for many years.



ink cartridge prices

original canon ink cartridges are some of the cheapest products on the market whereas hp (hewlett packard) are some of the most expensive. compatible inks for both of these printer types can be purchased from third party suppliers at much lower rates than the original products which are sold directly from the manufacturer. it is possible to buy kits to refill expired printer ink cartridges but these are messy and often turn out to be more trouble than they are worth.
cheap printer inks are now available from many sources and this has made home printing a much more viable prospect for many families. with the advent of digital cameras, the amount of home printers that have direct printing has increased making it very easy for anyone to produce top quality photographs at home. 




genuine or compatible cartridges

the amount of ink that is used by a printer can vary. black and white prints are cheaper than colour and it is important to choose a reputable company when you are buying replacement inks. poor quality ink can cause damage to a machine by clogging it up with residue that will prevent the printer from working. you can buy genuine printer inks which are often sold at a discounted price if you purchase multiple packs. cheap compatible inks will work just as well as long as you choose your supplier with care. good suppliers will sell top quality inks at very reasonable prices.
