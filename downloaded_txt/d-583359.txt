cons
despite the many advantages of deerfield advisors there are some areas that potential clients should consider.
cost
one significant drawback is the cost associated with deerfield advisors’ services. due to the high level of expertise and personalized attention provided the fees can be substantial. this may not be feasible for everyone particularly those with smaller portfolios or limited financial resources. the cost structure typically includes a percentage of assets under management (aum) which can add up over time. additionally some services might incur extra charges which clients should be aware of before committing to a financial plan.
accessibility
another potential concern is accessibility. deerfield advisors primarily caters to high-net-worth individuals meaning their services may not be readily available to the average investor. this focus on wealthier clients could limit access for those who are just starting their financial journey or have less substantial assets. additionally while they offer advanced technology and online tools the firm’s emphasis on personalized service often necessitates in-person meetings which could be inconvenient for clients who live outside their service areas. this geographical limitation may restrict the firm’s ability to serve a broader client base effectively.
performance and user experience
deerfield advisors is renowned for its commitment to delivering exceptional performance and a seamless user experience. their advanced technology and personalized approach are designed to ensure client satisfaction and effective financial management.
client testimonials

customer support
customer support is a cornerstone of deerfield advisors’ service, ensuring clients have access to knowledgeable and responsive assistance. the firm offers multiple channels for support, including phone, email, and live chat, providing flexibility for clients to reach out in their preferred way. clients often commend the prompt and effective responses from support representatives, who are well-versed in financial matters and can provide helpful solutions. additionally, deerfield advisors’ emphasis on building long-term relationships means that support is ongoing, with regular check-ins and updates to keep clients informed and aligned with their financial goals.
comparison to competitors
deerfield advisors vs. xyz financial services
when comparing deerfield advisors to xyz financial services, several distinctions emerge. xyz financial services is known for its accessible pricing structures and is more suitable for clients with smaller portfolios. deerfield advisors, on the other hand, primarily targets high-net-worth individuals, offering bespoke solutions with a premium price tag. both firms provide a range of services, yet the quality and depth of personalized advice from deerfield advisors often surpass that of xyz financial services.
performance-wise, deerfield advisors leverages advanced technology for precise financial planning, while xyz financial services may not offer the same level of technical sophistication. user experience also varies; deerfield advisors presents a more tailored approach, necessitating in-person meetings, whereas xyz financial services offers more accessible virtual consultations. this makes xyz financial services a preferable option for clients seeking convenience over in-depth personalization.
deerfield advisors vs. abc wealth management
abc wealth management is another significant player in the financial advisory space, competing closely with deerfield advisors in terms of service quality and client satisfaction. both firms cater to high-net-worth individuals, offering comprehensive wealth management services. however, deerfield advisors distinguishes itself with its client-centric philosophy, ensuring that each financial plan is uniquely tailored to the client’s goals and risk tolerance.
a notable difference lies in the transparency and communication styles. deerfield advisors is renowned for its clear explanations and empowering clients to make informed decisions, while abc wealth management’s approach may not always provide the same level of transparency. deerfield advisors also emphasizes continuous professional development among its advisors, ensuring they stay current with financial trends, a commitment that is not as explicitly highlighted by abc wealth management.
in terms of technology, deerfield advisors employs advanced tools to deliver real-time updates and a user-friendly online platform, enhancing the overall client experience. while abc wealth management also utilizes technology, it may not match the same level of innovation and user engagement offered by deerfield advisors.
conclusion
deerfield advisors has established itself as a premier financial planning firm, offering tailored solutions that align with clients’ unique needs. their commitment to a client-centric approach, combined with advanced technology and a highly qualified team, ensures precise and effective financial guidance. while their services may come at a higher cost, the value provided through personalized advice and strategic planning is significant. potential clients should weigh the benefits of deerfield advisors’ expertise and comprehensive support against the associated costs and accessibility considerations. for those seeking a reliable partner in achieving long-term financial goals, deerfield advisors proves to be a strong contender.

how to trade gold online

april 29, 2021

gold investment is fast becoming the most widely sought-after tool to either save for retirement or just increase your finances, and for good reason. it has long been considered a hedge against inflation and has certain characteristics to it that make it a very good investment. the supply of gold is very limited and this makes it a precious metal which is valued very highly, as the demand for gold is ever-increasing, with the making of jewelry being just one of the many uses of this precious metal.
trading gold with online platforms
there are many online trading platforms that you can use to invest in currencies, stocks, and even commodities, and all of these items are valued in u.s. dollars. the best thing about gold is that it tends to go in the opposite direction of the u.s. dollar, so when the currency is decreasing in value due to an economic crisis, the value of gold will increase, and if the dollar is strengthening, the value of gold generally tends to go down. another great feature of gold is that it also tends to go in the opposite direction of the stock market, as when the stock market is moving higher, people invest in it so that they can gain profit, while if the stock market crashes, these investors then move into gold which is a relatively much more stable investment.

the great thing about online trading platforms is that once you have opened a u.s. dollar account and registered it with one of these companies, which are used and regulated around the world, you can use the money that you have to buy or even short-sell any currency or commodity in real-time, without actually physically owning it.
one of the other good things about these trading platforms is that you can set limit orders on your trades. for example if you have bought 2 lots of gold at a price of $1200 and you think that the price of gold will touch $1300 and then fall back down, you can set a limit of $1300 or even $1299 on your trade so that it will automatically settle when the price touches that and give you a profit, without you having to physically monitor the trade all the time. this can be very beneficial as the prices of these currencies and commodities are constantly changing by small or large amounts and it is not possible to monitor them continuously.
there are many trading platforms which you can use to do this, for example markets trader, meta trader, etc, and these are all registered with the right authorities but you should still make sure that the platform that you use has a good reputation just in case.
trading gold in an ira
you can also trade gold in an ira account.  it’s called investing in gold ira.  click the link to read more.  this is rapidly becoming an investment that people are jumping into.
the most important thing to know when investing in gold is that you should always follow the trend of the market and try not to go against it. you should also put some time and effort into researching the few things that affect the price of gold so that you can have a clearer idea of what decision to take, and whether to buy gold if you think the price will go up, or sell it if you think that the price will go down.

do’s and don’ts of kitchen remodeling

october 16, 2020

if you have remodeled your kitchen before or if you are planning to do one in the near future, you know how intense the whole thing can be. you first have to decide the new layout of the kitchen and make sure that it is perfect for your workflow. then you pick the color scheme that goes with the rest of your house and then you just have to wait and see how the whole thing comes together. you just have to pray that you made the right decisions or you’ll be seeing the whole thing go downhill right in front of your eyes.
and before you can stop it, you’ll already be out of thousands of dollars.
trust me, i know how it feels because when we were remodeling our kitchen, we were going through the same thing. in fact, it was even more intense because we knew we weren’t going to remodel our kitchen after this one. we would either sell the house and move into a new one or just live in this one forever.
so we had to make sure that we got things right the first time. and that’s when we realized that there has to be a list of do’s and don’ts of kitchen remodeling on the internet. we wanted to make sure that other people don’t have to go through the same stressful situation like we did.
so, here it is.
do’s
have ceiling lights on top of your countertops
your countertops will be the place where you’ll be doing important work. so you want to make sure that that area is well lit. so when you’re installing your new lights, make sure that they are installed either on top of your countertops or along it.
but make sure that you are installing several lights on top of all the countertops you have to make sure that you have enough lighting in the kitchen, especially the countertops.
worst thing you can do is end up having shadows on your countertops whenever you’re working on them. we don’t want that.
add even more lights
even though i just said that you should have multiple lights on top of your countertops, you want to make sure that you have more than enough lights in your kitchen. there can never be enough lighting in there.
best way to do this is to allow for natural light to come in. that way, you can set up an ambience when the sun sets, or maybe you can have mood lighting above your island or maybe under the cabinets. it could come in handy when the guests are over and the sun is setting, you could have that natural light come in which the mood lighting turns on. an ample natural light will also help put emphasis on some kitchen decor such as if you have a vintage rug as a kitchen runner.
your kitchen would look perfect.
get an island if you have the space
i can’t recommend this enough. funny thing is, some remodeling contractors were recommending that i don’t get an island, and instead i should invest in better countertops or increase the countertop space. but the guys at https://www.aurorakitchenremodeling.com/boston/ said that i should ignore that and just get an island. that was the best decision i ever made.
i’mgonna say the same thing to you – just get an island.
it will naturally become the spot where everyone gathers in your house and you wouldn’t eve know it. plus, you will also get more storage space and additional countertop space anyway. so why not get it while also having the option to have everyone gather around in the same spot in your house?
it’s the perfect way to have a fun evening with friends and family.
don’ts
don’t keep your fridge too close to the wall
we made this mistake early on and we had to get a new fridge. we didn’t take into account that the floor trim would be installed later and that the fridge door will also take up space when we open it. so once the remodeling project was over, we weren’t able to open our fridge door all the way.
and since our kids were young at that time, they ended up making a game out of it and eventually the fridge door was no more.
so, make sure that you’re leaving enough room around the fridge to account for these things. in general though, it’s best if you leave a couple extra inches of space than you already were planning just in case. that’s the best way to ensure that you won’t have to either replace your fridge or change the layout of your kitchen by a couple inches.
do not get a stainless steel sink
i hate not seeing my sink spotless and dry. i make sure that my kitchen is clean and everything is exactly where it’s supposed to be. i take pride in that. we had a stainless steel sink before and it never looked clean.
the only time it looked clean was when i was done doing the dishes and i had wiped it off. that’s when it was shining and looking all pretty. but 30 seconds later, if someone had washed their plate, it would look wet and just dirty.
i know it’s just a personal preference and some people don’t mind having wet sinks, but if you want to have your kitchen looking perfect all the time, avoid getting stainless steel sinks. just get a black one or some other type of sink.
don’t keep your oven too close to another appliance or a wall
you want to make sure that your kitchen is looking pristine and not cluttered. if you have a lot of appliances placed close together, or if every appliance is placed near a wall, soon a pattern emerges and your kitchen will end up looking like a fortress that is being protected by appliances standing near the wall.
avoid that and mix things up a bit. especially with the oven, make sure that there’s space between it and the walls and even other appliances to ensure that there’s enough airflow around it. your oven will generate heat and it has to have enough space for it to escape or it will start damaging itself if it’s near a wall, or it will start damaging other appliances that are near it.

an in-depth seo keyword research guide for beginners

september 14, 2020
 / 
admin
 
keyword research is where seo starts. it doesn’t matter how great your website is. if it is ranking for keywords nobody is searching for, you won’t get any traffic no matter what. and i see a lot of beginners making huge mistakes when choosing which keywords to go after.
surprising thing is, even though there are a lot of guides out there about this, seo newbies are still making these mistakes which leads me to understand that either those guides are too complicated for them, or maybe these newbies are just targeting keywords that everyone is targeting which is a big no-no.
so i want to go over how i do keyword research for my clients and affiliate websites and hopefully you can learn how easily it is to find low competition keywords and start seeing some results.
importance of keyword research
keyword research is the only way you can find out what people are searching for on google. whether you are planning to start a new company or write a new blog post on your website, you want to make sure that you are targeting keywords that people are searching for.
and a lot of website owners make the mistake of not doing this and that is the reason why https://www.nabilansariseo.com/boston/ says  that more than 90% of the website owners never get any traffic from google.
if you think about it, you always want to make sure that there is a market for the products you’regoing to be selling. keyword research is how you find that out. if you are selling something that nobody is searching for or nobody wants, then you are setting yourself up for failure before you even start anything.
with proper keyword research you will be able to find out:
whether there are people actively searching for what you are planning to sell or write abouthow much traffic will you get if you rank #1 for that keywordhow difficult will it be rank for that keywordwhether or not people searching for those keywords will become your customers
how do i research keywords?
i like to keep things simple by having a set number of steps i have to take to find the keywords that i like and would be happy doing seo for.
starting with a list of “seed” keywords
coming up with a short list of seed keywords is how you want to start this process. these keywords help you identify what your niche is and who your competitors are.
for this, you’ll need to decide what product or service you would like to do seo for. once you have decided that, then coming up with a list of seed keywords is easy.
you just think about what other people would type into google to find that product or service.
for example, if you are an electrician in atlanta, then your list of seed keywords would be:
plumber atlantaplumbing services near mebest plumber in atlantaemergency plumbing services in atlantaplumber guy in atlanta
these keywords will help you identify who your competitors are and what keywords they are targeting.
reverse engineer your competitors
if your competitors are targeting certain keywords, that means they think they can make money from it. and obviously they would’ve only decided that after doing the keyword research themselves. so we don’t need to reinvent the wheel here.
if you don’t already have an ahrefs subscription, you should definitely get it because it is a priceless seo tool. if there was only 1 tool i’d recommend, it would be ahrefs. that’s the only thing you need to be successful with seo.
for the purpose of this guide, we will only be using the site explorer feature of ahrefs.
once you have a list of 4-5 competitors from the seed keywords list, you want to throw them into ahrefs site explorer one by one.
then click on top pages under organic search in the left hand column.
that will give you a list of the top pages on that website, how much estimated organic traffic they are getting and what is the top keyword that those pages are ranking for.
and boom! now you have access to all the keywords that your competitors are targeting on their top pages.
not just that, you can also reverse engineer what kind of information they have on these pages and you can structure your website in a similar way.
remember, i’m not saying that you should copy them. i’m only saying that you should take inspiration from these websites and create a slightly different and unique structure that you know will also work.
how do you choose which keywords are more important than others?
this is a good problem to have. now that you have a list of keywords that you know are good ones and you can’t wait to rank for all of them, you want to make sure that you are focusing on the most important ones based on what your seo goals are.
you don’t want to prioritize them based on metrics like what other people say in their guides. while they are not wrong, you sometimes pigeon-hole yourself thinking that metrics are everything.
you also have to consider the human aspect of seo – you.
let’s say you found a keyword that gets 1,100 search volume each month and another keyword that gets 300 search volume each month.
if you were just going based on metrics, you would choose the 1,100 search volume keyword without thinking twice. but you also have to think about motivation and confidence because whenever you are going after a keyword with a higher search volume, there will always be higher competition.
so, will you be okay seeing very slow movement for months and months at a time for a higher volume keyword or would you grow more confident with your seo abilities if you started seeing quicker movement and maybe even 1st page rankings for a lower search volume keyword?
me personally, even as a seasoned veteran would go for the 2nd option because that tells me i’m doing things right. not only that, it will also motivate me to put more time and money into that website because i am seeing good results.
my recommendation would be to go after a combination of low volume and high volume keywords. that way, you will start seeing quicker results for your low competition keywords while you keep progressing for the higher competition keywords.
and as you publish more content on your website and as it gains more backlinks, you will see it gradually rank higher and higher for those high competition keywords.
i hope this guide helped.

flipping vegas reality tv

flipping vegas is an american reality tv show that features scott yancey, a real estate investor, and his wife, amie yancey, an interior designer by profession. the show was aired on a&e network in the u.s from 2011 to 2013. it spawned 41 episodes before being finished. 
the show revolved around scott and amie and their real estate company goliath, as they bought, fixed, and flipped houses in las vegas, nevada, also their home town. the show used to originally air during saturday mornings until it was shifted to an evening spot during the third season. at the end of the show, it was shifted back to an afternoon slot and was split into two sections of which one was aired on fyi.
the show consisted of 5 seasons in total each featuring roughly 8-10 episodes with 42 minutes of length per episode. the show was widely regarded as one of the most informative real estate reality tv shows of 2011.
a short overview of flipping vegas
flipping vegas followed the lives of scott and amie yancey who bought run-down and completely broken houses for cheap and renovated them to sell them off at a huge profit. the two worked on the show through their real estate company goliath.
the fun and exciting part of the show was always the arguments and antics of the couples. scott yancey and amie had both very conflicting mindsets when it came to repairs and renovation process.
scott has always been very careful about spending his fortune on repairs, so he kept the budget very tight and the timeline even tighter. his wife, on the other hand, was a free-spirited and passionate type. she would never settle for a cheap makeover and would sometimes even go beyond the budget given to her for the makeover of the house. this would occasionally upset scott and the two would fight each other on the show creating drama and stress for the viewers.
parts of the show were also informative as one of the managers from the goliath company would invite various potential buyers and take them on a tour of all the houses on sale in las vegas. during this time, the real estate manager would pull off deals that would surprise the viewers as well as teach them about the basics of negotiating.
episodic review
to give you a good idea about the show, here are some short reviews from the first few episodes of the show.
episode 1, season 1 – the episode featured scott yancey and his wife who work with their project manager baldemar rivera in order to flip a house which was completely in ruins. at the same time, one of scott’s rental properties suffers from fire damage. scott sends away his manager baldemar to repair all the damage the fire has caused. scott runs into trouble while dealing with both the houses and his manager struggles to get the job done on time.
episode 2, season 1 – scott makes a hasty purchase of a house with remediated floor damage in a community with a guard and a gate for $225,00. this is actually six times more than the amount he usually spends on buying a house. when one of his real estate agents, heather stone, tours the house, she is surprised to find that the floor damage is actually much worse than they had thought of.
scott decides that there is nothing they can do and plans to spend around $20,000 on the renovations but then he discovers that the house is also infested with black mold. the black mold is later removed through an expensive process.
to discuss the design of the house, scott brings amie to tour the house with chad and michelle from the walker zanger business, the business from where they usually purchase the countertops and floorings for the house they are working on.
amie ends up with an expensive design idea which scott greatly disagrees with. so he hires a cheaper contractor named dino after baldemar, one of the project managers refuses to decrease his price to work on the house. scott gets in various crew members to get repair work done on the house in a timely manner so he can open it for tours by potential buyers. but amie and scott find out that dino’s crew have completely failed to correct the minor defects in the house.
after spending around $45,000 on the renovations, heather is able to sell it off for $349,000, which according to scott isn’t an amazing deal but he doesn’t mind it since he ended up buying the house hastily.

shipping cars for dummies

october 21, 2019
 /

whether you’re a family, a business owner, or a luxury car owner, there’s always a possibility that you may have to ship your car across the country or city. auto transport is something a wide range of people requires every year.
unless and until you are driving the car yourself to the destination, you’ll need to know how the process of shipping cars work. there’s a lot to consider, especially when you are shipping the vehicle across the country.
cross country vehicle shipping is handled by auto transport companies that specialize in moving vehicles quickly and safely from across the united states to elsewhere in the world. here is how the process is handled.

planning and scheduling
to ensure the vehicle reaches the destination in time, you will be required to schedule the shipping as far in advance as possible. pickup date will be given to you on which the company will send a car carrier to pick the car and begin the rest of the process.
cleaning the car
before you send the vehicle through a carrier, you must ensure the vehicle is completely empty. car carriers have a strict policy where weight requirements and insurance requirements must be met.
insurances never cover personal items so make sure all your belongings are out of the car before it ships. failure to do so will delay the process and will cause problems for the shipping company.
vehicle inspection
before the vehicle is taken from your hand to car shipping companies, it will have to be inspected for its condition. during transit, the car could be damaged so it is important to take photos of the car before shipping it.
once the car reaches the destination, an inspection will be held there too to see if any damage occurred. your insurance company will only cover the damages if you can provide proof that the car was damaged during transit.
low fuel and antennae
you have to make sure that your car does not have more than a quarter tank of gas before it is transported. more fuel in the tank means potential hazards on the way.
you also have to remove any loose parts from the car such as antennae, bed liners, and seat covers to ensure that they do not get damaged in transit.
destination pick up
once the car arrives at the destination, you will be given two options – have it delivered to your door, or pick it up from the location the company provides you. if you are living in an area where trucks cannot arrive, then you will have to pick the vehicle yourself.
moreover, picking the car yourself will also save you about $50 or more depending on where the car has to be delivered.
when the car arrives at the destination, it is important for you to visit the shipping company’s office and inspect the car before you sign any paperwork. if the car has been damaged on the way, it will be the only time you can claim for damages.
