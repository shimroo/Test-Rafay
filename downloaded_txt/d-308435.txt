traffic on the walking mall: 'let the people decide'
by cathy siegner
wednesday, february 09, 2005


if the friends of downtown helena gather valid signatures from 15 percent of the cityâs registered voters, helenans could see a measure on the september 13 (or november 8) ballot prohibiting nonpermitted traffic on the walking mall without a public vote.


two members of the groupâs steering committee submitted proposed ballot language to county clerk and recorder paulette dehart on monday afternoon. the petition must first be approved by city attorney david neilsen and, three weeks later, the group can begin collecting signatures.


a total of 2,255 verifiable signatures from registered voters within the city limits must be gathered, according to elections supervisor marilyn bracken.


âthis ballot initiative is the only option left to maintain the integrity of downtown helena,â said rachel peura.

swimming strong: local swimmers set new records at invitational
by alan barry
wednesday, february 02, 2005


swimmers from helena did well at the saturday invitational at carroll college. shown are lauren formaz (left) from helena high and hilary turner (center) and dani sandrock (right) from capital high. turner set a bruin record in the 200 freestyle, while formaz and sandrock had second-place finishes.


the capital and helena high school swimming teams hosted nine other schools from around the state at the bohn moerer invitational saturday at carroll college.


bozeman high school won the girlâs meet with 281 points, followed by flathead (244) and missoula hellgate. capital high school was fourth with 154 points, and helena high scored 88 points for fifth.


in the 200-yard freestyle, hilary turner set a new school record for capital. in a race that came down to the last stroke, bozeman's erin bell touched first by two one-hundredths (.02) of a second, but turner's time of 2:02.70 was a new bruin record.


walking the talk
by cathy siegner
wednesday, january 26, 2005


about 160 students, faculty and staff from carroll college recently caused a stir on campus by wearing t-shirts with deliberately insulting words printed on them. the words alluded to racial and sexual slurs and included âdyke,â âwop,â âinjun,â âfaggot,â ârag head,â âkike,â ânigger,â and others.


on the backs of the shirts was an invitation to anyone offended by the messages to come to a panel discussion about hate language the following night on campus, and quite a few people did just that, according to one of the eventâs organizers, ben fuglevand.


âwe had 80 to 100 students and faculty and community members show up, so that was pretty cool. i was pleased at the good turnout,â said fuglevand, 19, a freshman from seattle.


panel participants were travis mcadam, interim director of the montana human rights network; barb allen of pride; frank kromkowski from helena peace seekers; kat northup, a helena high school student; rep. carol juneau, d-browning; candie cain, carrollâs dean of enrollment services, and dan ladd from intermountain childrenâs home.

cold enough for ya? recalling the infamous winter of 1886-87.
by rick & susie graetz
wednesday, january 19, 2005


our recent cold snap may have been bad, but itâs nothing compared to the bitter cold montana suffered during the winter of 1886-87, when the stateâs ranchers lost an estimated 60 percent of their cattle, or 362,000 head.


in his book, âmontana high, wide and handsome,â montana author joseph kinsey howard depicted the vicious winter storms of 1886-1887 that beat the prairie and its unlucky inhabitants into submission. we continue his narration with the discussion of just how those residents fared.


âcattle which had been pushed over the missouri in the fall to the better grass on the northern range drifted back, for there was little shelter on the steppes north of the river. half dead from cold and hunger, their bodies covered with sores and frozen blood, bewildered and blind in a world of impenetrable white, they blundered into the barbed-wire fences, crumpled against them, and perished. they were trapped in drifts above their bellies and stood erect until their bodies froze. they slid into air holes in the rivers.


second fiddle....

wednesday, january 12, 2005


for the first time in many years, the gop doesnât dominate the montana legislature. will they make music with their colleagues across the aisle or will we hear sour notes until the session is over in april? shown (clockwise from top) are senate president jon tester, d-big sandy, senate minority leader bob keenan, r-bigfork, house republican leader roy brown, r-billings, and house speaker gary matthews, d-miles city.


by kristen inbody
his office small and sparse since he no longer âentertains dignitaries,â senate minority leader (and former senate president) bob keenan flipped through a three-ring notebook of news clippings on his desk in the capitol last week.


the 2-inch-thick binder is packed with hundreds of articles covering newly inaugurated gov. brian schweitzerâs election campaign, beginning with his declaration of candidacy.


âweâre going to hold the governor accountable for campaign promises and making sure they werenât just empty promises,â the bigfork republican said.

they're coming!

wednesday, december 15, 2004


look out, helena! the 59th montana legislature is about to descend on the queen city. lawmakers from across the state will be burning the midnight oil trying to divvy up the state budget.


legislative preview: the state budget
by kristen inbody
come january, montana legislators will face a budgetary phenomenon they haven't seen in years: an overflowing treasury. unlike their recent predecessors who dodged projected deficits by slashing programs, members of the 59th legislature will convene january 3 with a surplus estimated at $278 million.
yet deciding what to do with the money may prove anything but easy. one issue alone has the potential to derail what some legislators hoped would be the least stressful session in years.
âeducation has to be the 800-pound gorilla in the budget debate,â says outgoing rep. gary forrester, d-billings, chairman of the interim legislative finance committee.

death penalty hypocritical

dear editor:
dr. w. rea knight's letter (qcn, march 8, 2006) hit the nail on the head. he dared to say that if states want the ten commandments displayed in their capital buildings, etc., then they should be required to abolish the death penalty. that would avoid a lot of hypocrisy.

dear editor,
regarding the recent state health department recall of ammonia-tainted school food throughout montana, my 10-year-old son, who eats school lunches through the helena school district, complained several times of vomiting and a burning throat in the afternoon during this same time frame. on a couple of occasions, i had to leave work to take him home. school staff and i could not figure out what was causing his vomiting. he generally felt better within a few hours. his illness may have been caused by a virus or something else, although he had no fever, runny nose or other symptoms except for a mild headache.

to the editor:
i understand the frustration mr. bender expressed in his letter (qcn, march 8, 2006) that the aclu doesnât get it. i sometimes feel that way myself, and i work at the aclu. why does the aclu have to represent all these people with âoutlandishâ views? itâs because the rights and liberties set out in the bill of rights are for all americans, whether i agree with them or not. indeed, it is the very purpose of the constitutionâs bill of rights to limit the power of the democratic majority to ensure our individual rights. rich or poor, black or white or brown, man or woman, straight or gay, urban or rural, pious or atheist, american- or foreign-born, able-bodied or living with a disability, every person in this country is entitled to the same basic rights.

this is a story of what happens when wine goes bad. itâs a sad story, but one that must be told. first it starts sassing back to its parents. then, smoking behind the garage. pretty soon, itâs running around with its so-called âfriends,â spray-painting cars and tripping senior citizens as they try to cross the street.

dear wine guy: what kind of wine do i serve with what kind of food?
âpuzzled in the valley
dear puzzled: while there are definitely some guidelines that iâll be sharing with you through this column, the answer is once again, âthe wine you like and that tastes good to you.â donât get hung up on serving âthe right wine.â serve what you and your guests are going to like. itâs true that white wine is generally associated with lighter meals, summertime, fish and poultry, and red wine with heavier meals such as steak, but iâve enjoyed many white wines with steak and many red wines with fish.

'knocked up': more than just a sex comedy
by geoffrey stueven
wednesday, june 06, 2007


âknocked upâ is being touted as the new sex comedy from writer-director judd apatow, and while those two words capture something of the filmâs surface, they fail to do justice to its true strengths. as in his previous film, âthe 40-year-old virginâ, most of the laughs are derived from the sexual hang-ups and entanglements of the characters, but these are always dealt with in an unflinchingly honest way.

'28 weeks later': come the apocalypse
by phillip stephens
wednesday, may 30, 2007


ideally a zombie film or, more broadly, all post-apocalyptic fare â while made evocative through its frightening conceit â should serve as an excellent springboard for human allegory. the end-of-civilization motif made popular by such authors as john wyndham and richard matheson was seized upon by george romero and his original zombie trilogy and used to create an excellent vehicle for satire, exploiting the disturbing pitfalls faced by the human race once the veneer of civilization was stripped away.
