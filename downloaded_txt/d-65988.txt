hi greg, 
this is a wonderful computer desk.... 
  terrific for short folk like me. [model 33e] i can see though, with such a 
  great design, it really would be a boon for tall people as well. 
i've changed some of the shelving 
  configuration, and i'm wondering if you can send me extra slats for the 
  printer shelf. because everything is a little tight, i've put my printer 
  elsewhere (no problem) and i'd like to use the printer shelf for other storage 
  that requires a more solid surface. 
it looks like 5 slats will probably do it; 
  just let me know if you can do that, and what you'd charge. 
thanks for your thoughtful directions too. it 
  became for me a good exercise in really reading carefully, and then i was off 
  and running, having fun - so nice to handle lovely wood that fit together as 
  stated, with strong, simple hardware. i feel fortunate indeed to have come 
  upon your website!

hi greg,
i just came across your website after many years. i am going on ten years 
  now since i ordered my desk from you. i am typing this email on it. i love the 
  desk. it is solid and has kept up with my ever changing needs. when i ordered 
  i had one small monitor, today the standard is two 22â lcdâs. my desk has no 
  problem accommodating the changes. i have all my peripherals handy, too.
i still make adjustments as needed from time to time. having the 
  flexibility to adjust the height of the surfaces is such a luxury.
thanks again for building such a great computer desk.
