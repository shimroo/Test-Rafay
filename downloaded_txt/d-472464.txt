twin peaks: the return class at san francisco art institute


january 02, 2020





my twin peaks: the return - focus on the donut, not the hole class ended a few weeks ago, but some folks requested a viewing of the syllabus i created. here you go! the school, sfai, uses moodle as their learning management system, so you will be able to download the syllabus, peruse the weeks' readings, and see the different subjects and themes we unpacked in class. the link and password are at the bottom of this post.the only readings you won't be able to access are from the 3 required texts for the class. most of the readings are pdf's, though, so you'll be able to download those.teaching this class was a dream - thanks to sfai and christopher coppola for putting this into the schedule for fall and giving me the chance to teach it. hopefully, this can happen again in the future!link: https://moodle.sfai.edu/course/view.php?id=4885password: twinpeaks

it came from aquarius records - update, new clips, and completion date!


july 18, 2019





my third film in the aquarius trilogy is now on the post-production bullet train, with a completion date by summer 2020! read on for more, and click on the below link to see the first 7 minutes of the film, along with outtakes and extended, unedited clips…it came from aquarius records youtube channelit came from aquarius records is a feature-length documentary about the sf-based independent record store, aquarius records. having closed in 2016 after 47 years, this small apartment-sized store championed local, underground, independent, and challenging music to the masses - most memorably with their infamous bi-weekly, college essay-length, new-release lists.this doc has interviews with the aq owners dating back to 1970, other record store owners from around the world, musicians, label heads, music journalists, and intense music collectors. interviewees include matt groening (the simpsons), wayne coyne (flaming lips), bruce ackley, john darnielle (the mountain goats), ty segall, and liz harris (grouper).aquarius records influenced and enriched countless peoples’ musical tastes with their curated selections - but this film also shows the realities of an indie record store trying to survive in an increasingly difficult market of brick-and-mortar music shops, especially in the ever-changing and price-gouging mission district of sf.six years in the making, the film has a very personal angle, with lots of behind-the-scenes footage (and drama) that shows both the joy and excruciating stress that comes with running — and closing — a store like this.produced, directed and edited by kenneth thomas.currently in post-production.projected finish date: winter 2022.on a personal note: the original goal was to have this completed in 2017. various life events — moving to la, bouts of depression, re-finding and enjoyably embracing a career road into teaching, and all that “life stuff” — prevented this from being completed in a timely manner. having been re-invigorated by the positive life turn, as well as looking at all of this footage again, this project is back on track!so, stay tuned for more news and please peruse the youtube channel to view outtakes and extended cuts!

caleb scofield benefit concert, live at the wiltern


february 12, 2019





caleb scofield, bassist and amazing musician / songwriter in so many bands (a few of which are in blood, sweat + vinyl) died in the spring of 2018. the music community around him has majestically risen up to help out his family, through various fundraisers — central to this were 2 concerts: one in boston, and one in los angeles.i was honored with having been called upon to co-direct the boston live video stream, and to produce and direct the los angeles live stream. the link below is the archive — complete with chat transcript of that los angeles show, which took place on october 13th, 2018. 6 cameras and a live sound mix documented this event, which brought about the triumphant one-night-only return of isis — billed as celestial (the name of their first lp) for this show. 27, old man gloom, pelican, celestial (isis), cave in, and a special-guest-heavy set of zozobra songs. it was a thrill to produce and direct this live stream - please click below to check it out!preceded by a 14-minute mini-documentary about the boston show, also directed by me, containing rehearsal and live footage.link to youtube archive of live stream

off to the nordic for the aquarius records doc


may 27, 2016





i'm leaving on 28 may for 5 weeks - starting with a visit to finland, norway, and sweden. followed by iceland for 4 days, and then boston, atlanta, montreal, and ottawa. finishing off with a few days in central oregon with mom+dad, and to try and put my brain back together. this is all for a documentary i've been producing for the last 4 years, about a tiny record store in sf called aquarius records - but not so tiny that it doesn't have tons of fans and rabid record collectors that frequent the store... from all over the world. hopeful completion date is fall 2017. there are so many people to interview, so i'll have to rein it in to meet that date!but the trip isn't all business - for example, hope to meet this lovely horse whilst in iceland.
