"i flew in from texas to purchase a freightliner sprinter. nick had an uber waiting for me at the orlando airport to drive me to the dealership in sanford. this exceeded my expectations due to the amazing customer service! once there nick had everything ready for me to inspect and test drive the vehicle. the sales process was quick and easy and i highly recommend this family owned business because they care about their customers."

my father purchased a truck from debary truck sales and it has been a great truck for him. he has not had any problems and the truck runs great. i would highly recommend anyone to buy from debary truck sales.
sarah k


i needed a truck to build into a food truck in california. i worked with carlos cabito and all went well. i would call and he would answer or call me quickly. since i could not see the truck i hired a local mechanic not affiliated with debary to check out truck. the ad reflected the truck i was looking at and in good condition.

carlos worked closely with me to the end and is still working with me on future needs

thanks carlos
