âwhile our competitors are losing their manufacturing skills, weâre perfecting ours.â
dennis keiser
ceo, keiser corporation




family values
the values we learned growing up on the farm run through our company â a sense of integrity, dedication to work, and a commitment to one another. first and foremost, keiser is a family company.
                                            


keeping jobs at home
we decided a long time ago, we couldnât send our jobs overseas. so, we designed our machines to be built at home. and we built a team that believes in keiser, its mission, and each other to meet our high standards.
                                            


owning our technology
weâve always designed and built our own products. we donât just design our machines to work better, we make them to be better. and we keep our technology at home to give you the finest in american-made quality.
                                            


perfecting our manufacturing
to compete with low-cost, foreign manufacturing, weâve leaned out our processes and honed our manufacturing skills. it hasnât been easy, but while our competitors are losing their manufacturing skills, weâre perfecting ours.
