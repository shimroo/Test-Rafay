if i hire danny to do a custom concept rendering why is the price so high?





the prices will be higher due to the time and effort required for creation. danny never use artificial intelligence to create a rendering. he takes a photograph for reference and starts a project from a sketch. it demands the same amount of effort as building a custom vehicle from the ground up. if you cannot find your specific automobile on the website for use as a custom rendering, danny will need to create the artwork from start to finish. a significant amount of time, and craftsmanship goes into developing a drawing however, it remains more affordable than hiring an artist who charges between $2,500 and $5,000 for an original painting. renderings are excellent for generating visual excitement for presentations at car shows and events. showcasing your whitfield designs at the sema auto show can help you gain visibility and attract potential customers.have a look at design renderings created by danny whitfield

short summary of danny's skills 














































a fusion of art and engineering





		whitfieldâs work seamlessly merges art with engineering, a reflection of his profound understanding of both fields. his career began in industrial design, which gave him a unique perspective on the meticulous process behind automobile creation. this background is evident in his art, as he accurately reproduces even the most intricate details of each vehicle. whether itâs the gleaming chrome of a 1957 chevy bel air or the aggressive stance of a modern mustang gt, whitfieldâs attention to detail brings each car to life with stunning realism. however, his work goes beyond technical accuracy. whitfield infuses his art with emotion, capturing the soul of each car. his pieces often evoke a sense of nostalgia, celebrating the cultural significance of iconic models from bygone eras while appealing to car enthusiastsâ passion for speed, style, and innovation.
	
















































honoring automotive icons





		whitfieldâs portfolio includes a wide array of vehicles, from american classics like the ford mustang and corvette stingray to luxurious imports such as the ferrari and porsche. his art celebrates these automobiles not only as machines but as cultural icons that embody freedom, power, and individuality. he often personalizes his pieces to reflect the unique characteristics of each model, making them instantly recognizable to enthusiasts. in addition to individual vehicles, whitfield frequently creates collections and series that explore specific themes, such as muscle cars of the 1960s or supercars of the 21st century. these collections serve as visual histories, chronicling the evolution of automotive design and engineering.
	
















































signature style and techniques





		whitfieldâs signature style blends photo realism with a touch of artistic idealism. he frequently uses vibrant, saturated colors to emphasize the bold lines and curves that define automotive design. his compositions often place the car at center stage, isolated against simple or atmospheric backgrounds that enhance its visual impact. the result is artwork that is both dynamic and timeless. one hallmark of whitfieldâs technique is his ability to capture light and reflections on a carâs surface with extraordinary skill. his use of highlights and shadows replicates the way sunlight dances across polished metal, giving his pieces a three-dimensional quality. this mastery of light is particularly evident in his renderings of classic muscle cars, where the interplay of chrome and paint creates an almost tangible sense of texture.
	
















































a legacy of inspiration





		danny whitfieldâs automotive artwork has earned him a devoted following among car enthusiasts, collectors, and art lovers alike. his ability to transform mechanical objects into works of art underscores the beauty and artistry inherent in automotive design. by preserving the legacy of classic and modern vehicles through his work, whitfield ensures that their cultural significance continues to inspire future generations. in every piece, danny whitfield captures more than just carsâhe immortalizes the dreams, aspirations, and memories they represent, solidifying his place as one of the foremost artists in the world of automotive art.
