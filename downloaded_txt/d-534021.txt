connecting people to god and to each other 



 






worship 



619 broadway, fargo, nd 58102

we strive for worship to be invitational, contagious, and relational. we want more people to hear the message of jesus, and we will do anything to erase any barrier that prohibits people from a spirit of worship. 



we have two different styles of worship, one in the sanctuary (traditional) and one in the celebration center (contemporary).

				...for building up he body of christ, we must grow up in every way into him who is the head, into christ, from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by every ligament with which it is equipped, as each part is working properly, promotes the body's growth in building itself up in love.
