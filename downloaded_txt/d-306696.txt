malik: wings’ foul-out endemic of an arrogant organization

george malik continues his practice of posting excellant columns on kukla's korner with this critique of the wings' pr department. he gets a lot right in the first section, where he accuses the organization of arrogance. i do think, however, he somewhat overestimates the response the team would receive if they were to change its ways. hockeytown has become more and more pistonstown and tigerstown lately, and i suspect it will be hard to return to the glory days of wings fanship.

greg johnson retires

due to his heart ailment, greg johnson has retired from the nhl.  i don't want to blame ken holland too much on this one, other than the fact that a physical could've been demanded prior to signing him. and catching the ailment before signing him would've allowed the wings the cap space to go out and get a young forward. obviously this is all in hindsight and neither johnson nor holland saw this coming. enjoy your retirement, greg, and i hope your condition improves.

don't write about hockey, drew sharp

sharp got his annual  "let's bash hockey and the wings" column in today's free press. go read it if you can stomach it. favorite bit of editorial wit: but change hit home like a cold slap thursday. steve yzerman took the ice in only a ceremonial role. brendan shanahan was opening on broadway. and the goalie that everyone in detroit truly wanted was on the ice.the problem was he played for the other team. yes, drew, the first two were definite slaps to the face but you're speaking for yourself on the third.









shanahan gets 600th goal

      i really would have loved to have seen that. i wish he could have gotten those two goals while still in detroit. congratulations, shanny!

as for the wings, they lost last night and didn't look good while doing it, though it was still great to watch them again. definitely a lot of rust, for just about everyone on the team. hopefully they'll be better on saturday against the pens.

it was very strange to see lidstrom wearing the "c," but draper and zetterberg look good with the "a." now i have to get one for my hank jersey.

i'm sorry about the lack of posting. i really did mean to do a preview of the game, if not the season, but just was not able to fit it in. i hope to be able to start posting more regularly sometime next week, when the homework push is over.

kubina may be suspended for shot at hudler

update (7:39 pm): the tsn article has been updated to say that kubina has, in fact, been suspended for toronto's first regular season game. he'll forfeit $26,737.97 in pay. - matt

the leafs' pavel kubina was assessed a match penalty during last night's exhibition game in toronto (a 3-2 shootout win for the wings) for a cross-check to jiri hudler's face. now, the league is reviewing the play and may suspend the defenseman for at least toronto's season opener against the senators.

i only caught a glimpse of the play while watching it live (i was distracted) but it seems pretty clear that kubina ought to sit out at least one game. hudler is the shorter player by a fair margin, kubina has to control his stick, even when taking a cheap shot after the play. hit him in the chest next time, pavel.
