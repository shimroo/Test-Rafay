						welcome to spokesdog.com! i have been training dogs and people for over 20 years and love what i do for a living. it is my passion. my training approach integrates the dogs mind, body and spirit and my basic training philosophy is catch your dog doing something right. i enjoy teaching people how to communicate more effectively with their family dog to alleviate frustration on both ends of the leash. i believe loud is not leadership so my techniques incorporate what i call whisper training. my training programs include real world training which not only builds the dogs confidence around lifes surprises but help teach the dog to listen around various distractions away from home or a classroom environment. in addition to dog training, i love taking my registered therapy dogs to hospitals and nursing homes where we try to bring comfort to those individuals who may benefit from the healing powers of a dog offering unconditional love.
