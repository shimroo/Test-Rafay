decision time!  i've received countless e-mails from blog readers what's up with lack of posts.  the answer is time.  over the past 6 months my job...my career has kicked into high gear and has left little time if any to blog or even watch tv.  then while out on the road this past summer how great it was to be able to be out and doing something in one's free time.  so with that i have come to the conclusion to cease postings for awhile.  guys, there's more to life than sitting around blogging about cable news.  get out there and find it!
