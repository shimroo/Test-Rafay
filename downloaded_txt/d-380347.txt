just thought i'd let yall know january in an unsanctioned match i shot an hg agg of 1.230 @ 600yds, which would have been a record, this past saturday i backed that with a 1.298 for a new pending heavy gun agg record! 
the saturday before set highest score in 39 yrs at the bullseye annual groundhog match , all using kelbly actions polar and panda.
the rifle the kelbly team built was instrumental in helping me win the 2019 minnesota mid range ftr championship a couple weeks ago.  from the initial conversation about the rifle build to discussions about replacement barrels, your team always took the time to address my questions to help me reach solid conclusions.  
i want to thank you for a great rifle and the time you’ve invested in helping me along the way.
i sent a few photos from a successful hunt in greenland. muskox - hunting distance 420m (460 yards) fox - hunting distance 485m (530 yards) hare - hunting distance 300m (330 yards)
the temperature fell to -30 ° c (-22 ° f) and kelbly rifle 6.5x47 lapua and scopes march 3-24x52 ffp worked without any problem. i am me and my clients very happy with your products - it's the best i've ever used. i am honored to be able to use your rifles.
the deer was taken last weekend from a game ranch north of college station, texas.
the buck weighed 225 lbs, has 20 pts and scored 231.
this bruiser is entered into the tgr scoring/records system, but will not know how this deer rates until later.
thank you kelbly’s for getting my actions to me on time. ryan chambered up the barrel and had the rifle bedded and ready for me in record time. i had very little load development time. but it did the job this weekend at grrc [harris mn]. ended up winning the match with a rifle i’ve only had for a week. i couldn’t be more pleased with how smooth the panda is compared to my other customs.
i’ll be shooting the pandas from now on.
