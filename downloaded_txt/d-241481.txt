tee m. 
									oxtail with white rice and fried plantains								


the oxtail was tender and flavorful and not sugary sweet like most places. 










 


marjy g. 
									jerk chicken								


had the jerk chicken with red beans and rice (yes, i was hungry. don't judge.) i didn't think it was that spicy at first but then it crept up on me like strong liquor. just how i like it.i can count on one hand how many times i'm in the bronx, but i will travel for good food. 










 


kay l. 
									curry goat								


great customer service and great food. i had the fried chicken, jerk chicken, curry goat, and seafood soup on my last visit. everything was delicious and flavorful. they never disappoint. i would definitely recommend.
