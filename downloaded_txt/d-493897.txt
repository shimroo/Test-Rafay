bucky covington's new single "i feel ya" available now, new ep happy man available on itunes july 14th! 










 photo credit: calli hum photography

bucky covington's got some brand new tunes coming your way--welcome, summer!  here's the scoop from today's press release:

nashville, tn…june 30, 2015 – country music hit-maker and tv star bucky covington is back with a new single (available today) and his very first ep is set to release july 14th. fans can pre-order the 6 song ep starting today and receive the new single "i feel ya" immediately. bucky produced his new music alongside grammy nominated producer dale oliver and is very excited to finally be able to share it with his fans. along with this being covington’s first ep release as an independent artist, this also marks his first release in 3 years. happy man, the new ep from bucky covington, will release digitally july 14th and is available for pre-order now here as “i feel ya” shipped to country radio this month via plaympe and cdx.

"this project means a lot to me as an independent artist" bucky says. "the good part is that there’s no one telling me what songs to pick, and the bad part is no one is there to tell me what songs to pick or paying for making the music, so all the risk is on me. that said, i hope everyone loves it as much as i do!", the singer adds with his signature lighthearted smile and a laugh.

 bucky covington happy man ep track listing:

1. “i feel ya” (eric mallon, ruben estevez, jason afable)
2. “girl you get to me” (dale oliver, serg salinas, michael harter)
3. “i’m saying something” (matt warren)
4. “somewhere looking beautiful” (bucky covington, dale oliver, dan couch)
5. “buzzin” (brad hull)
 6. “happy man” (shannon lawson)

look for a single review asap--in the meantime, check out bucky's tour dates here and you can listen to him sing it live and loud!  more very soon--w

bucky covington teams up with clearview management









 bucky covington's starting off the spring with a new affiliation--he's now represented by clearview artists management as he continues his career as a must-see independent recording artist.  here's the news from the press release:


with a solid foundation of 3 top 10 hits and 6 charted singles, tv and country music star bucky covington has partnered with clearview artist management to guide his career for continued success as an independent artist.

forward thinkers and industry veterans steve schweidel and sean carpenter
 are the perfect fit to guide an established artist through the hoops 
and hurdles that accompany going independent in today's ever changing 
music industry.

"the business of artist management has changed. as the entertainment 
industry itself enters a new era of figuring out how to monetize art, 
clearview artist management is designed to harken back to a time when 
personal involvement was the keystone to success," says cva founder 
steve schweidel, an innovator with experience on the road and in the 
studio. "clearview is proof that nothing beats direct attention."

"we are very excited and honored to be working with bucky," sean carpenter adds. "he is personable, genuine and one of the best artists in the business."

clearview management's roster includes the multi-platinum country rock veterans nitty gritty dirt band, james otto, elizabeth lyons and champion bull rider ty murray.

about bucky covington: bucky covington
 is a man known as much for his engaging personality as his formidable 
talent. both come together on stage, where the north carolina native 
with a rocker's charisma and country boy charm thrills old and new fans 
alike as he criss-crosses the country. with his first album, bucky 
earned a place at the forefront of a new generation of country singers 
scoring 3 consecutive top 10 hits including "a different world" peaking 
at #4 on the country charts. he became the best selling debut artist of 
that year, with the best first-week sales and highest top 200 debut of 
any male country artist in 15 years.



bucky is currently in studio finishing his new project. he has been 
writing and producing his own music along side grammy nominated producer
 dale oliver. many fans have watched him from his first days as a 
finalist on american idol, and have seen him mature as an artist and yet
 maintain the unspoiled outlook that makes him the complete package- the
 guy next door with talent and charisma to burn. as he comes into his 
own both musically and personally, bucky covington
 is more than fulfilling the promise he brought to the table initially, 
and he continues to establish himself as one of the most exciting 
country performers on the contemporary country scene.

and as we always say around here, summer's just not summer without a hot live bucky covington show!  check out his latest tour dates right here.  more soon...
