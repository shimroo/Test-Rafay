wild game 2024 info!we will only be taking boneless trim this year. please bring in your hunting license with your confirmation number, we need this information to process your animal. the last day to bring in your trim for processing during 2024 will be saturday, november 23rd. anything brought in after this will be frozen until after the new year. keep in mind, if you keep your wild game in your own freezer until january, your items will be processed before anything that has been stored in our freezer. as always, we wish you a very safe & lucky hunting season!! ðŸ™‚ 






























greg's meats has produced 260 national and state champion sausages and smoked meats since 1987 




a little competition is a good thing. we always try to push ourselves to make the best product we can, and to help us out, we participate with our friends in the local state and national smoked meat competitions. we have over three hundred awards and counting with no plans of slowing down. greg himself was inducted into the cured meat hall of fame in 2007, but he is still seen sitting in on workshops and classes, always looking for new information and better ways to improve our products.
