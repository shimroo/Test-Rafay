testimonials

 

“when i joined lsc eight years ago, i was a good player looking to raise the level of my game. now as a high school senior, i’m very happy with the choice i made. the level of training is top notch and the friends i’ve made along the way have been great. i’m proud of my years playing for lsc and it’s a fantastic place to play and elevate your game.”-gabe

 

“we were concerned when we moved from charlotte, nc that we would not be able to find a competitive developmental program for our son’s continued growth. luckily we found lightning sc. the coaches and staff focus on the kids and the fundamentals of soccer and consistently look for ways to challenge and develop the kids. we have been so happy with the entire program and have been able to watch our son continue to develop.”-cassie

  

"our son had a great experience doing 10 individual training sessions with soren.  his ball skills, knowledge of the game and confidence grew so much from soren’s one on one instruction.” - molly
