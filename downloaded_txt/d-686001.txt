 a note from michael



     april 2023

hi everyone,

thank you for your continued support of my musicits been50 years! time flies when you're having fun! i am so grateful and happy that we are on this trip together. 

and its so great to be back on the road again! hope to see you somewhere along the way.

we will keep this site up to date with concert info and will also post on facebook.

now back to work on new music and a podcast with long time friend and band mate, vocalist veronica nunn. 

thanks again for encouraging my creative life. love from our house to yours. 

as always, 
peace, love and rescue,
sojg *  * a few years ago we were playing the house of blues in new orleans (a perennial stop for us). i left after the soundcheck to hunt down some vegan food. when i  
returned just before showtime there was a large crowd lined up in front of the club. i had to cut through this line to get to the stage door. a young house of blues employee was directing people and when a  
couple passed by and asked "who's playing tonight?" he replied "i don't know. some old jazz guy." and this is how i've referred to myself to claudia ever since...
