 stay updated with the latest news from lmpc

at the lombard mennonite peace center, we consider peacemaking a craft. like all crafters, peacemakers have their own set of tools for the work they do. the tools in our toolbox are selected to help reconnect human relationships that have been frayed or fractured. this blog is where we hone the finer points of our tools and share them with our fellow peacemakers.
