dc #9 j a a t f
long island city, ny
commercial / cfs system
i was teaching hand finishing in new york city when apla-tech’s eastern rep brought me a continuous flow (cfs) tape apla-cator.  i had never used it before and after i was shown how it worked i taped for 2 ½ hours.  since we only had 250’ rolls for hand tapers, i had to stop only once every 250’ to change the roll of tape.  i was surprised to see that i put up 20 rolls when i was finished.  since the taper was so light and had no drag feel i didn’t feel tired when i was done.  when i told other finishers i knew how well it went they said i was bsing them.  i was pretty impressed and recommend that taper to anyone.

work focus includes holiday inn hotels, multi-family units and commercial projects.
we originally had two finishing crews with conventional mechanical tools.  we purchased two sets of “air” tools.  we noticed a considerable difference in ease of the tools and an increase in production.  then we were one of the first contractors to purchase apla-tech’s continuous flow drywall finishing tool system (cfs).  the one cfs set we purchased produced the same amount of footage as the two air sets of apla-tech together

we were mechanical tool finishers.  we finish high end custom $1 million + homes & elderly housing.  we first purchased the “air” system from apla-tech and we are very happy with the increased production and especially the ease.  we then purchased the apla-tech cfs tools when they came to the market and again cut our production schedule (time of completion) by ½ for either type of project.

we are approximately the second largest commercial drywall contractor in our market.  we gave apla-tech an award for 2007 & 2008 for projects we used the tool that helped increase finishing production far above our anticipated numbers.  we presently have two sets of tools.
