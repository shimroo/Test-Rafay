this site currently has no

                        invading your privacy. current browsers are
                        making tracking quite hard in any case. also, i
                        actually enjoy using such browsers myself for
                        this reason. the web hosting that i use may
                        collect some server logs of course. beyond that,
                        i’m not aware of any kind of tracking or privacy
                        invading tools on this website.
