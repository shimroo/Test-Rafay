“annette helped me rent out my residential property, at short notice, quickly and for a fair rate during the difficult off-season. she handled the process from start to finish with professionalism. she also went above and beyond at times to make it more attractive for potential tenants. she was great to work with.”- richard c.






















annette provided phenomenal service and expertise during my search for an apartment in the boston area. she was always organized, responsive and knowledgable about the area and process, which allowed me to stay focused on work and saved many hours on my part. great attitude and patience…would highly recommend!- drew t.






















ben was a great agent and i highly recommend him. he is extremely knowledgeable about many different areas and the real estate market in general. i had endless amounts of questions and concerns during my recent home buying experience and ben had all the answers and made the whole process easy for me. he is very responsive and honest; i never once felt that he was pushing me towards anything that wasn’t in my best interest. working with ben allowed me to purchase a home that i love at an amazing price. you won’t find a better realtor!- kelly






















ben is as knowledgeable, professional and hardworking as they come. i’ve seen him succeed in situations where multiple other re professionals have failed and make it look easy. more than anything else, i believe his success is due to a relentless work ethic and a level of integrity above reproach. ben truly understand the concept of never sacrificing long term benefit for short term gain, and as such what others may consider “above and beyond”  is his “par for the course”. i would, without any doubt, recommend him to my closest friends and family.- matt
