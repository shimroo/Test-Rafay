dear valued customers,

it is with profound gratitude and a heavy heart that we announce the closing of constantines after 212 remarkable years of service.

this decision was not made lightly, and it marks the end of an era for our family business. we have cherished every moment of serving our community and building relationships with our loyal customers.

we extend our deepest thanks for your unwavering support and loyalty throughout the years. as we transition, please visit our website for significant sales on remaining inventory. the website will remain active, even after our physical location has closed which we anticipate to be by the end of february.

thank you once again for being a part of the constantines family.

with sincere appreciation,constantines
