how it works

we’ve never had an account get removed. our customized, organic strategy is effective and safe for clients in any country and with any account type!













1. share information about your target audience

how do we help you reach your desired audience? we’ll ask you to describe your desired audience and then your account manager will build a customized list of instagram accounts that have similar audiences to yours.













2. we'll get their attention via "targeted engagement"

we’ll then use your account to follow and unfollow people in your target audience (people who are already following similar accounts to yours). this works because you’ll show up in the notifications section of a high volume of relevant users.













3. your account's followers and engagement will grow

this leads to real, relevant, and engaged people checking out your profile, and then following you and engaging with your content if they’re interested! our clients average 150-1,000 followers per month.

testimonials













âi have been using virtualseychelles for almost a year and i love it! when i started, i had about 400 followers and iâm now approaching 21,000.
i have great engagement from the audience that virtualseychelles helped me to attract. thank you for the great work!â



andrew chan, 22.5k followers
@chanzanita









âafter only one month of using virtualseychelles, my instagram following has increased by over a thousand followers!
the likes are real. the followers are real. the engagement is real. cam and the virtualseychelles team have a solid platform in place to build and engage with real people. would highly recommend if you are looking to grow your instagram following.â



motophoria, 11k followers
@motophoria












âiâve been working hard on my brand for a long time.  as the instagram animal rose around me, i only had time to work on my craft.  suddenly i was widely ignored from commercial because i lacked a ‘following.’  not only was virtualseychelles able to remedy that, they built it organically.  i now have followers who are actually interested in my work and consequentially more customers. “



ed anderson, 13k followers
@edandersonart












“virtualseychelles really worked for me! i received more followers than virtualseychelles estimated i would, and they were real people with similar interests to my own. engagement went up and likes went up. pleasantly surprised with the results. thanks to cam and the virtualseychelles team!”

is my account safe? how are you safer than your competitors?

yes, we've never had an account get banned, ever. and our service is actively working after instagram's recent updates (this was written in mid-september).
your account's safety is our number one priority and it's the lifeblood of our business!
the super-short explanation is that (click for long explanation):

we are real people and we are very publicly associated with this business
if we were in the business of stealing accounts, we would offer free trials and we certainly wouldn't charge this much
the risk of getting in trouble with instagram is extremely low - we've never had an account get banned
we're much more safety-focused than our competitors (no artificial engagement, only real instagram followers, and no free trials that put your account at risk)










how is virtualseychelles different from other growth services?

the very short explanation is that:

we have an industry-leading approach to account safety
we tend to produce better results than our competitors
we're real people and we're obsessed with providing an awesome customer experience!

to read our comprehensive breakdown, click here to open a popup.









does virtualseychelles offer a free trial?

while 95% of our competitors offer free trials, we don't.
why? because free trials put your account at risk in pursuit of short-term profits for the growth service.
companies that provide free trials have to produce immediate results by:

pushing your account to follow/like limits immediately which greatly increases your risk of getting in trouble with instagram.
providing you with fake followers and likes to convince you to stay on beyond the free trial.
both of these strategies put your account at risk and are bad for your long-term success.

by taking on fewer clients, we're able to maximize results for paying customers and build deeper long-term relationships.
and this focus is a big reason why our customers tend to be blown away by our results and customer service.

will my new followers unfollow me if i stop using virtualseychelles?

former clients (who didn't want to grow anymore) retained more than 90% of followers six months after stopping with virtualseychelles.
we don't control any accounts and all of the people who follow (or unfollow) you do so under their own free will.
this means that like any other normal follower, they're likely to stick around after deciding to follow you.
and unless your content gets dramatically worse, it's unlikely that you'll have issues with people unfollowing you.









do you comment on photos or send direct messages?

we believe commenting is too spammy, so we don't do it. but we can add direct messaging for you!












how does virtualseychelles work?

we use targeted engagement (following and unfollowing) to drive organic follower and engagement growth for our clients. this strategy works for any type of account and any geography.
in basic terms, this means we use your account to follow and unfollow people who are likely to be interested in your content (people who are already following similar accounts to yours).
you'll show up in their notifications section so this will lead relevant people to check out your profile, follow you, and engage with your content (if they're interested). our clients average 150-1k followers per month with this strategy.
we don't do any activities other than following and unfollowing! and by default your following number will increase by a total of ~600 but you can customize this if you'd like to follow fewer users!
example: if youâre a female model, weâll use your account to follow and unfollow people who are already following and engaging with other female models (people who have expressed interest in your type of content).









are you sure i can cancel at any time?

yes! no contracts, commitments, or minimums. weâre a month to month service.
if you want to cancel, just let us know via email (support@virtualseychelles.sc) or chat support before the start of your next month.









does your service still work after instagram's algorithm change?

yes! instagram recently changed its algorithm but we've adjusted our processes so that we still operate within instagram's limits and our service is running normally.









will this work for my location (city or country) or my specific account type?

yes! we work with clients in almost every niche imaginable across 35+ countries. every strategy is customized depending on your needs and what audience you're trying to reach.









do you mute accounts or will my feed get cluttered?

yes, we mute every account that we follow so your feed will stay clean!









will i see instant results after signing up?

if you're looking for fake followers and instant results then you've come to the wrong place!
we're focused on providing industry-leading long-term results.
your account will start out very slowly and we'll gradually increase your daily number of follows and unfollow over a 2-2.5 week period.
this is part of our safety first approach because instagram doesn't love when you go from "0 to 100" overnight.









how many followers should i expect by using virtualseychelles?

because weâre an organic growth service, results vary depending on the quality of your account and the niche that youâre focused on.
we can guarantee that we'll get your account in front of tens of thousands of relevant users to your niche. but we can't guarantee results because every situation is different.
having said that, our clients tend to average 150-1,000 followers per month.
if you want us to give you a detailed estimate on what you should expect then feel free to click the chat button in the bottom right or request a free growth estimate.









some other growth services were shut down, what happened?

some of our competitors were shut down for selling likes and then using client accounts to execute that service.
they were operating multiple sites and then making money off of client accounts in this fashion. this is something we are strongly against and we only provide this single service.
for more about your account safety, please read the "is my account safe?" question.












these aren't bots or fake followers - right?

correct! we donât provide any fake/bot followers or likes.
we use targeted engagement (described in the how it works section) to organically get your account in front of tens of thousands of people each month who are likely to be interested in your content.
they then choose to follow you back (or not) under their own free will.









will my engagement grow with the new followers?

yes, most likely, but this depends on your content and instagram's algorithm. because we're an organic service and we're marketing your account to people who are likely to be interested in your content, followers and engagement tend to grow together.
but we can't guarantee engagement because this depends on people liking your content.
the better your content, the better the engagement that you'll see!









how does signing up work? what happens after i sign up?

you can view our pricing  and you can sign up in thirty seconds here with your email, instagram username/password, and a credit card.
after you sign up:

we'll ask you to describe your desired audience on instagram
we'll then use your initial information to build a larger list so that we can test, track, and improve which targeting works the best for your account
weâll log in to your instagram account ~24-72 hours after your sign up
weâll start engaging with users ~24 hours after logging in - this delay is intentional to maximize your account's safety










can i still use my account while signed up with virtualseychelles?

yes! you can still use your account normally while using our service. the only thing that we ask is that you don't do any mass liking, commenting, following or unfollowing.









are there any reviews i can read?

yes! you can read reviews and client examples here. most of our clients prefer to stay anonymous so we've also published a long list of example results and growth charts.









how do you do target users who are likely to be interested in my content?

we can do targeting for any location, niche, industry, or account focus.
we do our targeting based on users who are following and engaging with accounts that are similar to yours. we can tailor this to your specific country or industry.
after you sign up, we'll ask you to describe your desired audience on instagram. then we'll do a lot more research on our side to build a large list so that we can test lots of different targets and figure out what works best.
we're constantly testing new sources and tracking which targeting works the best which means that your results will improve over time!









will you unfollow users i'm already following or that i follow in the future?

no, we never unfollow anyone that we don't follow directly.









does virtualseychelles post or help with content?

while we're happy to give tips and advice, we are solely focused on helping you grow. you are 100% in control of the content!














is my account safe? will i get in trouble with instagram? and how are you safer than competitors?

yes, we've never had an account get banned, ever. and our service is actively working after instagram's recent updates (this was written in mid-september).
your account's safety is our number one priority and it's the lifeblood of our business!

is this safe? how are you safer than your competitors?
most importantly, we’ve never had an account get banned, ever.
your account’s safety is our number one priority and it’s the lifeblood of our business.
we know there are a lot of shady companies in our industry, we are not one of them!
a few important things to know:
#1 you can trust us with your account credentials
we’re real people: unlike 95% of our competitors, we are not anonymous and we aren’t hiding! we are real people and we are very publicly associated with this business because we’re proud of our work.
we’re a real business: we make money by providing a phenomenal service at a premium price. if we were in the business of stealing accounts then we would offer free trials, we definitely wouldn’t charge this much, and we certainly wouldn’t do interviews publicly associating ourselves with virtualseychelles.
#2 the risk of getting in trouble with instagram is extremely low
a) we start slowly and then gradually increase your daily engagements to maximize your account’s safety
b) we stay well under instagram’s limits.
c) instagram is quick to provide an alert if we’re doing something that it doesn’t like.
d) this does occasionally happen and then we simply adjust.
e) we don’t provide any fake/bot followers or likes
f) we’ve never had an account get banned or deleted
#3 our approach is much safer than that of our competitors
a) no free trial risks: why is this safer and better for you? because companies that provide free trials have to produce immediate results by:
pushing your account to limits immediately which greatly increases your risk of getting in trouble with instagram.
providing you with fake followers and likes to convince you to stay on beyond the free trial.
both of these strategies put your account at risk and are bad for your long-term success.
b) how we keep you safer: instagram’s flagging system doesn’t love when you go from “0 to 100” overnight.
by not doing free trials, we’re able to focus on maximizing long-term safety and results, not producing overnight results. we start your account viewing stories very slowly and then we gradually increase your daily actions over a 7-10 day period.
we’re experts in this industry and it’s much harder for us to sign up clients without a free trial. if we believed it was safe to do free trials then we certainly would.
c) we don’t sell likes: why should you care? because any service that sells real likes is using client accounts to actually facilitate those likes.
this is a shockingly common and super shady practice in our industry. this is one of the easiest ways to get in trouble with instagram and it’s why many instagram growth services were just shut down.
if you see a site that sells likes or like packages, run! if you’re a client of theirs, then your account will be the one supplying those likes.
hope this provides some clarity! if you want more information or have additional questions, please use the chat button in the bottom right to talk with our team.




            x            










unfortunately, we aren’t accepting clients on this plan and don’t have plans to change this in the immediate future.











            x            







how does virtualseychelles compare to other instagram growth services?
there are three main differences between us and our competitors:
#1 we’re much safer than our competitors
a) no free trial risks: why is not having free trials safer and better for you? because companies that provide free trials have to produce immediate results by:
pushing your account to limits immediately which greatly increases your risk of getting in trouble with instagram.
providing you with fake followers and likes to convince you to stay on beyond the free trial.
b) how we keep you safer: instagram’s flagging system doesn’t love when you go from “0 to 100” overnight.
by not doing free trials, we’re able to focus on maximizing long-term safety and results, not producing overnight results. we start your account viewing stories very slowly and then we gradually increase your daily actions over a 7-10 day period.
we’re experts in this industry and it’s much harder for us to sign up clients without a free trial. if we believed it was safe to do free trials then we certainly would.
c) we don’t sell likes: why should you care? because any service that sells real likes is using client accounts to actually facilitate those likes.
this is a shockingly common and super shady practice in our industry. this is one of the easiest ways to get in trouble with instagram and it’s why many instagram growth services were just shut down. if you see a site that sells likes or like packages, run!
#2 we produce better results than our competitors
people that switch to us from some of our popular competitors report that we produce 1.5-2.5x better results. why? because our head of instagram growth is one of the best in the world.
the difference between a good growth manager and a world-class growth manager is significant. our ceo, cam, knows this first hand because he managed the growth for all of virtualseychellesâs clients until mid-2018 when he realized that he was unlikely to ever be one of the worldâs best instagram growth managers. he hunted down and partnered with one of the world’s best growth experts who immediately outperformed cam by 2-2.5x on all existing accounts. we’ve been delivering industry-leading results ever since!
also, by not offering free trials it means that we’re working with fewer clients and can focus on maximizing results for existing clients instead of churning through new customers.
#3 we’re real people and we have great customer service!
unlike 95% of our competitors, we are not anonymous and we aren’t hiding! we are real people and we are very publicly associated with this business because we’re proud of our work. we don’t trust companies that are afraid of putting their face on their website and you shouldn’t either.
you’ll have a dedicated account manager who can answer questions and help you on your journey to instagram dominance!
if youâre looking for a long-term partner to help you scale your instagram, then youâve come to the right place!
