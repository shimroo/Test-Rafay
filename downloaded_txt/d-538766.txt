book!





ha ha. no we havev't written a book. but someone else has on exactly the same theme. we're not so churlish to suggest they might have been inspired by our little site, infact we think their book is utterly fab and if you enjoy let's be friends you'll love this book. buy "unlikely friendships: 47 true stories of animal friendship" now.
