brown’s commitment to affordability has never been stronger.



















undergraduate financial aid
brown’s commitment to affordability has never been stronger.








brown meets 100% of each student's demonstrated financial need. and we do this with no loans — only scholarship grants that do not have to be repaid — included in university financial aid packages. the brown promise, along with our newest initiatives, have been established to make brown increasingly affordable to students and families from all backgrounds.
we believe that making an impact and addressing critical issues in the world demands an undergraduate experience that reflects a diversity of views, backgrounds and life experiences. we actively seek students from all income groups and have need-blind admissions, which means that an applicant’s ability or inability to pay the cost of tuition does not determine our admission decision.
