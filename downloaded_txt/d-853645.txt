you folks really rock. the delivery was on time, placed perfectly in our garage as we requested and was without a hitch. your staff is knowledgeable about the products and has as always, provided us with detailed information that has helped us maximize our enjoyment of our wood stove and saved us considerable time and expense. we’ve purchased the bio bricks and eco bricks from bt in the past and we love both products. your pricing is better than any other supplier i know of and nobody, i mean nobody in my experience has a better staff or customer service than you all.  bt’s service and reliability is second to none. we’ll be back next year for sure. thanks for all your help and keep up the great work!
