i am contractually prevented from showing much of my work publicly, but here are just a few of my client projects and personal works…









this women's ministry has a complex, content-rich site that i had the pleasure of re-architecting and redesigning. component to the project i devised a content and product cross-promotion scheme that better revealed the breadth of their offering.

i have a passion for writing
in addition to writing hundreds of articles for magazines and web publications, as well as my own sites, i have authored these books.









i published "design professionalism" in 2011; subtitled, the designer's guide to taking back your profession. i wrote and published the book because professional disillusionment very much seemed to be a fait accompli for designers. too much of what passed for compulsory preparation left designers underprepared and mis-prepared for the profession. what's more, designers were and likely still are consistently led astray by both educational institutions and popular social organizations. 
							my treatise was and still is the only serious work on the topic, for this profession that i hold so dear.

artistic foundations of bonsai design
i published "artistic foundations of bonsai design" in 2003. it was an outgrowth of my artistic and design understanding meeting my hobby and secondary vocation of bonsai. i actually spent some years as a bonsai professional at nurseries in texas and massachusetts. 
							the book is an effort to help bonsai enthusiasts understand how to use time-honored methods—artistic methods—for producing more successful and meaningful bonsai designs and displays. the text examines in some detail the language of art as applied to bonsai. that examination of what some perhaps mistakenly call the rules of bonsai is meant to explain and expound upon the commonly cited fundamentals of bonsai styling that are referenced in other texts.
