about us

we have been helping to build healthy, confident, happy kids through gymnastics since 1984. a family business, acrosports was founded by kay and tom higgins to serve the needs of area kids as well as those of their own budding gymnasts. many of our instructors are former students and we are especially proud that many of our former gymnasts are now bringing their own children to acrosports!
we have energy, enthusiasm, and a passion for teaching kids about self-confidence, responsibility, hard work, and healthy habits that will last a lifetime. please come by any time to see our facility and meet our family & outstanding staff.
hope to see you soon!
kay higgins, president and founder of acrosports kids center
