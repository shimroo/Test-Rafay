what people are saying





this was my first home purchase.  the team made me feel very relaxed and confident.  the team provided a detailed answer for all of my questions.  the process was almost easier than buying a vehicle.  very satisfied with my home.
          mr. stovall elizabethtown, ky








as we sit here looking out at the trees we feel very fortunate to be here.  we are grateful for working with the clinkenbeard team to have our dream become a reality.  the professionalism shown during this whole process was greatly appreciated.
          mr. and mrs. brendahl elizabethtown, ky








clinkenbeard extreme team is professional, honest and extremely knowledgeable about the real estate business and the local market.  they kept us well informed, were very responsive, and helped us understand the implications of each potential purchase.  also, everyone they recommended from their "referral network" was equally outstanding!  will definitely see them again.
          mr. and mrs. eisenberg vine grove, ky









we had a house on the market over 18 months. it's a great house but "time on the market" wasted with other realtors killed us. the clinkenbeard 
team helped us get a renter in, managed our property, and when the time was right they put it on the market and it sold! 

thank you clinkenbeard team!
          amy alpuerto elizabethtown, ky









mr. clinkenbeard is heads above other realtors who simply list on the mls and think that is enough. he has very thorough knowledge of what needs to be done to show your home so it can look the best.
          janice bellville elizabethtown, ky









the clinkenbeard team completed my home sale with professionalisim and courtsey. even though we were out of the country they were and remained proficient and kept us informed of each step, each time the home was shown we were informed and received timely feedback. i would be happy to refer their   services to others locating to the fort knox area
