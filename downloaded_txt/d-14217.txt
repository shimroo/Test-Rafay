although his international profile
went ballistic when he appeared as boromir in peter jackson's the
lord of the rings,
yorkshire-born sean bean has been thrilling audiences since his early
days onstage with the glasgow citizens theatre and the royal
shakespeare company.
sean's roles have been as diverse as
they are memorable: the british weapons expert spence in ronin;
006, the baddie who battled brosnan in goldeneye; miller, the
irish
terrorist who took on harrison ford in patriot
games; richard sharpe, the
heroic soldier who marched his way through france, portugal and spain
in the 14-part series, sharpe;
and the rogue lover who more or less reduced the tv screen to a slow
simmer in films such as a
woman's guide to adultery, clarissa
and lady chatterley.










sean also played sgt. andy mcnab in
the film version of bravo two
zero, set in the gulf war; neil
byrne in the 4-part tv drama extremely
dangerous; and nasty gangster
jason locke in granada films' essex
boys.
more recently sean was seen as patrick
koster in don't say a word,
starring michael douglas; as tom's dad, paul, in the dutch children's
film tom & thomas;
and as the poetry-reading partridge in the sci-fi thriller equilibrium.









 in 2002, sean returned to
the stage
after a 13 year absence to play macbeth
at the albery theatre in london. responding to popular demand, the
limited-run production was extended until 01 march 2003.









in 2003, sean was seen in in itv's henry
viii, and on the big screen in the
big empty; and in 2004, national
treasure and troy.
sean's most recent projects are
independent horror flick, the
dark; disney's flightplan,
with jodie foster; dreamworks' the
island; wb's north
country; the movie version of
the videogame silent hill; the
elder scrolls iv: oblivion
videogame; sharpe's challenge for
itv and bbc america; faceless,
a one-hour tv pilot for fox television, uk indie film outlaw,
a bold remake of the hitcher
(in which he takes on rutger hauer's original role) and far
north, filmed in norway from
september until november 2006.
root of all evil (formerly the
cache), was filmed in september
2007 in chicago.
sean filmed sharpe's
peril, the 16th sharpe
installment, march 3 to april 19, 2008 in india. sean also appeared in crusoe,
for nbc television, in which he played robinson crusoe's father, james.
his latest projects: a drama trilogy
for channel 4 based on three of the books in david peace’s
series of novels, the red
riding quartet, in which sean
played local property magnate john dawson; and percy
jackson, directed by chris
columbus. sean plays zeus.
percy jackson was filmed in vancouver april 6 -
july 18, 2009.










 a common
misperception of me is...that i am a tough, rough northerner, which i
suppose i am really. but i'm pretty mild-mannered most of the time.
it's the parts that you play i guess. i don't mind it. i'm not a tough
guy. i'd like to act as a fair, easy-going, kind man at some point. (sean quoted in the
independent, 09 march 2007)









 (com·pleat)
(pronunciation: k&m-'plet)
quintessential; used in writing as a bit of whimsy; referring to a
person who is accomplished, especially in reference to a particular art
or pursuit (oxford english dictionary).
archaic variant of complete, as in the
compleat angler, or the contemplative man's recreation; being a
discourse of fish and fishing, not unworthy the perusal of most anglers
by isaak walton (1653).

 sean bean,
as the
villain who wants his ''property,'' is as malevolent as can be without
suffering serious dental damage. - roger ebert (chicago sun times)
reviewing don't say a word.






 sean
bean...is
super-attractive, thanks to his air of guarded self-concsciousness, as
though this being-an-actor business were a bit like sitting at the bar
with one elbow on the counter, watching the people coming in and out
from the corner of one eye. - antonia quirke, writing in a recent
edition of west end extra.

fan of the big garden birdwatch. he thinks it's a great activity for
