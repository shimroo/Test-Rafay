“ nature speaks”

giving nature a voice through art








lori’s love of nature and the earth inspire her creations.  she gets her inspiration from nature, dreams, exploring and experiences. she paints from her heart, bridging the world we say is real with the unseen one. each painting and sculpture takes anywhere from months to years to create as they are much more than just a painting or sculpture, her paintings have a deeper message, and a story behind them. they will touch your soul and stir your emotions.her motto is… “live life to the fullest, from your heart, do only what you love, and what you’re passionate about, and live life adventurously!
