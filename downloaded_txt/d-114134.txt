st. clair productions is no longer producing the eclectic music and more series.  after 20 seasons, ariella st. clair has retired and moved to yreka, ca to raise goats. 
we thank the many musicians who performed in our series, the audience members who came to enjoy live music, and the many businesses and organizations that helped us financially keep the music series a vital part of the ashland cultural offerings for so long.
thanks, ariella
