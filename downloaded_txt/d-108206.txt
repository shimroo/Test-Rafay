new, free fake disk #2 upgrade   for all fd2 registered users
thousands of new styles have been added to biab since we first compiled this e-disk back in the 1990s. plus, we are much better at making these disks than we were back then.
	we spent well over a year revising this e-disk, assigning new styles, and doing many other things to make the chord progressions portray the songs more faithfully.
	it's a much better product now, and we are offering this update to you for free. why free? because we think it's the right thing to do.
how to get your free upgrade? (note: you must be a registered owner of fake disk #2)
	
e-mail norton music. put "free fake disk #2 upgrade" in the subject line
		include your current physical and e-mail address. if you have moved since you bought the disk, let me have that address too, and i'll update my records
		i'll check my records, and if i have you down as purchasing disk #2 from me, i'll e-mail the upgrade to you. (be sure to put my e-mail in your address book, so the anti-spam robots don't nuke it. i won't know it if they do.)
		please, be patient  i'm doing this by hand, one at a time, and i'm still a gigging musician. if it's been a couple of weeks since you asked, try again. sometimes e-mail gets lost.
	
i hope the update gives you endless hours of pleasure.

norton music's band-in-a-box innovations
 norton music invented and implemented these innovations first, years before they were incorporated into the band-in-a-box program itself:
	norton was the first to substitute other instruments into the piano/guitar/strings patch inserting synths, saxes, brass and other instruments
		norton was the first to include "shots" in the styles, years before pg (norton called them kicks)
		norton was the first to make multi-styles, years before pg (norton called them mix and match mega styles)
		norton was the first to introduce expanded and reduced styles, a full decade before pg music included them

this site is dedicated to:
howard r norton, my father. he played trumpet, violin, organ and ukulele. i have fond childhood memories of weekend mornings with my father, ukulele in hand, music books sprawled in front of him, and he, my sisters, and myself singing all those old, corny, wonderful songs. this ignited the spark of music in me.
		robert c. monroe, my first band director. his passion, enthusiasm and love for music fanned that spark and turned it into a raging fire of passion for music ... "thank you" to bob monroe and to all the band directors and music instructors who give the gift of music education to our children.
		and to leilani m. chandler, who provides the sunshine in my life, keeps the smile on my face and is one of the best vocalists in the known universe.
