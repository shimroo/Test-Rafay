knight legacy






















tony knight, a master craftsman, inventor, and seasoned huntsman, founded knight rifles from his workshop in putnam county, missouri, driven by a desire to revolutionize the muzzleloader industry. drawing on decades of field experience and a thorough study of muzzleloader history, from primitive flintlocks to more contemporary designs, tony saw that these firearms had scarcely evolved in a century. motivated by this insight, he crafted a truly modern muzzleloader, leading to the creation of the finest, most versatile black powder rifle ever created; known for its safety, impeccable 100% american craftsmanship, unmatched accuracy, smooth operation, and formidable down-range power. today, knight rifles upholds this legacy, continuously pushing the boundaries of muzzleloading technology, grounded in a rich history and driven by innovation.
