honeymoons



                            from a romantic retreat on a palm-fringed tropical island to a thrilling safari, or a boho trek high in the andes, our tailor-made honeymoons are as individual as they are special.
                        





safari & beach holidays



                            a safari and beach combination is a timeless classic and deservedly one of our most popular.

self drive holidays



                            if you love the thrill of the open road, africa offers some exciting opportunities for independent travel. our top recommendations for a self drive holiday are south africa, namibia and the indian ocean island of reunion.
