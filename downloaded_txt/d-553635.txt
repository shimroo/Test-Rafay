meet our lead pastor
pastor joe has served at decatur baptist since january of 2019 as lead pastor. joe and his wife, debbie, both grew up in the area. in 1991, joe became the student pastor here at dbc for 14 years. he and his family later moved to cartersville, georgia where he served as the lead pastor at oakland heights baptist church for 14 years before god brought them back to decatur baptist. a graduate of louisiana baptist university, joe has invested 20+ years of his life into the local church.
pastor joe’s ministry experience also includes serving as a chaplain for both the cartersville and decatur police departments.  he and his wife, debbie, have two children: lauren and drew. their passion is to see families serving together to accomplish god’s will and purpose as they share the gospel in decatur and throughout the world.
