welcome !


						the department of computer science and engineering at the indian institute of technology kanpur (iit kanpur) was the first department in india to start computer science education.  it started in august 1963 with an ibm 1620 system - a novelty then, even in many north american and european universities. the department runs btech, mtech, ms and phd programs and is engaged in cutting edge research with sponsored projects and consultancies. many of the nation's leading experts, educationists and consultants in computer science today are the alumni of this department.
						


 







latest news



 dr. priyanka golia has won the acm india 2024 doctoral dissertation award for her dissertation "functional synthesis via formal methods and machine learning". priyanka was advised by prof. subhajit roy from iit kanpur and prof. kuleep meel from university of toronto.

 the paper "nid-tgn: spatiotemporal intrusion detection system for iot networks" by dr. priyanka bagade and collaborators has received the best paper award at the international conference on security, privacy and applied cryptographic engineering (space) 2024. congratulations!

 dr. abhranil chatterjee has joined the department as a faculty member. before joining iit kanpur, dr. chatterjee was an inspire faculty at isi kolkata. his research area is theoretical computer science, specifically, (1) complexity theory and (2) designing algorithms with algebraic techniques.

 prof. angshuman karmakar has received the google india research awards 2024. the award comes with an unrestricted research grant of us$20,000. congratulations!

 prof. rajat moona, a faculty member in the cse department and currently on deputation as the director of iit gandhinagar, has been conferred the institute fellow award by iit kanpur. congratulations!
