post of the week :



 do you know ralph wolf?
everybody knows wile e. coyote but 
                            few people know ralph wolf. it seems that coyotes 
                            and wolves look the same for warner bros.

                            read article : [ do 
                            you know ralph wolf ] [ other 
                            articles ]  


 character of the week :






taz "tasmanian devil"
 released by: warner bros. first 
      appeared: 1954 creator: robert mckimson 
      (director) and sid marcus (writer)
like a tornado!
      welcome on the tasmanian devil's spot...
      don't flee in terror before his insatiable hunger. he's such a jovial fellow...
 
      today taz is one of the most recognizable 
        members of the looney tunes roster. robert mckimson based the character 
        on the real-life tasmanian devil of australia, though the most noticeable 
        resemblance between the australian mammal and mckimson's creation is their 
        ravenous appetites. whirling like a tornado that sounds like several motors 
        whirring in unison, the devil devours everything, animate or inanimate, 
        and his efforts to find more food are always a central plot device of 
        his cartoons.
