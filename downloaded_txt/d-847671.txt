			it uses javascript, html, and style sheet layers from dynamic html (or dhtml) to model a portion of our solar system.
  		
 mike's picture albums

this picture page is the newest addition to 
my website. i have taken my raw digital photos and loosely organized 
them into album folders. this page is still 
in the works, so i haven't added descriptive names to all albums. i also
haven't added all of my digital pictures from over the years.  hopefully, they will all be here 
soon.  
			note 
that these pics are raw digital photos and have not been edited for the 
most part.  this means they are big pics, some are not rotated right side up, and original versions will take time to view on 
slower connections.  for those using dial-up, i have made the pictures and the first frames of video clips into thumbnails when first viewing the 
albums.  yes i am considerate of all of you too :-p  
			 also note that clicking on a .avi video file (file names starting with mvi) will load the entire movie file.  this 
may take a very long time even on fast connections as the videos are bigger then the pictures, much bigger.  your browser may appear to lock up while the video is 
downloaded to your computer, but please be patient.  however, after the first time downloading the video your browser's cache will bring the video 
right up with future viewings.
