.
i un-posted this (below) after i initially wrote it two years ago because whatever i am dormant and didn't want to end on a sour note... but i will re-post it now because annoying. 

-----

roberta smith says james franco sucks but instead why doesn't she just shut up about him... it's the third review she has given him. waste of space. two full reviews of george bush paintings too.

 roberta smith on james franco 8/19/2010.

michael dotson

eight ball, at geoffrey young gallery, in great barrington. ma. closes 7/27.




brece honeycutt.... wearing a cool shirt she made... i think she said she made it by wrapping something really hot/burning(??)... i can't remember, maybe a horseshoe?... but it was an interesting process. 

 

initially i thought it was like a cai guo-qiang gunpowder thing... like he did for gap... as seen in 'which infant stool sample?'.

 



geoffrey young (l) michael dotson (center) gary petersen (r). 

 

somebody remind me who did that yellow piece... it's plastic pepsi bottles or something all flattened and smooshed down, painted over yellow.

 



vince contarino!... - i've known vince for a few years at least but this was the first time to see a selection of his paintings,,,, nice!

 



vince contarino and nina smith.

john davis gallery (through 7/14)








gregory amenoff

 

at john davis gallery, hudson ny, through 7/14.

 



jason stopa

 



gregory amenoff - very nice... i liked the big ones especially...they are very elizabeth murray.

 

(btw i mentioned that and he said they were in a show together in 1978... eight abstract painters, at the philadelphia ica... with frances barth, jake berthot, bruce boice, james juszczyk, paul rotterdam, joan thorne)

 



jason stopa

 

studio critical interview with jason stopa.

studio critical interview with me!

 



jon isherwood - glistening brown... plop... mysterious glyphs...  so weird!

 



gregory amenoff and jason stopa - sorry it's blurry.

 



jj manford + a jason stopa painting... rainbow and glitter. jj had a show at john davis last year.

mass moca summer 2013








eric doeringer, some los angeles apartments, in love to love you, curated by martha joseph.

 

mass moca summer 2013!! .... some new shows opened.... a jason middlebrook show, a joseph montgomery show, and a small group show including eric doeringer.

 



jason middlebrook's centerpiece... a falling water sculpture... kind of an 'awkward space'-filler, his totems/planks are more interesting.

mass moca recycles everything... i wouldn't even be surprised if this was styrofoam left-over from k. grosse's wonderful show. 

best use of mass moca recycling i have seen yet was the utilization of the the c. buchel abandoned movie theater seats to watch guy ben-ner's (buchel mocking) video.




jason middlebrook... charred-ish...  'plank' pieces are always cool. how/why. also, anything that is burned or just looks burned.

 

judy chicago's 'plank'-ish piece, rainbow picket (1965), included in the 1966 primary structures show, came before the first mccracken plank (1966)...  he was in primary structures also, but it wasn't a plank... was he inspired? i've never read anything.

 

judy chicago +... tough ads-as-art in artforum before benglis, car hoods on walls before prince.

 



jason middlebrook

jason middlebrook

 



eric doeringer + mass moca's director joe thompson.

eric has what looks like a really good show - or series of shows - this summer at no foundation, in toronto. i saw some photos on his facebook... not sure if this link to the fb pic works but try it. eric's 2009 show at dam, stuhltrager was one of those rare perfect shows.




joseph montgomery

 



more totems!... not planks though, on the wall.

 



plastic coated

 



joseph montgomery

 



really like how this oily one extends, and the shadows

 



 these are so 3-d

 



joseph montgomery

 



eric with artists working at mass moca.  eric's gf,,, i staged this photo don't be mad!

 

note of discord - i don't live terribly far from this museum... back in 5/2012 i emailed some curators here (susan cross, denise markonish, +) and at the tang (megan hyde, rachel seligman, ian berry), inviting them to visit my studio... not a single one responded, even to decline. lame!!...as non-profit museum 'curated' shows it's kind of sad; the artist's nyc galleries do all the work getting these shows placed.
