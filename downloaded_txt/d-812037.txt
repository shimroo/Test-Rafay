"i 
                          had an art college education and on a rainy night in 
                          1966 i went into a pub in cornwall, but i couldn't afford 
                          to pay to go in. so i said, i'll tell you what, i don't 
                          want to stay outside in the rain, i'll play guitar for 
                          half an hour for you. they offered me a job for the 
                          rest of the summer and i've been at it ever since."
"michael 
                          chapman was never just a singer-songwriter - his gritty 
                          brand of guitar based songs span folk, ragtime, jazz 
                          and blues... it's on the tracks which feature chapman's 
                          magnificently bleary vocals that this album really scores. 
                          hell to pay and only pretend are outstanding tracks, 
                          that world-weary voice singing words of bitter experience. 
                          this 
                          man is so laid back that he makes jj cale sound like 
                          he's on helium."
