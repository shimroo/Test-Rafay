metric conversion tables to or from imperial measurements the si system for metric conversion











summary:- over 
    1000 factors for metric conversion. plus 30 detail pages for m to ft., water, 
    cc to hp, density, etc.





 


 






























for 
            metric conversions go to a unit starting with
-
a
b c d
e f g
h i j
k l m
n o p
q r s
t u v
w y

( 
            like m for metre or l 
            for liter or c for cfm or cubic ft/min)









 












this is the 
            format of the conversion factors on this site:-




these units multiplied by .....


...this factor will...


..convert to these units.


acre


160


sq. rods






example:-
                  task: how many sq.rods in 10 acres.
                  from the tables: 1 acre = 160 sq.rods, so
 10 
                  acres x 160 = 1600 sq.rods
                  when you want to reverse the conversion,
                  divide by the factor viz.
                  1600 sq.rods/160 = 10 acres
convert 
                  fractions of an inch to mm
two pages convert 
                  feet, inches and fractions of an inch to metric and from 
                  metric to feet 
                  inches and tenths of an inch. easier than getting an answer 
                  in 6.7238 feet!
impossible 
                  conversions
                  remember that you cannot create energy only convert it. likewise, 
                  you will not find a conversion from pounds to metres - the basic 
                  units must remain the same - mass converted to mass, length 
                  converted to length, and so on. a common question is... how 
                  many horsepower in a 500cc engine which is an impossible 
                  conversion but i have given an approximation on this 
                  page.

                  you won't usually find a conversion from kilograms to grams 
                  - the prefix 'kilo' means '1,000' so a kilogram is in fact 1,000 
                  grams in the same way as a kilometer is 1,000 metres [or about 
                  1,000 yards in 'old money']. i have put a few in the table because 
                  visitors have asked for them. more examples can be found on 
                  the prefix table.

one handy metric link between 
                  units 
                  remember that 1 litre [1000cc] of pure water weighs 1 
                  kilogram. 
                  equally, 1 milliliter of pure water has a mass of 1 gram or 
                  1ml = 1g. 
                  the upper case l for liter is preferable as the lower case can 
                  be confused with the figure one, however it is common to see 
                  ml for milliliters on bottles.
the 
                  scientific notation - 1.76e+09 or 3.78e-12 
                  cuts out a lot of noughts. explained here 
                  ...

                  if accuracy is critical beware of old versions of ms excel which 
                  had problems rounding off numbers. 
we have tried to be accurate with the data but cannot be held responsible for inaccuracies.
                    go back to first principals and double check your calculations if the result is 'mission critical'.

                    metrication is a great help but has also created anomalies; i have seen pressure gauges changed from a commonly used psi to kg/cm.sq., bar, pascal, kpa and atmos but will no doubt
                    move to a popular metric standard in a few decades.
