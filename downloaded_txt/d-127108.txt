contemplating the ordinary jubilee of the year 2025

the jubilee calls for us to set out on a journey. hence, it is important to prepare ourselves well, to plan the route, and learn about the destination.
contemplation is also part of the journey and helps us to realize that care for creation “is an essential expression of our faith in god and our obedience to his will” (pope francis, letter for the jubilee 2025).

		international day of prayer and awareness against human trafficking	


st. josephine bakhita, born in sudan in 1869, was kidnapped at age nine and sold into slavery. her captors gave her the name "bakhita," meaning "fortunate." she endured brutal treatment, being sold multiple times. at 14, she was bought by an italian consul whose kindness led to her conversion to christianity. she was baptized as josephine and chose religious life after gaining freedom in adulthood. her memorial, celebrated on february 8th, is an occasion to pray for victims of human trafficking and continued awareness and advocacy against it.

		world day of the sick	


world day of the sick (february 11th) honours jesus' ministry to the sick, which pope john paul ii established to offer prayers for those suffering from illness. the day coincides with the memorial of our lady of lourdes and emphasizes the importance of caring for the sick. it acknowledges the dedication of healthcare workers and pastoral caregivers who minister to the afflicted. the church encourages members to pray for the needs of the sick, highlighting the vital role of service to those who are ill and suffering.
