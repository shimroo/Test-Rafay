welcome to the newest trend in cooking; outdoor kitchens.  sometimes called grill islands, these outdoor entertainment centers are the perfect product for people who enjoy hosting barbeques.  unlike cart model grills, outdoor kitchens have more food preparation space,  which means less running in and out of the house for ingredients.  sinks, refrigerators, drawers, ice-makers, cabinets and even ovens can all be built into outdoor kitchens for added convenience.
