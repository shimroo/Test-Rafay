new audiometer updates










the latest versions of the gsi audiostar pro™ and gsi pello™ now deliver enhanced performance and speed. clinicians can benefit from quicker startup times and smoother testing transitions. featured in these new versions is the new act™ (audible contrast threshold) test*. the act test is an easy-to-administer evaluation that is an accurate predictor of a patient's aided hearing in noise. the act score can help determine a patient's act contrast loss, which is used for counselling and selecting hearing aid features that will be most beneficial in noisy environments.
*only available on the latest versions of the gsi audiostar pro and gsi pello with the speech plus license.
