“coming from the non-union sector, i don’t want to necessarily say that my prior boss didn’t care about safety, but there’s just more of a priority for it here. protection and adhering to the rules are foundations of bac. i’ve never seen a boss of mine cut a corner. it’s a really well-oiled system.”

“i didn’t know what i was going to do with my life, and i didn’t know how i was going to take care of my family — and the union gave me all that. they gave me a future, and security for my family."

"there is something in bac to really help you advance your career. the union is an amazing thing. you have access to continuing education as well as traditional training that is all paid for. you don’t have to pay anything out of pocket. the wages are good, the benefits and the retirement are also great."
