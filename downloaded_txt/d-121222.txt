tell your stories. 







we chose to build our platform on the versatile wordpress framework, which means the blog module comes free with every artsopolis platform package. see how our network member, nowplayingtoronto.com, is leveraging that capability into an editorial-style online magazine.

data normalizationas part of the start-up development phase it is common for our clients to request content from an older database be transferred to and normalized for their new artsopolis website. or, they may wish to import new information they have compiled in a spreadsheet, such as organization, venue, artist, or public art information. rather than using manual entry, our developers can take care of this process. 

 












brand integrationartsopolis is a white label platform. as part of the start-up development phase we engage in discussions and decision-making processes to help your team determine how best to implement your existing branding and design elements within our system. additional custom css development can be undergone as a separate custom development project,. 

 












trainingas part of the start-up phase of development, artsopolis provides training for your content management team to orient them both on how to use the administrative control panel and how to navigate the front end user dashboard. one additional follow-up training, while still in the start-up phase, is available upon request at no additional charge.

what people are saying about us








 

"excellence. that's the word that best describes artsopolis.  our community was stuck in the time-warp of just posting posters all over town to promote events. this was until our platform, currents, run by artsopolis came along. sophisticated, nimble, user-friendly, accessible, practical but fun, and a game-changer.  that's what artsopolis gave us. doing business with this organization is a pleasure - their professionalism, attention to detail, flexibility, and expedience have allowed us to share our community's arts & culture in the best way possible."

inez maubane jonesexecutive director, arts & humanities bainbridge  




 

"you should be so proud of what you've done/are doing with artsopolis. it's really transforming our organization and what we're able to do for our community. i knew it was going to be great but this is beyond what i had imagined."

catherine petersonexecutive director, artsboston 




 

"the artsopolis team is a true partner to artswave, the largest community arts campaign in the nation. in cincinnati, we piloted several projects with the team – such as call-out categories to amass different types of arts, covid resources during the pandemic, and a seamless linkage between our largest donor benefit/website and the calendar. the team is always there to brainstorm, collaborate and then to figure out, “how might this roll out to other arts councils and aggregators of the arts?” i feel that jeff trabucco and his team are an extension of ours, with a noble vision to help in any way possible."

kathy debrossevice president, marketing & engagement, artswave
