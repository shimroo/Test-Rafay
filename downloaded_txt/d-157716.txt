welcome to casls
creating innovative approaches to language learning since 1994
the center for applied second language studies (casls) at the university of oregon supports innovative world language teaching and learning. we develop research-based curricula, professional development resources, and assessments to support infrastructure and innovation.
we are one of sixteen national foreign language resource centers that work to increase the nation’s capacity for language education. our resources incorporate best practices in pedagogy, the latest in second language acquisition research, and technology that’s actually usable in the classroom.
ready to see what we’re all about? participate in our 30-day language challenge (started in 2020) and be inspired to use a second (or third or fourth!) language in your daily routines, connect with others doing the same, and win a limited edition prize along the way.
