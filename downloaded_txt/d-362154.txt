how to become a firefighter

being a firefighter could be one of the most rewarding careers out there. why? not only do firefighters
                douse and contain blazes of all shapes and sizes (and in multiple environments), but they also provide
                life-saving medical aid to citizens prior to hospital care.

public service degrees

                public service degrees give students the chance to earn credentials and gain valuable knowledge and
                skills that make a difference. common program areas include public administration, criminal justice,
                forestry, emergency management, homeland security and more. some public service professionals work on
                the front lines in critical situations, while others play more of a support role, coordinating
                operations and managing personnel behind the scenes. explore public service degrees -- at all levels --
                to see how you can help your community.
