	 babies with robots
	 
    


"researchers at the university of delaware are providing safe mobility to children with special needs who are unable to fully explore the world on their own through the development of kid-sized robots that infants can drive using joysticks.""infants with down syndrome, cerebral palsy, autism and other disorders can have mobility limitations that disconnect them from the ongoing exploration that their peers enjoy."“if these infants were adults, therapists would have options of assistive technology such as power wheelchairs,” james c. (cole) galloway, associate professor of physical therapy says."the tiny robot is ringed with sensors that can determine the obstacle-free roaming space, and will either allow infants to bump obstacles or will take control from the infant and drive around the obstacle itself. the next prototype, ud2, will build on the current technology to provide additional control to a parent, teacher or other supervising adult."obviously the next step would be to make a giant car-crushing biped with a little baby seat inside.  don't worry - the giant baby-driven monster will never be allowed to escape into a busy downtown to rip corners off sky scrapers and toss city buses through plate glass windows.babies learn to ride robots at udlabels: cross-species relationships, extending human capabilities

	 robot love
	 



press release from universiteit maastricht in the netherlands:a ph.d. thesis submitted to the universiteit maastricht contains some controversial forecasts about the future of human-robot relationships. the thesis is entitled “intimate relationships with artificial partners” and its author is david levy, an international master at chess from london. levy’s thesis argues that trends in robotics and other areas of artificial intelligence will, within a few decades, result in robots that are so humanlike in their appearance and functionality, in their personality, and in their expression of emotions, that many people will be falling in love with them, having sex with them, and even marrying them.levy’s ph.d. research has encompassed the fields of psychology, sexology, sociology, robotics, artificial intelligence, and gender studies. his forecasts are based on his analysis of certain trends and on what he sees as the inevitability of how these trends will continue in the future. one of these trends follows the objects of human affection – at first this was only for other humans, then it expanded to include pet animals, then virtual pets such as the tamagotchi and sony’s robotic dog aibo, and in the future, according to levy’s thesis, for robots. another trend examined in the thesis follows our attitudes to various sexual practices, as these attitudes have become steadily more liberal. the thesis also examines the principal reasons, identified by research psychologists, why we fall in love and why we have sex. most of these reasons are shown in the thesis to be equally applicable to the human-robot relationships of the future as they are for human-human relationships today.love and sex with robots - press releases 2007 - press releases - press - universiteit maastricht

	 3000th argo ocean probe launch
	 
    


the 3000th argo ocean sensor probe is to be launched from  the rv kaharoa off new zealand.the argo program started in 2004 collects temperature, salinity and pressure readings from all of the worlds oceans with the 3000 sensor probes.the robot sensors sink in the water to a depth of up to 2000 meters.  when they reach the target depth they pump oil into an external bladder to allow them to float to the surface.  as they rise they record the temperature and salinity readings.  at the surface they transmit their position and data to a satellite then begin the cycle again.  each cycle takes about ten days.the objectives of the argo project are to get a better understanding of the oceans and the world's climate.  the program has worldwide support.each probe is expected to last about 150 measurement cycles and they plan to replace 800 per year.that is a lot of robots. do not be surprised if one of the floats up in your bathtub one day.scoop: maharey launching 3000th robot of the seasee also:  legions of ocean robots: 2000th launchlabels: environmental robot, sensors, underwater robot

	 irobot in the gutter
	 
    


roomba maker irobot has introduced a new household robot, the looj, made for cleaning rain gutters.you just drop the small looj into you gutter and it "augers" it way through and ejects the crappy buildup out and away. just in time for the fall season.the price range from us $100 to $170 depending on the options you get.  available now from the irobot web store.  i would guess that it will be available in suburban home depots soon.  and also available to clear the rain gutters in your third world countries.i like the belt holster.  i can help you to climb the ladder sure, but also wearing it around the yard would make you the coolest guy in the 'hood.irobot corporation: about loojlabels: extending human capabilities, home robot, irobot

	 nuclear powered lunar prospector
	 
    


the folks at carnegie mellon’s robotics institute have come up with another unique robot creation.the scarab is a 4-wheel robot is designed for prospecting on the moon.  the design has been optimized for drilling into rock in cold and dark environments.the drill in the center of the robot body can drill out a core sample up to meter deep.  the body is shaped so the relatively small drilling robot - only 250 kgs ( 550 lbs) - can get enough weight on the bit to drill.the scarab can run in the dark bottoms of moon craters with its nuclear power source.  the advanced sterling radioisotope generator (asrg) converts the emissions from a radioactive isotope to electricity.  according to the article the generator can provide 100 watts of power for 10 years.the robot has a laser navigation system so it can see the local terrain in the dark and find its way around.so far nasa does not have have any specific plans for sending the scarab to the moon but the robot is being used to test technologies for the task.there is no mention if cmu is thinking of fielding a team for the $30 million google lunar robot x-prize.the tartan online : 'scarab' the robotlabels: extending human capabilities, hazardous conditions, lunar robot

	 sacramento police train unmanned aerial vehicle helpers
	 
    


the sacramento, california police department is developing a specialized unmanned aerial vehicle, uav, as a low cost alternative to helicopter cops.they currently have two helicopters that can stream live video to remote terminals in police cars or command centers.their uav's are 5 feet long, weigh 12 pounds and hand launched.  they can keep their multiple video cameras aloft for 45 minutes.  they are almost autonomous and have the capability to track subjects with their camera eyes.the police are looking forward to reduced costs and better availability of the flying robots compared to expensive helicopter teams.they also like the silent operation of the spy planes."police chief albert najera, who said the department gets many complaints about the noise of the helicopters. "the noise factor is huge. this is almost silent, you can't hear it," he said. "not many police departments can afford a helicopter, but most will be able to afford this.""the aircraft still need to get faa clearance before they are put on duty.sacramento police unmanned aerial vehicle program gaining altitude - government technologylabels: police robot, uav

	 robots get voice in us congress
	 
    


in a demonstration of their growing influence, robots are gaining apolitical foothold to help them shape the policies of the us government.congressman mike doyle, a democrat from pennsylvania's 14 district and zachwamp a republican from tennessee's  3rd, announced the formation of a bi-partisan congressional caucus for robots.congressman doyle explains that robots are "being used to defend our nation, perform surgery, fill prescriptions, deliver supplies and materials, and even as tools to educate our children...""...it is important that we create a forum by which congress can familiarize itself with the impact this first great technology of the 21st century is likely to have on the lives of all americans."their press release states the proposed public reasons for the creation of the group:the preliminary, proposed goals of the bipartisan robotics caucus will include, but are not limited to:-- increasing general awareness of robotics industry challenges and issues among members of congress and policy analysts in the federal government;-- educating members of congress and congressional staff on current and future research, development, and utilization initiatives involving robotics; -- serving as a forum where robotics-related policy issues can be discussed and debated; and-- ensuring that our nation remains globally competitive as the robotics industry rapidly expands and begins to exert a profound effect on the way our citizens live their lives.obviously the goals will also include strong-arming representatives to pass legislation favorable to robots and promoting the robot agenda.generally the political types lag the real world on new issues so this move also shows that robot are truly becoming an important and growing part of our civilization.congressmendoyle andwamp launch congressional caucus on robotics - yahoo! newslabels: robot business, robot politics

	 robot radio relays
	 
    


communications between troops in an urban area can be a problem due to interference and line of sight blocked by buildings.can you hear me now?darpa is looking to robots for a solution to the dropped call problem.they are looking for proposals for mobile robots that act as radio relays around a city. the robots, called landroids, would be dropped by soldiers around the city to create a network of communications nodes. the robots should be smart enough to know how to stay online under changing conditions - for example if some of them get destroyed. the robots would position themselves so they can always hear someone else in the network.darpa would like the disposable robots to be about the size of a deck of cards, cost under us $100 each and stay online up to 14 days.there will be an information day on july 6 for potential bidders.darpa information processing technology officepdf landroid proposal informationlabels: military robots, urban robots

	 thermal imaging robot finds termites
	 
    


the australian company termicam is testing a remote controlled robot that can crawl through nooks and crannies to track down sneaky termites munching on your house.the termibot uses video and thermal imaging to find the pests.  once found the robot probes the termite nest to break it open and expose the bugs.  it then squirts poison directly into the nest to kill the buggers.the prototype is connected to the human operator with an umbilical wire but future versions will be wireless.the robot offers many advantages over traditional methods of termite control.  first, the robot can go into small paces where an exterminator cannot fit.  this eliminates the need to poke holes in the walls searching for the bugs. secondly, the thermal imaging capabilities of the robot extends the human vision to be able to 'see through walls' to where the insects build their nests.  finally, the robot can deliver the insecticide directly to the nest instead of having to poison    an entire house for a small infestation.  this saves chemicals and reduces the stress to the environment.remote-controlled robot uses thermal imaging to detect and eradicate termites - gizmag articlelabels: extending human capabilities, hazardous conditions, service robot, telepresence

	 robots to guard israeli border kill zone
	 
    


israeli defense forces (idf) are deploying automated weapon robots along the border of the gaza strip to create a buffer kill zone to prevent unauthorized infiltrations.the system, called the "see-shoot" system, is currently being installed and will be fully operational by the end of 2007. it consists of automated weapons stations connected through a command center to visual, ground andairborne sensors. the system is the culmination of years of development by defense contractors rafael, elbit systems and imi.the system is part of an idf strategy of low-signature/no-signature warfare. the no-signature doctrine strives to keep soldiers out of harms way as much as possible.however, "no-signature" warfare does not mean 'no responsibility' yet.eventually the see-shoot system will be able to operate as a completely autonomous closed-loop system. but for now, the sensor data will be monitored by soldiers and a commanding officer will approve activation of the automated kill function.the system is designed to enforce a 1500 meter(almost 1 mile) wide area along the border. future plans include adding anti-tank missiles to extend the width of the no-mans land to several kilometers.i wonder if they made plans for removing the dead bodies from the kill zone. will they have to disable the whole system or do they have a robot that can drive through the zone and clean up? maybe they will just leave the dead bodies laying around to mark the boundary of the buffer zone. similar automated systems are under development for the border in korea.defensenews.com - israel wants robotic guns, missiles to guard gaza border - 06/01/07 17:55labels: automation, military robots, security robot
