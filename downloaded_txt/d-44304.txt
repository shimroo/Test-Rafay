sealing is optional

                  for pedestrian pavers sealing is optional because of additives
                  and the high density of our pavers, algae and mildew have a
                  difficult time growing on our product.

so glad i chose these pavers. while
                  renovating my pool i couldn't decide which color or style as
                  they were all great.



                    my biggest concern in the heat was walking barefoot. i
                    remember as a kid hopping around when my sandals were off. i
                    didn't want to go through that as an adult lol...not a
                    problem...pavers stay pretty cool and i don't need shoes
                    ...no hopping around either...i would def recommend to my
                    friends...thanks!

                  we decided to go with the shellock pavers in sand color for
                  around our pool.
                  best decision we could have made. everyone
                  that comes over comments on them and they really took our
                  outdoor space up a level.no fading or mildew either!
