by dan keane associated press 5:31 p.m. august 12, 2008 tijuana, mexico – people have so little confidence in the police here that the army invited citizens to report crimes to soldiers instead. officers are so mistrusted that federal authorities even took their guns away for a time last year.  now tijuana is campaigning to regain that trust with an accountability campaign to break the officers' old, corrupt habits.  public safety secretary alberto capella proudly points to a tijuana policeman accused of murder who was promptly arrested by his fellow officers.  “if this scenario had happened nine months ago, he wouldn't have been captured. or he would have asked for help, and they would have let him go,” capella told the associated press. “that's a clear indication of the change of attitude taking place among tijuana police.”see this related story! -mmlabels: corruption, mexican law enforcement, mexican military

                      	 mexican drug gang turns to kidnapping in u.s.
	                       


tue aug 12, 2008 6:34pm edt by lizbeth diaz tijuana, mexico (reuters) - american businesswoman veronica was stepping out of her car in california when two men forced her into the passenger seat at gunpoint, pushed her teenage daughter into the back and drove them into mexico. taking advantage of lax mexican security at the san diego border, and with u.s. authorities focused mainly on those entering the united states, the kidnappers took the two women to tijuana in january and held them for a month before their family paid a $100,000 ransom. "we got an automatic green light to go through mexican customs and then we were blindfolded and taken to a house in tijuana. they held a pistol to my stomach all the time we were in the car," said veronica, who declined to give her surname. an unintended consequence of mexican efforts to weaken drug gangs, drug traffickers around tijuana are turning to abducting u.s. citizens and residents in southern california and holding them in mexico as a new way to get funds, u.s. and mexican authorities say. mexican intelligence officials say veronica is one of around 30 americans abducted in southern california and taken to tijuana since last november. many of the victims are of hispanic origin and hold double nationality.  labels: border security, gangs, illegal invasion, kidnappings

by daniel borunda / el paso times article launched: 08/13/2008 12:00:00 am mdt related: find more on the violence in juárez.  el paso -- a narco-message was left by the body of a man killed in juárez on monday, which finished with a death toll of 15, making it one of the bloodiest days this year.  the note was next to jose luis trujillo ramirez, 24, who was found shot to death soon after 10:30 p.m. monday near eje vial juan gabriel, chihuahua state investigators said tuesday.  "this is for those that continue not to believe, el flaco, el negro gordo and those who continue," stated the note, apparently referring to nicknames of unidentified men.  notes with threats and taunts left on corpses are a trend believed to be linked to a drug cartel war behind many of the more than 750 homicides in juárez this year. the monday killings included two quadruple-homicides. about 5 p.m., four males, ages 16 to 38, were killed when more than 40 shots were fired on the streets of colonia independencia ii.  about two hours later, a 14-year-old boy survived when four men were shot in a home in colonia morelos ii.  in another case, police detained four men suspected of pulling a man off a bus and beating him to death. the rest of the victims monday were shot to death. in chihuahua city, assassins gunned down pedro aragonez, the forensic science director of the chihuahua attorney general's office.  labels: border violence, drug cartels, juarez

                      	 deport yourself plan isn't going to work
	                       


squads of immigration agents are going around the country knocking on doors, scouting out street corners for day laborers, stopping cars driven by foreign-looking people and raiding factories in search of undocumented immigrants.  it's literally a manhunt that is not only taking a toll on immigrant families but is draining the resources of the immigration and customs enforcement agency. so now it is asking for help.  ice has come up with a new pet project. it's being called "operation scheduled departure." it looks like the agency is so overwhelmed with its hunting expedition that it wants immigrants to aid in their own deportation.  this is what ice proposes: if you are a "fugitive alien," turn yourself in. those who adhere to this program will avoid being jailed, and they will have up to 90 days to make the necessary arrangements to leave and take their family with them.  according to assistant secretary of homeland security julie myers, this pilot program is in response to those immigrants who were arrested and deported and said they would have liked some time to leave things in order. myers says the plan targets hundreds of thousands of immigrant fugitives who do not have a criminal background.  now, think about it: if they do not have a criminal background, then why are they being considered fugitives? sounds confusing, doesn't it? the government defines "fugitive immigrants" as those who have deportation orders — mostly immigrants who have been deported before and came back into the country or who violated a previous deportation order. they are the ones who qualify for this voluntary deportation program, but not if they have committed "other" crimes.  the pilot program is supposed to run from aug. 5 through aug. 22, and includes five cities: phoenix; chicago; charlotte, n.c.; san diego; and santa ana, calif. if effective, it could be extended. immigration authorities claim there are some 457,000 fugitive immigrants in the country. mind you, that does not include other undocumented immigrants who are not considered fugitives, even though immigration agents are also going after them. i know, i know, it still sounds confusing.   labels: fugitive immigrants, i.c.e., just plain silly

alexandra olson published: 08.14.2008 mexico city - six federal agents have been arrested on suspicion of passing information to a group of powerful drug lords, a spokesman for the attorney general's office said wednesday. the agents worked for the anti-drug-trafficking intelligence unit of the attorney general's office, the spokesman told reporters on condition of anonymity because his office prohibits him from being named. none were prosecutors, but all had various coordination responsibilities during arrests, interrogations and the transfer of prisoners. the infiltration of drug gangs into the ranks of police and federal agencies has long been endemic in mexico. it stands as a major obstacle in president felipe calderon's fight to destroy the cartels, using thousands of soldiers and federal police deployed across the country. the six agents are suspected of leaking information to the beltran leyva brothers, who head one of the most feared drug-trafficking organizations in mexico.  labels: corruption, mexican law enforcement, mexican society, sinaloa cartel

                      	 census: diversity to reign by 2042
	                       


paul overberg and emily bazar published: 08.14.2008 the number of minorities in the united states is growing so briskly that non-hispanic whites will lose their majority status in 2042, years before demographers had previously projected, according to census data released today. the population is surging on almost all fronts, the new figures show. there will be 400 million people in the u.s. in 31 years, up from fewer than 305 million now. the swelling numbers will transform americans' standard of living from the environment to public schools, demographers and public policy experts say. "it affects quality of life in very important ways," says mark mather, who studies u.s. demographic trends for the population reference bureau, a research group in washington. "we're already experiencing that in traffic congestion, in schools and in our crowded coastal areas." dramatic growth in the numbers of legal and illegal immigrants, especially hispanics, has propelled the increase. annual immigration this year is about 1 million and is projected to double by 2050. jeffrey passel, senior demographer at the pew hispanic center, says the earlier projections were low because they underestimated immigration. "we've measured a much higher immigration in the '90s," he says. "in this decade, those high levels continued."  labels: cost of illegals, illegal invasion, the impact of illegals

aug. 14, 2008 07:53 amchicago tribune  shenandoah, pa. - under an elliptical moon, the sight of an illegal mexican immigrant alone with a 15-year-old hometown girl seemed to push the beer-fueled high school football players into deadly violence. "isn't it a little late for you guys to be out?" one teen reportedly asked luis eduardo ramirez, 25, and the girl as they walked near a park after 11 p.m. one saturday last month. "get your mexican boyfriend out of here!" ethnic slurs ricocheted in the night, echoing what many have muttered for years in this crumbling mountainside town that was once the thriving jewel of pennsylvania's coal country. then, fists flew, and one teen, an honor student, delivered a skull-shattering kick to the head, killing ramirez.  this pocket of blue-collar america, where big band musicians tommy and jimmy dorsey got their start, is spinning in the ugly vortex of the nation's racially charged war over illegal immigration. federal officials have launched an investigation into last month's murder to determine if it is part of a rising trend of anti-latino hate crimes around the country. "we are reaping what we, as a nation, have sowed," said mark potok, spokesman for the southern poverty law center, which tracks hate crimes and hate groups nationwide. ramirez, a father of two who held down a factory job and another one picking cherries, had no criminal history, district attorney james goodman said. he arrived illegally in 2003, friends said. his connection to the 15-year-old girl remains unclear.labels: racial tension, the impact of illegals

effort shows ice's commitment to target transnational gang violence washington, d.c. - u.s. immigration and customs enforcement, working in conjunction with federal, state and local law enforcement partners across the united states, have arrested the 10,000th gang member under operation community shield. this ongoing operation started in 2005 to curb gang violence and weed out transnational gangs gaining hold in urban and suburban u.s. cities. transnational gangs pose a growing public safety threat to communities throughout the country. it is estimated that there are over 900 different criminal gangs roaming u.s. streets and neighborhoods. these gangs no longer own turf in just the inner city but have spread their criminal networks throughout suburban and rural communities.  these transnational street gangs have a significant number of foreign-born members and are frequently involved in human and contraband smuggling, immigration violations and other crimes with a nexus to the border. like any street gang, these transnational gangs also have a propensity toward violence. their members commit myriad crimes including robbery, extortion, assault, rape and murder.  "this recent arrest, marking the 10,000th arrest under operation community shield, is a significant milestone," said julie l. myers, assistant secretary of homeland security for ice. "the violence being perpetrated by foreign-born gang members and associates is as shocking as it is pervasive. ice is committed to using the full force of our enforcement authority to make our cities and towns safer from gang violence."  in a recent chicago area community shield enforcement operation, one of the men arrested by ice was valentin sierra-martinez, a 20-year-old confirmed "norteno-14" gang member. sierra-martinez is the 10,000th gang member or associate arrested by ice as part of operation community shield.  sierra-martinez, a mexican national was in the u.s. illegally and has an extensive criminal background including convictions for residential burglary, domestic battery, possessing drug paraphernalia and knowingly damaging property. he remains in ice custody pending removal to mexico.  ice has the unique and powerful authority to remove foreign nationals from the u.s., including illegal aliens and legal permanent residents based on their criminal history.   labels: gangs, i.c.e.

                      	 three illegal aliens arrested have a combined 69 arrests
	                       


august 7, 2008 - 5:47pm by james gilbert, sun staff writer   border patrol agents in yuma arrested three illegal aliens with extensive criminal histories and immigration violations in two separate incidents wednesday.  at about 6 p.m., agents discovered a set of footprints leading away from the colorado river near county 8th street - "a high-traffic area," said border patrol spokesman ben vik. vik said agents tracked the prints for about two miles to a field where they found an illegal alien trying to evade them. a fingerprint check identified him as juan francisco-flores and revealed a criminal history originating in the late 1980s. included were assault with a deadly weapon, inflicting injury upon spouse, driving under the influence and drug offenses. francisco-flores was also previously deported from the united   states. later that same evening, a yuma sector camera operator helped agents in the arrest of two more criminal aliens who used the same crossing point to enter the u.s. "they were trying to circumvent the north end of yuma," vik said. "the camera operator watched them enter the country illegally and guided agents to their location. it was a triumph of technology." silvio arrellano-estrada, a criminal alien with history beginning in the 1990s, was found to have three previous arrests for various forms of theft including shoplifting and vehicle theft, as well re-entry after deportation. a records check identified the last subject as sacramento velasquez-morales. his varied immigration and criminal history includes 60 arrests, using 47 aliases, spanning from the mid-1970s to present for multiple battery/assault charges, narcotics, theft and public drunkenness in various states such as california, washington,  texas and arizona. velasquez-morales reportedly has multiple illegal entry offenses and has been formally removed from the u.s. eight times.  labels: border patrol, fugitive immigrants, illegal invasion

                      	 mexico criticizes us salmonella findings
	                       


by e. eduardo castillo, associated press writerthu jul 31, 7:14 pm et  mexican agriculture officials said thursday that u.s. colleagues hunting for the source of a salmonella outbreak are rushing to a conclusion about finding the strain at a mexican pepper farm. the salmonella sample that one u.s. official called "a smoking gun" was taken from a water tank that had not been used for more than two months to irrigate crops, said the director of mexico's farm food quality service, enrique sanchez. sanchez told a news conference on thursday that the tank held rain water and suggested that roaming cattle or other factors could have recently contaminated the tank with the same strain of salmonella that has sickened 1,300 people in the united states since june. on wednesday, dr. david acheson, the food safety chief for the u.s. food and drug administration, described the finding of the salmonella strain at a farm in the northern state of nuevo leon as a key breakthrough in the case. "we have a smoking gun, it appears," said dr. lonnie king, who directs the center for food-borne illnesses at the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention. sanchez said the u.s. officials "totally lacked scientific evidence" to make such statements and said they had broken a confidentiality agreement by announcing findings before their investigation is complete. "we're eating this same produce in mexico and we haven't had any problems," sanchez said. he suggested the fda officials confused the source of the samples because the tainted water was found on a farm in the tamaulipas state municipality  of hidalgo — not in nuevo leon as the fda reported. the fda issued a statement later thursday saying it was "surprised and disappointed" the mexican response. "we are confident of our findings," the statement said. "fda's analytical methods are publicly available."  labels: agriculture, u.s. - mexico relations

no suspicion required under dhs policies  by ellen nakashimawashington post staff writerfriday, august 1, 2008; page a01  federal agents may take a traveler's laptop or other electronic device to an off-site location for an unspecified period of time without any suspicion of wrongdoing, as part of border search policies the department of homeland security recently disclosed. also, officials may share copies of the laptop's contents with other agencies and private entities for language translation, data decryption or other reasons, according to the policies, dated july 16 and issued by two dhs agencies, u.s. customs and border protection and u.s. immigration and customs enforcement. "the policies . . . are truly alarming," said sen. russell feingold (d-wis.), who is probing the government's border search practices. he said he intends to introduce legislation soon that would require reasonable suspicion for border searches, as well as prohibit profiling on race, religion or national origin. dhs officials said that the newly disclosed policies -- which apply to anyone entering the country, including u.s. citizens -- are reasonable and necessary to prevent terrorism. officials said such procedures have long been in place but were disclosed last month because of public interest in the matter.  labels: border crossing, cbp

                      	 illegals off the hook?
	                       


ice tells aliens 'deport yourself' posted: july 30,  2008 11:00 pm easternworldnetdaily  now illegal aliens can get a free ticket home by turning themselves in to immigration and customs enforcement rather than spend time in prisons. the newest government plan to cut back on an ever-increasing population of illegals will be unveiled next week, the san antonio express-news reports. ice director announced the idea to a spanish television network sunday. "the program basically gives an opportunity to those seeking an organized way to self-deport," myers told univisión anchor jorge ramos. "operation scheduled departure" will give illegal aliens who don't have criminal histories a chance to turn themselves in and avoid detention. myers said the plan was hatched in response to illegal alien complaints. many detainees said they would rather go home than spend time in immigration prisons. the illegals can now walk into ice, schedule departure, have several weeks to pack their belongings and fly or bus out of the country without facing arrest. she said the program helps illegals dodge home and work raids, but it doesn't offer incentives for self-deportation.  labels: cost of illegals, i.c.e., the impact of illegals

border agent spots unlicensed tanker by tom mallory  union-tribune staff writer july 26, 2008 san diego – forty-nine people being smuggled into the united   states were found yesterday packed inside the metal tank of a water truck that a border patrol agent noticed near the notorious smuggler's gulch. the truck was coming out of a construction area, its driver apparently trying to blend in, when the agent saw that it didn't have a license plate, said border patrol agent jason rodgers. rodgers said the agent followed the truck from monument   road and hollister road in an under-the-speed-limit pursuit that ended nearby with the arrest of the driver and a passenger and the discovery of the people crammed inside. “for someone to actually stuff 49 people inside a tanker like this, even though these criminals are breaking the law anyway, shows a complete disregard for human life,” rodgers said. he said most of the 49 people agents found inside the truck's cylindrical water tank were in the first stage of dehydration. three of the women were pregnant – one eight months, and the others three and five months. another woman inside the tank had a dislocated ankle, rodgers said.  labels: border patrol, coyotes, human smuggling

thu jul 31, 2008 2:28 am bst ciudad juarez, mexico (reuters) - a mexican police officer working as a hit man for drug gangs killed one of his police colleagues on wednesday in the violent border city of ciudad   juarez, police said. francisco ventura was shot and killed by gunmen in two sport utility vehicles as he drove home early on wednesday in ciudad   juarez across from el paso,  texas. federal police arrested three men following the shootout, including the police officer accused of leading the gunmen. city police declined to give more details, but ciudad juarez mayor jose reyes said the discovery of a police officer working as a hit man showed the urgent need for a "total cleansing" of the city's police force. "we know there are officers who are in the pay of organized crime and that is why we need to flush out bad police," reyes told reporters. despite the deployment of 3,000 troops and federal police in ciudad juarez this year, more than 550 people have been killed in drug violence in the city, mexico's most lethal front in a drug war that has killed 1,900 people nationwide in 2008. daylight gun battles have erupted on city streets and buildings set on fire as mexico's most-wanted man, joaquin "shorty" guzman, fights drug baron vicente carrillo fuentes, boss of the juarez cartel, for control of ciudad juarez and its lucrative smuggling corridor into the united states.  labels: border violence, corruption, drug cartels, juarez, local law enforcement, mexican society

                      	 alien smugglers indicted for hostage taking
	                       


miami - a u.s. immigration and customs enforcement (ice) investigation resulted in two alien smugglers indicted for hostage taking. on june 25, 2008, a federal grand jury sitting in miami indicted two miami dade residents niovel chirino-alvarez, 33, and lazaro martinez-padron, 21, with charges related to hostage taking and alien smuggling for the purpose of commercial advantage and private financial gain. if convicted, chirino-alverez and martinez-padron face up to life imprisonment. according to the allegations in the indictment and documents filed with the court, chrino-alvarez and martinez-padron conspired with others to encourage and induce aliens to come to, enter, and reside in the united   states without the alien having received prior authorization to come to, enter, and reside in the united   states and with holding the aliens hostage. more specifically, chirino-alvarez and martinez-padron encouraged and induced eight cuban nationals to enter the united states, charging each adult an estimated $10,000. chirino-alvarez and martinez-padron then held the cuban nationals against their will until their ransoms were paid. "targeting smugglers who prey on human beings is a top priority for ice," said anthony mangione, special agent in charge of the ice office of investigations in miami. "alien smugglers have a callous disregard for the value of human life and whose only motivation is greed as demonstrated by these two individuals. their only goal is to profit at the expense of others. we will continue to aggressively investigate those involved in this illicit and dangerous activity."  labels: human smuggling, i.c.e.

                      	 el pasoan's lawsuit altered how immigration judges chosen
	                       


by ramon bracamontes / el paso times  article launched: 07/30/2008 12:00:00 am mdt a national report that points to illegal appointments by the u.s. attorney general's office was influenced significantly by a lawsuit filed in 2005 by an el paso woman who claims she was passed over because she was not politically connected.  guadalupe gonzalez, an el paso lawyer and the chief counsel for the u.s. immigration and customs enforcement office in el paso, filed a discrimination lawsuit against the federal government three years ago alleging that immigration judges were being appointed based on their political ties and not on merit. as a result of her lawsuit, in 2007 the federal government changed the way it filled immigration judge positions. and on monday, the u.s. department of justice office of the inspector general issued a report reaffirming that the way judges had been seated was illegal. "i am glad that the public record is now clear that it was my lawsuit that forced the changes in the hiring practices," gonzalez said tuesday. "while i am glad that my lawsuit settled nicely, i wanted to make sure that we had done something to change the system. in some ways, it was an act of patriotism and i'm pleased that other lawyers can now apply and compete for the jobs." according to the u.s. department of justice report, the system of hiring immigration judges was frozen after the lawsuit was filed. the freeze was lifted after gonzalez's lawsuit was settled. the department of justice report states, "with regard to immigration judges, as a result of the civil litigation over the unsuccessful candidacy of an immigration judge applicant, in april 2007, former attorney general (alberto) gonzales approved a new process to fill immigration judge positions.   labels: circus court, immigration

                      	 mexico ties flooding in nogales to u.s. border patrol-built wall
	                       


by brady mccombs arizona daily star mexican officials say a concrete barrier constructed by the u.s. border patrol in a storm-water tunnel beneath nogales appears to be on mexican soil and was the main cause of serious flooding july 12 in nogales, sonora. the flooding caused about $8 million in damage in nogales,  sonora, the officials say. the 5-foot-high wall on the floor of the tunnel in front of a gate was put in without notifying the international boundary and water commission, said sally spener, spokeswoman for the u.s. section of the commission. the commission requests that any agency doing work on the border that could affect storm drainage send it plans. "we do have concerns about structures that are placed on the international boundary that could affect storm-water flow," spener said. the u.s. side of the commission hasn't yet determined if the barrier caused the flooding, spener said. it's important to remember the mexican side of the tunnel was old and in poor condition, she said. a delegation from the commission, including commissioner carlos marin, was en route to nogales on tuesday. while in arizona, the delegation will be analyzing whether the structure is in mexico, what role it played in the flood and what should be done to remedy the situation, she said. officials with the mexican section of the commission say the barrier reduced the flow of storm water through the tunnel by 40 percent, said jesús quintanar, a representative in nogales of the mexican side of the commission. the barrier was put up in january by the border patrol without letting anyone else know, he said.  labels: border fence, border security, meddling mexico, mexican politics, whining

                      	 report: illegal immigration drops markedly this summer
	                       


center for immigration studies analysis sheryl kornman published: 07.31.2008 a report by the nonprofit center for immigration studies in washington,  d.c., indicates that illegal immigration is down in the united states this summer by 11 percent compared with the same time last summer. if the trend continues and the decline is sustained, "it would reduce the illegal population by one half in five years," the report concluded. the report is based on an analysis of census and other data. it was released wednesday. steven camarota, the author of the study, said in an interview with the tucson citizen on monday that although arizona figures are not explicitly discussed in the study, he found the rate of illegal immigrant population in arizona declined 18 percent in the last year. he compared data from april with data from the previous summer. the study looked at u.s. census figures for foreign-born people ages 18 to 40 who had not graduated from high school or who did graduate from high school but had no additional education. "those are the attributes" of individuals counted by the census or by the census bureau's american community surveys that indicate illegal citizen status, camarota said. the cis study concluded that increased federal enforcement efforts, immigration reform efforts and the declining economy are the key reasons illegal immigration is falling in the united   states.  labels: the impact of illegals

                      	 mexico sees decline in migrant remittances
	                       


the associated press published: 07.30.2008 mexico city - half-year figures are expected to show the first sustained decline on record in remittances sent home by mexicans working abroad, officials said. the downturn in u.s. housing construction and stepped-up immigration raids have made it tougher for migrants to find jobs, and less able to send money home. mexico's central bank is scheduled to release figures on the remittance flow on wednesday. jesus cervantes, director of economic measurement for mexico's central bank, said remittances are expected to decline 1.5 percent to 2 percent for 2008 as a whole over the previous year. cervantes said that would be the first such sustained drop since a reliable tally has been kept. annual remittances nearly tripled from about us$9 billion in 2001 to almost us$24 billion in 2007, amid improved reporting methods and swelling immigration. businesses in many mexican towns that came to rely on the cash flow are now being forced to scale back — also in part because of the decline of the u.s. dollar, which has lost almost 8 percent of its value against the mexican peso this year.  labels: illegal invasion, mexico's economy

                      	 mexican military losing drug war support
	                       


the associated press published: 07.25.2008 ojinaga, mexico - this hardscrabble mexican border town welcomed 400 soldiers when they arrived four months ago to stop a wave of drug violence that brought daytime gunbattles to its main street. but then the soldiers themselves turned violent, townspeople say, ransacking homes and even torturing people. the frustration boiled over this week. more than 1,000 people marched through the streets carrying signs begging president felipe calderon for protection from his own troops. ojinaga, across the rio grande from presidio, texas, is not alone. people in cities on the front lines of mexico's battle against trafficking say they are increasingly frustrated with military tactics — a shift in opinion that threatens to undermine calderon's nationwide crackdown. mexico's national human rights commission says it has documented more than 600 cases of abuse since calderon sent 20,000 soldiers across the nation to take back territory controlled by drug lords. mexico's attorney general argues the cases are isolated incidents. the army says it investigates all allegations and punishes those found to have to violated the law. but many people say the soldiers have become part of the problem.  labels: abuse of power, border violence, mexican military
