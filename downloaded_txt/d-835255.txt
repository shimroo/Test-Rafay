a catalyst for hope and change.














the future of sozo



sozo has served and loved the people of afghanistan for over 20 years and tens of thousands of individuals and families have been positively impacted through our programs and staff. unfortunately, the last few years have brought significant difficulties to our work in education initiatives and family outreach programs.due to heightened expenses and ever increasing difficulties stemming from the government takeover, sozo's programs are no longer capable of fulfilling our core mission in a sustainable way.after many months of research and with input from key stakeholders and outside voices, sozo’s kabul office and programs, in their current iteration, have begun a phased shutdown process and will fully close after the 2024 spring semester.the heart of sozo continues, and through our parent organization we are still bringing hope and change to the people of afghanistan. in the coming weeks, you will have an opportunity to get connected to that work.you can still support work in afghanistan.  funds given to sozo will help us complete all of the proper closing procedures required by the afghan government and help provide a 6 month severance to all our sozo staff members. they also will support the ongoing work in afghanistan done through our parent organization. you can learn more about our parent organization and sign up to receive communication from them here.though we’re sad to see this era end, it is important to understand that even as sozo’s education programs will end, the heart of sozo’s mission continues.thank you for standing with us. the impact sozo has had is only possible because of the generosity of people like you. from the bottom of our hearts, we thank you for your love for afghanistan and we’re excited to continue bringing hope and change to this part of the world.
















support work in afghanistanfunds given through sozo will go towards the ongoing work of our parent organization.
