2024 newsletter and future reunions
june 2022 was the last organized official annual reunion. we had a good
turnout and lots of fun. on the friday, we had a wine and cheese event at the apartment building
on the alma property. the luncheon on saturday went well. dave mathers, who was one of the acceptable local boys, spoke about his memories of alma girls.
he is a good storyteller and we all had some laughs.

	the annual newsletter is now available. there is no printed version. 

get together: we are planning a lunch to be held at 12:00 pm on saturday june 15th, 2024, at
the buccaneer in port stanley. please rsvp donna robertson, if you plan to attend. it will be pay as you go. cut off date is may 24th as there is a maximum
capacity at the restaurant. we hope to see many alma girls at the lunch!
toujours en avant!
