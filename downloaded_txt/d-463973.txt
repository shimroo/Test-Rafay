exciting news from our shelter – thank you for your support!
dear friends,
we are thrilled to share some wonderful news with you! over the holidays, we had a significant number of adoptions, and many of our furry friends have found their forever homes. this has been an incredible time for our shelter, and we couldn’t have done it without the support of our amazing community.
as we celebrate these successes, we also recognize the ongoing need for support. you can help us by sharing our adoptable dogs and cats on your social media! we expect to fill the shelter again soon as our intake volunteers work to contact everyone on the very long waitlist for cats needing to come into the shelter. our volunteers have been working tirelessly to address this waitlist, ensuring that every cat waiting for a safe and loving environment gets the help they need.
if you need assistance in finding a home for an unwanted kitty, we encourage you to use the resources available on our website or reach out to other shelters that may now have room. every effort makes a difference in giving these cats a chance at a better life. on the dog side, we continue to place many dogs in foster-to-adopt arrangements, and more come in each week. sharing our adoptable animals on social media can make a huge impact in helping them find their forever families.
as we look forward to a busy and rewarding new year, we remain committed to providing our guests with a loving home away from home while they wait for their permanent families. your continued support means the world to us and to the animals in our care.
we’d like to take a moment to express our heartfelt gratitude to all our supporters, the city of parma, and our incredible volunteers who make it possible for us to care for so many dogs and cats in need. your contributions allow us to provide shelter for strays, surrendered, and abandoned animals, many of whom require medical attention and foster care before finding their forever homes. a special thank you to those who open their hearts and homes to foster these animals during their recovery journey. your support means the world to us, whether it’s through attending our events, donating, or sharing our mission on social media.
donations can be made easily via credit cards, paypal, or by mail. you can also check out our amazon and chewy wish lists to provide much-needed supplies, and don’t forget to donate fresh step litter points to support our foster kitties.
we are always looking for dedicated volunteers to join our team. from staffing the front desk to walking dogs, cleaning, or caring for our cats, every effort makes a difference. volunteers are asked to commit to a two-hour weekly shift, and after completing training and four shifts, you’ll have the flexibility to pick up additional shifts via signup genius. approved volunteers can also stay on call after being approved for membership by our board of trustees. if you’re interested, please fill out a volunteer application on our website.
another way to make a meaningful impact is by becoming a foster for our special needs cats and kittens. kitten season will be here before we know it! you provide the love and care, and we cover the food and medical expenses. we’re especially in need of foster parents for kittens who are bottle-fed or too small to be spayed or neutered. if fostering sounds like the right fit for you, please fill out a foster application online and let us know your area of interest. we also offer foster-to-adopt opportunities for both cats and dogs.
finally, we’d like to remind you of our adoption policies. visit us during open hours to meet our adorable pets, and consider filling out an adoption application online beforehand to speed up the process. with a pre-approved application, you can adopt the same day you visit. please remember to bring all family members for a meet-and-greet, as our adoptions are based on finding the best home—not first come, first serve.
thank you for your continued support in helping us rescue, rehome, and educate others about animal welfare. together, we are making a meaningful difference in the lives of animals in need.
warm regards,
parma animal shelter volunteers

stubbs is a friendly male cat who is easy to pet. you have to come in and check this guy out and see why his name is stubbs! he loves attention and will give head bumps when you pet him. stubbs is playful and likes string toys and the laser. stubbs might be okay with another cat, dog and children. he tends to be a little shy and may be better as an only pet or might be okay with a calm cat or dog. this kitty says please bring me home so i can enjoy the new year in a home and not be stuck in a cage. he would probably be best in a home with an experienced cat owner. stubbs can use a little extra tlc. fill out an application online. you will receive an email once the application has been approved.
