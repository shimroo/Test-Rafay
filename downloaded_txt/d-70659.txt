treated accordingly. these essays, reviews, and miscellaneous writings have been 
posted both for your reading pleasure and to cause you to think. happy pondering:

stuff from the kids
the resources in this section have been created by our children.
covers for cereal box dvds
early in 2002, and again in late-2004, one of the breakfast cereal manufacturers 
in canada offered kids dvds as a give-away in certain brands of breakfast cereal.  
we scoured the internet for relevant artwork and then created case-covers (real 
dvd-sized covers, not cd case inserts) using powerpoint, for each of the dvds we 
collected.  these were created as a computer assignment by two of our children 
within the context of our home school.

air bud dvd case-coverpowerpoint 
	(1,799 mb) or pdf (196 kb).
alice in wonderland dvd case-coverpowerpoint 
	(60k) or pdf (60k).
babar, king of the elephants dvd case-coverpowerpoint 
	(57 kb) or pdf (176 kb).
the mask dvd case-coverpowerpoint 
	(118k) or pdf (130k).
the thief and the cobbler dvd case-coverpowerpoint 
	(1,732 kb) or pdf 
	(233 kb).

stroke books
in late 2002, i (christopher) came upon a reference to something called a stroke 
book. this is a small, bound booklet that can be folded from a single sheet of paper. 
the best instructions i can finddescribing 
with illustrations exactly how to fold one of these booksare found on the
oregon public education network's website, 
in the

support for teachers in art section.  what appears below is an ms word 
document that is formatted such that you can easily type text into the document, 
print it, and fold it into a stroke book.  this was created as a computer assignment 
by one of our children within the context of our home school.

stroke book ms word document 
	(3 kb).

stuff from christopher
the resources in this section have been authored by christopher.
mr. travel
since 1995, my work has caused me to travel much more than i have ever imagined 
i would.  my giving of opinionated and vocal travel advice to co-workers caused 
me to be nicknamed mr. travel (specific thanks for the moniker goes to brad black).  
while waiting in airports, hotels, and airplanes, i have collected my opinions and 
recommendations into the following documents (i trust they will be of some value 
to others):

tips for travelersbusiness 
	travel advice by christopher rath
hotel rating.zippersonal 
	notes by christopher rath (this page is very stale and no longer maintained, 
	so i've zipped the page; if you're interested in the page then download it and 
	view it from your pc)


worship team & sound reinforcement
i have been part of worship bands/teams since becoming a christian in january, 
1983.  playing in bands and later helping to start a church led to experience 
setting up and running sound systems for church services, conferences, and concerts.  
early in 2001 i decided to try and capture my experience and learnings in writing, 
and these documents form the resources in this section. 
i am confident that not everyone will share the opinions i express herein, but 
i trust my experiences will serve to assist others as they work out their own 
salvation (c.f. philippians 2:12) in service to the body of christ.
the links in this section are presented in alphabetical order; with a
list of terms being listed at 
the bottom:

choosing sound 
	techniciansguidelines for selecting appropriate individuals to become members 
	of your team of sound technicians.
choosing 
	sound system equipmentthoughts and suggested constraints for the selection 
	of sound reinforcement equipment.
gift projection 
	& sound technicianssound technicians are present at a variety of meetings 
	and often encounter "gift projection", so they should be prepared to handle 
	it.  even worse, sound technicians themselves often engage in gift projection 
	and they should be prepared to deal with themselves.
home group worship seminarour 
	church put on a day-long seminar, in 1991, for anyone interested in leading 
	worship in home groups (i.e., small, mid-week care groups). these are my teaching 
	notes for the session; where an outline of the other presenters sections are 
	present, but the only detailed notes are for the sections i authored and taught.
how to use a vocal 
	micsome tips regarding proper use of vocal mics.
overhead transparency 
	templatethis document is an ms word 2000 document template (a .dot file).  
	to use this template, download it (by right-clicking and doing a save-as) and 
	put it on your desktop.  whenever you need to create a new overhead for 
	a song, double-click on the overhead template icon and youre away to the races.
prerequisites for home group 
	worship leaderssome thoughts on both the qualifications required to be 
	a home group worship leader as well as how the local church should be serving 
	such leaders.
prerequisites for worship team 
	membersthe set of requirements i wrote (with lots of input from our congregation's 
	leadership team at the time) to capture the responsibilities and prerequisites 
	for membership in the worship team that led the congregation in worship on sunday 
	morning's.
sound reinforcement 
	& friction with othersa short discussion intended to help sound technicians 
	deal with common complaints.
sound system checklist, 
	or, how to get sound from the systemthis document is a printed as a small 
	4 page booklet and left with the sanctuarys sound system.  i wrote this 
	to provide instructions which would allow anyone using the sanctuary to be able 
	to make use of the house sound system.
the importance of 
	rhythmsome thoughts on the importance of rhythm when leading a congregation 
	in worship/singing.
yamaha bms-10a usage tipan 
	inexpensive tip for getting extra life from your yamaha personal monitor mic 
	stand adapter.
list of termsa list 
	of common terminology used throughout my worship team & sound reinforcement 
	notes.

miscellaneous
this section contains a miscellaneous collection of tips and contributions towards 
the public good.  i hope theyre helpful.

availability 
	outage tablesthis excel workbook presents system availability 
	percentages in terms of years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds; 
	that is, in plain english.  the workbook uses the
	formatinterval() vba 
	function that is available on my vba resources 
	page (it's also embedded in this workbook).  it's available here in
	excel and
	pdf versions.
big mac marketingan example of how mcdonald's marketed the big mac when it was first released.
christmas carolsi have compiled 
	commonly sung christmas songs (the ones i like) and put them together into a 
	little booklet and overhead transparency masters.  although this collection 
	isn't new, it has been reformatted and new carols added for the 2004 christmas 
	season.
clarkconnect notesthoughts, 
	experiences, and software i've written for our clarkconnect-based firewall.
csv.pmperl module for processing 
	comma separated value (csv) files.
diamond grading chartto assist 
	with a diamond purchase, i created a pocket-sized chart of the
	agss diamond grading system.

	noteswe recently switched from an analogue to a digital camera.  click 
	through the link to read about our experiences.
hacking the 3com multi-purpose internet 
	server (3c19504)my experiences hacking into, reconfiguring,  and upgrading 
	my 3c19504.
home group teachingsnotes for 
	teaching i have done in small groups (generally associated with the church we 
	belong to).

	couple of ms excel tools i put together to assist with evaluating the various 
	options.
it 101an introduction 
	to information technology (it) practices.
latex songbook stylemore than 15 
	years ago i took on maintenance of the songbooks and overhead transparencies 
	at the church we attend. the style will print songbooks with chords, without 
	chords, and transparencies, all from a single input file. it will also produce 
	a table of contents, an index sorted by title and first line, and an index sorted 
	by key. it attempts to handle songs in multiple keys, as well as songs in multiple 
	languages.
nature loga log of some of the wildlife 
	we have seen.
newton resourcesi have produced 
	a few resources which may be of interest to newton messagepad users/owners.
next writenow to ms rtf conversionclick 
	through the link to download a couple of scripts which can be used to perform 
	some rudimentary conversion of next writenow files into microsoft rtf (rich 
	text format) files that can be opened with ms word.
ntp for windows 2000network 
	time protocol (ntp) support is built into windows 2000 professional; however, 
	its not turned on by default and the process of turning it on is not properly 
	documented.  follow the link (at the start of this bullet) for my w2k ntp 
	crib sheet.
ms office templateschristopher's 
	excel templates. [new]

	actively managing the salaries of my staff; the material was updated to make 
	it generic prior to being posted here. this work is licensed under a
	creative 
	commons attribution-noncommercial-sharealike 2.5 license. the
	original powerpoint 
	file and 
	a pdf version are also available
	under the same license.

old hat
these are past publications, most of which have no current application but which 
might have some historical value.  if nothing else, they capture a point in 
time which may interest others.  the publications are presented in reverse 
chronological order:

internet access 
	white paper presented to an ocri technology executive breakfast in february 
	1993.
usenix winter 1993 conference 
	reportthe conference report i circulated to co-workers upon my return from 
	the conference.
hp-41c microcode programmingpublished 
	in ppc technical notes #15, early 1984. in early 1983 i was invited to 
	give a talk at an upcoming gathering of hewlett-packard calculator enthusiasts. 
	over the preceding couple of years a number of my letters and articles had been 
	published in both the ppc journal and ppc technical notes, and 
	the primary focus of these writings had become microcode programming of the 
	hp-41c calculator. this article is an annotated version of paper i wrote and 
	presented at the rhode island conference on 1983/05/0708 (the annotations are 
	by john mcgechie and michael thompson).
tic-tac-toe algorithm & hp-41c implementationpublished 
	in ppc technical notes #13, late 1982. i created this algorithm and code 
	during early 1981 while learning to repair ground radar at the canadian armed 
	forces electronics school in kingston. for many months i had been promising 
	the ppc tns editor that i would write up and submit an article; hence the gap 
	between the writing of the program and the publication of the article. a text 
	version of this article is available 
	at this link.


aliases
over the years, christopher has been known under several email addresses within 
the high tech community and on the internet.  those addresses include:

crath@jetform.cawhen i was working at jetform corp. (originally known 
	as indigo software)
crath@bnr.cawhen i was working at bell-northern research (subsequently 
	known as nortel and then nortel networks)
crath@nortel.cawhile working at nortel (subsequently known as nortel 
	networks)
christopher.rath@nortel.com and 
	crath@nortel.comstill while working 
	at nortel networks (during the .com boom, john roth, the ceo, mistakenly thought 
	that only having a .com corporate address was somehow of value)
crath@cyberus.camy first personal email address (before this current 
	address)

who i am not.  this christopher rath is not the a c t o r who is 
also a a member of the religious organisation whose name starts with 'sci'.
