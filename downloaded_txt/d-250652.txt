kirt and cathy kamepher are the best realtors we’ve ever worked with. they were really interested in finding us the right property and then they were total advocates for us during the buying process and afterwards. they connected us with the right people and we felt they were really on our side and made sure that all of the bases were covered during and after our purchase. you can tell that they are very passionate about what they do and want to make sure that they get you the right property at a fair price. they are also really fun to work with and we’re able to share local recommendations that made us feel at home right away. i wish we could clone them and work with them again the next time we’re in the market for another property!

my wife and i have bought and sold numerous houses over the years and we had the best realtor experience of our lives with kirt and cathy kaempher. they are a phenomenal team. cathy has such a great design sense and is so in touch with the market and market trends. kirt has such high energy and a tremendous personality. he helped move furniture, drove hours at a moments notice to get signatures to make the deal happen, and wins everyone over with his great sense of humor. even though we were hours away, they kept us informed with texts, emails, video calls and video tours and were available at a moments notice to act. they made us feel like they were truly invested in us and our needs and not just looking to make a buck and get on to the next client or deal. they always put our interests and needs first. they are longtime residents of western nc and their knowledge of the area was so valuable to us. being a team, they were able to provide us with so much more support than we would have gotten with a single realtor. i highly recommend them to anyone wanting an honest, hard working, knowledgeable, and dedicated team that is truly invested in their clients' best interests.

bridgette shuler was amazing! she sold our connestee falls home quickly during a down time in the market. she was always available for questions and navigated a complicated transaction extremely well. we would highly recommend her as a realtor with no reservations!

i wish i could find the perfect way to thank you for being so thoughtful in the myriad of details you handled in marketing our home. the burdens we faced being out of state to property get our home ready for market you simplified by handling and overseeing all the contractors. your honesty and integrity helped us tremendously. your generous spirit has made such a difference, and we greatly appreciated you being there for us.

as new residents to connestee falls, we had the greatest real estate experience using bridgette schuler as our realtor.  she was outstanding at introducing us to the entire brevard area as well as connestee falls. within a short period of time, she had identified the perfect home for us and worked tirelessly on our behalf to get us our dream mountain house.

it took a long time to sell the family home in connestee falls, and during this process, dj golden has continually shown professionalism and a positive attitude towards our home. her passion for the house showed in the number of times she was able to bring potential buyers to the house. the contract to sell the house was going to a competitor but only the attention from dj brought it back to connestee falls realty. she managed the very difficult buyers and their realtor which was very taxing for all parties concerned.

lynda hysong is our agent of choice in connestee falls! she is an extremely great communicator, which we value above all else. she is currently helping us sell our condo in qualla village in connestee falls and is very encouraging and positive in her interactions with clients and advice to us. plus, we just love her sparkling personality!

purchasing a home from another state was very challenging and stressful and sarah was instrumental in helping us find the perfect home. highly recommend her as an agent!

bridgette was more than a realtor selling my parent’s house in connestee falls – she was a savior! since the house was unoccupied, we ran into a few emergency situations – roof leak – heat pump freeze – either of which could have been a nightmare, but she immediately hired the necessary contractors for us and we avoided disaster. not only is she extremely pleasant to work with, she is an excellent communicator and knows the market extremely well. we would highly recommend using bridgette for listing your home.

we just purchased a home here in connestee falls, thanks to your realtor, nolan riess. we were so impressed with nolan’s professionalism. he seemed genuinely interested in our needs and never pressured us. 

walter (terry) & barbara  
									agent: nolan riess								






looking out of state for the perfect vacation home can be a challenge. it takes the right realtor-one that has the ability to listen and key in on the desires and needs of the buyer. dj handled the negotiations with skill and we obtained an excellent buy. it was also comforting to have someone capable to handle all the infinite details of the translation till closing. we personally recommend dj for her in-depth knowledge, tenacity and ongoing positive attitude.

we love it here. james showed us a variety of properties and worked to help us find the very best property for our needs. we highly recommend connestee falls, and also working with james as a buyer’s agent!

my wife and i recently purchased our home in connestee falls using the services of bridgette shuler. she was very knowledgeable about the area, and she genuinely cared about locating a property that met and exceeded our expectations. having a limited amount of time to tour properties, she was able to organize our showings where we were able to make a well informed decision about our purchase. she was professional with negotiating the price and terms of our contract, and we feel both parties to the transaction were equally satisfied. we would highly recommend her services, and feel like we have made a life long friend.

i recently purchased a home in brevard, nc. other than the day we actually looked at homes, the entire transaction was long distance. lynda was in the loop the whole way and made sure we got to closing on time. thanks, lynda!!

									agent: lynda hysong								






bridgette listed our connestee falls house and was absolutely fantastic across the board. from marketing our house, negotiating the price and managing the closing process. she went above and beyond to help with repairs, furniture and other details as they arose. most of all, bridgette offered smart, strategic insights at every point in the process to help us sell the home quickly and at the right price. 

greg schott 
									agent: bridgette shuler								






our home search and home buying experience with sarah was fantastic. her knowledge of the area and the bidding/buying process was second to none. she was always available for questions or to talk things through. most importantly, she listened to our wants and needs and created target lists and visits that were on point. 

kevin and kirsten doyle 
									agent: sarah hysong								






sarah worked diligently as i initially searched on-line from afar, and in-person after narrowing down the prospects. she provided sage advice throughout the offer and negotiation stages, as well as assisting with inspections and ultimately with move-in. she went above and beyond what one might expect from a realtor.  

vick and jackie cox 
									agent: sarah hysong								






from the very first phone call to sarah hysong and connestee falls realty, through our initial offer and closing and interim management of the house until we were able make our final move, sarah (and her entire team) has proven that she is one of the best agents around. she listened to all of our wants and needs, and found the perfect house for us. the level of courtesy and professionalism is beyond compare. i only have positive things to say about the entire home buying and relocation process with sarah leading the way.

sarah helped us sell our house in connestee falls in july of 2019. we knew her from a local charity team and i was really impressed with her enthusiasm, professionalism and work ethic. when we decided to move, she was the person we called. very attentive and great attention to detail! our house sold in about 2 weeks. everything was smooth as silk.

my husband and i felt like sarah was very professional and the most pleasant individual to work with in finding our home. very dependable and dedicated to her clients.

my husband phil and i both loved sarah from the very first time we met. she is personable and professional with integrity as her strong foundation. her heart for brevard is contagious and we immediately fell in love with her home town. sarah was responsive to our many questions and always put her heart and soul into her work. we both highly recommend sarah at connestee falls realty to either buy or sell your home. she's the best!

thank you, sarah, for selling our home in connestee falls, brevard, nc! brevard and connestee falls are wonderful places to live, and i enjoyed having sarah as my realtor.

kirt and cathy kaempfer go above and beyond to make the home search not only as easy as possible but also enjoyable. their professional advice was invaluable throughout the process. they also shared some of their personal experiences with local tradesmen and community elements that helped in the decision process. kirt even brought his truck—after i moved in—to haul off large boxes. i’ve bought and sold a number of houses and this team exceeded every previous benchmark. don’t think you can go wrong with them. 

joyce ryan 
									agents: kirt and cathy kaempfer								






kirt and cathy are the best realtors we ever used. they paid attention to our needs, showed us many properties in our price range. they were extremely patient with us. they went out of their way to preview homes since we were out of state. we purchased a home they previewed for us while we were out of state. they measured rooms, walked the property. we highly recommend them.

i want to thank bridgette schuler on the fantastic job she did for my wife and i in finding our dream home in connestee falls. her professionalism and patience helped us every step of the way. she was truly exceptional and made the home buying process a pleasure. i give her my highest recommendation. 

patrick van der ham 
									agent: bridgette schuler								






having dealt with several realtors in the past, it was truly special to have kirt and cathy represent my mother in the sale of her home in connestee falls - especially during covid-19. i live in florida, so all of our transactions and correspondence had to be virtual and secure. kirt and cathy made certain to connect me immediately with the closing and title attorneys and made sure we had access to their vast community connections for any resources we needed at our disposal, including architects, cpas, and members of government.

my experience working with lee was excellent. as empty nesters looking for a second home in the mountains, we knew very little about nc real estate when we started the process. lee was very knowledgeable about the area and helped us determine what we were really looking for (and narrow our focus). i have been a real estate professional for over 25 years in florida, and i can say with certainty that lee was excellent in all ways, from showing properties to the contract negotiation process, through the inspection period, and to the closing. as we were purchasing long-distance, we had to put our trust in him and we were not disappointed! i highly recommend lee lindler if you are looking for an outstanding, patient, and trustworthy realtor in western nc.
