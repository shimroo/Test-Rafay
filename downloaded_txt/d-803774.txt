ho`ala school‚Äôs educational philosophy
ho`ƒÅla education is a philosophy that uses a coherent system of practices to develop citizens of personal integrity who act effectively for the greater good. ho`ƒÅla education is based on the work of alfred adler as articulated by rudolf dreikurs and others. adler held that human behavior is purposive or future oriented, although unconsciously so. adler identifies two basic motivations and says that each of us is searching for two things:
‚Äî a strong sense (or experience) of significance, and
‚Äî a strong sense (or experience) of belonging

parent testimonials

‚Äúho`ala is the best thing that has happened to our family! my son has been going there for for two years, 1st and 2nd grade, and his transition from public school to ho`ala has been amazing. after receving recommendations from a facebook page, i booked a tour with ho`ala and their philosophy blew every other school we had seen out of the water! the small class sizes, the belief that teachers and parents should work together, and that emotional developmentis practiced just as much as academic development set them apart. my son is so excited to go to school everyday and to stay for his after school programs, steam, robotics, and tutoriing! i know my son is learning an improtant foundation to guide the rest of his life!‚Äù

‚Äútruly a unique little enclave of hands-on, participative education for a fairly low price. we sent our daughter there for kindergarten after she just barely missed the cutoff for kindergarten at public school. we couldn‚Äôt be happier with the results. by the time she left, she was reading at the mid-1st grade level and was a considerable amount ahead of where her sister was at the same level in public schools! very military friendly and offer considerable discounts for service members. if you‚Äôre pcsing to hawaii and looking to avoid everything you‚Äôve heard about the public schools here (all true), please consider ho`ala as an alternative. the teachers care for the students and the students care for one another.‚Äù

‚Äúwe feel assured sending our children to school every day, because at ho ªƒÅla, we know that our children are in a safe space where they are valued and also taught to value others. they are gaining an education that will open doors to their future while developing the social-emotional skills of being kind and caring individuals. it‚Äôs true that it takes a village to raise a child, and we‚Äôre grateful to have found that village at ho ªƒÅla.‚Äù

‚Äúhoala school is the greatest gift we could have given our daughter. as a military family, we got relocated from virginia to hawaii. on a short note, as the school opening date was coming up, the staff was walking us through the process every step that feels like getting a warm welcome hug. our child is cared for, respected, listened to, encouraged, and challenged. she experiences joy in every aspect of her education. she feels connected to the community and supported in a way to learn in meaningful and memorable ways. the incredibly warm and talented staff creates an ideal environment for academic, social, and emotional growth. she grows to be a confident learner. hoala school takes the matter of covid-19 and social distancing seriously and with precautions to ensure all children are safe at all times. for almost 2 years, i am grateful every day for the amazing experience that is hoala school. i wish every child could have the opportunity to attend this very special school.‚Äù

‚Äúthe teachers and administrators are very nurturing and loving to the children, while also providing wonderful structure and guidance. the level of enthusiasm that they display, and the respect they hold for all the students and parents is phenomenal. i am happy that my child is in a safe environment, that allows her to grow, play, and learn. the small class size and individualized attention the teachers provide to the students is a sight to see, and it is wonderful to see them use differentiation in instruction based on the students‚Äô levels. it is obvious that my child is truly thriving here at ho`ala school, as she is so excited and happy to go to school every day. we will forever be grateful for the endless love, support, and dedication that the entire staff has shown to my daughter in her first year here. i am enthusiastic and optimistic that she will continue to thrive and blossom in the coming years.‚Äù

‚Äúthank you so much. there are so many reasons ho‚Äôala is such a wonderful school. there is no way public school would do this for me. i was so thrilled with my daughter‚Äôs report card. she is doing so well. amazing. not only is she enjoying ho`ala, she is doing well academically also, ho`ala has been a godsend to our family. it‚Äôs amazing how your school has changed our daughter‚Äôs life around. life is 180 degree turn around for her. i can‚Äôt imagine her being that girl who used to bite herself until she was bruised..because she was so stressed at her old school.¬† thank you and all the others there for rescuing her. thank you so much for your support. if you ever stop and wonder if ho‚Äôala is making an impact‚Ä¶. you all are.‚Äù

‚Äúit is difficult to put into words what it is exactly that makes ho`ala special, but i shall try. there is a feeling, it is not something tangible, which you can touch, taste or smell, but it is there nonetheless. a feeling of love, of caring, compassion, understanding, and acceptance. it is a safe place, physically of course, but also spiritually and emotionally. it is a place where the atmosphere encourages us to be ourselves, and to be more than ourselves.‚Äù
