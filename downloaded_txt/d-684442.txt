 welcome to beds on clouds inn
we are currently under new management! we are acting on the feedback of our customers. we’ve taken a  few steps to meet these needs. rates are 1/2 to 1/3 of the other lodging facilities in the area offering a more affordable stay with all the luxuries.
we’ve lowered our prices since we eliminated the breakfast. however, we now also provide you with a guest kitchen for you to use. it’s fully stocked with refrigerator/freezer, microwave, stove, sink, and all utensils such as plates, pots/pans, silverware, etc. you only provide your own food.  the windham diner is also located across the street, which offers breakfast all day.
we’ve eliminated the service charge. the only time you will receive what is called a “hotel charge” is if you use a third party to book the room such as expedia or booking dot com. even though it is their 15% or 25% commission, they will itemize it as a hotel fee. book with us directly to get the best price.
beds on clouds is the crowned jewel situated on top of the majestic windham mountain of the great northern catskill mountains. windham is considered the “gem of the catskills” and the “land in the sky”, making beds on clouds the ideal windham, ny boutique hotel for experiencing spectacular views of our historic town and the surrounding mountains. 

our beautiful guest rooms all feature hand painted clouds by artist betty sweet on each bedroom ceiling, which is how the rooms got their names. enjoy a restful night’s sleep with feather beds, down comforters and pillows. our room rates start at $139/night during midweek and $209/night on weekends. each suite is equipped with a/c, cable, a 32″ flat screen tv, and wifi. each room boasts an ensuite, meaning the bathroom is in the room, meaning private bathrooms. each room is adorned by a collection of original paintings and photographs by artist sacha beres, rebecca blake, mihail chemiakin, susumu sato and romano vitali,to name a few.
other amenities on-site include:

deliciously crisp filtered water right from the tap; revitalized and restructured to shield you from harmful contaminants and leave your skin and hair silky soft. 
1/2 acre of gardens to enjoy and explore, including some delicious grape vines!
our entire property is cared for with green cleaning products.
susumu sato photo and fine art gallery on premises.

conveniently located, beds on clouds is less than a 1/2 mile from windham mountain and 10 miles from hunter mountain, creating the perfect place to stay for your skiing adventures. we are just a 3-minute walk to the adirondack trailways bus to nyc’s port authority that arrives twice daily (am and pm). beds on clouds is walking distance to most shopping, restaurants and pubs, which include live music on the weekends.
outdoor activities in the area include hiking, skiing, ice skating, snowmobiling, apple picking, bike rentals, golfing, horseback riding, and more. we will provide you with maps, brochures and recommendations on places to explore around the northern catskill region.
