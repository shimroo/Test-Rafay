a new classic





how sad.









florida county library pulls racy 'fifty shades of grey' from shelves



have they looked on their romance shelves lately? or some "ya"? there is some seriously hot sex going on in those books. how is this any different? 



from florida today:


“it’s quite simple — it doesn’t meet our selection criteria,” said cathy schweinsberg, library services director.

“nobody asked us to take it off the shelves. but we bought some copies before we realized what it was. we looked at it, because it’s been called ‘mommy porn’ and ‘soft porn.’ we don’t collect porn.”


they'd bought 19 copies already, so it met your selection criteria before, or are you in the habit of buying material before you know what it is? now they won't stock them because some people called it "porn" (who? qualified reviewers? librarians? professional adult material selectors? jackasses who call everything with a sex scene "porn"? your selection committee, perhaps?)  



i haven't read these books, they're not really my thing. but 300+ people on hold for the first one at our library, and  probably more every day. 



they say they have other "porn" titles:




copies of “the complete kama sutra” are available through the cocoa beach, mims/scottsmoor, palm bay and titusville branches. also up for grabs countywide: “fanny hill,” “lady chatterley’s lover,” “fear of flying,” “tropic of cancer” and “lolita.”

so what makes “fifty shades of grey” different?

“i think because those other books were written years ago and became classics because of the quality of the writing,” schweinsberg said. “this is not a classic.”




you know what makes something a classic? standing the test of time. getting a reputation as something everyone should read. you know what all these classics listed here have in common? sex scenes, and having been banned somewhere.



we might just have a classic here, after all.

damn proud to be an american







and to call this man my president. especially in the wake of a pathetic vote in north carolina.

we're americans. we're all created equal. we should all have equal choice. we should have marriage equality.

now.

nj bike exchange





have a used bike cluttering up your garage? or need a bike for yourself? i just found out about this program. it's a great idea.the boys & girls club bike exchange accepts donated used bikes which are re-conditioned by volunteers and sold. profits go to the trenton boys & girls club's after school programs.places to donate your bike can be found here.the exchange is located at 1500 n. olden ave, ewing nj. they're open saturdays 10-5, and thursdays 5-8. they say you can ride the bikes to try them out before purchase, too.reduce, reuse, recycle, and ride, all for charity. what's not to love?

better than i could've said it: jennifer beck flip-flops edition





jay lassiter on state senator jennifer beck's sudden change of heart regarding marriage equality:new jersey's new map added asbury park and ocean grove to her district, transforming it overnight into (arguabley) the gayest district in new jersey.so, beck's track record on equality: vote against gay people when it matters (or when it suits her politically) but now that she wants to represent the gayest district in nj, a sudden conversion. go figure. ah, a fair weather friend. just what everyone needs. here in the former 12th, i say: good riddance, senator beck. and good luck to the folks in her new district. you're going to need it.

memorial day 2011





“it is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died. rather we should thank god that such men lived.” — george s. pattonfrom the times of trenton:on this memorial day, it is fitting to call the roll of the 145 service membersand two civilians with ties to new jersey and bucks county, pa., who have diedin iraq and afghanistan.we give thianks that such people lived, and remember them this memorial day.
