attending isu was a no-brainer for me because of the financial help i have received from the oneapp, private donors, and the hixson opportunity award program. iowa state continues to do its best by providing scholarship opportunities and helping me navigate scholarship applications each semester. if it weren’t for the financial aid i receive from iowa state, i wouldn’t be where i am today.
