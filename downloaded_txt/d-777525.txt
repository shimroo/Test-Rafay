history in the making





what started as concern over the growing racial divide in our region  six years ago inspired publisher sam logan to do what he has been doing  for decades with the support of his michigan chronicle family. 
he dived into the heart of the matter. 
he wanted to inspire dialogue with leaders into prickly islues and have  open, honest conversation. mr. logan worked with hiram jackson at real  times media and .came up with an event that would feature leaders  talking about key issues and "pancakes and politics" was born. 
that inaugural event featured two political heavyweights, detroit mayor  kwame kilpatrick and oakland county executive l. brooks patterson who  talked about race relations and problems associated with the notorious  eight mile divide between city and suburbs. 
the  conversation lit up the standing room crowd of influential people from  business and government gathered at the detroit athletic club where most  "pancakes" events have been held. 
"pancakes and politics"  has grown into a signature event for the michigan chronicle as the four  star-studded breakfast events held each spring feature a who's who of  leaders from politics, education, business and media before an audience to delve into issues and inspire thought-provoking conversation. 
i was honored to have been asked by sam logan and hiram jackson to help  with that first "pancakes" and have been involved with all the others.  so too other journalists like michigan chronicle senior editor bankole  thompson. 
wwj-tv cbs detroit which has aired  "pancakes" as "michigan matters" specials for viewers anxious to hear  what the packed audience at each of the events heard. 
"with so many issues and concerns simmering across our region, there's more need than ever for tancakes and politics,'"  said trey fabacher, vice president and general manager at wwj-tv cbs  detroit and cw50 wkbd. "we're honored to be involved with hiram jackson  and sam logan in this endeavor." 
dozens of  michigan's most famous and infamous political, business and educational  leaders have appeared on stage before an audience to address tough  issues and face probing questions from media members and the audience  which is now part of the "pancakes" ritual. 
from  gov. jennifer granholm, detroit mayors kwame kilpatrick and dave bing,  dte ceo tony earley, strategic staffing solution ceo cindy pasky, henry  ford health system president and ceo nancy schlichting, to skillman  foundation president and ceo carol goss, dozens have graced the  "pancakes" stage. 
"as long as people are talking  and debating issues, there's a chance you can find solutions," mr. logan  said at that first "pancakes." 
it has been mr. logan's mantra ever since. 
and leaders and audience members have not been disappointed as  attendees have left the events inspired, uplifted and knowing more about  key issues than before they arrived. 
what's up next for "pancakes and politics" as the michigan chronicle prepares to kicks off its sixth season in 2011? 
sam logan and hiram jackson are keeping it under wraps for now. 
but one thing you can be sure of - it will broach issues as few other  events in michigan. and it will likely raise a few eyebrows and make us  think. 
and that's exactly how they envisioned it.

government crisis hits democracy score





ireland ranks 12th of 167 countries and territories covered in the  economist  intelligence unit's democracy index (of those countries, we  adjudge 26 to be "full democracies"), but its score has fallen from 9.01  in 2008 to 8.79 in 2010. ireland's high ranking reflects, inter alia,  the highest-possible score for civil liberties--independent  international surveys over decades have shown that political, press and  civil liberties are among the most comprehensive and best enforced in  the world. ireland also scores well in the electoral process category,  reflecting the openness and fairness of the electoral system, but misses  out on a maximum score owing to a lack of transparency in the system of  funding political parties. ireland's score for political participation,  although high on a global basis, is the second-lowest-scoring  sub-component, owing to a comparatively low proportion of women in politics,  falling levels of political party membership and a relatively high  percentage of survey respondents saying that they do not follow politics. 
ireland's score in the democracy index has been pulled down in 2010  primarily because of a sharp drop in its score for government  functioning. this reflects a dramatic drop in support for the ruling  government, owing to its perceived culpability in causing the economic  depression and prioritising of party over national politics.  intensified dissatisfaction with the prime minister, brian cowen,  culminated in january 2011 with an attempt to unseat mr cowen from his  position as leader of fianna fail, the largest party in government.  fianna fail's popularity has fallen to 14%, putting it well behind the  two main opposition parties, fine gael and the labour party, in opinion  polls. we expect a coalition between fine gael and the labour party to  emerge following the forthcoming election in the first quarter of 2011,  but important policy differences between the two parties exist, namely  on how to achieve the agreed fiscal adjustments for 2011-14. the parties  in the new coalition will be more evenly matched in size than in the  current government, and decision-making may be more difficult. given the  brutal austerity measures that the government will have to implement  over the forecast period to achieve the fiscal targets negotiated with  the eu and imf, we expect social unrest to rise significantly in the  next few years.

high hopes: reform party flexes political muscle





   romania's national library is desperate  for books  -  nonetheless, the complete works of nicolae ceausescu are  headed for the pulping machine.    ""perhaps we'll keep one copy of each, somewhere," allowed angela  popescu bradiceni, director since 1955, with a slight sniff. ""after  all, we are a library."   the dictator's  numbing words were stacked in the window of every bookstore. at the  national library, they filled six long rows.    enthusiastic workmen have already carted off various translations of  ""on the way of building up the multilaterally developed socialist  society," all 32 volumes, 700 pages each.    had anyone ever checked out volume 26, for example, he would have  learned: ""the visit i have paid to somalia at the invitation of  president mohammed siad barre has yielded highly good results."   publicity packets   the pile included  leaflets of speeches, collected mental musings and 12-ounce publicity  packets to the glory of a man who traveled the world ceaselessly to  exchange fulsome toasts and pose for photos.    one collection had almost identical covers. at the left, there was  ceausescu with slicked down jet black hair and a debonair mien, a photo  from 1957. at the right, there was someone else: jimmy carter of the  united states, brezhnev of the soviet union, ethiopia's mengistu or  whichever leader he happened to be visiting.   but not all the purged books were his.   there was also ""research in the field of systems and characteristics of macromolecules" by his wife, elena.   ""no one ever read this stuff, no one," said virgil tiberiu spanu, director of acquisitions. ""never."   the couple were ousted from power last friday and were executed monday.  restricted access    for the librarians, destroying ceausescu's books was sweet revenge  for bibliophiles forced to hide away 10 percent of their collection  under lock and key.   ceausescu's strict  laws forbade anyone without a special permit to see books about  romanian politics since world war i, or works of anyone suspected to be  even a mild dissident. books by foreigner ""radicals," such as u.s.  economists, also were restricted.    romanian and foreign researchers had to apply to a cultural council that  decided whether to grant permission. applications were referred to the  secret police.   ""when you applied to  the council, a very secret, complex mechanism came into play," spanu  said. ""most people did not bother, assuming they would be denied or  afraid of calling attention to themselves."   mostly, books were not bought because the library had no foreign currency.  10 to 15 years behind    ""we were 10 to 15 years behind the world in scientific material,"  spanu said. the library's latest edition of the journal ""chemical  abstracts" is from 1972.   although the  nearby university library lost 500,000 volumes in fires caused by  fighting between ceausescu loyalists and revolutionaries this week, all  of the national library's 1.5 million books survived.    ""we were lucky because we have no building of our own, and our books  are in storage all over town," bradiceni said. the offices and reading  rooms are in the old stock exchange, never of much use in communist  romania.   now, bradiceni said, it is time to catch up.    ""romania needs books for the spirit," she said. she looked around at  at the shelves purged of ceausescu's works. ""now we have plenty of  room."

northampton county





the dominant issue in the county for much of 1989 was the county's  experimental integrated human services delivery system, which meant a  single  caseworker would be assigned to help with all of a person's  problems instead  of a different caseworker for each problem area. the  county has received  several critical inspections on children and youth  services during the  program's existence. the programs ran up a $1.5  million deficit this year,  part of the reason for the county's 4.9-mill  tax hike.

demis stewart, the architect of the experimental system, said last week  she would not seek reappointment as human services director and did not  want the  job any longer. reports indicated incoming county executive  gerald seyfried  did not have the necessary votes on county council to  confirm stewart even if she was nominated. seyfried also reportedly  decided not to keep stewart.

palmer township





long-time police chief nick divietro retired after 28 years on the job  amid reports his departure was prompted by allegations made by a police  informant  that divietro had furnished her with marijuana. divietro and  the township  supervisors vehemently denied the reports. reports then  surfaced that the  township police union had asked the supervisors not  to appoint divietro in  1990. the chief and the union have been at odds  since the union was formed in the early '80s.

the deadlock





   the deadlock over the easton area joint  sewer authority voting system and  budget threatened the future of  easton sewage treatment plant. although a  budget was finally approved,  the suburban municipalities of forks and palmer  townships, wilson and  west easton continue to object to a bloc vote system  that gives easton  control.   the sewer authority, the city  and and pfizer inc. were named in an lawsuit filed by the federal  environmental protection agency for violating federal  discharge limits,  and the $14 million upgrade of the sewer plant was  completed. the  renovations meant the release of some 500 building permits. the state  department of environmental resources had placed a moratorium on the   permits until the sewer plant discharge was up to state and federal  standards.    easton   the lack of a  permanent shelter for the city's homeless eventually led  easton  officials to offer the former raub supply building on bushkill drive to a  non-profit group called safe harbor easton. the homeless continue to be   housed in area churches until the building is renovated. early this  year,  tempers erupted over the homeless issue with homeless men setting  up tents in centre square after the city closed a church shelter  because of code  violations.   alvin l.  "skip" fairchild jr. was named easton's police chief in june.  the  18-year veteran succeeded william cunningham who resigned in march.   fairchild's advocacy of a physical fitness program for officers has  placed him at odds with the police union, which opposes sanctions for  those who fail to  make the grade.    easton started recycling this fall, and so far participation is far  greater than expected, forcing city officials to upgrade collection  schedules.
