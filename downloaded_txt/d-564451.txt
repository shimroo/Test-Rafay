bhc is a vibrant artistic community with over 200 artists and 40 new students each month. in our 55 year history, we have learned how to support our artists so they can focus on their art and not have to worry about all the other logistics. we offer private events, memberships, and beginner classes.



​here are some of the ways we support our artists and students:
