the great american think-off

now in its 28th year, the great american think-off is an exhibition of civil disagreement between powerful ideas being explored by every day people. designed to bring philosophy down from the ivory towers of academia and make it accessible for all, the contest has received national acclaim including coverage by c-span, the new york times, and the today show.
