mission statement​​

the ocua was founded for the purpose of protecting and preserving our 
	area's vital environment for current and future generations and by so doing 
	ensure a healthy ecology, a robust economy and a high quality of life for 
	our citizens. the skilled and dedicated men and women at ocua accomplish 
	this by effectively collecting and treating wastewater from our service 
	areas' thirty-three municipalities and then recycling a safe, clean water 
	back into the natural ecosystem. our philosophy is to never lose sight of 
	those we are committed to serve; residents, businesses, public institutions 
	and the millions of seasonal visitors to the many attractions located 
	throughout our service region. all of the plans, improvements and system 
	changes are made to ensure that we continue to meet or surpass all mandated 
	federal and state regulations and standards and to operate the authority at 
	as low a cost to our customers as possible. ​​​​​ october 2024 outfall pipeline repair notificationplease be advised that​ the authority has successfully completed outfall pipeline repairs.  please click here​ for further details. new jersey environmental infrastructure financing programusepa public awareness of srf assistance requirements:s 340372-58 aw1610 area wide interceptor rehabilitations 340372-59 aw1611 area wide clarifier rehabilitations 340372-60 sd1821 si-4
