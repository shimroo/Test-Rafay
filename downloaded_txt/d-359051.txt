customer comments
tommy in ohio:
thank you d&d for saving me so much money. i had to replace my ice maker and before i ordered it, i used their ice maker troubleshooting help and found out my ice maker was bad.
gary in ft. myers:
my water valve arrived in 2 days and i had ice that same day. easy to replace and saved a ton.
chad in georgia:
could not figure out what was wrong with my icemaker so i called d&d. their tech guy had me on point in 5 mins. when my icemaker arrived i installed it and it works great. you got my business.
frank in naples:
i saved about $50 by buying my ice machine pump from you. thanks for your help.
jim in texas:
searching around the net for an icemaker and your repair help page sure helped me figure out what was wrong with my refrigerator. i ended up needing the optics board and not the ice maker. thanks for your quality tech tips. you saved me a lot of aggravation, time and money with this repair.
gordon in maine:
my refrigerator parts did arrive quickly, installed and i have ice! thanks for diagnostic assistance on your web site and short phone conversations. oh, not to be forgotten is your helping keep total repair cost down! best wishes in your business.
