virtu software - educational and corporate software
virtu software specializes in web-based applications for corporations, schools, and non-profit organizations.  below you can find information about many of our products and services.
chordmaker
chordmaker is used worldwide by musicians in both churches and secular settings.  this unique software package takes all the guesswork out of creating chord-and-lyric sheets for use by guitarists and other musicians.  most musicians use a word processor to create music sheets; that's like using a sledgehammer to pound a finish nail!  click the link above to find out for yourself just how easy the job can be.  download the software and take it for a test-drive for 30 days before purchasing!
