mobilem


free download + in-app purchases, available for apple and android
emra's goal is to be there for you on every shift, and we're making it even easier with mobilem. this powerful app features all of our most high-yield on-shift guidance, including the vaunted emra antibiotic guide.
get free content, subscribe a la carte, or take advantage of the all-access pass, which unlocks all current and future content.
a couple of key points about mobilem:

the search is universal, to see guidance from all our various resources.
double-tapping a page creates a bookmark on that page, for faster access.
double-tapping the yellow "notes" section on a bookmark allows you to embed your own notes (eg, local antibiogram info or hospital-specific protocols).Â 
it updates continually without asking you to download a new version from the app store.Â 
it does not require internet connection at all times. it caches the latest version, and when you're connected to the internet and open it, then it simply swaps out new content without you needing to take any action.
