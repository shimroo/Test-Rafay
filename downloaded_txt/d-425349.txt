[...]tony and cathy storace
dear chris, hope all is well. am emailing you to let you know about kathy's accomplishments. we have had our house up for sale for the last 5years with many different realtors and have come up empty handed. kathy was the eventual seller of our home. she is very special in that she cares about the seller and gives comfort to the buyer. she has integrity, caring, hard working and is not interested in the commission, but rather making both parties happy. she is real, not phony as some realtors who are in it just [...]regards, sass khazzam. 27 ocean bluff drive
kathy made our dreams come true.  after a 10 minute conversation at the new seabury new member reception where i mentioned that we would really love to live on the bluff, she stayed in regular contact over the next year.  she found a seller....tee'd up the home  to us ... and closed the deal.  kathy single-handedly created this deal for us and for the sellers.   her local knowledge and her persistence prevailed.  kathy is a total pro and a true pleasure to do business with.mike and fran howley
