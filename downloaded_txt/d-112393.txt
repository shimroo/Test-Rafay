the billie eilish “96 facts” book is out now!for some time now, i’ve been writing a series of middle-grade celebrity biographies called the “96 facts” series for penguin random house. (this shouldn’t be news to you. i mean, come on, i just mentioned it in my previous blog post!)
anyway, the eighth book in that series – 96 facts about billie eilish – came out today. and as with all of the other “96 facts” books, 96 facts about billie eilish is illustrated by the amazing risa rodil.
here’s the official publisher description of 96 facts about billie eilish:
the ultimate fact book and journal for fans of billie eilish! packed with fun facts and quick quizzes about the superstar singer, as well as bonus pages for journaling, this is a must-have for any billie eilish fan.
you can buy a copy of the book here and here.
and to see all of the other books i’ve written for penguin random house, click here.
when you get a chance, you should also check out the “96 facts about…” page on my website, because that page is relatively new and people seem to like new things. from what i understand, anyway.
