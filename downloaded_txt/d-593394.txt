jean baudrillard - fatal strategies - p. 79





"the scene is in the order of the visible. but there is no longer a scene of the obscene; there is nothing but the dilation of the visibility of all things to the point of ecstasy. the obscene is the end of any scene. furthermore it is a bad omen, as its name indicates. for this hyper visibility of things is also the imminence of their end, the sign of the apocalypse."
