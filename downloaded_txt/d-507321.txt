also from t. jefferson parker!
the rescue 
is a gripping thriller that explores the strength of the human-animal bond and 
how far we will go to protect what we love by three-time edgar award winner and 
new york times bestselling author t. jefferson parker.

while reporting on a tijuana animal shelter, 
journalist bettina blazak falls in love with one of her storys subjects―an 
adorable mexican street dog who is being treated for a mysterious gunshot wound. 
bettina impulsively adopts the dog, who she names felix after the veterinarian 
who saved him.  bettina discovers that felix is a former dea drug-sniffing 
dog, and he has led a very colorful, dangerous, and profitable life!
as the big-wave contest draws closer, a huge, 
late fall swell is headed toward the pacific coastline. jen's fears gnaw at her 
― fear for herself, for her sons, for what this competition will mean for the 
rest of her life.
