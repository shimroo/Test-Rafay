1st day of 1st grade!





i have almost forgotten how to update a blog, but i think i can remember! i have a new goal to post more often.here are pics of mitchell on the first day of first grade! we had a rave review about his teacher, so i feel good about that. i think he will be so tired today after staying all day instead of half. he will be eating lunch in the lunch line! wow! and, he will ride the bus home!  of course he chose to wear his newest starwars shirt(of about7).  he wanted to do a silly pose too!  we said a little prayer for the first day after we took pics .  i tried my hardest to keep my voice from cracking!    getting silly waiting in line.  the drop off line was terribly long!  we got there at 8:20 and dropped off at 8:45.  school started at 8:35!  ah the last wave!  have a great day!  see ya at 3:30!

spring break





here is what we did on days one and two of spring break. we don't have anything else interesting planned so this is probably all the action photos!day one : park and pond  day two : zoo!    as you can see megan has become quite adventurous!  she really likes climbing and slides and today went down a spiral slide by herself!  at the park she wanted to ride on the merry-go-round by herself and walk across it while it was spinning, but that is where mom drew the line.  she screamed when i made her sit in my lap, so we had to get off!

the boys were playing in the yard and mark did a flip in the swing and hit his head.  then he said to neil, "daddy will you go get my bike helmet so don't hurt my head when i flip?"  smart kid!  or pretty soon gonna be not so smart from all the head trauma!  here are the pics!
