building community through poetry
the portsmouth poet laureate program is dedicated to building community through poetry by appointing and supporting an outstanding local poet as poet laureate for the city, sponsoring events that feature area poets and authors from outside the new hampshire seacoast, and encouraging a love of poetry among people of all ages.
