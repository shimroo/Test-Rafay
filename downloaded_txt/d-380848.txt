[-] welcome



welcome 
        to javascript-fx. here you will find javascripts that have been developed 
        using object oriented (oo) methods as opposed to the more normal "procedural" 
        javascript. for this reason you can have multiple versions of the same 
        script on one page and you can easily combine any of the scripts. for 
        quick access follow this link to the javascripts.

		to all the people trying to buy jsfx.com as an investment/trading opportunity, please
                note that this site is registered under javascript-fx.com javascriptfx.com and jsfx.com 
		for short. i have no intention of selling the domain name.
	  





[-] site news - (oct 3 2003)



as you 
        may have noticed this site has not been updated in a while. there are 
        3 very good reasons for this...


        1) i have a new job and am having to learn tons of new stuff which takes 
        up loads of my time (and brain power, not much left these days).
        2) i wasted time trying to change the style of the site and created a 
        ton of new pages that were xhtml transition compliant (well almost, i 
        needed it to work in ns4).
        3) i was spending a lot of time creating pages on how to install, modify, 
        customize scripts. i was wondering if there were a way to 
            a) easily install a script (just cut'n'paste 1 
        block of text).
            b) install multiple copies of the script by just 
        cutting and pasting the exact same block of text into another place on 
        your web page.
            c) install multiple different scripts without 
        conflict.
well, i have come up with a solution. it will make scripts even easier 
        to install and configure. it is harder for the programmer to produce this 
        kind of script but it makes it much easier for the user to install the 
        script. i am now working on converting some of the more useful scripts 
        from this site to this new technique and that too is eating up my time. 
        however, it is kind of neat to open up your webpage in a text editor and 
        cut'n'paste a single block of text and see an exact duplicate of the script 
        appear with no errors and no conflicts. it's like copying the html for 
        an image and seeing another copy of the image appear. no need to change 
        variable names or create 'objects' with different names or put "this 
        in the head, this in the body, this in the 'onload' command".
having said all that, i was browsing the web and came across some fading 
        routines and realized that the imagefader 
        script (in the navigation section) 
        could be adapted to fade any kind of html element. it is still in 
        development but may be worth a look (demo1, 
        demo2).

it is 
        difficult to find time to update the site but here is a useless little 
        script that some may find amusing (for a short while). mouse attack: demo1 
        : demo2.
      here is a script that you may find more usefull. it is a copy of the linkfader 
      script used on this page but modified to allow only links of a selected 
      class to be faded. check out these demo's : demo1 
      ; demo2 : demo3.

      the reason for no site updates recently is that the site is undergoing a complete overhaul. 
      the redesign is taking way too long so i had to 
      post this script before july 4th came and went.
      it is actually a collection of scripts to provide different fireworks effects
      in a web page. check it out.

the 
        new "squidies" 
        mouse trailer script has been completed and added to the mouse 
        trailer script section. the download 
        and install instructions have 
        been added there as well. i have also added some simple 
        install instructions for the script as i have submitted it to some 
        javascript sites and have learned by experience that new visitors to this 
        site cannot be bothered to read the help links and tutorials and want 
        a "quick fix" install.
i have also been working (in development) 
        on some new text color changing scripts. one (spancycle) 
        just cycles the color of a <span> of text. the others (demo1, 
        demo2) cycle the 
        colors of certain links. the scripts can be used to draw attention to 
        certain parts of the web page without using the annoying <blink> 
        tag. 






[-] site news - (march 06 2003) - *** warning ***



the 
        demo.zip file of trans rollovers 
        had the wrong version of jsfx_transrollovers.js included in the archive. 
        this causes a copyright banner to be displayed and a javascript error 
        to occur in ie5. if you have used trans rollovers on your site please 
        download the latest version 
        and use the new jsfx_transrollover.js file from it.






[-] site news - (march 06 2003)



i am 
        close to posting the new squidie mouse trail script. i have created my 
        own images so i can provide a complete application (script + images) for 
        download. if you want an early preview (no install instructions) see this 
        demo. you can download 
        the demo and you should be able to install the script by following 
        the instructions of any other other mouse 
        trail scripts.
