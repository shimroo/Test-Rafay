customer testimonials

"the city of aitkin library recently expanded and renovated its original footprint.  buckstaff was the clear choice in providing additional tables and chairs.  the company perfectly matched wood, finish, and design of the original furniture, providing a contemporary update that blends perfect with the original furniture and shelving!â
mary beth woodrow, branch librarian | aitkin public library, minnesota


"in 1998, buckstaff redesigned the maple avenue library before i started working here.  their innovative design back then has withstood the test of time, as it is still aesthetically beautiful and fully functional. this past year, we started running out of room on our fiction book shelves.  i called for help in determining what we could do to increase shelf space for our fiction collection.  buckstaff quickly sized up the situation and came up with three affordable options to add more shelf space in that area.  we chose one of the options and could not be more pleased with the results.  the additional shelving matched our existing shelves in both form and stain color.  the quality of the workmanship was evident and the installation process was flawless.  i will continue to use buckstaf for all of my library design needs.â
brian latus, library media specialist | maple avenue elementary school, wisconsin


"recently, we ordered several tables to match up with older buckstaff furniture.  from the quality of the wood, right down to the finish, we canât tell any difference.â
diana lightfeldt, library facilities manager | university of california riverside, california
