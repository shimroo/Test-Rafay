what is vibrocise?
vibrocise reduces arthritis pain by combining the science of arthritis with the effective benefit of vibration exercise. the reduction in arthritis pain facilitates a resumption of normal activities.
the smovey is a vibration therapy tool using cutting edge technology from austria. it stimulates specific neurological pathways resulting in a reduction of arthritis pain for the vibrociser. this product also helps those suffering from chronic neurological disorders such as parkinson's disease by improving coordination and balance, and is safe and effective.

we have been training with our smovey rings for about one year and totally love them! i'm 55 years old and my arthritis pain in my hands has improved amazingly completely drug free! i haven't changed anything else than swinging the smovey rings for a few minutes every day. my friend to my right finally managed to lose 15 pounds! we would pay thousands of dollars to get our smoveys back if we would ever lose them!

i love my smovey rings! my family would never travel without our smoveys any more as we use them all the time to get rid of muscle stiffnesses and all kind of joint pains. i used to have terrible back pains after 5 pregnancies but my workouts and smovey treatments helped me amazingly to become completely pain free! i also love the sound they make and my kids want to play with them all the time!
