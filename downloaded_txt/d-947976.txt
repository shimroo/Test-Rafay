the founder and co-ceo of salesforce delivers an inspiring vision for the future of business â one in which everyone is empowered to change the world.
whatâs the secret to business growth and innovation and a purpose-driven career in a world thatâs becoming more complicated by the day? according to marc benioff, the answer is embracing a culture in which your values permeate everything you do.
in trailblazer, benioff gives readers a rare behind-the-scenes look at the inner workings of one of the world's most admired companies. he reveals how salesforceâs core values â trust, customer success, innovation, and equality â and commitment to giving back have become the company's greatest competitive advantage and the most powerful engine of its success.




no matter what business youâre in, benioff says, values are the bedrock of a resilient company culture that inspires all employees, at every level, to do the best work of their lives. along the way, he shares insights and best practices for anyone who wants to cultivate a company culture positioned to thrive in the face of the inevitable disruption ahead.
none of us in the business world can afford to sit on the sidelines and ignore whatâs going on outside the walls of our workplaces. in the future, profits and progress will no longer be sustainable unless they serve the greater good. whether you run a company, lead a small team, or have just draped an id badge around your neck for the first time, trailblazer reveals how anyone can become an agent of change.
