:(





im really missing talking to sir. :( i feel alone, uncertain, and lost. i hope things turn out okay so i can completely give myself over to him to control and own. i want to put all my energy in pleasing him and being formed to how he wants me to be. that is all i want to do

:(





i feel terrible for how i was getting upset and ansy with sir because he wouldnt respond to messages and then signed off of yahoo. i guess i would say i was getting mad or upset. then find out he had a family emergency which caused all of this. i feel bad :( im sorry sir.

well im on my 4th day of chastity. it sure is frustrating as i wear my pull ups. my clit strains as its almost fully erect and just the pressure of it against the cage is frustrating. i feel like i would cum, but never do. what an experience so far and im sure i have a long ways to go till im even allowed out of the cage, not to mention cum. i notice that my balls are slightly bigger than normal too *blush* something else that i really want to do is please sir by staying in chastity for as long as he wishes with no sexual pleasure at all. i wish i had the money to buy a full chastity belt so i would have no access to my clit- no touching or feeling it, no erections, not being able to see it too. i think eventually in the future i want one of those.

lately, i really have been longing for sir's total control over me.. over everything. i love his control, power, strictness. i love it and would love to experience more of it. :) i feel it would be good for me, and get me in order faster as well.

first post of many to come





this is my first post, not too entirely sure what i should express or talk about though.. so here we go!

firstly, last night i slept okay. since it was the first time in a long while that i wore my chastity device. i woke up in the middle of the night but wasnt in a lot of pain (luckily :) ). it was difficult to fall back asleep but i was able to maybe an hour later.

this morning i shaved my clit and its all smooth now- just like how a little girls privates should be. sir hasnt been online at all today, which has me down. i guess i will wait for him to sign on.
