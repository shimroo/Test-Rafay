     testimonials making an impact on individuals.      “our biggest concern was could we find enough food to handle this growing number of people seeking food and still maintain a safe distribution practice.  during the pandemic, capital roots would come with fresh fruits, vegetables, dairy products, meats and grains arriving in the nick of time to help resupply our pantry with much needed resources.”  kathy amen place food pantry     “the community garden was a real life saver this season as a safe place to go to get some fresh air and exercise, socialize outdoors with safe distancing, and generally relieve the stress and boredom of the pandemic. the community garden was particularly soothing, uplifting, and healing this year. the fresh vegetables were an added bonus.”  christine community gardener     “warmly greeted by young enterprising students as supported by able staff. just magnificent at every level—the products—the policy of opportunity and promoting healthy—and the personalities as senior staff has impacted upon youth such that they are proud and well informed.  it is a model that should be followed nationally in every urban area.”  michael urban farm stand shopper    join our mailing list! it only takes a minute.   sign up today    contact us we are here for you and any questions you may have!     please enable javascript in your browser to complete this form.name *firstlastemail *comment or message *messagesubmit
