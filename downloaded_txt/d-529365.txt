manufacturer of the















forklift



























custom mobile equipment, inc. was founded in 1993 by gary dick with the intention of designing and building material handling equipment. in our humble beginning, we rented office and manufacturing space from cutler repaving in lawrence, kansas. we quickly outgrew that facility and moved just down the road to baldwin city, where we currently reside.
















 the first machine created by custom mobile equipment was the 40/60 versa-lift. it was designed and built for jim taylor of taylor crane and rigging in coffeyville, kansas. shortly after delivery of the first machine in 1994, we introduced the 40/60 versa-lift to the market.
















after much success with the 40/60, custom mobile equipment introduced another model of versa-lift in 1998 called the 60/80. the 60/80 is built with many of the same features as the 40/60 but is capable of lifting loads weighing up to 80,000 pounds.
















the year 2000 brought another versa-lift model to keep up with demand and it is called the 25/35. the 25/35 is a more compact model with a maximum capacity of 35,000 pounds.  this machine was designed for machinery moving but also has components that will allow it to be used in other markets such as die handling and paper roll handling.
















the demand for handling heavier loads brought a bigger versa-lift to the market. the first 100/140 was designed and delivered to mayberry machinery movers in 2003. with the capability to lift 140,000 pounds, there is not much this machine canâ€™t lift. this allows machinery movers the option of using a forklift, instead of a gantry system, saving time and money.
















in 2017, we brought to market the 17/25. the need for a forklift with a small wheelbase and high lifting capability was evident. the extendable counterweight base, paired with the triple stage mast, was exactly what customers were looking for.
