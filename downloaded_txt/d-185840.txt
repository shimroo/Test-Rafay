about

					the pop vs soda page is a web-based project to plot the regional variations in the use of the terms "pop" and "soda" to describe carbonated soft drinks. you can help by filling out the survey!
				


the survey

					name and email address are optional. hometown and state/province are also optional, but strongly encouraged. however, a valid zip or postal code is critical, because our software uses a database of zip codes and their latitudes and longitudes to plot the data on the map.
				

					currently the project is limited to english-speaking north america. please stay tuned for an updated map which will include data for canada.
				

					thank you for your participation!
