an unexpected post, oh my!!



i know it's not july yet but i just had to say hi!i love the socks in my last post, i just had to share chuncho v.2aren't these just beyond cool? and you can really see the tocapas (animals)see?i figured this beautiful peruvian pattern deserved to be on some genuine peruvian feet so i knit a second pair for the p-man's favorite gal, my next door neighbor, giovana!i did love every stitch but i think i've had my fill of chunchos, at least for another couple of years but ya never know! here's another pose:these were super fun to knit and i highly recommend them to anyone, even colorwork newbies.....i never in my wildest dreams ever thought this florida girl would have a love affair with colorwork but again, ya never know!now a quick pic of my real love affair....happy knitting, see y'all um, someday :)

it's time for the fkd annual post!!



hi there!remember me, i used to blog a loooooong time ago :)things are pretty much ssdd here at casa de fluffyknitterdeb - still knitting, mostly socks, and still administering sock knitters anonymous over on ravelry and with over thirteen thousand members (we're the fourth largest group on ravelry!) it's like a full time job! i just thought i'd pop in and say hi because i do miss all my blog friends and i know y'all miss the handsomest kitty on the net! so once again, i bring you my friend tina's feet wearing her latest "christmas in february socks".the pattern is called chuncho and it's a super fun knit! as you may notice, i've discovered colorwork since we last visited! imagine, this florida girl can't get enough of that colorwork stuff - who woulda thought that would ever happen! here's an off the hoof pic:of course even if it's only once a year, a fkd post wouldn't be complete without a little kitty beefcake! the p-man has a birthday next week - he'll be 7 on july 10th, doesn't time fly! come on over to ska and say hello cause i miss y'all!see ya next july! :)

hi there, remember me?



gah! it's been so long since i blogged i don't even know how to use blogger anymore! :)so i'm still alive and kicking knitting but despite losing my blogging mojo i do still miss all my blog friends!ravelry keeps me really busy - the group i administer, sock knitters anonymous, is the third largest group on rav and has almost 11,000 members!! wowser!anyway since y'all have been staring at my friend tina's feet in her orange annetrelac socks for exactly a year, i figured it was time to at least show you her feet in a new pair of socks (direct from germany!)aren't they pretty?while i haven't been blogging, i have kept my sidebar with my yearly projects up to date so even if you aren't on ravelry (and why not????) you can still see what i've been knitting and of course my tutorials will always be around as long as blogger is.i can't promise i'll start blogging again but i'll try to stop in an say hi every now and then.....and of course this lil guy is as studly as ever! he's gonna be six next week, kinda hard to believe how time flies!come on over to ska and say hi now and then....see ya!!

socks on parade, part two!



two more socks for you my knitbloglandia buds!first up -christmas in february sockslast year during our entrelac challenge over at ska i knit thesemy partner in crime fellow mod bettina went so crazy for them that i promised to knit her a pair which i sent to germany for christmas in february!specs:pattern: annetrelac socksyarn: schaefer heather in the cranberry kiss colorway ( i ♥ ♥ ♥ this yarn!!)needles: us #1 (2.25mm) and us #0 (2.0mm) 32" addi turbo circs, magic loop methodit's a super easy pattern that looks much harder than it is! i used a little bit heavier yarn than the pattern suggested so i made a ton of mods - all deets on on my rav page (link above).bettina loved them and they are a perfect fit, see.....? (actual bettina feet, woo hoo!)and now for something completely different i give you....more socks!juicy mystery socksspecs:pattern: march mystery sock by kristi schueler of designedly kristi fameyarn: sereknity yarn and fiber sock options shimmer merino & bamboo in the seriously citrus colorway - again love!!!! (as an aside, i am completely enamored of bamboo blend sock yarn - it's so smooth and cool on the needles and the feet!)needles: us# 1 (2.25mm) hiya hiya 32" circs, magic loop method.this was a very interesting and fun mystery sock with a cool cast on/bind off. we started the sock on waste yarn and added a knitted on i-cord after the whole sock was completed! a new and interesting construction from one of my favorite designers and bloggers, but it still needs a name kristi!! :)thus ends this week's installment of "socks fkd has been too lazy too post". the parade continues next week :)but wait!!a certain handsome kitteh boy has a birthday this week!my p-man turns five next friday!! happy birthday baby boy!there isn't a sweeter lil chubler kitteh than you!see ya next week! :)
