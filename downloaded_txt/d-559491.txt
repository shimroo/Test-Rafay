 you can contact me at: esn@telus.neti have been absent from this website for quite sometime now. in truth, i haven't added anymore collectibles to my collection in the last year and a half. i am currently working as much as possible to save money for a trip to europe. i plan on going in september 2004 and tavelling for at least three months. i also hope to go to russia in my travels, so when i get back i may have some new content to add. so, until then i won't be adding any more material to my website, but feel free to email me at my new email address (above) as i check that regularly.
 
i have added a short essay that i wrote a year ago regarding the battle of kursk. i may be able to add some essays that i have on file occasionaly.
 
take care,
eric
