what makes it throughsara groves’ 14th album and first collection of original songs since floodplain (2015) is a reflection on events of the last several years. sara explains, “in kazuo ishiguro’s book the buried giant, a husband and wife are waking up to their own histories - the ways they have been wounded, and the ways they have hurt the other. the story inspired me to explore the role our memories play in forgiveness and reconciliation. what do we remember, what do we forget, and what do we memorialize? how can we move toward each other when we have different versions of what happened? we are imperfect witnesses to our own lives and histories, and in the end, it is really difficult to tell ourselves the truth.” working on both the interpersonal and communal level, the songs of what makes it through speak to the hard work of what it means to arrive at something like truth and reconciliation.

patreoni was recently getting physical therapy for a shoulder issue, and my pt asked, “do you mind me asking - how do you make a living when your music is streaming for free.” i appreciated the question, and said, “yes, imagine if the community at large decided that pt should be free for everyone (maybe a good idea), and they enacted that, but didn’t work out another means of compensation.” that is about what happened with the emergence of streaming platforms. streaming is not a bad idea, but in hindsight, the labels might have done a better job advocating for artists. everyone saw ‘exposure bucks’ as a viable exchange, and it took just a minute to realize that a person can’t buy groceries with exposure bucks. royalties are still a thing, but are a fraction of what they were on radio. touring and merchandise are also meaningful ways to make a living, but for some people (single moms, caregivers, etc), it is a hustle that can’t be meaningfully maintained. so. the arts have always required endowment, and now that process is more personalized than ever. we can’t possibly support everyone we stream, but we can pick a handful of artist that we want to come alongside of, and can make their music possible. my music is made under the umbrella of art house north, an art community center in st paul, mn that is interested in creative community for the common good. we are doing a lot of fun things in st paul, and beyond - book clubs, artist support groups (online and in-person), theater (via our partner bucket brigade), skapa counseling, music of course, and more. check it out, and consider joining us!
