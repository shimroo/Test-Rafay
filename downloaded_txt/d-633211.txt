created by the community, for the community ...  

 


the procession is rising!
30th anniversary ~ 1995-2025  
april 25th & april 26th 
luminary procession ~ friday ~ 8:30 pm 
procession of the species ~ saturday ~ 4:30 pm 
arts walk weekend ~ downtown olympia


the sun also rises....

  

we have an art studio!
 
yes! we are assured of yet another procession! we will be located at the olympia creative campus armory once more. and this time, we not only have all the bays of the armory downstairs, we also will have access to the entire annex building - end to end! - for large creations as well. 
 
even so, it's a new year. a renewed undertaking of effort and teamwork. a navigation of familiar terrain but of unknown climate. a venue to cherish equally as an aesthetic intersect of creative intellect and shared kindness. a balm of imagination, creation and sharing that invites resolution for the beauty of nature to reflect wholly within the world about us. 
 
and so, it is with the same uplifting vision and seasonal renewal of enthusiasm that we are all invited to create this year's 2025 procession! looking forward to seeing us all together once again! 



production crew 
 
studio set-up calendar

studio staging and load-in (from lott storage warehouse to armory) 
 february 13, thursday - noon to 4:00 pm 
 february 14, friday - noon to 4:00 pm 

 
notes: trucks, trailers and vans - along with gloves and muscles! this is a heavy lifting task replete with curses of "why do we have so much stuff and when are we going to get rid of it!" (next year for sure!) it is also a bummer because we cannot access the warehouse on a saturday, so there will be fewer of us at hand. 

armory studio staging set-up dates
 february 15, saturday - 10:00 to 4:00 pm 
 february 19, 20, 21, w-th-f - 3:00 to 8:00 pm 
 february 22, saturday - 10:00 to 4:00 pm 
 february 26, 27, 28, w-th-f - 3:00 to 8:00 pm 

 
notes: knee pads and gloves as we may be taping down a lot of tarps! 

special event: the studio is open! ~ saturday march 1st
 studio volunteer introductions & coffee meet-up - 9:00 to 10:00 am 
 studio volunteer orientation & operation guidelines - 10:00 to 11:00 am 
 art workshop presentations & planning sessions - noon to 6:00 pm 
 public art supply donation drop-off - noon to 6:00 pm 

 
notes: the public is welcome to listen-in and begin art projects. but the main emphasis is bringing crew volunteers up to speed with layout, art styles, greeting procedures, as well as fill-in the staffing calendar and coordinator positions, etc. this is a great day for classroom teachers, group leaders and would-be art instructors to attend! 

the studio is open to the public! ~ march studio hours
 saturdays - 10:00 to 6:00 pm 
 sundays - noon - 6:00 pm 
 wednesdays, thursdays, fridays - 3:00 to 8:00 pm 

 
notes: every saturday there will be a production crew meet-up and studio debrief between 9 and 10 am. coffee and pastries mostly provided and always encouraged! 

special event: official open house & dance fundraiser march 8th!
 studio volunteer & coffee meet-up - 9:00 to 10:00 am 
 studio open house - tours & workshops - 10:00 to 6:00 pm 
 public art supply donation drop-off - noon to 6:00 pm 
 dance fundraiser set-up - 2:00 to 7:00 pm 
 dance fundraiser event - 7:30 to 10:30 pm 

 
notes: this is its own production for set-up and decorating - and of course dancing. so even if you are not on the schedule for a studio shift, we will need your help from collecting tickets to putting on tablecloths.

beribboned with the resplendent rise of reflection ~ we truly revived the impassioned joy of a community in self-recognition! 
 
we literally made it! from luminary magic thru rain-twinged delight! for all involved in the production of this year's 2024 procession celebration, and especially for those crewing the procession art studio, may we too recognize, that the success of our invitation was a credit to both our presentation and facilitation. the art studio was alive with the gifts of mutual scheming, spontaneous sharing, dramatic creating, and the welcoming inclusivity of our community's participation. and all was reflected in the thousands of smiles along every block of the procession route. so very much for us all to be proud of.... all the way around! 
 
and now that we have cheered-on the reviews of photos and videos with grand conviviality, regaled our stories with friends and families, and wiped the glitter from our eyes, it is time to turn to the gallant task of storing all things away. and while this one last effort is the resultant task of not having a year-round procession art studio, its effort will hold, nevertheless, a vivid recollection of what is possible; of what could be next. 

congratulations to all! -eli
