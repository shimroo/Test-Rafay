we recognize the use of linguistic markings of the (modern) hawaiian language including the ʻokina [‘] or glottal stop and the kahakō [ō] or macron (e.g., in place names of hawaiʻi such as lānaʻi). we acknowledge that individual businesses listed on this site may not use the ʻokina or kahakō, but we recognize the importance of using these markings to preserve the indigenous language and culture of hawaiʻi and use them in all other forms of communications.
