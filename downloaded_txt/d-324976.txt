	 joy of sox    (never say never)
    


i have learned to never say never.....now we know that i'm not big on making intricate socks but when i got an email last summer accepting submissions for this book i decided to give it a go.  i was more intrigued by the concept of the book and it got my designer wheels turning. rarely does the call go out for sexy themed knits.  of course socks keeps it from getting too risque but it pushes the mind to be creative.  i came up with some "lace corset" socks.  i got my copy today but i don't think it will be in stores until october. if you're into socks, check it out.

	 i'm putting out a hit on top-down raglan sweaters
    


there.....i've said it!i've been holding out, trying to be nice but i've had enough!  this zimmerman thing has gotten out of hand. i've haven't had the time to follow hand-knits as much over the past 2 years but now that i've started paying attention again i'm thoroughly disappointed. top-down raglan knitting, like a virus, has taken over the hand-knits and it's ridiculous. don't get me wrong. every style has it's place but i'll be damned (excuse my potty mouth) if every sweater you make is suited to be a raglan. there are set-in, dolman, drop sleeves, etc. as a knitter if every sweater you make has raglan sleeves because you don't like making sleeves or sewing seams that is your preference because maybe you like every sweater you own to look the same or just like the act of knitting.  as a designer i take real issue.  if all you are doing is taking an elizabeth zimmerman recipe and throwing in a different stitch pattern.....well let me say it like this... it's like the difference between chefs and cooks.  and now we have whole publications chock full of top-down raglan-sleeved sweaters that in no way cater to people, like me, that don't want increase holes in my raglan line or better yet think raglans make me look like i have shoulders like a football player. if it's really raglan sleeves that you like then try designing a sweater where the raglan sleeves need to be sewn in. so from this day forward, tell your mothers, friends, sisters, brothers, and cousins.....i'm issuing a challenge and i'm putting out a hit out on top-down raglan sweaters.  i want to kill this trend before it gets any worse.

	 isabel toledo & the inauguration dress
    


yesterday,  tammi and i got a chance to go to the isabel toledo exhibit at the fit museum. the biggest draw to this exhibit is the chance to see the dress that michelle obama wore the day of the inauguration along with many dresses from her collection over the years.  when i saw mrs.o in the dress i was very impressed with it. the simplistic and elegant style appealed to me along with the non-traditional color choice and the way it seemed to shine.  getting the chance to see it up close and in museum lighting i must say that i wouldn't have thought it was the same dress. the museum lighting is meant to preserve and not fade the fabric but it doesn't show off what is one of the best aspects of the dress.  it is made of a yellow couture lace which is very matte in color. the genius of the dress is in the lining. the white wool lining not only provides warmth but it also what gave the dress it's sense of "shine" in the january sunlight. the rest of the exhibit was very interesting to see. you can view the online exhibition here.  mrs. toledo is the essence of a couture designer. she is driven by the art and the structure which translates to creative and expensive garment construction. much of her work is based on the concepts of origami in fabric.  if you get a chance to stop by the exhibit (which is free and on display until sept. 26th) you should try and see it.

	 what are you willing to spend?
    


so i've been pondering something i figured i'd come to internets for the opinions of the people.in these penny-pinching economic times, when it comes to fashion what are you willing to spend on clothing? how article of clothing are you willing to splurge on and what's your price limit?i designed a dress that i wore to a 4th of july cookout and received many complements.  i considered making a few and selling them online through etsy.  after calculating my costs and labor i'd have to charge over $100 for what is essentially a simple cotton dress?  i don't really shop the stores so are people still willing to spend that much for clothing these days?

	 where to go from here
    


howdy doo everybody!it's been ages since i've really blogged.  i am happy to say that i am a graduate of the fashion institute of technology with an associates degree in fashion design.  it's a goal that i'm am happy to have accomplished (even if the economy isn't being so kind to the fashion & entertainment industries at the moment)school was tough. a lot of time and hard work.  after it was all over i took a 4-week fashion-free break.  no fashion news or magazines. no sewing, no knitting.  i slept, i ate, i read books and i did a little travel.  it was time off that i needed to reflect and relax.now i'm back and i'm trying to decide where i am going to go from here with this blog.  i don't want to pick up where i left off.  i really want to try and incorporate the things i have learned and my life changes over the past two years.  everything is not decided yet but i know that i want to go forward with a more fashion-forward approach to this whole thing.  i want to focus on the fashion world, the design process, the details, etc.   i want to design a collection of knitwear as well as regular clothing.  i want to explore different techniques. and i want to use this space to keep track as well as share with whoever chooses to read.  i know i promised some patterns way back in january and i'm going to work on getting those out. i've got some new ideas going and i have a free knitting pattern in the works too.  i also plan to move this blog to a more permanent space in the internet world and redesign it.as a way to try a new technique and get myself re-acquainted with the simple joys of making something because "i choose to" and not because "i have to", i decide to try my hand at a crochet pattern.  i want to understand how this whole thing really works because i want to add crochet designs to my arsenal.this is the "walking after midnight" skirt from the book "amazing crochet lace" by doris chini used sonata cotton from elann and worked it up in about a week and a half.  i like the yarn and the pattern was pretty straight forward.  i've wanted to do this skirt ever since christie did it a few years ago.  i'm glad i did. i think crochet doesn't always translate into truly fashionable items but this skirt makes the cut.
