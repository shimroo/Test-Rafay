about



the sydney society of recorder players was formed in 1956 to promote the playing of the recorder, and to foster interest in the musical repertoire of the instrument from medieval to modern times.the society provides opportunities for recorder players throughout sydney and further afield to meet and play the recorder, both at our monthly meetings as well as in small groups. we also hold occasional one day workshops.there is a wide range of recorder competence and performance experience within the society. but whether you are a novice or an experienced amateur, we can accommodate you! membership is open to all.you can follow ssrp activities as well as other events in the recorder world on our facebook page.
