macos 10.5 leopard phones home, reveals little snitch 2





apple's mac os 10.5 leopard 'loginwindow' process phones home to lcs.mac.com on port 443 which is only revealed by running the new little snitch 2 security monitoring tool.read more | digg storyi find alex's story a bit prematurely accusatory toward apple, though he did seize a worthwhile opportunity for some healthy advocacy of little snitch. i just upgraded my license to 2.0, and it's well-worth the $13 :).it's good to track these types of issues, but there are a lot of processes on os x that'll communicate to other servers, even over ssl, including webdav client for idisk, mail.app for .mac mail over imap. it's just that loginwindow isn't a process you'd typically expect to connect to some mac.com host, which happens to be lcs.mac.com, so it's definitely worth raising an eyebrow.engadget mentions some "secure magic" of the "back to my mac" feature, allowing a mac linked to a .mac account to control another mac linked to the same .mac account:[...] on the back end of things, leopard includes "back to my mac," which keeps track of your home mac's ip address through various (and secure!) magicks [... read more ]apple has a page dedicated to the back to my mac feature. the requirements section is particularly interesting:requirements to use back to my maca .mac membership.two or more mac os x 10.5 leopard-based macs that are configured for use with the same .mac account.for screen sharing, a 128kbps or faster bi-directional network connection between the computers (file sharing may be usable with slower connections).an airport base station, or third-party internet router which supports upnp or nat-pmp.nat-pmp? interesting. wikipedia gives us some interesting information about nat-pmp, a protocol introduced by apple in june 2005: it essentially automates the process of port forwarding.included in the protocol is a method for retrieving the public ip address of a nat gateway, thus allowing a client to make this public ip address and port number known to peers that may wish to communicate with it.this may be wild speculation but could it be possible that loginwindow is sending public ip and ports information to .mac, to enable other macs linked to the same .mac account to connect?i don't find the mere fact that leopard is sending data over an encrypted connection to lcs.mac.com a security concern in and out of itself. and until a crafty developer manages to extract information out of the perpetrating process before it sends its data over the encrypted connection, i won't just assume this is a privacy concern.on the other hand, reading more about this "back to my mac" feature makes me nervous. a long time ago, i wrote a rant about layers of operating system security, touting the fact that os x had virtually no open ports on a default installation, dramatically reducing vectors of attack. making this "back to my mac" feature available on default leopard installations could, possibly, one day, present a vector of attack.let's hope apple's got their proverbial sh*t together, and if not, let's hope some crafty ethical hackers manage to find holes and get apple to plug them, before some zero-day exploit gets in the wild.

safari on windows: beyond the browser, apple's decoy into microsoft's world





on june 11th 2007, apple introduced a beta version of safari 3 for windows. safari is apple's flagship browser, built on-top of possibly the fastest web browser engine, webkit.as soon as it came out, i threw it at our dwr-driven css-rich/dom/script-intensive used cars search results-page and compared rendering/execution speeds with ie6 on the same windows xp machine. i counted 2+ seconds on ie6 vs 1+ seconds on safari. not bad for beta software, i thought, most especially software developed by apple for its competitor's operating system.the speed of apple's web browser on microsoft windows is a testament to the maturity and strength of webkit.that's all dandy, but here's the twist: safari 3 on windows is a decoy, something to stimulate pundit, media, and industry's attention, generate buzz, and throw them off the scent of the real story underneath. the real story here is webkit. itunes. quicktime: the makings of an enabling software platform, and safari and itunes being the manifestation of what underlying platforms such as webkit and quicktime can do.history just may prove me wrong, but i can't imagine safari-on-windows, in and out of itself, being part of apple's longer-term strategic product offerings. i don't picture them running ads on tv encouraging users to switch from internet explorer  to safari, in a world where so many windows users don't even know what their web browser is, and still consider it "that internet icon thingie in the start menu".on the mac, webkit enables far more than just "safari". it also enables a whole realm of useful mini-applications, called "widgets", running inside "dashboard". with theoretically little added engineering resources, apple could create great opportunities by developing a webkit-only equivalent of dashboard for windows.one of windows vista's "touted features" are "gadgets", microsoft's attempt at cloning frameworks such as apple's dashboard widgets, yahoo's konfabulator, which provide application development platforms that leverage web standards.why would this be  great opportunity for apple? bring more value to their developer community, and establish a budding footprint of mac developers releasing narrowly-focused applications simultaneously to mac and windows, thereby allowing them to multiply their audience by a factor of ... uhm ... a lot.while mac os x dashboard widgets have access to the full underlying cocoa apis to provide rich functionality, there already exists a vibrant ecosystem of great widgets built solely with web standards, simply leveraging webkit. a webkit-only version of dashboard would nicely cater to this community ... today."gadgets" on windows are a vista-only feature. it will take some time for vista to supplant xp. it will take some more time for windows developers to release great "gadgets" for vista.if a webkit-only version of dashboard was available for windows tomorrow, apple could release it to millions of pc users as part of one its routine itunes updates for windows. and many of these mini applications would be available to them, near-instantly.by doing this, apple would add value to its existing developer community, catch the attention of web developers who are on the fence as to where to start their development efforts for mac widgets vs vista gadgets, by giving them the opportunity to not have to choose.while leveraging web standards to build useful desktop applications on both platforms would be an encouraging development, the rabbit-hole may yet go even deeper.consider itunes and safari, two applications that look absolutely identical on both mac and pc. are we to believe both applications live in two radically different code bases? what if apple had internally developed an easier way to code applications for both mac and windows? what if xcode was to one day also produce windows binaries?could this hurt apple's competitive edge? i don't believe so, quite on the contrary. it comes down to providing even more value to their developer community, and help grow it by "reaching out to the other side". windows users looking to switch to mac don't make this decision based on specific pieces of 3rd-party software they'll be able to run on their shiny new mac. they'll switch because of the iapps, which apple doesn't have to release to windows and likely never will, and an overall more pleasant, secure, stable, fun computing experience.the way i see this unfold isn't thru the release of a windows binary of the cocoa framework. this would mean that to run mac apps, an additional framework would need to be loaded on a windows user's machine, much like .net. this would strike me as redundant.i don't either see xcode ported to windows. it'd be rather pointless as the key audience for this product would be mac developers looking to release their apps on windows, not windows developers who are primarily .net developers and already enjoy microsoft's awesome ide.instead, picture the ability for mac os x's xcode to load-up key windows apis, translate cocoa source-code into .net source code, and compile the whole thing into a binary to be tested ... in parallels ... or a windows box nearby :).

real-time 2k playback for film and hd content: frame thrower at siggraph





those of you working in the film industry, or any industry leveraging real-time playback of high-resolution imaging, ought to stop-by digital ordnance's booth at siggraph san diego. it should be fairly easy to find ... look for the tallest guy on the floor, manning the smallest booth, with the biggest crowd of on-lookers.while i won't make it this year, as beyond personal interests, this isn't technically "my industry", it's always nice to see daryll show-off their network-attached real-time 2k playback system: the frame thrower. it's amazing to watch stock footage unfold on a big monitor while being able to use a simple jog shuttle to granularly control playback speed, zoom-in on any portion of the image, apply a rich selection of "on-the-fly" color corrections and effects ... during playback . i hear directors and editors eat this up.daryll's company has grown into a well-established player in the digital intermediate industry with a loyal and growing customer-base that swears by their products, shaking pre-established moguls at their core, as industry professionals realize they shouldn't have to fight their digital intermediate tools.
