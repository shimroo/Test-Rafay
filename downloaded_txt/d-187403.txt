loss of molly glynn and bernie yvon

one woe doth tread upon another's heel, so fast they follow...chicago stages became dimmer yesterday with the passing of molly glynn and bernie yvon. too soon we lost them, my thoughts and prayers are with their family and friends. a memorial trust for molly glynn has been set up to help with her final expenses and the education of her sons chance and declan.labels: rest in peace

chicago pd will shoot here in chicago

 "chicago pd" - from the same people who make "chicago fire," [which has also been renewed for a second season] including producer dick wolf and creators derek haas and michael brandt - will be shot here in its entirety and have more in common with a show like "hill street blues" than the typical high-concept crime procedurals that have become predominant on network tv (from chicago tribune, thanks to gray talent group for letting me know). no word yet on who will be doing local casting, though both simon casting and paskal rudnicke casting locally cast some of the episodes of the first season of chicago fire. background casting of the first season of chicago fire was at least in part done by joan philo casting. labels: filming in chicago, trends

where to find auditions in chicago

last month i was asked where one finds auditions in chicago, and here is a partial list: 
waitingpatiently my chicago theatre/film email list. while is has become a much lower traffic list then it once was, it does occasionally get messages that are about auditions for paying acting jobs (i try not to have it post audition notices for unpaid gigs). performink once probably the largest audition listings in chicago, now seems inactive after stopping printing on paper in 2009, and changing owners in the last couple years. was almost comparable to the audition listings in backstage for new york and la listed auditions online and also had audition listings in paper edition agents actors usually get auditions for the highest paying acting jobs through their agent or manager sag-aftra has a list of agents on the screen actors guild's old site which i imagine they will eventually more to the sagaftra.org site talent managers association may be a resource to learn more about managers, and imdb pro is a way to look into who currently may be represented by whom actorsaccess while this may be more used in la and new york, it does list chicago and midwestern auditions if you get a showfax account, you can submit to as many auditions as you want without paying for each submission chicago reader lists auditions online and also available in paper edition years ago i found their audition listings sparse and often for community theatre friends and colleagues other actors, directors, producers and people you've worked with may also contact you for auditions, though this may not happen immediately, or at all there are other place to find auditions, but this is a start. remember in all cases to look out for yourself and do due diligence on the organizations and people you will be auditioning for or working with; caveat actor. break a leg!labels: auditions, submissions

ad: psprint's chicago location

sponsored post: psprint asked me to get the word out about their new printing facility and option to pick-up prints locally at their des plaines location. i haven't used their services yet, but during may they were giving an additional 10% savings on all orders shipping from chicago. not sure if they are still offering that. they are offering, until june 30, 50% off postcard printing and may have competitive prices on posters. there are many place that can print your postcards and such, but not all allow you to pick it up in the chicagoland area, which probably saves shipping costs.labels: ad, money, services

chicago fire picked up by nbc

...the network has given a series order to the wolf-produced firefighter drama pilot chicago fire (from deadline). the show's pilot filmed in town earlier this spring, and will presumably continue to film here as the show progresses, meaning boatloads of revenue for the city, local film crews... (from a.v. club). no confirmation of who will be doing local casting of principal or background actors.labels: filming in chicago

ad: travelers haven

sponsored post: film and tv projects last longer than a few days, and so do stage plays. often the producer provides the housing, but if you're non-union, you may be on your own. sublets are complex and sometimes annoying, and you have to do all the leg work yourself. enter travelers haven, who asked me to write about their service. they just opened a chicago division. they describe it as giving "...property owners with vacant properties a chance to earn money while also giving travelers a chance to rent furnished housing instead of using hotels during their stays." so no living out of a suitcase in a hotel. you'd actually get a place that is like your own, but without that pesky need to buy furniture, linens, set up utilities or have a long term lease, mortgage, or other silliness. since they aim to serve both luxury and economy travelers, this may work for both higher end options (like the goodman) and for the non-union gig someone is coming into chicago for and wants to spend less than a hotel or sublet would cost. if i had a multi-week or multi-month gig in town, and were left to fend for myself for my long term housing, i'd look at this seriously. if you or someone you know is a project's producer and needs to put up various people in town for extended stays, this may make the accountant smile. not living out of a hotel room may actually put your people more at ease, and that often comes across the footlights and lenses. finally, if your living in chicago, and get a long term gig out of town, you don't need to turn into an ad hoc landlord. travelers haven can help you make some money on your place, and take care of the details so you don't have to. way better than vetting randoms off craigslist. on both sides, whether visiting chicago, or leaving chicago for a long time, this can mean less expensive long term accommodations for the visitor, and help fill the hole in your housing budget for the chicagoan traveling.labels: ad, money, services
