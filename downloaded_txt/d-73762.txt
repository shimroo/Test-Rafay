when should i see an orthodontist?
while any age is a good age to receive orthodontic treatment, the american association of orthodontists recommends that children receive an orthodontic evaluation by age seven. this allows your orthodontist to monitor growth patterns and correct problems sooner rather than later. it’s important to visit a trained orthodontist for your care. unlike a general dentist who offers braces, an orthodontist has received years of specialty education and training in tooth movement, growth and development, and bite function. as an orthodontic specialist, our doctors have the expertise you deserve.

"i loved the people. the orthodontists, receptionists, and nurses all were very personable. they made the long wait easier and enjoyable. i always thought braces would be a pain, but brace place made it an experience i’ll never forget." — s. dabbara


"for two years, the experience at brace place for me has been a positive one.  the doctors and staff have been very attentive and caring to my needs. i am pleased with the work so far and would definitely recommend brace place to others." — j. clark


"as a patient, i had an excellent experience at brace place. you worked until my adult teeth were perfect. i was always impressed by the staff and doctors' professionalism. now that my children are patients, i have complete confidence that their orthodontics will be done correctly. your office is comfortable, the staff is great and i’d recommend you to anybody." — e. callery-colhoun (patient and mother of two patients)
