        rita litton    acting teacher • coach

“the most rewarding aspect of my job is creating an atmosphere where actors feel free to ‘play’. as an actress i worked with many professional directors through the years. the ones i enjoyed the most, or wanted to work with again, were those that inspired me to take risks,and who gave me freedom to explore. i ask a great deal from my students, so i am thrilled when they rise to the challenge and do something unexpected or brave. that exhilaration, that sense of adrenaline pumping, when the work takes flight…that is any director/teacher’s goal.” 
rita litton (from the book “the actor’s other career book” by lisa mulcahy.)
