                                mary jo salter's 2024 volume fizzes with the potential of debut poets, the sprezzatura of journeyman accomplishment, and the depth of old masters. intriguingly, salter singles out a number of longer poems for inclusion, i think putting her finger on a recent trend. as the series initially intended, we get a generous survey of what is happening in american poetry today, and a sense of whence (journals) and by whom (poets) the best work is coming. unlike some prominent american poetry magazines, we also have a sense of the editor's (salter's) idiosyncratic taste and aesthetic, which is wide ranging, but focused on craft rather than, say, identity or political orthodoxy.
