					explorations in a city of firsts
				









as one of america's oldest cities, boston can proudly claim many "firsts." the first public park, boston common, is across from the massachusetts state house in the beacon hill neighborhood. the boston public library, founded in 1852, is the first extensive free municipal library. the first subway system in america opened in downtown boston in 1897. and the first lighthouse in america was established in boston harbor on little brewster island in 1716. we boast the first telephone call, the first public school, the first computer, and many, many more!
boston, and the surrounding area, are also home to many great inventions. the disposable razor was patented in 1901 by king c. gillette. the 54th massachusetts was the first unit in the union army made up of free black soldiers in the civil war. and the original toll house chocolate chip cookie was invented in nearby whitman, ma, by ruth wakefield.
