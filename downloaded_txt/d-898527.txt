praise for the doc ford novels















“[randy] a text cannot do justice to what i have to say. your best book ever? how about one of the best thrillers ever? you owe me a week’s worth of sleep; when i put it down at night i was wired from reading it.”joe soucheray | garage logic podcast host











“the pace of this thriller moves as fast as the hurricane that hits florida, forcing the great doc ford to protect his family even while dealing with a group of mobsters as bad as the storm. it’s randy wayne white’s best.”mike lupica | author of “robert b. parker’s broken trust” and “12 months to live," with james patterson











“explosive!  stunning depictions of hurricane prep and the aftermath in a nonstop thriller. both longtime fans and new readers should revel in this.”connie fletcher | booklist











“who could better weave the convergence of a 500-year tropical hurricane and the high voltage evil of a deviant crime syndicate than randy wayne white. ‘one deadly eye’ hits more powerfully and reads faster than ian.  if you weren’t on or near the sw florida barrier islands around the end of september 2022, now’s your chance…"porter goss | former director, c.i.a.











“anyone who insists mysteries can’t also be ‘real literature’ should be duct-taped to a chair and handed a novel by randy wayne white.”washington times











“packed with finely drawn characters, relevant social issues, superb plotting and an effortless writing style. white has produced a virtually perfect piece of work.”denver post











“white is willing to take risks, which is why he is one of the few best-selling authors today worthy of the title ‘writer.’”fort worth star-telegram

enter the doc ford worldjust as randy’s novels are inspired by these islands, his days on the water, and the people he came to know, the doc ford themed sports bars and cuba expeditions were inspired by the marine biologist who is the main character of those novels.doc ford is the baseball-loving, tropical adventurer who - not so surprisingly - has spent a lot of time in the same far flung countries that randy wrote about when he was a monthly columnist — places such as cuba, cambodia, south africa, australia, vietnam, borneo, and all over south and central america. it was while traveling for outside and other magazines he came to know and love the superb cuisine and landscapes of the rural tropics.

exhibit featurethe museum of the everglades' special exhibit, randy wayne white’s everglades – writing the real florida, explores the world that has inspired the bestselling author’s stories. before his writing career took off, white spent 13 years as a fishing guide in tarpon bay, running over 3,000 charters from fort myers to flamingo. when government regulations ended his livelihood, he turned to writing and created doc ford, a marine biologist and former national security agent who brings florida’s history, adventure, and intrigue to life. now, 27 books later, the everglades remain central to his stories, capturing the unique people and landscapes that define “old florida.” this exhibit celebrates those connections—experience the real florida before it closes on may 3rd!
