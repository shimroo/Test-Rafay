bipbop.
this is insufferable music nerdery, but i have to ask.  does this:
now i'm falling asleep
and she's calling a cab
while he's having a smoke
and she's taking a drag
now they're going to bed
and my stomach is sick
sound kinda like this:
yeah i lay down a while
and i look at my hotel wall
and i'm phoning a cab
'cause my stomach feels small
there's a taste in my mouth
and it's no taste at all
to anyone else?  i guess there are only so many song lyrics you can write about "so and so is getting on so and so instead of on me" before they start to sound similar.  but i could totally see the killers being david bowie fans -- it's in the gospel-chorus backing vocals.  i'm just as glad they didn't try to include the part about the bipperty-bopperty hat, though.  i mean, bipperty-bopperty?  hello, 1970?  your slang called; it wants a ride back home.

motherfuck.
9:30 friday night, just settling down in bed to watch good night and good luck in my underwear... and it occurs to me that i think i left my foot heater on at work.  
you know, the foot heater i'm not supposed to have?  the kind of old funky one that i don't trust to have any kind of auto-off function?
the one i really, really should not trust not to burn down my office overnight?  
option a: get out of bed, put pants on, take train downtown, walk to campus, let self into empty building, unplug heater, come all the way back.
option b: call campus security and ask them to turn it off, get in trouble for having foot heater which is strictly disallowed in case i, for instance, leave it on on a friday night after i've gone home.
option c: leave it until tomorrow and spend all night having nightmares about burning down the graduate school.

look out honey 'cause i'm using technology.
the technology i am using is called 2nd avenue records, and i have only just learned how to use it.  it took a tutorial.
see, most music stores that i have shopped in have worked something like: music is out lying around in some kind of order, and you poke around until you find what you want.  self-serve.  this generally suits me perfectly, because i have a pathological aversion to telling record store employees what i am looking for.  it doesn't seem to matter whether i'm looking for something impressively cool or something totally embarrassing; i don't want anyone to know what it is until i have it in my hand.  but 2nd avenue records doesn't give a damn about my neuroses, and, weirdly, i love them for it.
2nd avenue records is a glorious, wonderful, tiny independent music store that specializes in metal and hardcore but also has stuff that the not that hardcore populace wants to listen to.  it's a tiny, tiny retail space stacked to the rafters with cds and lps.  did i mention it's tiny?  i walked past yesterday and didn't believe it was a record store because it didn't take up half a block, and when i got inside i had a hard time figuring out where to step that wasn't taken up by various shit.  i checked my bag in and was trying to browse discreetly among the mess, when an aging punk dude who may well have been the proprietor pointed out helpfully that that wasn't going to work.  see, the lps are all out in big racks like in a normal store, but the cds are for some reason contained in a massive pile of boxes behind the counter.  you have to tell them, "dude i gotta get a copy of raw power," and they'll drag out a shoebox or vodka case or something that says stooges in sharpie on one side, and dump it on the counter in front of you and let you flip through it.  and the shoebox or vodka case or whatever contains wonders unknown that even the other, hugely massive, local independent record stores don't have, and many of them are used and cheap and after a few minutes of agonizing decision you hand over 20 bucks and walk out with two cds.  also, they're on your way home from work, which totally rules.
i'm in love with this whole business model.  it's so outrageously old-fashioned: you go to a shop which is run by people who know what the fuck they're talking about, and you tell them what it is that you want and they understand and help you find it in the most useful, i.e. cheap, way possible.  i love that this kind of knowledgeable, personal customer service exists only in the form of the scruffy, tattooed punk dudes at the tiny crappy crowded metal-and-hardcore record store.  it strikes me as the kind of thing that makes corporate image consultants -- the kind who write customer service scripts that tell you how many times to use the customer's name and which places to smile and how much tasteful jewelry is allowed at the front counter -- put their heads in their nicely-groomed hands and cry.
i also love that it allowed me to sit at my desk today, in the full carnival of the second day of the term with everybody confused and frantic, listening to iggy pop made very small inside my speakers but nonetheless screaming at the top of his lungs.  i can't begin to tell you how soothing it was.  it's much easier to smile politely at a lot of people with identical frustrating problems when you have a tiny, tinny helper telling them all that their collective pretty face is going to hell.  even if they can't quite hear it, i know.  i'm sorry, sir, what was that?  please excuse my associate; he's on drugs and has no social skills and is probably emotionally disturbed.  i'd be happy to help you get into your classes.
the fact that my shrieking audio assistant and i were both at our desk until 7 pm today makes it incredibly likely that i will need to go back to 2nd avenue records before the week is out.  it's only tuesday and this is a short album, but if i can find one more that's as good i think i can get through at least thursday.  maybe by friday i'll just walk into the shop and ask the helpful scruffy punk dude if he can come to work with me for a few minutes and scream at people in person.  i think that would keep requests for my help to a bare minimum for the next year at least.

gotta make way for the homo superior.
for shame, the oregonian.  for shame.
we have an article about a major step being taken by oregon colleges willing to try out non-gender-strict dorm assignments, and all we can fucking talk about is how now straight couples get to live together.  because, you know, the queer students have really had an unfair advantage up to now under strict gender-segregated dorm arrangements.  if you read to the end of the article someone actually fucking says so with a, haha, straight face.  thank god we've stopped discriminating against the heteros.
it's not that there's anything particularly wrong with straight couples living together in college dorms -- i mean, it's a stupid idea for a shit-ton of reasons, but it's an equally stupid idea for straight couples and queer couples.  so, sure, let 'em all give it a shot if they want to and they'll figure it out somehow.
no, my problem is that the article gives the barest mention to, oh, that tiny little aspect that has to do with making respectful and reasonable accommodations for students who are actually uncomfortable with or threatened by gender-segregated dorm arrangements.  honestly, who the fuck do they think pushed for gender-neutral dorms in the first place?  straight couples who couldn't bear to be separated?  i fucking doubt it.  a tiny handful of queer and trans kids who already spent their high school years fighting with their school administration over things like campus bathrooms?  probably.  how much metaphorical or literal balls does it take to move on to college and keep fighting about it?  lots.  how awesome is it that it's working?  awesome.  how much recognition is that getting?  crickets.  tumbleweeds.  bleached cattle skulls and far-off lonely cowboy harmonica.  none, is what i'm trying to say.
i've tried fighting automatically-gender-segregated living arrangements myself.  i've tried it on two occasions i can think of, and both times i was in a totally comfy and privileged position compared to, say, your hypothetical 18-year-old transgender kid whose automatically-assigned "same sex" roommate is going to freak out and reject him or her utterly.  me, i was just in it for my own comfort and the principle of the thing.  on one of the two occasions i fucked up the whole kingman room-bid process and royally pissed off the house manager and did eventually win, but on the other -- in ithaca, where my field-school director decided that male and female students would live in different houses -- i lost utterly.  for six weeks that happened to correspond with my androgynous gender-freakout phase and wearing baggy boy jeans and boxers and chest-flattening sportsbras at all times, i lived in the fucking metaphorical red tent surrounded by girly girls who wore makeup and jewelry even while doing fieldwork.  i'm pretty sure that they shared my conviction that if we had anything whatsoever in common it was sure as hell not related to gender.  then i imagine that instead of six weeks it's all year, and instead of being 25 i'm an impressionable college freshman, and gosh, this gender-inclusive dorm option is really going to be an enormous relief to some people.
so obviously that's why the headline needs to be "oregon colleges allow couples to be roommates."  for fuck's sake, the oregonian.  really.

plus two, carry the one, minus five, zap fraggle error redo from start.
i have a tendency to keep score, in my head, of the fair-to-unfair balance of my personal universe at any given time.  the scoresheet exists for one reason, and that is to help me justify doing or getting extravagant nice things for myself.  these things are usually somewhat out of proportion to the unfairnesses that they're intended to remedy: i have just stubbed my toe so terribly that i need a big stack of new books to read while i lie in bed waiting for it to heal.  i'm sad that it's cold out, so i need to eat this entire cake to make myself feel better.  a five-page paper?!  how dare they?  nothing but lots of stripey socks will make this okay!  you get the idea.
once in a while something like fiasco week will come along and tip the balance so far in one direction that it's not really possible to equalize, so i'll give up for a while and start keeping score again when things have settled back down.  that is not what happened this weekend.  what happened this weekend was that fair and unfair succeeded each other in such dizzying and contradictory oscillations that i've actually lost track.  
see, i spent friday being capital-g good.  it was the last day of spring break and i was here at work doing things which weren't technically my responsibility but which saved other people from various terrible fates.  i did paperwork for the faculty so that students' graduation wouldn't be held up.  i intervened between the graduate studies office and students who were about to lose their jobs over grading errors.  by the end of the day i deserved a damn halo, and what i got instead was looking in the mirror on the way home and discovering that one of my absolute favorite wood plugs had fallen out of my earlobe.  i scoured the building to no avail; it was gone.  to restore my faith in the justice of the universe, i bought myself a pair of beautiful swirly green glass ear danglies and went to my local music store to find some cheering music.  the fact that i couldn't find an acceptable copy of the album i absolutely had to have warranted the additional restorative measure of having an enormous pecan sticky bun for dinner and going home to watch movies.
this is where it got weird.  i found my missing plug in my bed, where it had fallen out the night before and i just hadn't noticed.  so, okay, all of my justification for the new jewelry and music -- and therefore the sticky bun dinner -- evaporated.  i spent the rest of the weekend being good; i even did my taxes like a responsible citizen even though my mid-year move made them, frankly, a bitch.  i thought that warranted trying another record store for the elusive album (hunky dory, if you were wondering), but 2nd avenue records was closed and i came home freezing and empty-handed.  at roughly this point my beloved sister called me for help with her bewilderingly fucked-up blog, and i did my technologically-limited best to help unfuck it.  when we hung up after some limited success, i hopped in the shower and in so doing dropped one of my new, beautiful, fragile glass ear swirlies on the nice hard bathroom floor.  
since it's monday morning, people keep asking me how my weekend was.  so far all i've really been able to do is give them confused looks and reach for a pencil and paper to try to calculate the answer.

degrees of separation between the revolution and me: three.
bet you didn't know there even were degrees of separation between the revolution and me.  not because the revolution and i are inseparable, but because you can't have degrees of separation when things are simply utterly unconnected.  me, i am a child of the corporate 80s and complacent 90s and if i am a revolutionary, well, then my mom's a revolutionary, and she's not.
still.
i just finished watching the excellent documentary the weather underground, about, yes, the weather underground.  it was quite good.  it blew my mind slightly: i grew up thinking of nearly everything that the 60s and 70s produced as out of touch, ineffectual, irrelevant, and ludicrous.  which is not to say that the weathermen may not have been out of touch or ineffectual -- that's somewhat beyond me to say -- but i don't now have the impression they were irrelevant or ludicrous.  [edit: if it looks like i have rearranged my adjectives, that is because, on careful consideration, i have.]  that they had clear and resolute ideas about what was going on around them, that they saw themselves not as an idealistic fluke but as simply the first to choose sides in an actual revolution that was actually supposed to happen, was to me a total shock.  that surprise right there, that's the 80s talking.  but this is not the point.
the point is that, in the credits of this excellent documentary, the film's creators thanked someone who just sent me a letter.

weather underground, organization
to
weather underground, documentary
to
vanessa renwick, filmmaker, oregon department of kick ass
to
my desk.  observe.

i periodically google "wear your fucking helmet" to see if anyone has started talking about my stickers yet, and in six months the internet has given me exactly one mention.  it popped up some time ago, and, with all the enthusiasm of a person who believes she's gotten her first mention of many instead of her first and only, i googled the commenter, tracked her to her awesomely-named independent filmmaking enterprise, and mailed her a sticker.  between then and now she replied, sending me a nice thank-you note on awesome stationery with a sticker of her own (i'm still deciding what to do with it).

there you go: my credentials neatly arranged in a single frame.  i'd say "let me show you my credentials" if i didn't think it sounded dirty.  and now, if you'll excuse me, this nearly-being-connected-to-the-revolution is exhausting; i need to eat a bagel and go to bed.

poor deluded creature.
i went out last night with my sister's delightful former housemate (dfh for short), who is in town for an obscure classics conference i couldn't possibly comprehend less.  we took a stroll through powell's and then i dragged him across the river for dinner at a place that has probably by now been scientifically proven to be the best restaurant in the world.  it's called nutshell, for the record, although if you ask my sister she will tell you it is called either nutsack or sasquatch.  no matter.  
the thing about nutshell is that it is a nice restaurant.  it's quite nice.  it's a lovely space with small attractive tables that have little candles on them, and i was there with someone whose company i find excruciatingly enjoyable.  the dfh's title is not an honorarium; he is just exactly as delightful a former housemate as one could hope to find.  he's also gay, which is at this point quite well-established and not that difficult to notice.  for instance, the story he was telling me about how he managed to re-break his boyfriend's foot in the bathtub was a dead giveaway.
about halfway through dinner i realized this: i was sitting across a small candlelit table from the dfh, demonstrating my tendency when in the presence of delightful people to lean forward and watch them raptly as they relate adorable stories of tragic mishaps.  oh, and the dfh is a nice southern boy with nice southern manners who politely refilled my water glass any number of times and invited me to try various parts of his meal.  i did so with gusto, because everything was fucking amazingly delicious.  so enthralled conversation, sharing of food, refilling of glasses and, indeed, the dfh delightfully paid for my dinner.  we looked like a perfectly plausible date if not for the fact that, you know, gay.  i imagined the waiters eyeing us and raising eyebrows.  that poor girl, they thought.  doesn't she know???  maybe she's just hoping, you know.  he seems like such a nice boy.
i'm sure the bathtub thing was just a, a, friendly misunderstanding, anyway.

new rule.
when my sister tells me to watch a movie, i run, i do not walk, to the video store and i watch it.  first she was right about hedwig, and now this?  after taking ten years to get around to seeing velvet goldmine, i am thanking god for giving us dvd so i can see it again without waiting for rewind.
katie, if you're hiding any other gorgeous, dysfunctional, glitteringly homoerotic rock-and-roll love stories up your sleeves, i'd like to know.  thanks.

missed connection: my somatic awareness and your municipal myth.
i can't describe to you the weirdness of the portland allergy cult.  actually, i can: you know how inglis, florida banned satan from its city limits?  portland has, by overwhelming popular agreement, banned rhinovirus.  there is no such thing as a cold here, as you will find if you make the mistake of saying aloud that you have one.  no, if you are unwell in the city of portland, by definition, whatever the evidence, what you have is allergies.
really? you might ask.  what if it started with a sore throat and overnight turned into acute sinus congestion that feels exactly like every single head cold i have ever had in the state of california?
your portland listener will nod sagely.  that's allergies.  that sore throat?  that's the allergies hitting.
it's about here that i start getting the narrowed dianna-does-not-think-much-of-your-listening-skills eyes.  now, look, i say (as i did today), i must propose an alternate explanation here.  because, see, i'm stressed about finals and i've been missing sleep this whole last week and i'm pretty sure my immune system is not up to snuff right now.
more sage nods ensue.  that's just when the allergies will hit you! says the interchangeable portlander.
i try again.  fine.  maybe?  whatever.  but that's also when viruses hit you.  as they generally have done in my experience.
at this point another person in hearing range chimed in to suggest that everyone develops allergies when they move to portland and that even though i may not know i have them yet, they're probably the problem.
if i'm recalling correctly through the fog of acute sinus symptoms that compose what, where i come from, we call a cold, i think my original listener at this point said something like, "you'll see.  it's allergies."  i was so floored that i actually let it go, because i couldn't begin to imagine how an entire city could become so resistant to the idea of a virus that it actually goes around telling people with confidence and assumed authority that there is just no way they are correct in their self-assessment of their illness.
i can't remember the point i was trying to make here, probably because my cold is making it hard for me to concentrate.  i mean, i'm actively working on listening to other people's suggestions and not necessarily taking my own assumptions as gospel truth quite as often as i'd like to, but there are some times when i simply must take a stand.  in my nearly 27 years on this earth i've interfaced with the common cold more times than anyone else i know except my equally sickly sister, and by god i know how it works.  i'm a damned snot expert by now.  questions?  just pick up the phone and call your local dianna.  or, at the bobent, diadda.

fun? fact brought to you by my damn nagpra paper, still, for fuck's sake.
while reading about the repatriation of some skeletons rudely removed from an alaska native village in the 1930s, i came across a quote from one douglas preston, former manager of the department of publications for the american museum of natural history.  i thought, hah, that's funny, he has the same name as the dude who wrote that totally egregious primitive-monster-as-modern-day-slasher novel relic.  how embarrassing for this guy that someone with his name is going around writing books about murderous monsters living in natural history museum exhibits.  what are the odds?
pretty good, apparently, as they're the same person.  (and one of his brothers is richard preston, who wrote that very serious and not at all sensationalized no no we are scientists here ebola book the hot zone.  what did their parents do to turn all of their kids into cheesy thriller writers?)
i simply cannot believe that mr. preston's former colleagues at the museum of natural history were anything but embarrassed when this book started showing up in the stores with its lurid gold letters and menacing claw cover.  it would be like finding your old women's studies professor's name all over one of those splashy romance novels with roses and billowing skirts if not actual heaving bosoms.  you'd have to buy the thing in the hopes that it would be better than it looked and might even redeem your colleague, but then you'd read it while cringing with one hand over your eyes and if you ever saw the author again it would just be awkward city.  
"i, uh, saw your book the other day..."  
"great! what'd you think?"  
"oh, it was really interesting."
"hey, i'm glad you think so!"
"yeah, the way you totally abandoned good taste and your academic credibility was absolutely fascinating.  gosh, look at the time, i'd better be going.  nice to see you!"
