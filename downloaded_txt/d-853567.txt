hometown alien 
by john washinsky  
illustrated by ruth sacharzewski
i have worked on 
this science-fiction novel for almost 20 years.  it's about a young
 boy growing up in a coal mining town in western pennsylvania and being 
messed with by aliens for their own purposes. he is the grandson of 
ukrainian immigrants and i 
incorporate many ukrainian traditions into the story.  i started 
writing it for my son so he would know what it was like during the 60's 
and 70's. things were much different back then.  it's a clean 
book, meant for young adults and beautifully illustrated by my late 
wife's god-daughter. i know many people in the ukrainian diaspora would 
relate to it and enjoy it. there are electronic formats and it is also 
on audible.  available on amazon. for more information, click on 
the book.
