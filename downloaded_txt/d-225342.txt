vitamin 
  b12 : what is it?

vitamin b12, also called cobalamin, is important 
  to good health. it helps maintain healthy nerve cells and red blood cells, and 
  is also needed to make dna, the genetic material in all cells (1-4). vitamin 
  b12 is bound to the protein in food. hydrochloric acid in the stomach releases 
  b12 from protein during digestion. once released, b12 combines with a substance 
  called intrinsic factor (if) before it is absorbed into the bloodstream.
what 
  foods provide vitamin b12? 


vitamin b12 is naturally found in animal foods 
  including fish, milk and milk products, eggs, meat, and poultry. fortified breakfast 
  cereals are an excellent source of vitamin b12 and a particularly valuable source 
  for vegetarians (5, 6, 7). the table of selected food sources of vitamin b12 
  suggests dietary sources of vitamin b12. 
what 
  is the recommended dietary allowance for vitamin b12 for adults?

the recommended dietary allowance (rda) is the 
  average daily dietary intake level that is sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements 
  of nearly all (97 to 98 percent) healthy individuals in each life-stage and 
  gender group (7). the 1998 rdas for vitamin b12 (in micrograms) for adults (7) 
  are: 


life-stage
 men
 women
 pregnancy
 lactation


ages 19+
2.4 mcg
2.4 mcg
 
 


all ages
 
 
2.6 mcg 
       
 2.8 mcg


 results 
      of two national surveys, the national health and nutrition examination survey 
      (nhanes iii-1988-91) (8) and the continuing survey of food intakes by individuals 
      (csfii 1994-96) (7) found that most adult men and women consume recommended 
      amounts of vitamin b12 (6-8).  


when 
  is a deficiency of vitamin b12 likely to occur? 

diets of most 
  adult americans provide recommended intakes of 
vitamin b12, but deficiency may 
  still occur as a result of an inability to absorb b12 from food. it can also 
  occur in individuals with dietary patterns that exclude animal or fortified 
  foods (9). as a general rule, most individuals who develop a vitamin b12 deficiency 
  have an underlying stomach or intestinal disorder that limits the absorption 
  of vitamin b12 (10). sometimes the only symptom of these intestinal disorders 
  is anemia resulting from b12 deficiency.
characteristic signs of 
  b12 deficiency include fatigue, weakness, nausea, constipation, flatulence (gas), 
  loss of appetite, and weight loss (1, 3, 11). deficiency also can lead to neurological 
  changes such as numbness and tingling in the hands and feet (7, 12). additional 
  symptoms of b12 deficiency are difficulty in maintaining balance, depression, 
  confusion, poor memory, and soreness of the mouth or tongue (13). some of these 
  symptoms can also result from a variety of medical conditions other than vitamin 
  b12 deficiency. it is important to have a physician evaluate these symptoms 
  so that appropriate medical care can be given. 


who 
  may need a vitamin b12 supplement to prevent a deficiency?


individuals 
  with pernicious anemia

pernicious anemia 
  is a form of anemia that occurs when there is an absence of intrinsic factor, 
  a substance normally present in the stomach. 
vitamin b12 binds with intrinsic 
  factor before it is absorbed and used by your body (7,14,15). an absence of 
  intrinsic factor prevents normal absorption of b12 and results in pernicious 
  anemia. 
anyone with pernicious anemia 
  usually needs intramuscular (im) injections (shots) of vitamin b12. it is very 
  important to remember that pernicious anemia is a chronic condition that should 
  be monitored by a physician. anyone with pernicious anemia has to take lifelong 
  supplemental vitamin b12.
individuals 
  with gastrointestinal disorders

individuals with 
  stomach and small intestinal disorders may not absorb enough 
vitamin b12 from 
  food to maintain healthy body stores (16). sprue and celiac disease are intestinal 
  disorders caused by intolerance to protein in wheat and wheat products. regional 
  enteritis, localized inflammation of the stomach or small intestine, also results 
  in generalized malabsorption of vitamin b12 (7). excess bacteria in the stomach 
  and small intestine also can decrease vitamin b12 absorption.  
 surgical procedures of 
  the gastrointestinal tract such as surgery to remove all or part of the stomach 
  often result in a loss of cells that secrete stomach acid and intrinsic factor 
  (7, 17, 18). surgical removal of the distal ileum, a section of the intestines, 
  also can result in the inability to absorb 
b12. anyone who has had either of 
  these surgeries usually requires lifelong supplemental b12 to prevent a deficiency.
older 
  adults 

vitamin b12 must be separated from protein in food before it can bind with 
  intrinsic factor and be absorbed by your body. bacterial overgrowth in the stomach 
  and/or atrophic gastritis, an inflammation of the stomach, contribute to vitamin 
  b12 deficiency in adults by limiting secretions of stomach acid needed to separate 
  vitamin b12 from protein in food (10, 20-24). adults 50 years of age and older 
  with these conditions are able to absorb the b12 in fortified foods and dietary 
  supplements. health care professionals may advise adults over the age of 50 
  to get their vitamin b12 from a dietary supplement or from foods fortified with 
  vitamin b12 because 10 to 30 percent of older people may be unable to absorb 
  vitamin b12 in food (7, 19).  
vegetarians

 vegetarians who do not eat meats, fish, eggs, milk or milk products, or 
  b12 fortified foods consume no vitamin b12 and are at high risk of developing 
  a deficiency of vitamin b12 (9, 25). when adults adopt a vegetarian diet, deficiency 
  symptoms can be slow to appear because it usually takes years to deplete normal 
  body stores of b12. however, severe symptoms of b12 deficiency, most often featuring 
  poor neurological development, can show up quickly in children and breast-fed 
  infants of women who follow a strict vegetarian diet (26). 
fortified cereals are one 
  of the few plant food sources of vitamin b12, and are an important dietary source 
  of b12 for vegetarians who consume no eggs, milk or milk products. vegetarian 
  adults who do not consume plant foods fortified with vitamin b12 need to consider 
  taking a b12-containing supplement. vegetarian mothers should consult with a 
  pediatrician regarding appropriate vitamin b12 supplementation for their infants 
  and children. 
caution: 
  folic acid may mask signs of vitamin b12 deficiency


folic acid can 
  correct the anemia that is caused by vitamin b12 deficiency. unfortunately, 
  folic acid will not correct the underlying b12 deficiency (1, 27, 28). permanent 
  nerve damage can occur if vitamin b12 deficiency is not treated. folic acid 
  intake from food and supplements should not exceed 1,000 micrograms (mcg) daily 
  because large amounts of folic acid can hide the damaging effects of vitamin 
  b12 deficiency (7). adults older than 50 years are advised to consult with their 
  physician about the advisability of taking folic acid without also taking a 
  vitamin b12 supplement. 
what 
  is the relationship between vitamin b12, homocysteine, and heart disease?

a deficiency of 
  vitamin b12, folate, or vitamin b6 may increase your blood level of homocysteine, 
  an amino acid normally found in your blood. there is evidence that an elevated 
  blood level of homocysteine is an independent risk factor for heart disease 
  and stroke (29-38). the evidence suggests that high levels of homocysteine may 
  damage coronary arteries (34) or make it easier for blood clotting cells called 
  platelets to clump together and form a clot. however, there is currently no 
  evidence available to suggest that lowering homocysteine level with vitamins 
  will actually reduce your risk of heart disease. clinical intervention trials 
  are needed to determine whether supplementation with vitamin b12, folic acid, 
  or vitamin b6 can help protect you against developing coronary heart disease. 
what 
  is the health risk of too much vitamin b12?


vitamin b12 has 
  a very low potential for toxicity. the institute of medicine states that "no 
  adverse effects have been associated with excess vitamin b12 intake from food 
  and supplements in healthy individuals (7)." the institute recommends that adults 
  over 50 years of age get most of their vitamin b12 from supplements or fortified 
  food because of the high incidence of impaired absorption of b12 from unfortified 
  foods in this population (7). 


selected 
  food sources of vitamin b12 
as the 2000 dietary 
  guidelines for americans state, "different foods contain different nutrients 
  and other healthful substances. no single food can supply all the nutrients 
  in the amounts you need" (39). as the following table indicates, vitamin b12 
  is found naturally in animal foods. it is also found in fortified foods such 
  as fortified breakfast cereals.
