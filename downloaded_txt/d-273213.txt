mexico is a magic
    country, it is a colorful fan for the visitors soul and for the

    mistery and an ancestral fascination and presents that point to an uncertain
    future. because of this, mexico is the adventure of those who leave any logic
    security to face the impossible, the dreaming world, the mysthics, to feed
    the world with its emotion and new life in constant colorful explotion and
    rhythm blends of a song and a cry that talk about a vital deep philosophy.
