it’s singular not plural! taking stock of the 1914 and 1915 cracker jack cards
if you’re like me, you might have grown up singing the line to the song incorrectly. it’s not “buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks” at all! not having a major league team in colorado until after i was done with college, i probably sang this at denver bears or denver zephyr games. it wasn’t until i watched the spectacular baseball documentary by ken burns that i realized it was singular, because i wasn’t really a fan of sweet treats growing up as a kid, and never really purchased any cracker jack for myself. i remember some of my friends showing me the little trinkets they got as prizes in their boxes of the caramel popcorn treat, but nothing that i saw really impressed me very much. of course, it wasn’t until much later that i became aware of the really good prizes that used to come in the boxes, way back in the day.

2020: the worst of times, the best of times!
sorry to get all “tale of two cities” on you there but it seems like a lifetime ago that the nba announced that rudy gobert had tested positive for covid-19 and some nba games would have to be cancelled. then in an instant, the entire nba was gone. and then the nhl. and there goes nascar, and the pga, and the kentucky derby. suddenly, the draftkings app was only good for wagering on russian table tennis in the moscow ligo pro, with fistfights breaking out between fans of alexandr serebrennikov and dmitry petrochenko. ok, that last part might not be accurate, but yeah, 2020 was a different kind of year. in retrospect though, it wasn’t all bad. no seriously, it wasn’t.

don"t take our word for it. take theirs!


over the past several years i have come to know mile high card company through numerous baseball card transactions. having dealt in the past with several other card dealers on a similar basis, i have found brian drent to be the most knowledgeable and fair of the bunch. brian has consistently exceeded my expectation in getting top dollar for the cards that i sell through his auctions or has been exceptionally fair in a head-to-head transaction. in my opinion, brian can"t be beat on his knowledge of the hobby and his ability to seek and find that rare card through his vast network of contacts. i highly recommend brian drent"s mile high card company. there is not more knowledgeable, fair and honest dealer out there.
- jamie saxton, houston tx


i have purchased baseball cards from brian drent even before he formed his mile high card company. with over ten years of transacting business with brian, i without hesitation, recommend to all my fellow collectors to buy, sell, or consign your cards and memorabilia to mile high card company.
- marshall fogel, denver co


mile high card company has it all: the greatest service, the highest integrity, the finest selection of cards and a professional staff you expect from a top notch company. brian drent is the most personable, knowledgeable and respectable dealer in the hobby. thank you for making these last five years the best of my collecting career.
- shane leonard, dallas tx


i have been buying, selling, trading and consigning sports cards to brian drent and mile high card company for over six years. brian runs his company with the highest level of integrity and their customer service is second to none. i would highly recommend mile high card company as a source to buy or sell high-grade vintage sports cards.
