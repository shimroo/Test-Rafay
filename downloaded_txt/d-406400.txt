enough already


a #1 new york times bestseller
beloved actress, food network personality, and new york times bestselling author valerie bertinelli reflects on life at sixty and beyond.
behind the curtain of her happy on-screen persona, valerie bertinelli's life has been no easy ride, especially when it comes to her own self-image and self-worth. she waged a war against herself for years, learning to equate her value to her appearance as a child star on one day at a time and punishing herself in order to fit into the unachievable hollywood mold. she struggled to make her marriage to eddie van halen -- the true love of her life -- work, despite all the rifts the rock-star lifestyle created between them. she then watched her son follow in his father's footsteps, right up onto the stage of van halen concerts, and begin his own music career. and like so many women, she cared for her parents as their health declined and saw the roles of parent and child reverse. through mourning the loss of her parents, discovering more about her family's past, and realizing how short life really is when she and her son lost eddie, valerie finally said, "enough already!" to a lifelong battle with the scale and found a new path forward to joy and connection. despite hardships and the pressures of the media industry to be something she's not, valerie is, at last, accepting herself: she knows who she is, has discovered her self-worth, and has learned how to prioritize her health and happiness over her weight. with an intimate look into her insecurities, heartbreaks, losses, triumphs, and revelations, enough already is the story of valerie's sometimes humorous, sometimes raw, but always honest journey to love herself and find joy in the everyday, in family, and in the food and memories we share.
"this thoughtful, bighearted book is sure to be a hit with bertinelli fans and those with an appetite for stories of hard-won self-acceptance. a warmly intimate memoir."
- kirkus reviews
Â 
"in a series of brutally frank essays, bertinelli looks back on the emotional struggles and triumphs of her life. by turns raw and inspiring, this contains a little bit of wisdom for everyone."

wired for love


"what the heck is my partner thinking?" is a common refrain in romantic relationships, and with good reason. every person is wired for love differently, with different habits, needs, and reactions to conflict. the good news is that most people's minds work in predictable ways and respond well to security, attachment, and rituals, making it possible to actually neurologically prime the brain for greater love and fewer conflicts.
wired for love is a complete insider's guide to understanding your partner's brain and enjoying a romantic relationship built on love and trust. synthesizing research findings on how and why love lasts drawn from neuroscience, attachment theory, and emotion regulation, this book presents ten guiding principles that can improve any relationship.
strengthen your relationship by:

creating and maintaining a safe couple bubbleâ
using morning and evening rituals to stay connected
learning to fight so that nobody loses
becoming the expert on what makes your partner feel loved

by learning to use simple gestures and words, readers can learn to put out emotional fires and help their partners feel more safe and secure. the no-fault view of conflict in this book encourages readers to move past a "warring brain" mentality and toward a more cooperative "loving brain" understanding of the relationship. this book is essential reading for couples and others interested in understanding the complex dynamics at work behind love and trust in intimate relationships.
while there's no doubt that love is an inexact science, if you can discover how you and your partner are wired differently, you can overcome your differences to create a lasting intimate connection.

what to read next
























the great awakening


in the great awakening: defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance, the most persecuted man on earth, alex jones, gives you the good news about the failing plans of the globalists to control humanity. the expression âget woke, go brokeâ has entered the common lexicon as weâve seen company after company invoke the false gods of diversity, equity, and inclusion to their financial demise. but this surface discussion masks a much darker truth. what we are witnessing is nothing less than the failed plans of social darwinists to capture free market capitalism and turn it toward their fascist aims of controlling and depopulating the globe. working with new york times bestselling author kent heckenlively, jones masterfully gives you the deeper discussion about such hot button topics as the truth behind the globalists plans for artificial intelligence (ai), the central bank digital currency, social credit scores, big tech tyranny, censorship, fifteen-minute cities, the unholy alliance between big business and big government, the military-intelligence-industrial complexâwhich is hell-bent on eternal warâand the all-out assault on free speech and the second amendment. the good news is that these plans are destined to fail, if we wake up to the anti-human future the globalists have planned for us. the globalists hate freedom, and what they hate the most is the greatest freedom document in human history, the united states constitution. jones does not shy away from the darker parts of american historyâthe way we have been systematically deceived by the intelligence agencies since their assassination of president john f. kennedyâbut he provides example after example of people who have broken free from the matrix of lies to tell the truth. the people the globalists fear the most are the members of their own systems of control, who wake up and then decide to act against the machine. the globalists believe theyâve planned for every possible contingency, but they hadnât counted on the conscience and love of truth, which lives in the souls of good people. st. augustine once wrote: âthe truth is like a lion; you donât have to defend it. let it loose; it will defend itself.â no figure in our modern times has roared louder against the enemies of freedom than alex jones. in the calm and dispassionate style that made his first book, the great reset: and the war for the world, such a smash hit, alex lays out the flaws in the plans of the globalists and how they seek to create a world in direct opposition to godâs plans for our glorious human future. but god consistently works his will in our world, even through imperfect individuals like donald trump, alex jones, or you. if you want to read one book this year to understand your world and help lead humanity to the next great human renaissance, you need to order this book today.
    










crossing the desert


usa today bestsellerpublishers weekly bestsellerpublisher marketplace bestsellerat the age of 16, he escaped persecution and made his way to america as a refugee. at 28, he secured a billion-dollar ipo. today, heâs redefining what it means to be an entrepreneur by building a new model of capitalism.in the summer of 1987, payam zamani fled iran. as a member of the bahaâi faith, he had already survived years of religious persecution at the hands of islamic fundamentalists. taking the only path available to him, he escaped to pakistan through the emptiness desert: a harrowing five-day trek through one of the hottest, driest, and most hostile regions on the planet.twelve years later, he and his brother set records when the company they founded hit a $1.2 billion valuation on wall street. he was richâon paper. but in the wake of yet another wall street meltdown, he learned the hard way that modern capitalism can be harmful to the human soul.in 2015, payam set the example he wanted to see by merging his business acumen with his spiritual beliefs and founding a new companyâone planet groupâthis time without letting wall street or the venture capital world dictate the terms. today, one planet group is proving that itâs not only possible but necessary to build strong businesses while taking care of our employees, customers, communities, and the planet.crossing the desert gives readers an intimate look at how the paths we choose, the values we embrace, and the systems we decide to participate in (or not) can make or break us, not only financially, but spiritually. payamâs story is a timely reminder that enduring and embracing lifeâs most difficult journeys can lead us to a brighter futureânot only for ourselves, but for the people around us, and even the world.
