orienteering cincinnati is a registered 501(c)3 not for profit charitable corporation and is a member of orienteering usa, dedicated to providing orienteering
       opportunities for education, recreation, and competition in the greater cincinnati area.
if you’re looking for a new adventure which mixes the great outdoors with a bit of a scavenger hunt, orienteering
      is the sport for you.  if you currently enjoy hiking, trail running, geocaching, adventure running, or just a leisurely walk in the park, we’d love for
      you to come out and join us at one of our events.  it's an activity that everyone in the family can enjoy, regardless of age or experience, and
      our local events range from only $10-$15!
