what we believe
w e believe in god; that which can be sensed but never grasped by the mind. we engage this sacred mystery both as the essential nature of our being and in relationship. we believe that god has been revealing and will continue to reveal the power of life in creation, healing, and relationships of love throughout history.
we believe the divine lives us, breathes us, thinks us, is us. we understand “sin” to be ignorance of our essential divine nature. we believe that jesus (yeshua) realized his true nature as the christ, child of god. as we move toward recognition of our true nature, we move toward the christ in ourselves.
we turn to the sacred texts of faith traditions, including the bible, allowing scripture to meet us and inspire us as it resonates with and challenges our own spirituality.
we believe in compassionate service to our community and the world and in deepening our inner connection with the divine as our guide for action.
we respect the power of the holy spirit, which works in each person differently. we believe there are many ways to understand, live, and worship within the christian tradition. we are nurturing a church community that welcomes individuals at any stage of their faith journey.










worship service
sunday: 10:00 am



worship services are held as “hybrid” services — in-person and online. our policy is to allow each individual to choose whether they wear a mask in the building. we ask that you be considerate of others by social distancing.
services are also offered virtually using zoom. you can join in the service by clicking on this zoom link.
child care: children are always welcome! worship services include a time for the “young at heart.”
here are steps we’ve taken to improve indoor air quality to help keep you safe in our building.
check out recordings of past sermons and worship services on our sermons page.
we ask for your grace as we move together through this uncharted territory where anxiety lurks, but where hope most assuredly lives.
all are welcome anytime, no matter who we are, what we offer, or where we gather.

 
calendar of events
church activities are held virtually, in person, or both.
if you have any questions, please contact the church office: (360) 598-4434.
suquamish community kitchen
free dine-in dinners are offered  on most wednesday evenings from 5:00 to 6:30 pm.
our intent is “to serve community with every meal,” and we welcome a diverse population, regardless of age, gender, gender identity, ethnic background, physical ability, economic status, religion, or any other factor.
any extra meals left at 6:30 pm are placed in the outdoor refrigerator the next day, where people can help themselves.
all of our cooking teams are volunteers. donations are welcome though never required. we are grateful to everyone involved for making this possible!
