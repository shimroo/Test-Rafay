program download
full package for new users:

these setup files include recent past seasons, but to get the 2010 and 2011 seasons you need to download them separately under the team library section below.

version 4.9.2 has been modified to work under windows 7. version 4.9.1 and older versions do not work well on windows 7.
sbs493-setup.exe - sbs 4.9.3 for windows (self-installing .exe 09/21/2012).
sbs492-setup.exe - sbs 4.9.2 for windows (self-installing .exe 05/08/2010).
sbs491-setup.exe - sbs 4.9.1 for windows (self-installing .exe 03/27/2009).


 

if you want to update sbs from a version older than 4.9.x, it is recommended that you download the full version. you

may wish to save your old baseball.cfg file for reference before your download.


if you want to update sbs from version 4.9.x, choose one of the options below:
1. if you want to include the 2009 teams along with the 2009 schedule:
upg-492-2009dat.exe - (05/08/2010)

2. if you do not want the 2009 season data included:
upg-492-no-dat.exe - (05/08/2010)


the upgrades above do not include a "stadium.txt" or a "baseball.cfg" because you may have done some

customizations on your existing files and we don't want to overwrite them. the included whatsnew.txt file contains

the updates to the stadium.txt and baseball.cfg that you may copy and paste into your current files.


see whatsnew.txt changes in version 4.9.2 etc.



other files that may be of interest:
sbsim36.zip - version 3.6 for dos (.zip version 3/19/2001).
vuangle.zip - (9/28/2002) crude utility to determine observer's location for background images
vuangle.txt - source code for vuangle

new text-to-speech feature

this is already included in the full download of 4.9.3. 

if you have 4.9.2 and want to upgrade for the audio,

download these two files and and stick them in your regular sbs folder:
sbs493.exe - sbs 4.9.3 text-to-speech
announcer.exe - program that "talks"

now make a shortcut to "sbs493.exe" and you're in business. (you want to run that instead of sbs492.exe).

you'll probably want to change the delay factor to "2" if you're running xp, which seems to work quite well.

on windows 7 you'll probably want to leave the delay factor at "3". it's not as smooth as xp. tweak as needed.

also, if your computer is under a heavy load, like from a busy virus scanner, results may not be good.

source code

some folks have expressed an interest in looking at my source code. 

i started writing this in fortran back in the early 1980's and then in quickbasic, microsoft basic and finally powerbasic.

stylistically, the code is a mess. however, it could be used in structured programming classes

as a good example of how not to construct a program. it also makes heavy use of "global" variables

which i will not bother to document. examine the code if you like, but i do not have time to answer any "how does this work" questions.
sbs491-public.txt - source code for sbs 4.9.1. powerbasic console compiler, console tools and graphics tools required.
sbs493-public.txt - source code for sbs 4.9.3. powerbasic console compiler, console tools and graphics tools required.
announcer-public.txt - source code for "announcer". powerbasic 9 for windows
