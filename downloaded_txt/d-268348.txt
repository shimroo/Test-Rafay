tips and information
recent trends in caregiving
recent trends in caregiving include family caregivers becoming younger, new tools to assist with caregiving, and more. agencies should stay aware of these shifts to provide optimal client service.


despite all of its challenges, most family caregivers find caring for loved ones satisfying. according to a forbes article published earlier this year, millennials were particularly likely to find caregiving fulfilling.





1. millennials are taking on more caregiving responsibilities


people typically think of family caregivers as middle-aged females with careers and children. yet as chronic diseases and improved treatments extend lifespans, younger generations have assumed greater caregiving responsibilities; according to genworth financial’s study on family caregiving responsibilities among under-fifty four year-olds more are taking on caregiving responsibilities than ever before, often for longer durations with limited resources at their disposal.


baby boomers remain the primary family caregivers, yet millennials are quickly catching up as major family caretakers. on average, millennials devote an average of 21 hours a week helping a loved one in need; more likely to work full-time jobs and devoting more of their income towards caregiving expenses than other caregiving groups.


at the same time, they often serve as primary caregivers to their parents while managing other familial obligations and managing careers and personal lives. furthermore, many millennials feel trapped by stereotypes of “lazy and selfish” individuals that inhibit confidence when it comes to addressing health concerns for loved ones or seeking resources – although more caregiver support networks like visiting angels have begun offering respite services so millennials can still provide care while managing themselves effectively.


2. the covid-19 public health emergency (phe) has created more permanent caregiving situations


family caregivers are entering the fold at an increasing pace, taking on greater responsibilities for elderly loved ones while needing support from home care agencies to find such help and retain these valuable employees.


some companies have implemented measures that make opening their own home care agency much more cost-effective, such as eliminating initial franchise costs for new owners and offering training and retention programs to ensure quality care to clients and long-term commitment to this profession.


an important trend is the rising diversity within families. according to aarp’s valuing the invaluable report, black/african american, hispanic/latino, asian american pacific islander and native hawaiian and alaska native family caregivers all possess unique experiences and needs when providing care to loved ones with specific care requirements. lgbtq family caregivers play an especially essential role because they often provide the most effective care to meet these specific requirements.


inflation and higher costs are increasing the stress on family caregivers. these expenses range from healthcare and housing costs, food supplies, and daily essentials such as toilet paper. therefore, it’s critical that we recognize their impact so we can implement changes to better support family caregivers.


3. companies are making more permanent workplace changes





as more caregivers shift away from traditional home care agency models, companies are adapting their workplace policies and benefits accordingly to better meet employee needs. many now provide flexible working hours, remote work options, redesigned leave policies and dedicated staff focused on meeting family caregivers’ unique challenges – such as on-call support services to help balance caring responsibilities with professional work responsibilities.


though many large employers already provide formal support for working caregivers, smaller businesses and organizations often struggle to offer comprehensive packages of assistance for working caregivers. some solutions involve writing flexible working arrangements or compassionate leave into terms and conditions while others use employee assistance programs or simply allow employees to repurpose existing leave entitlements (sick leave and annual leave) towards providing care to loved ones.


covid-19 phe has led several families to move their elderly relatives from nursing homes into their own homes, creating an increasing need for home care services and leading to an increase in family caregivers, typically millennials. many caregivers juggle multiple roles – often work and caregiving duties simultaneously – often leading them towards burnout, decreased productivity at work or health issues like sleep disruption, compromised immune systems or diet changes that lead to missed days at work.


4. there are fewer paid caregivers


people tend to think of caregivers as women – whether it’s their wife, adult daughter, granddaughter or another family member. yet men are increasingly taking on these responsibilities: northwestern university reports between 27%-33% of family caregivers are male caregivers.


changes to gender dynamics have had profound ramifications on the workplace. women who take time off for providing care experience slower wage growth and may miss out on promotions opportunities, according to an aarp study. furthermore, nearly half of family caregivers who experience financial repercussions due to caring for someone reported going into debt or depleting savings accounts as a result.


millennials have also changed the face of caregiving. unlike baby boomer caregivers, millennials have grown up as digital natives and are comfortable using technology for caregiving needs – including monitoring tools (app-controlled home cameras and door alarms), ridesharing apps to get to medical appointments quickly, online grocery shopping services, telemedicine systems and telehealth programs.


as it relates to supporting family and professional caregivers, there remains much work to do. first off, raising interest in long-term care industry careers by showing individuals what caregivers do. companies should also facilitate easier work-life balancing solutions when necessary.

what are the benefits of using cbd for caregivers





caregivers have reported several benefits of using cbd for individuals under their care. in the case of fragile x syndrome (fxs), a survey found that the majority of caregivers reported cbd hemp creams to be very or somewhat effective at improving symptoms such as anxiety, hypersensitivity, irritability, attention problems, aggression, and sleep disorders. additionally, caregivers of individuals with alzheimer’s disease found cbd to be effective in managing behavioral symptoms. furthermore, studies have indicated that cbd can reduce inflammation, alleviate pain, and aid in managing mental health and mood-related disorders, which are common concerns for caregivers. however, it’s important to note that some caregivers have expressed concerns about potential interactions between cbd and other medications. overall, the reported benefits of using cbd for caregivers include symptom relief, improved behavioral symptoms, and potential effects on conditions such as anxiety, pain, and inflammation.

when to call hospice for dementia
caregiving for someone living with dementia can be a complex challenge, yet knowing when it is necessary can be daunting. while no one knows exactly when hospice should be called should it become necessary is difficult, certain symptoms and signs suggest hospice is warranted.





hospice care involves a team of professionals dedicated to your loved one’s physical, emotional and spiritual comfort. a nurse or certified home health aide will visit regularly to address their health needs – bathing them, changing bed linens and alleviating any disease-related pain or discomfort. a social worker will assist with medical decision making while explaining available care options and supporting caregivers; finally a spiritual support counselor will explore spiritual concerns to help make sense of life changes, reconcile feelings of guilt or regret and discover sources of hope.


dementia patients must meet specific criteria in order to qualify for hospice. they must be unable to:



walk independently


dress themselves without help


bathe on their own;


have limited communicationabilities – usually only being able to speak short sentences or phrases


as well as having terminal illness with an anticipated life span of six months or less



if your loved one is showing symptoms of advanced dementia, it’s essential that they speak with their physician about end-of-life care options. families may feel reluctant to discuss hospice services due to fears it will mean abandoning them; however, hospice is designed to provide comfort and dignity for terminal illness patients, including dementia. furthermore, hospice can reduce hospitalizations costs as well as frequent doctor visits nearer death.


no matter the severity or moderateness of dementia in your loved one, they will require hospice care as their condition worsens. the first step should be finding a reputable hospice provider with nurses and aides trained specifically to work with individuals living with dementia – these staff members will likely spend most of their time with your loved one, helping your family through tough times together.


consideration should also be given to whether there are additional health conditions – called comorbidities – such as pneumonia, sepsis, severe weight loss and pressure ulcers (bedsores). being subject to such illnesses makes your loved one more likely to qualify for hospice care.

dealing with depression in elderly parents
many elderly parents suffer from depression. while this can be heartbreaking to witness, untreated depression is dangerous to your loved one and could worsen existing health conditions and increase the risk of suicide. depression also contributes to fatigue which hinders their daily tasks.





recognizing depression symptoms in an elderly parent is the first step toward helping them feel better. encourage your loved one to visit a primary care physician or mental health professional so that an accurate diagnosis and recommended treatments can be provided.


elderly adults can often resist seeking help for depression. it’s important to remain persistent when broaching the subject with them and explain why your concern exists. depression should not be seen as weakness and feelings of sadness, hopelessness and despair are normal when facing major life changes, loss or illness.


negative emotions often have a source, making it easy to diagnose your parent’s distress. for instance, if they complain of aches and pains or decline social invites due to medical conditions or loss of independence. on the other hand, preoccupation with death could indicate depression in their life.


depression can result from a number of different sources, including genetic risk factors, role changes or losses, grieving process difficulties and health conditions that compromise quality of life. furthermore, past depression acts as a strong predictor for future problems.


loneliness can also play a significant role in depression among aging parents. when family and friends live far away or when an aging loved one becomes frail or dependent, isolation can become crippling. one way to combat loneliness would be inviting your parent over for dinner or inviting them on an outing such as walking or yoga class with you; exercise has proven itself a powerful mood enhancer that may also improve sleep, an important contributory factor towards depression.


depression in elderly populations is a complex, often disabling disorder. but by recognizing its signs and symptoms, encouraging socialization, helping with daily tasks, encouraging physical activity, assuring medication compliance, recognizing warning signs of depression among seniors, getting a proper diagnosis/treatment plan in place, as well as seeking professional assistance when necessary, you can help your loved ones feel more hopeful and happier again.
