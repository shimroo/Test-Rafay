“attending women in government programs are one of the best uses of my time. there are many conferences we are invited to, as legislators, and women in government works hard to ensure useful, efficient, and productive programming that is also enjoyable and has plenty of networking. i come away from their programs having ideas i can adopt in my state, and help and support in getting those ideas implemented. they also strive to provide information in a bipartisan nature that are win-win’s for all.”idaho state representative julie yamamoto, women in government state director




“women in government and the amazing legislators who attend provide important opportunities for me and my colleagues in the biopharmaceutical industry to interact, help inform, provide resources and discuss policy issues with legislators before we may be testifying or in their offices on a particular bill. the agenda allows for additional socialization with external stakeholders in the healthcare and business community, something that’s invaluable when networking and knowing others is a priority. after more than 10 years in working with women in government, phrma appreciates our collaboration and work with the women legislators and great staff of the organization.”sharon lamberton, ms, rn, deputy vice president of state policy, phrma




“state government affairs council (sgac) is a proud partner with women in government in their support of the work of all women legislators. women in government provides a forum for civil discourse in a non-partisan environment. through valuable programming and collaboration with legislative peers and private sector experts, wig creates an environment where women legislators can learn, share ideas and create effective public policy.”beth loudy, executive director, state government affairs council (sgac)




“i’ve been participating in women in government since 2018 and what i love most about the organization is the legislative conferences, whether virtual or in-person. the information that we share and the topics that are covered are helpful to me as a legislator. i also value spending time with my legislative colleagues around the country and hearing what they’re doing in their states. i have also had the privilege of experiencing how the networking opportunities has built strong relationships across the aisle. women in government is a great opportunity to sharpen your skills and it’s made me become a better legislator.”georgia state representative kim schofield
