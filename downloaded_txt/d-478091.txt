the innovative novus b8fc is a high performance executive
stapler that incorporates the industry's only power on demand (pod) and requires
70% less effort to staple. just lift the top lever and experience the benefits
of stapling up to 50 sheets of paper from across your desk! it also features an
automatic bypass system which provides the convenience of using one size staple
for all your projects.
the b8fc is a versatile stapler capable of producing either a permanent flat
clinch, which bends and presses the staple legs flat to provide 30% more binder
storage, or a temporary pin. the temporary pinning mode allows you to easily
remove the staple from the back of the document. this eliminates the need for
paper clips or other temporary fasteners. each mode is easily attained by
rotating the circular anvil at the base of the stapler.
no more jammed fingers that often occur from spring activated, top loaders.
the novus pro b8fc is a front loading machine that is easily refilled by pushing
the orange button at the back of the stapler.
for optimal performance, we recommend using novus 24/6 super
and 24/8 super staples. these thicker gauge, precision formed staples will
ensure your pro stapler performs as designed
