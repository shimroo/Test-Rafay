the orchard golf & country club
the orchard is distinguished by two world-class championship courses, the arnold palmer course and the gary player course. both have hosted international and national competitions, (1995 johnnie walker classic, the 1996 world golf tour), and professional and amateur tournaments (the philippine amateur matchplay championships, philippine professional tour events, etc).
the club is noted for its untiring efforts to protect the environment and to promote junior golf. it actively supports golf course maintenance programs, a national handicapping system, and preserving wildlife sanctuaries.

two championship courses



palmer course
the name for palmer’s intensely loyal legions of fans – “arnie’s army” – originated at the 1958 masters. soldiers from a nearby army base attended, and nearly all supported palmer, many holding homemade signs to show their support. the name “arnie’s army” stuck.
palmer has a beverage named after him: the “arnold palmer,” of course. see arnold palmer drink for details.
