your path to a brighter future starts with citizens high school. 










a high school diploma is the key to unlocking a world of opportunities, but the traditional high school model doesn’t work for everyone. real people have jobs, families, and other responsibilities and challenges that make it difficult — or just plain impossible — to sit through classes for several hours a day.

						i am immensely proud of the diploma and transcript, which serve as a testament to the hard work, dedication, and countless hours of study i have invested over the years. they represent the knowledge and skills i have gained during my time at citizens high school, shaping me into the person i am today. i am truly grateful for the educational opportunities and experiences that the school has provided me.

						i wanted to find a place to learn more and be more comfortable to do my work, and my mom was helping me and she found citizens high school. when she told me about it i said, "it sounds great i want to" and so she enlisted me and i've really enjoyed it, so much and i've learned a lot more.

						i would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to each and every member of the administration, faculty, and staff for their unwavering commitment to excellence in education. the guidance, support, and encouragement i received from my teachers were instrumental in my academic success, and i am forever indebted to them for their dedication and passion.

						this was a new way of studying for me. it was really hard, because my english was not the best. at some point i thought that i could not make it. i felt i was slowly giving up or that i was losing my strength. when i was feeling like that god put my family, friends, and you guys to help me and gave me the boost that i needed. since then i said to myself “this is the road you have to go through if you want to get to the finish line and begin with your life”. so every day, even when i was not feeling my best, i tried a little bit, and step by step i was nearer to the goal. now i can say that i crossed the finish line and i’m in my way to begin with my life.
