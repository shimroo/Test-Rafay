orchid care tips




orchids don’t require bright light, and they can thrive in a variety of climates. mottled-leaf orchids, for example, prefer temperatures ranging from sixty to 65 degrees f at night and seventy to eighty degrees f during the day. green-leaf orchids prefer temperatures of 50 to 60 degrees f, and both need to be kept moist. you can feed orchids with a 30-10-10 water-soluble fertilizer. when the last flower has fallen, trim off the stem tip to encourage reblooming.
don’t cut off flower spikes
cutting off the top of a flower spike isn’t the best way to care for an orchid. it will cause the plant to conserve energy for a future bloom, and you’ll likely end up with a smaller flower spike next year. the best way to prune a flower spike is at the first node below the lowest bloom. this will encourage side shoots to develop. however, do not cut off more than one flower spike at a time.



don’t cut off roots
if you want to keep your orchids healthy, don’t cut off their roots! despite the fact that they’re a beautiful part of your garden, they can become damaged if you accidentally cut them. a good way to determine whether your orchids’ roots are healthy is to feel them. a healthy orchid root feels firm and supple. a dry orchid root feels mushy and brittle.
don’t mist
you’ve probably heard the phrase, “don’t mist your orchid” at one point or another. the reason is simple: orchids require a certain level of humidity in their environment. misting will damage these roots and encourage mold, mildew, and root rot. instead, use rainwater to mist your orchid. and don’t mist your potting media unless you’re sure it’s suitable for your orchid.
fertilize
the most reliable way to fertilize orchids is to use a complete inorganic fertilizer. these fertilizers are formulated for various purposes, such as stimulating the growth of the leaves and roots. some orchid fertilizers also promote flowering. whatever your purpose, an orchid fertilizer is an important part of orchid maintenance. using the right formula is essential for healthy orchid growth. follow these instructions to make fertilizing easy. you should always read the package instructions and follow them carefully.
don’t cut off leaf tips
species from colombia
don’t cut off leaf tips when caring fro your orchids. leaf tips can die off due to over-fertilization or improper water quality. potted orchids can become sunburned if the potting medium becomes too impure. to avoid this, flush the pot thoroughly and re-pot the orchid after fertilizing. cut off only damaged foliage and do not remove the entire leaf spike.
avoid overwatering
if you’re not sure whether you’re overwatering your orchid, you should start by inspecting the roots. if they’re black or brown, they’re most likely suffering from overwatering. additionally, you should check for drooping leaves or yellow spots on the leaves to determine whether your orchid is overwatered. these symptoms may be signs of a disease or lack of oxygen around the roots.

orchid types




there are many orchid types available to grow. these include cymbidium, phalaenopsis, vanda, and cattleya. learn more about them by reading this article. and while you’re at it, you can also browse some of the most popular flowering orchids on the market. this article will teach you about the differences between these four orchid types. so, now you’re ready to start growing orchids of your own!
cattleya
there are four basic cattleya orchid types, ranging from the southern pacific ocean to the andes mountains. the plant’s scientific name is cattleya, abbreviated c in trade journals. if you’re interested in learning more about the plants, you should begin with the basic information on the families of these orchids. then, you can learn more about each type’s features and how to identify them.

phalaenopsis
a lot of people can identify phalaenopsis, the moth orchid. however, not everyone can name the cattleya, or old corsage orchid. they all share a few distinct physical traits. for example, most orchids have three petals, or sepals, with one being specialized to be a labellum for pollination. this labellum is attached to the reproductive organ and can also be found on the old canes of certain orchids.

cymbidium
there are many different types of cymbidium orchids. they can be grown in the same conditions as their more famous cousins. some species require little to no care and some are available in abundance. these plants can be easily found and can be bought from an orchid nursery or other species collectors. some species can also be propagated by divisions, mericlones, or seedlings. you can get a good deal when you buy them directly from an orchid club or grower.

vanda
the vanda orchid genus, abbreviated v in the horticultural trade, comprises 87 species. these species are often cultivated for the market. the vanda and its allies are the most specifically adapted orchids. in fact, they are widely cultivated in both tropical and subtropical regions. listed below are a few of the vanda orchid types. learn more about this orchid genus below.

lady’s slipper
there are many things to look for in the name of a lady’s slipper orchid. this hardy plant is part of the cypripedium genus. it contains 58 species and is one of five genera that together make up the subfamily of lady’s slipper orchids. the name lady’s slipper is derived from the greek word “cypripiadion,” meaning’slipper’.

odontoglossum

the genus odontoglossum consists of approximately 100 species of orchids. the scientific name derives from the greek words glossa and odon, which refer to the calluses that form on the base of the lip. these calluses are present on both the female and male odontoglossia. the scientific name is often used to describe a specific orchid, but in actuality, this group of plants includes a much wider variety of species.

which orchid supplies should you purchase?




orchids can be infested with insects. in the event of insect infestation, you can use a chemical insecticide or organic method. another essential item is pruning snips, which allow you to control the look of your plant. with these snips, you can clip back errant leaves and sculpt the plant to perfection. the following tips will help you choose the right supplies for your orchids. but which orchid supplies should you purchase?
choosing the right potting mix

orchids require a different type of potting medium than other plants. the best mix is organic, containing several types of tree bark, moss, and charcoal. these materials provide orchids with important vitamins and minerals. the best orchid potting mix is also well-draining, allowing the roots to breathe easily. if you’re unsure about which mix to use, experiment and make sure your plants are happy!
choosing the right sphagnum moss
you can buy sphagnum moss from nurseries, but beware of the lower grade sphagnum moss. while it is sold as orchid moss, this type of moss does not have the same properties as better grades. those who choose this type of moss for their orchid plants will find that they require more watering and root rot, which are both bad for your orchid’s growth.
choosing the right fir bark
traditionally, fir bark was used for potting orchids. but these days, a more sustainable form of bark is available. known as power plus, this type of bark is used for repotting and potting orchids. it is a sustainable source of fir bark that doesn’t decompose or add salts to the mix. its unique wet/dry cycle is ideal for orchids, and it contains beneficial microorganisms that protect the plants from pathogens. however, it is more expensive than many other mixes.
choosing the right perlite
orchids thrive in the best growing medium, and perlite is an essential part of that mix. it increases the aeration of the soil and helps it retain moisture and nutrients. a quality perlite will also help you grow orchids in hydroponic systems, which are growing methods that can drastically alter soil chemistry. choosing the right perlite for orchid supplies is a critical part of growing orchids successfully.



choosing the right leca
choosing the right leca orchid supplies is essential for ensuring successful growth of your new plant. using old potting soil can cause problems for your new plants because they are not clean and can contain pests. it is also difficult to clean up potting soil with old pots, so choosing the right leca orchid supplies is essential to a successful transition to leca. if you have never tried leca before, then here are some helpful tips.
