notable testimonials















margaret cho
“it was very exciting to be featured in asianweek, mostly because it was the only publication of its kind at that time. i felt honored and elated to be acknowledged by my community, and i was thrilled by the alliteration! that seemed fitting for the era and even more starmaking! i am glad that the importance of diversity has now made it vital to look back at the ways we celebrated ourselves in the past and am overjoyed to have this in my scrapbook. it was certainly a life-changing event when it happened over a quarter of a century ago.”











kristi yamaguchi, olympic gold medalist 
“i always appreciated the dedicated news, sports, and lifestyle coverage by asianweek. it was the go-to media source, when you wanted to be in the know on anything asian.”kristi yamaguchi’s always dream foundation











maeley tom, political godmother for apia's
“during my 20 years in the state capitol, asianweek represented the legislature’s sole source of news about asian american issues, because it was the first asian american english-language paper. i was so honored to contribute to this paper as a monthly columnist for nine years. the fang family's publication made historic contributions chronicling some of the most interesting moments in the wakening of the social consciousness of asian americans during a period when the community was finding its voice.”











fiona ma, california state treasurer
“as a young asian american writer and cpa, i could not help but read every issue of asian week over three decades. i was inspired by the pioneers of our community. asianweek covered the giants of our grassroots development - march fong eu, my predecessors matt fong and john chiang, norm mineta, mike honda, justices ming chin and tani cantil-sakauye, and mona pasquil. and, of course, i can’t forget working with a young local prosecutor named kamala harris.”











george takei
“the central pillar of a vibrant democracy in a land of diversity is energetic journalism. many publications flourished in the asian american community and many have faded. asianweek is one of the strong survivors.  that asianweek is starting up a database project is an important new benchmark in asian american journalistic history that is cause for celebration. may asianweek live long and prosper.”











doug chan, board, president, chinese historical society of america
“since its founding more than a half-century ago, the chinese historical society of america has served as a center for research about the history of chinese america and its communities. narrative is destiny. as asian america’s own paper of record, asianweek’s team of reporters, photographers, and op-ed writers documented a crucial 40-year period of dramatic demographic, economic, social, cultural, and political change and ferment among america’s diverse asian and pacific islander communities. the creation of an accessible asianweek newspaper archive represents a significant step in preserving that first draft of history, as told in our own voices.”
