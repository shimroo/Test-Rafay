here for cats and the people who love them.

meow foundation is a cat-focused registered charity and humane society with a no-kill mandate. every year, we rescue hundreds of stray and abandoned cats and kittens, with the goal of finding them loving, permanent homes. in addition to our rescue and adoption program, we also offer community-oriented programs to support local cats and the people who love them.
