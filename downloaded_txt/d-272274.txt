gbac star facility 
we are so proud to announce that the mountain america exposition center has achieved global biorisk advisory council (gbac) star accreditation once again. gbac is considered the gold standard for facilities around the country who's number one objective is the health and safety of their employees and attendees. as the cleaning industry's only outbreak prevention, response, and recovery accreditation, gbac star helps organizations establish protocols and procedures, offers expert-led training, and assesses a facility's readiness for biorisk situations. the program verifies that the mountain america exposition center implements best practices to prepare for, respond to, and recover from outbreaks and pandemics. 
in order to obtain gbac star accreditations, the mountain america exposition center was required to demonstrate compliance with the program's 20 core elements, which range from standard operating procedures and risk assessment strategies to personal protective equipment and emergency preparedness and response measures. you can learn more about gbac star accreditation at www.gbac.org.
