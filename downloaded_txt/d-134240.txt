what our customers have to say








a different bouncy castle cancelled on us last minute, and these people saved the day.  you all made a little girl extremely happy on her 5th birthday.  the princess castle was in perfect condition, it fit in my car, was easy to set up, and you stayed open a few extra minutes to be sure we left with something that would work.  the woman on the phone was very helpful, even though she was really busy.  highly recommend!!!  we will be back for future bouncy houses!!








weâve rented inflatables on multiple occasions for our brewery events and had excellent service each time.  they are quick to respond with quotes and even let us add on last minute rentals!  definitely recommending them to fellow breweries and friends/family.








i honestly had the best experience with this company!  we had an event scheduled last minute and as a planner i was so nervous that i would not be able to get everything figured out in time.  my first conversation with this company was with chrissy and i knew that i was in good hands from the initial phone call.  she was able to get me everything i needed and everything from being to the end was beyond exceptional!  the pricing was the best in the market and tyrek delivered and set up everything for us, and he was a joy to be around!  i will use this company for all my event needs in the future and i hope you do too!  highly recommended.








this was the third time we used fun jumps for a rental of a bounce house.  we rented it for the weekend (friday pickup and monday drop off) for our daughterâs birthday party.  i had great communication from rachel and the flexibility with the friday pickup and monday drop off was pretty awesome.  pick-up on friday was quick and easy with the bounce house, chairs, tables and pucker powder dispenser loaded into our van by chris who explained everything well and took the time to answer any questions.  the bounce house is always a hit and the pucker powder dispenser was liked by the kids and adults.  everything worked as expected with no issues.
we will be using fun jumps for future rentals.  your prices and service can not be beat by any of the other places in the twin cities offering the same products and services.  if you are out of the delivery area it is still worth the drive to pickup just for the prices and service alone.








it was an absolute pleasure working with fun jumps entertainment.  they were incredibly helpful in booking.  i quickly learned that they are a one-stop shop for all event needs.  our collaboration for the foot locker grand opening at the mall of america was truly seamless, and i am delighted to have discovered such an outstanding vendor partner.  i want to especially thank chrissy, brian, rachel, and adam.  you made this a wonderful experience!








we used fun jumps last year and this year for our community night out.  the staff are responsive and thorough on explaining everything.  we used the dunk tank last year and had a great time.  this year was wax hands, and that was a hit!  it was great to have an attendant to talk everyone through it.  this company is great!








i rented a cotton candy machine for my daughterâs graduation party.  the experience i had from the time of making my first call to inquire about the rental until i dropped the machine off after our party, was top notch!  everyone i talked to on the phone was so helpful.  a couple of days before our party, i received a call confirming our rental of the cotton candy machine.  when i went to pick up the candy machine, i was greeted warmly in the office.  everything was explained thoroughly.  the machine and supplies were loaded into my car for me.  the cotton candy machine was clean, came with directions, and was easy to use.  it was a hit at our grad party!  drop off was easy.  i highly recommend fun jumps!  thank you for everything!
