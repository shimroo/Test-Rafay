					a message to lance gamma customers and friends:
				
we regret to say that rick lance passed away on may 15, 2019 from colon cancer.  not many people knew of the diagnosis he received in june 2018.  rick was a christian who had an unwavering belief in jesus christ as his lord and savior. he knew that christ's death on the cross and subsequent resurrection won for us, not only salvation from sin and death but also total healing through his broken body!   rick's faith in god's ability and willingness to heal him never wavered. even those who visited him (who were not believers) and knew of his condition would walk away agreeing with rick that the lord will surely restore him to perfect health!                  
rick's heart was always centered on helping people â to bring a little joy (usually through his quick witted humor), comfort (he frequently helped people who were in need) or simple friendship.                  
however, his ultimate desire was to be with jesus.  he lived a very full life and if you knew him well, he would have told you about the many times he was healed supernaturally!  i was with my dear brother when he passed into jesus' arms.  i believe that the lord showed rick his glory and gave him a choice to stay or go to heaven.  what a choice â right?                  
on behalf of rick lance, we want to thank you for your years of loyal support as well as friendship.  
				

					sincerely, katherine lance - rick's sister
