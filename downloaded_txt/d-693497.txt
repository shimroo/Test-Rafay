jan was nothing short of amazing in her verbal dominance of the other side in depositions and trial arguments. let’s say i am very glad she was on my side of the table. at the conclusion of my case the judge looked at me and said, hope you appreciate the herculean effort that your lawyers gave in this case. believe me i did! that’s just how they roll.
