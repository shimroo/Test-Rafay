it feels like we are in the second generation of autistic discourse. the first generation was marked by medical intervention, and by the elimination of the autistic voice. the diagnosis was considered the beginning of finding a solution, or a cure. it was the policing of bodies, the refusing of awkwardness, the speech therapy to end stuttering, the constant supervision, the endless correcting. these strategies often used (and still use) violence of the body to control and mainstream what are viewed as failures of the language. this ranges from the relatively mild--the holding that is required of autism behaviour control, to the much harsher--the infamous use of electric shock. what  these strategies have in common an obsession with “adapting the maladaptive”   there were proto histories--bettelheim's idea that the absent mother, or the uncaring mother caused autism. but the assumption was that the autistic voice was a flawed one, and one that had to be processed out of children--as early as possible. 

the second generation has a radical edge. it refuses to see where they are as a problem of adaptation, and to seek a cure. there is nothing wrong with the autistic voice, and that voice has advantages--advantages that should be preserved. this is not to suggest that there is a utilitarian need for those on the spectrum either. this is not an argument of preservation via use. the main thrust of the book is to elucidate the differences between neuroqueer and baseline uses of langauge--what marks the difference between these two factions, is the radical reinvention of language that those who are autistic construct. 

the collection of essays will be about how autistics use language, and how that usage can provide a set of methodological interventions, patterns of resistance, and also refusal. in this anthology, mostly featuring autistic people writing on autistic subjects, will be one of the first work to discuss the pragmatics of autistic language, but also to deconstruct what those pragmatics mean both within autistic cultures. part of this is new forms that are emerging--that refuse the linearity of neo-liberal prescriptivism--ones that encourage the list, the jarring transition, the info dump,  the non-verbal, the stutter, and the stim. it is also how those forms can be used outside of an autistic context--how the list can become a liturgy, how the jarring transition haunts the jump cut of modernism, how the infodump is one way through the problem of taxonomy and archive, how the non-verbal resembles the lacunae or the gap so beloved by deleuze or derrida, or how the stutter or the stim is a writing on the body. 


these gaps, and hauntings, the connections between autistic speech and the speech of theory, is one way of constructing these narratives. but, the multiphasic, and the personnel are key as well. autism for autism’s sake is key here.  the book will then, be primarily, one that discusses linguistic codes/language games  that mark autistic people--words that they use to describe their own experiences.

from munoz:

the mark of the utopian is the qoutadian
barthes

memory is most certainly constructed and, more importyant, always political. the case i make in the chapter posits our rembrances and their ritualized tellings--through film, video, peformandce, writin and visial culture--as having world making potentialities...these queer memories of utopia and the longing that structures them, esp. as they are empodied in work that i identiy as public-sex-mimetic-cultural production help us carve out a space for actual, living, sexual citizenship. (35)

the double ontology of ghosts and ghostliness, the manner in which ghosts exist inside and out and travese categorical distinctions , seems especialyl useful for a queer criticism that attempts to understand communal mourning, group pyschologies, and the need for a poltiics that "carries our ded" with us into battles for the present and future.

the state understands the need to keep us from knowing ourselves, knowing our masses. (64)

i was a spy in the house of gender normativcity, and like any spy i was extremely careful and worried that my cover would be blown. (68)

lee edleman, in his powerful polemic: no future queer theory and the death drive, wishes to alert his readers to the fact that "the structuring optimism of poltiics of which the order of meaning commits us, installing as it does the perptual ope of reaching meaning through signification, is always, i would arguea negation of the primal, costituive and negative act. poltiical hope fails queers because, like significaiton, it was not orginally made for us. it resonates only on the level of reproductive futirity, abandoing politics and hope, is a certain jouissance that at once defines and negates us. edelman's pschoanytic optic reveals that the social is inoperable for the always already shattered queer subject. (90)


utopian and willfully idealistic practices of thought are in order if we are to resist the perils of heteronoramtivce pragmistim and anglo-normative pessism. imagining a queer subject who is abstracted from the sensous intersectianlitis that mark our experience is an ineffectual way out. (96)

the utopian performative charge of this image allows one to see the past, the moment before an actual performace, the moment of potentiality, and the veiwer gains access to the affective patrucarity of that moment of hope and potenrial transformation that is alos the temporality of performance. (101)

queer cultural production is both an acknlowegent of the lack that is endemic to any heteronormative rendering of the world and a building, a "world making" in the face of the lack. a nothing is a utopian act insofar as it acknowledges a lack that is normalized as a reality and attempts to work with and through nothingness and empheramity. it is both a critique and an additive or reprative gesture. (118)

i have watched the disposessed and the starving laborlized. i have watched the dispossed and starving laboring in the fields which others own, with their transitor radios at their ear, all day long: so they learn, for example, along wiht equally weighty matters, that the pope, one of the heads of the civilised world, forbids to the civilsed that abortion which is being, literally, forced on them, the wretched. the civlised have created the wrestched, quite coldly and deliberately, and do not intend to change the status qou, are responsible for thier sluaghter and enslavement; rain down bomba on children whereever and whenver they decide that their vital interests are menaced, and think of nothing of torturing a man to death: these people are not to be taken seriously when they speak of the sanctity of "human life" or the "concience" of the cilivized world.  (16)

even if what i was preaching was gospel, i had no right to preach it if i no longer believed it. to stay in the church merely because i was afraid of leaving it was ununtterably far beneath me, and too despeciable a cowardice for him to support in any friend of his . therefore, on the coming sunday, he would buy two tickets to a broadwy matineed and meet me on the steps of the 42nd street library, at two o'clock in the afternoon. he knew that i spent all day sunday in church--the point, precisely, of the challenge. if i were not on the steps of the library (in the bookshelves of which so much of my trouble had begun! then he would be ashamed of me and never speak to me again and i would be ashamed of myself. (32)

the choices do not involve, for example, that seismographic shudder which the word, homosexual, until today, produces in the american mind, or soul: i doubt that americans will ever be able to face the fact that the word, homosexual, is not a noun. the root of this word, as americans use it--or as this word uses americans--simply involves a terror of any human touch, since any human touch can change you. a black man and a white man can come together only in the absene of women, which is, simply, the american legend of masculinity brought to its highest pressure, and revealed, as it were, in black and white. (67)

there was a rite in our church, called pleading the blood. when the sinner fell on his face before the altar, the soul of the sinner then found itself locked in battle with satan: or, in the place of jacob, wrestling with the angel. all of the forces of hell rushed to claim the soul which had just been astonished by the light of the love of god. the soul in torment turned this way and that, yearning, equally, for the light and for the darkness: yearning, out of agony, for reconcillation--and for rest: for this agony, for recncillaiton--and for rest: for this agony is compounded by an unimaginable, unprecedented, unspeakable figure. only the saints who had passed through this fire--the incredible horror of the faining of the spirt-had the power to intercede to "plead the blood" to bring the embattled and mortally endangered soul "through". the pleasing of the blood was plea to whosoever had loved us enough to spill his blood for us that he might springle the soul with his love once more, to give us power over satan, and love and courage to live out our days.... (113-4)

reading in bed w/ gore vidal, and the heartbreaking fourth chapter on vidal's companion of 40 years howard austen. their arrangement--a kind of sexless middle and then boys on either side, seems incredibly typical of an upper midde american artistic bourgeoisie---having someone do all of the work of propping the genius up, and having the genius just be this monster of narcissism and cruel uncaring ( for other examples, see auden and kallman, ginsberg and orlosvosky, merill and jackson, tennessee williams and frank merlo, ned rorem and james holmes, even isherwood and baechelor) (auden and isherwood as late americans is something worth noting beside.--for all the conversations about how did what to whom in which circumstance, the emotional topping and bottoming, the careful notice of power, and the age differential suggests a topping/bottoming outside of strict sexual positions. add class to the mix and it gets really really messy  i am sure their are examples of more caring and less caring--but figuring out how much of it was sexual, how much of it was the domestic work of keeping house or keeping emotional regulation or drinking in check, and how much of it was having a second for dinner, and how much of it was managing a public life--these were dedicated open questions, that i think are vastly under-represented. (this seems to be slightly different in queer circumstances than the anonymous work of the housewife--perhaps because the ambiguous sorting out of the queer domestic had not be slotted into a kind of propriety i might be wrong about this point). this is not limited to boy on boy though (see muriel spark and penelope jardin, or stein and toklas and though it seems mostly american, the  book has this great quote by edmund white about margaret yourcenar and what her life long companion did. or didn't do). i think there is a longish book to be written about what exactly the role of a secretary is.

six points:



the idea that the new york school of poetry is mostly marked by a flanuer's energy, and by extension a flanuer does not have form. 
two examples where the ny school has form, o hara and dlugos. 
kinds of form---poetics, but also religious forms, religious forms as a kind of poetics. religious forms that these two used--liturgical calendar (qs/qt), prayer, and esp, litany. 
dlugos and heritage of o hara's form,  g9 vs fast life, tightening, closing form's potential, thru a religious lens. 
g9 as liturgy, list vs litany, queer list, o hara against litany, nessc. of disntinctly queer forms post aids> 
matrice of mutually reinforcing potentials--dlugos would not be the poet that he is w/o both o'hara--but also the poential to discuss dlugos' radical religious potential w/o both an o'hara frame and a queer frame. 




also lacunae.

"the street becomes a dwelling for the flâneur; he is as much at home among the facades of houses as a citizen is in his four walls. to him the shiny, enamelled signs of businesses are at least as good a wall ornament as an oil painting is to the bourgeois in his salon. the walls are the desk against which he presses his notebooks; news-stands are his libraries and the terraces of cafés are the balconies from which he looks down on his household after his work is done."1938

fuck the social order and the child in whose name we’re collectively terrorized; fuck annie; fuck the waif from les mis; fuck the poor, innocent kid on the net; fuck laws both with capital ls and small; fuck the whole network of symbolic relations and the future that serves as its prop. (edelman) fuck the churches order, and the child in the creche in whose name we're collectively harrowed; fuck the christmas pageant; fuck the waif from the little drummer boy; fuck the poor, innocent kid in the altar guild; fuck canon laws, both with the capital ls and small; fuck the whole network of eccelsial relations and the fear of future that serves as its prop...

what happens when we apply an edelman infused framework on the recent death of mainline protestants--instead of thinking of queerness as new kinds of fecundity, or new kinds of praise, or new kinds of excess, what happens if we trust the queer gifts of negation. if we think of queerness as liminal, as a way of moving between the living and the dead, if we think of the queer carnival as one of ghostly remembering, if that ghostly remembering is as much about burying as anything else, then is the queer task one in the memory of christ's body, just as the torn body of christ bridged b/w the living and the dead, can our queer bodies bridge the live church and the dead church...we learned the gifts of mercy, of death, of martyrdom, of righteous anger, of hospitality in our history, of new narratives against a needless and dangerous promulgation, can we translate those gifts to the death of the church? if the church is dying, can we in our own way, lead it to discovering its own holy and sacred negation...even this idea of resurrection, does the spirit not manifest itself in a myriad of forms, is our love of the institutional forms of christendom idolatrous... or is this a way of getting one of the hook for genuinely corperate worship. continually reading queer theory this semester, i am reminded that our gifts are gifts of greyness, and that we have to maintain the radicality of our refusing the fecund and reproductive.

top works from the isabelle stewart gardner:

a) the courtyard garden, wiht chespaeke mums and a small side room, with chinese panels of mums
b) giotto work that had in the center a large white sqaure, flirting with abstraction.
c) this big portrait of henry james
d) a pair of 16th century red chalk male nudes.
e) a korean vase, delicate, and black, with two fairly non abstract fish handles.
g)  holbein portiats of minor english court funcitonaries (i like minor holbein, he doesn't feel like he needs to do anything but flatter)
h) a whole chunk of whistler second impression etchings of french country rivers, boats, and that sort of thing--looking weirdly dutch. a whistler nocturne with perfect grey tones.
i) the biggest monstrance i have ever seen (also, the rapcious appettie she had for church furniture--choir stalls, stained glass windows, pews, bishop chairs, bishop croizers, monstrances, pyx, frontals, all sorts of vestments)
j) greek statue on top of a black domino cabienet--looking like a mirroiring and continution of a complicated body.
k) two side cabnients of hand tatted venetian lace.
l) titan's europa
m) piano extension

top works from the mfa:

a) the johns show was super tight, and made a solid argument--i am rethinking what his cross hatching means, and a v. good catenary painting from 2001, with excellent draping, an encaustic from 1984, where he paints trompe de oliel aged scotch tape.
b) a big jack bush with a bright indigo field
c) sean scully's wall of light pink from 1994--bigger than most scully's i've seen, and uses the over painting with under paiting visible, to acheive an almost monet quality
d) a warhol pissing painting, that they coyly call an oxidazation painting (can we talk about this as the true success of the market--this censoring of warhol's language) even though it is a crude joke against abstract expressionists of his youth, and is weirdly sexy (in the idea of sex, in the traces of sex, not of sex itself, the pockmarked copper surce makes it genunely almost sublmimely beautiful)
e) a couple of benin sculptures from the first colonial contact of the portugese, first time i have seen it from the beinnite side.
f) a modest sized el antusi carpet work, this one called black river.
g) across a large gallery--whiteread's door peice, with its failure as a protal marking a bleak and steady grey and white severeity, with fgt's chemo--a peice that i always find rreally spooky to go thru.
h) fred wilson's iago's mirror--which looks like plastic but is mirrored glass, a clock, refleciting blackness against euroccentric decorative culture
i) a niickalene thomas colalge, a afrofutirist decosntruction of courbet at his most pornographic, with the pastoral made from the usual vinyl wall paper and magazine clippings she usually uses.
j) they put five ken prices against the wall, but how he transitions colour--from an olive to a jade to a mustard in one peice, or from a scrambled redish pink to a dark rasberry in another, might be the formalist highlight of american post war sculpture (the other highlight a truitt, in royal blue with a subtle violet stripe)
k) terra cotta jar painted with birds, ca 2600
l) bridget rileys story of orpheus, 1978--i love how unserious her colours are, and how much does wiwth thiem, this primal, undaliting wave, of light pinks, teals, and grey greens, in tight reflecting lines.
m) slyvia plimock magold's half waindow from 1972
n) a lous, tall, (almost my height, but narrow, maybe a yard, more vertical than his usual work, and i love how it was book ended by raw canvas.
o) deigo romero's reworking of contenporary issues in pueblo pottery
p) a nice van dyck,
q) two great melon paintings--a musk melon by luis melandez, from the 17th century,  and a judith scene, where her prgrant belly is reflected in a melon in the foreground, that it is a marriage portrait, explains why the melon looks like a womb and a phallus.
r) manet. and his greys
s) finally saw a dutch church scene that had the little dog pissing in the corner, been waiting to see one of those for year.s
t) david tenius the burch shop, with its cloth overing half of a bull, the head of the bull to the left, the innards of the bull to the right, women breaking down the carcass.
u) hans melming christ blessing--post resecution jesus, happy and serene, in a room full of crucifixtions and martydoms
v) two small and quite intimate chardins, the best kitchen table, with a copper jar, a white porcelian jug, and a mess of smelt.
w) some excellent game pics
x) tipelo's, all the tipelos.

hat i find interesting iabout the books boxed set is two things a) that he wants to control the means of distrubution, which might be more impt than production, and that is in flux (though not as much as flux as techno-utopians want it to be) b) that for one of the great singles artists of the 20th century, still belives singles are lesser, are almost ot be given away against albums.

i hate writing bios esp only 20 words:

anthony easton still believes the rectum's the grave.anthony easton was saved at a pentecostal tent revival in their early 20s.anthony easton digs pina coladas. anthony easton is a capricorn and seeks a taurus.anthony easton seeks to live up to the moral severity of edith sitwell's turban.anthony easton's' mother never let him grew up to be a cowboy.anthony easton is feeling like kathleen hannae oversold the radical potential of plesure.anthony easton would like to "shake it for the squirrels" as required by luke bryan.anthony easton knows more about ryman from the late 1980s than you.anthony easton's mystical visions are all about the problems of negation.anthony easton realizes the greatest art of the 20th century might be dolly parton's wigs.anthony easton never under estimates the power of the tracking shot.anthony easton writes about things, but really wants to produce.anthony easton finds the joke about the starlet who slept with the writer more amusing if one believes fitzgerald wrote it.anthony easton's favourite colours are electric magenta and damson.anthony easton believes in the restorative power of cold chicken.anthony easton spends a lot of time figuring out the origin of the queer archive, and thinks it might be joe brainard's i remember poem.anthony easton thinks their prayers go up to heaven like the insence smoke in a thurifer.anthony easton thinks--fabulous outfit, but honey your purse is on fire.
