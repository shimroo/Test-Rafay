mdeq is proposing new regulations to address the effects of the u.s. supreme court ruling in the case of sackett v. environmental protection agency
these proposed regulations will provide clarity and consistency to the existing definition of “waters of the state” and establish the state water alteration program (swap) which will include exemptions and conditional exemptions for certain activities that could affect waters of the state.  find out more about the proposed regulations, upcoming public hearing, and instruction for submitting comments by clicking the link.
