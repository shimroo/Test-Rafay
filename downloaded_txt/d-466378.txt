memories 
                  of memorial









labor is prior to, and independent of, 
                    capital. capital is only the fruit of labor and could never 
                    have existed if labor had not first existed. labor is the 
                    superior of capital and deserves much the higher consideration. 
                    capital has its rights, which are as worthy of protection 
                    as any other rights.

                    at the lemmon valley amazon distribution center.

                    where: amazon fulfillment rno4, 8000 n virginia st, reno nv

                    this is a national strike at numerous amazon locations throughout

                    and all locations will be active primary picket lines.

                    we encourage our brothers and sisters from other unions to 
                    participate in solidarity by joining the teamsters on the

las 
            vegas, nv (nov. 15 2024 5:00 a.m. pst) — for the first time in 
            more than 22 years, the culinary union has taken workers out in an 
            open-ended strike at a las vegas resort. over 700 hospitality employees 
            stopped work at the virgin las vegas beginning friday, november 15 
            at 5:00 a.m. pst. we will continue as long as it takes to win a new 
            5-year union contract. we formed picket lines around the property 
            which will remain in place 24/7. culinary union local 226 urges customers 
            and community allies to *not* cross the strike line. we respectfully 
            request that customers check out of the property, choose a union accommodation, 
            dine at union restaurants and cancel reservations. thanks for your 
            support. stay tuned.

            appointed to make the service so bad that nationwide privatization

thank 
            you, defendant t-rump. your postmaster general rasputin dejoyless 
            is doing one helluva job. so what's next, moving up the assassination 
            date to kill voting by mail this november? whassamatta with biden's 
            new appointees to the postal service board of governors?
fire the sumbitch, already.

a 
                  story so hot off the press
                  that it may require opening the water gates

8-2-2024 
                    —> today, aaron c. davis and carol d. leonnig of the 
                    washington post reported that there is reason to believe that 
                    when trump’s 2016 campaign was running low on funds, 
                    trump accepted a $10 million injection of cash from egypt’s 
                    authoritarian leader abdel fatah al-sisi. it is against the 
                    law to accept direct or indirect financial support from foreign 
                    nationals or foreign governments for a political campaign 
                    in the united states. stay tuned.

$10m cash withdrawal drove 
                    secret probe
into 
                    whether trump took money from egypt
political 
                    appointees rejected efforts to search for additional evidence 
                    investigators believed might provide answers, then closed 
                    the case. 
"five 
                    days before donald trump became president in january 2017, 
                    a manager at a bank branch in cairo received an unusual letter 
                    from an organization linked to the egyptian intelligence service. 
                    it asked the bank to 'kindly withdraw' nearly $10 million 
                    from the organization’s account — all in cash."

when 
                all else fails dept.—> a year or so back, i got my 
                first criticism in more than two decades that this site is a bit 
                confusing to navigate. i take that as a compliment. confusing 
                people is one of my few talents. 
                    i thought i had anticipated any such problems 
                years ago by liberally sprinkling links to the front page site 
                map. (these days, am i supposed to say that i sprinkled progressively 
                rather than liberally?)
                    the front page of nevadalabor.com acts 
                as a chronological listing of recent workplace news with the latest 
                at the top. i archive annually to create a continuous permanent 
                record fully accessible via the site map or 
                any garden-variety websearch.

                own section inside. say hi to don quixote.
                    current 
                barbwires plus more than 20 years of columaniacal archives, 
                the statewide news roundup 
                and breaking news/bull'tins/almanac 
                are all available via the site map—>as 
                well as the usual general or specific ongoing madness and historical 
                inflammation. (once something's posted here or to any of my other 
                sites, it's up forever.)
                    while the front page is chronological, 
                the statewide news roundup 
                is categorical, e.g., construction, hospitality, legislation, 
                health care and many others. breaking 
                news/bull'tins/almanac often publishes original u-news as 
                well as links to items at other sites that are not hot enough 
                for the front page chronology. the nevadalabor.com 
                search engine acts as a short-cut to everything, depending 
                on what you seek. so simply seek and ye shall find.
                    as my old friend wise 
                john the lake havasu cropduster pilot often says, "when 
                all else fails, read the instructions." so when all else 
                fails, re-read the above, then go to the nearest site 
                map link and/or "search." 
                the nevadalabor.com search engine is really amazing. it's also 
                union-signatory and thus quite efficient.
                    thanks for your inputs and support over 
                lo, these many years. keep up the good work and the good fight.
                    esté bien. haga infierno. / be 
                well. raise hell.

editor's 
          note: many of the news links on this site 
          are from nevada dailies. in late 2006, the reno gannett-journal began 
          nuking much of its archive. if you encounter any broken links, i encourage 
          you to contact them and 
          send me a copy. on 
          the one hand, they want to build their web traffic in order to increase 
          the price of ads. on the other hand, they are killing that very traffic. 
          far be it from me to reconcile the dilbert-style motivations of an outfit 
          for which a 38 percent net profit is not enough. if you can explain 
          it, please enlighten me. (before 
          you e-mail me, please read this bulletin — ab) update: 
          in early 2008, the las vegas sun "upgraded " its website, 
          nuking more than a dozen years of links. if you find an orphaned sun 
          story, search their site for the title.

the tale of our gorgeous union-created graphics






in 2002, 
          we were honored to produce the centennial 
          book for the 100th anniversary of the founding of northern nevada painters 
          and allied trades local 567/afl-cio. working on a short time frame, 
          we cast a nationwide net for appropriate cover art and succeeded beyond 
          our wildest dreams thanks to muralists kathleen scarboro and 
          kathleen farrell. the above illustration ("papering 
          the world: joliet's wallpaper industry") appeared on the cover 
          and interior of local 567's centennial book, copies of which have been 
          submitted to nevada libraries and historical organizations. the mural, 
          painted on a wall in joliet, illinois, depicts painters union members 
          manufacturing wallpaper the old fashioned way, long about the time of 
          local 567's founding. ms. farrell is a member of united scenic artists 
          local 829, an affiliate of the international union of painters & 
          allied trades/afl-cio. ms. scarboro is a member of the maison des artists 
          in paris, the association which represents artists in france. 
ms. farrell executes murals, 
          mosaics and figurative sculptures for the labor movement. her work and 
          that of others may be viewed at the friends 
          of community public art web site. "we have added new table 
          top size sculptures for sale as well as additions of our life size sculptures," 
          she says. "a number of the sculptures feature union members including 
          the baseball player (the catch) and the firefighter. i 
          have also finished the rad workers sculpture i mentioned awhile back. 
          i welcome work from unions that would like to buy the existing sculptures 
          or hire me to create awards, tabletop size sculptures and life size 
          sculptures."
