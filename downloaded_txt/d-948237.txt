snhs vision

america has been honoring brilliant students through honor societies since 1921. educators began to notice the need for subject specific honor societies in america’s high schools in the 1980's. since then, new honor societies have sprung up to recognize and encourage students in such areas as english, art, french, and spanish. until now, there has been no national honor society for science. in this era of rapidly changing technologies and scientific advancement, it is time to encourage and recognize high school students in the sciences. 
snhs is a prominent scientific organization that will engender a new group of young thinkers who will be the future of industry, research, and scientific exploration for america.
(snhs is not directly affiliated with the national honor society but we do maintain a cordial and professional relationship with that organization.)participation encourages leadership and supports a student's academic achievements in the sciences. establish a snhs chapter at your school today!
