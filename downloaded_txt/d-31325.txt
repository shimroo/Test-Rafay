ho train products! 
 welcome back and thank you for bearing with us during our long absence and our tortuous efforts to restore our web site. our entire site was wiped out when the original hosting company went out of business...suddenly. between health challenges and technical snafus, it has been a struggle to get "back on the air."
we are far from done and our efforts will continue during the coming months. even for those parts now up and running there will be additions and corrections as we continue to work on the recovery. for most of the items currently posted, shipping charges are are a blanket $12 for the total of all items  within each category, no matter how many are selected. in other categories, such as structures and locomotives, additional shipping charges will  be specified, as needed, for each item.
finally, as many of you know, our somewhat bizarre schedule has been to stop shipping in early winter due to medical requirements. we then, as usual, continue work during winter posting more items and recording orders for shipments in the spring.  
the last day of shipping for 2024 will be october 14th. we will continue to accept orders until we resume shipping orders in spring 2025.

 we ship only to the usa. 
again, we thank all who have waited so patiently for us to get back on line. we hope to continue serving all of you.
