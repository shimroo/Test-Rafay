love does not follow the boundaries we set

feb 02, 2025
   ·   the rev. michele h. morgan   •    luke 2:22-40

we are people of the way; we follow so that our selfish desires are muted, and we follow someone who calls us to be merciful, to see each other, and to be of service to each other.  more


when someone steps up and yells no

jan 19, 2025
   ·   the rev. michele h. morgan   •    mlk jr., 2025 

sometimes, we have to point out that we are wrong and that something in the system is terrible. sometimes, even when we all agree that something was one thing, one way, or even one reality, someone has to step up and say no.  more


christmas ii : what we remember and what we forget

jan 05, 2025
   ·   the rev. michele h. morgan   •    luke 2:41-52

if we leave it up to our brains only and not our community and our sense of something more, we seek to hold on to the past and shield ourselves from seeing our faith in a new light.  more
