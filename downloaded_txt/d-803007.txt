translating the code of life

the human proteome organization (hupo) is an international scientific organization representing and promoting proteomics through international cooperation and collaborations by fostering the development of new technologies, techniques and training.read more
 


  





human proteome project (hpp)

the human proteome project (hpp) is an international project organized by hupo that aims to revolutionize our understanding of the human proteome via a coordinated effort by many research laboratories around the world. it is designed to map the entire human proteome in a systematic effort using currently available and emerging techniques. completion of this project will enhance understanding of human biology at the cellular level and lay a foundation for development of diagnostic, prognostic, therapeutic, and preventive medical applications. > more on the hpp
