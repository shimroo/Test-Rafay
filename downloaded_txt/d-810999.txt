    testimonials
 
  


    
  "this was place was awesome. i had to place a last-minute engraving  order and it was done so quickly and efficiently, and the price was 70% cheaper than other businesses i have used, for the same product! while there i mentioned i needed some ribbons and medals mounted and he said he could make it happened, had them ready by lunchtime the very next day! he was incredibly helpful. i'll use them for everything going forward."
traci h.

  





 
  "loved the work on my marine shadow box. nobody comes close to the quality, workmanship and attention to detail. ordered two more for my army and navy service and can't wait to get them."
stephen s.

  





 
  "clint and the team at precision medals did a great job with a recent build for my alpha blouse. the pricing was more than fair and the turnaround was quick. recommend checking them out before going anywhere else. their build was actually less expensive and came out better than the one i created. give them a call and talk them through what you need done if your not seeing what you need on their website."

    frequently asked questions

 military medals

        what is included in the mounting fee?

  




  a new piece of drape for your medal, a stiff plastic insert so the medal lays flat, the mounting bar, and a plastic case.



   what does mounting/no mounting mean?

  




  when selecting a medal 
you are asked to select mounting/no mounting before adding it to your cart.  if you select “mounting”, then the medals will be mounted on a bar for uniform wear.  if you select “no mounting”, then the medals 
will be shipped separately in their individual packages.



   how long does it take to mount a set of medals?

  




  from the time we get the order, your medals 
are ready to be shipped usually in 1-2 days.   times vary due to the number of orders during the marine corps ball season but still is within 3-4 days.



   do i need to order my medals in their order of precedence?

  




  no, our staff know the order of precedence for every branch and also know the order if you have medals 
from multiple branches.



   should i worry about getting my medals mounted correctly based on the number of medals and my gender?

  




  no, when you place your order you select a gender for the person wearing the medals and a branch of service.  from that information, we know how many medals go in each row and the proper overlap.



   what type of stiffener is used in the medal mounting.

  




  we use a laser-cut plastic insert.  your medals will not bend or warp when wet or subjected to high humidity like the paper/cardboard backings other companies use.



   how are my medals/ribbons shipped?

  




   we ship primarily through the usps using priority mail.  you can choose ups shipping if that works better for you.



   i am stationed or live overseas, do you ship to apo or foreign addresses?

  




  we ship anywhere in the world to any address you provide.  we will contact you if we need more address info.



   do i need to ship you the medals i need to add?

  




  no.  send in your current set and include any new medals/devices you have.  but if you don’t have the medal or new device we can provide that.  we stock every medal and device for every branch.



   can i use my current set of medals and add to them?

  




  yes, the majority of the time we can open a set of medals, add to it, and close them back up.  there are a few companies that mount medals in a way that makes it impossible to open them without ruining the ribbon.  in those few cases, we might have to remount those medals.  but we can always reuse the medallions and just replace the ribbon.



   can i reuse my “thin” ribbons when adding to the set?

  




  sometimes.  it depends on the company that made them originally.  some ribbons will not come apart without using tools that ruin the ribbon.  some are easily removed and can be remounted.  we take a look and let you know what we can do before we do any work so the decision is yours to make.



   can i return my order?

  




  yes, if there is a mistake with the order just contact us and we will issue a return label.  if you just don’t want the items any longer you can return them for a refund minus the shipping and credit card fee.



   if i need to send in my medals to be updated, how do i do that?

  




   send them to the address at the bottom of the home page.  include your name and phone number inside.  we will call you when they arrive and go over everything you need to be done.  we can take your credit card over the phone at the same time.



   if i order online can i pick up my order at the store?

  




  yes, when you checkout make sure to opt to pay with cash.  that way your order doesn’t get shipped and you will be notified when it is ready.



   is there a fee to assemble my ribbon order?

  




  no, if you order a ribbon bar at the same time you order ribbons then the ribbons will be put together for you.
