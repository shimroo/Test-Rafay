helping long islanders when they need it most
find help now


   








            family service league          


fsl is a social service agency that provides support and security to our long island neighbors who need it most. from children and families to individuals and seniors, we empower more than 60,000 of our community’s most vulnerable to mobilize their strengths and improve their quality of life.












            did you know that in the past year ...          
















fsl secured permanent housing for 199 adults and 116 families!












through our hospital referral pathways, 1,507 people were connected to fsl for ongoing clinical services.












our innovative program with law enforcement facilitated 1,065 on-the-spot telehealth sessions, and 74% avoided transport to the hospital.















looking to help?
our ability to give every long islander access to the support they need to grow, heal, and prosper could never happen without the selfless support of our generous neighbors. every donation counts—and is very much appreciated.
