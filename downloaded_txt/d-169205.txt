you are not alone. there is help for you!this organization has changed my life.” – d.h., detroit
1996  •  celebrating 29 years  •  2025







the problem
you may have a social phobia: not being able to relieve yourself in the presence of others is called shy bladder (paruresis). it is a legitimate medical condition affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide. those suffering from this phobia often live uncomfortable, severely restricted lives.
“the more we run from a problem, the more we’re actually running into it. ” pico iyer, essayist 







the solution
graduated exposure (ge) therapy to the feared experience is an effective treatment that can dramatically improve the quality of life for most paruresis sufferers. ge alongside foundational cognitive therapy leads to improvements that include being able to urinate in the physical proximity to others and being able to enjoy a social life away from home. relationships get better, work life improves, and travel (including on airplanes) is possible again.

workshops
a workshop is a safe, structured program to help you begin to recover from paruresis. much of what happens involves relearning how to urinate in the presence of others. many people report that they were nervous before the workshop and quite reluctant to sign up, but after the first few hours wondered why they hadn’t sought help for their paruresis earlier.
