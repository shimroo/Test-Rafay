inspirational mixed media retreats






what are art & soul retreats?


                        art & soul is a creative in-person art retreat offering unique workshops taught by a hand-picked group of professional and talented instructors. choose from a diverse array of
                        mixed media classes featuring collage, assemblage, jewelry, fabric, fiber arts, sculpting, and painting. register for a retreat and you can take as many or as few workshops as
                        you like! really. it's that easy. dip your toes in for a day or an evening, take a full week of classes, or mix it up. you get to decide how many you take and when! so have a
                        look around, then come join us.
                    

                        you'll do more than learn at one of our retreats, you'll make immediate and lasting friendships, while you experience art-making amidst a gathering of like-minded souls. we
                        have several week-long events throughout the country, jam-packed with full day and evening workshops, on-site shopping, and plenty of extra activities.
                    
join us for an inspirational experience that feeds your heart and soul.
