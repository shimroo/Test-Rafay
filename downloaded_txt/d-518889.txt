featured book

my twenty-five years in provence
by peter mayle
from the moment peter mayle and his wife, jennie, uprooted their lives in england and crossed the channel permanently, they never looked back. here the beloved author of a year in provence pays tribute to the most endearing and enduring aspects of his life in franceâthe charming and indelible parade of village life, the sheer beauty, the ancient history. he celebrates the cafã© and lists some of his favorites; identifies his favorite villages, restaurants, and open-air markets; and recounts his most memorable meals. a celebration of twenty-five years of provenã§al livingâof lessons learned and changes observedâwith his final book mayle has crafted a lasting love letter to his adopted home, marked by his signature warmth, wit, and humor.
