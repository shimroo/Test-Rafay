the entire team is wonderful with our blake…he’s not always a fan of coming to the groomer but hillary and the team are amazing with him. thank you all for taking such great care of blake. even though we moved to sherman, we are committed to driving down for his grooming appointments. it’s clear to us that he’s cared for and his grooming needs are taken into consideration. blake is not a fan of the groomer but hillary, shauna and everyone there have been so great with him. your patience is so appreciated, thank you again!

we have been taking our “boys” to pappy’s in richardson for over 2 years… the folks at pappy’s take a genuine interest in the care of our dogs, and are always excited to see them. i’m sure our guys are challenging at times, but you would never know if from how the team at pappy’s treats us when we go to pick them up. we are completely comfortable and confident in leaving them there for daycare, overnight or extended stays as well… we highly recommend the professional care that pappy’s provides.

i love pappy’s! the grooming is fantastic (boy i love that shedless!) and charlie is excited to visit his pals. the staff is very welcoming (they remembered charlie after just one visit!) and very accommodating. i’ve enthusiastically recommended pappy’s to everyone looking for grooming or boarding.
