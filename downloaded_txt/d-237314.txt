chauncy- i bought your ultimate kit and it changed our lives. my husband and i rescued two male cats a few years ago and when we moved to our new house april/99 they began to spray in the basement where the prior owners kept their cat’s box. we bought extra litter boxes, used soaps, used deodorizers, and nothing worked. we used your products once and they have not sprayed again in 4 weeks. the smell used to be overwhelming when you entered the house but there is no smell now. i volunteer for the humane society and i have been telling everyone whether they are human, feline or canine. my husband and i are thrilled!

i cannot stress to you how much your product has helped me. i was afraid i’d lose my security deposit on this apartment. i could not invite friends over. it was awful, and the carpet is almost white. now, you cannot even tell that a dog ever lived here. i think my puppy is actually happier, too, and we actually have a better relationship. i love hanging out in my apartment again, and coming home to a perfect ivory rug that smells fresh. your product is a little more expensive, but not as expensive as spending $20 here and there on things that never work. i’m glad i shelled it out, and if i ever have this problem again, i know exactly where to turn! thanks again!

questions and answers with planet urine
q: we had a dog that marked our dining room table. we had a rug with pad down. he marked several chairs, and the hardwood is now black. can i use your product to take out the older stains as well?
a: thanks for your inquiry. sorry about the problem you’re having! to remove the stains and/or odors from hardwood floors, you can use this simple solution:
1) lightly mist the stained areas with the urine-release pre-spray. 2) sprinkle the urineout powder onto the areas, and work it in with your applicator brush. this should “wick up” and absorb the urine in the areas. 3) sweep up the dry, urine laden powder. repeat this process until the stain is gone.
4) after you remove the urine following the above steps, you’ll want to treat for any lingering odors and “scents”.
5) you can spray smells no-more! odor eliminator directly on the soiled areas, allow to dry, repeat if needed.
6) then we treat the areas with no-p! housebreaking aid to remove urine scents. when sprayed on the soiled area, no-p! housebreaking aid will eliminate the urine scent so pets will not re-soil in that area. go here for detailed instructions.
i recommend you start with the hard surface cleaning system ii, which includes a free odor detector blacklight, click here for more information.
i guarantee if you follow my advice, call or write if questions, then you will be impressed with how well it works to remove the stains and odors!
remember, the difference is dry powder cleaning.
q: our indoor cat, maddie, has for some time has been standing in her litter box, but peeing outside. after cleaning the box, floor litter and removing soiled paper etc., she would continue to use the box. just in the past 2 weeks, she wouldn’t go into the room where the 3 litter boxes are located and have always been in that 2nd floor room. we bought three new boxes, with a total of 4 boxes now, using dr. else’s cat attract litter and additive, moved each box to a separate room and one in a hallway. she used the one box iin the hallway, peed only, missing the box again. she also has pooped several times on carpet on the first floor. she has been acting normall, eating well, grooming and is a chatter box as she is pairt maine coon. we think she an aversion to the original litter room and have moved one litter box on first floor where she has defecated. i am not sure if moving the litter box downstairs on my oriental carpet in the dining room is a smart move. also we know she doesn’t like covered litter boxes, but was considering putting the lid on, but cutting the center top out so the sides are high and hopefully keep in pee inside. any suggestions would be much appreciated.
a: thank you for the information. when cats behave this way, i know how frustrating it can be! let’s first take a look at some simple solutions to help with this.
cats possess a certain subtlety and purpose in everything they do. they are territorial animals. marking behavior in cats is normal and is an important part of communication between cats. it helps to establish boundaries and reassures the cat that the area is familiar. marking territory involves the spraying of urine and depositing pheromones from glands located on the cat’s body. glands are located around the face, tail and in the foot pads.
the most common behavior of a cat rubbing its face against an object releases facial pheromones, letting it be known that the area is familiar and safe. the presence of facial pheromones has been shown to have a calming effect on cats.
another common form of territorial marking, urine spraying, is often stimulated by anything new in your cat’s surroundings. if your cat can see or smell another cat outside the house or if you have added a piece of new furniture or a new pet or person in the house, this could be enough for your cat to “spray” in an attempt to define boundaries.
some cats look for the cleanest place they can find to urinate. if they even smell an odor in their litter box, especially another cat’s urine, they will go to the opposite end to find a clean area. it could just be a simple matter of looking for a clean area.
did you know that the plastic in a litter box will actually absorb the urine odors into the plastic? this can cause a cat to avoid using the litter box. no matter how hard you try to clean it, you can never remove all of the “scents” that will linger in the litter box. cats are very sensitive to this.
it is highly recommended that you replace the litter box with a brand new litter box. most vets recommend replacing it every 4 – 6 months. people we have shared this information with are surprised at how well it has worked to get a cat using the litter box again. at planeturine.com we are committed to helping you until this problem is solved!
 
q: my whole house smells like urine. it has saturated into the hard wood floors. i do not know how to get my dog to pee outside
a: thank you for contacting us regarding his problem. i know how absolutely frustrating it can be to have a male dog urinating like this, but don’t worry, because your problem with him is soon over!
did you happen to read the information about the pu housetraining wrapper belly bands?  his behavior is exactly what they are designed to prevent.  hands down, this is the best and quickest way to train a male dog that is acting this way.
the pu housetraining wrapper belly bands, in-and-of-themselves, will teach him to only do his business outside, period!  especially with a dog that is going outdoors, and then still doing their business indoors.
in addition, when you train a dog to only go #1 outdoors, you’ll simultaneously teach him to go #2 in the same area.  “where there’s pee, there’s poop” as the saying goes.  click here for more information.
go here to watch a video to see how to use the wrappers: click here to watch video. 


q: our very loved cat is peeing on baseboards and doors and any cloth object left on the floor. we have one litter box in the bathroom which she also uses. she poops on our rugs and we&#39;ve taken all of them up now. she gets lots of cuddles and attention. is she marking her territory? why now, why so much? we’ve a pretty calm house and there’s not a lot of changes to her routines. help!
a: hi regina,
 

thank you very much for contacting our animal behaviorists.  when cats stop using the litter box, i know how frustrating it can be!  let’s first take a look at some simple solutions to help with this problem.it could be happening because of a medical problem.  you need to have your vet check for any urinary tract infections.  this can cause pain to a cat when they urinate.  then they associate the pain with the litter box, and avoid using it.  then they go around finding places where they can pee, with an attempt to “avoid” the pain.  it’s a major problem for them.
the fact that cats can be taught to relieve themselves in specific places is what permits us to keep them as house pets. many species of cats begin to show this behavior as soon as they can eliminate on their own.  however, where a cat eliminates can be affected by its experiences. litter boxes which for a variety of possible reasons do not provide an acceptable place to eliminate, from the cat’s point of view, may cause a cat to go to the bathroom somewhere else. thus, it is important for you to provide a litter box, which meets your cat’s needs so that s/he will like the box and use it consistently. most cat owners want to place the litter box in an out-of-the-way place in order minimize odor and loose particles of cat litter tracked around the house. often, the litter box may end up in the basement, possibly next to an appliance, on an unfinished, cold cement floor. this type of location may be undesirable from the cat’s point of view. adult cats new to a household may not at first remember where the box is located if it is in an area they seldom frequent.


secondly, cats may be startled while using the box if a furnace or washer/dryer suddenly comes on, that may be the last time they’ll risk such a frightening experience! lastly, some cats like to scratch the surface surrounding their litter box and may find a cold cement floor unappealing. so you may have to compromise. the box should be kept in a location, which affords the cat some privacy, but is also conveniently located. if you place the box in a closet, be sure the door is wedged open from both sides in order to prevent your cat from being trapped in or out. if the box sits on a smooth, slick or cold surface, consider putting a small throw rug underneath the box.

in addition, it is critical that you use a type of litter specially designed to attract your cat to the litter box.  you should go read about dr. elsey’s new cat attract litter.  click here to learn more.
here are some great resources that have helped many a frustrated cat owner.  “how to get your cat back to the litter box”.  click here.
discourage urinating in the same area:
1) clean the areas thoroughly using our urineout powder cleaning process. this allows you to remove the urine.
2) give the areas an unpleasant smell by spraying them with no-p! housebreaking aid. when sprayed on the soiled area, no-p! housebreaking aid will eliminate the urine “scent” to prevent repeat urination in that area.for more information, click here.
3) place the catscram ultrasonic housetraining aid in the areas you want avoided.  finally, a great housetraining aid to help stop cats from soiling in unwanted rooms & areas!!  it works great to keep cats off counter tops, & upholstery too.  for more detailed information about catscram ultrasonic housetraining aid, click here.

4) another possible solution would be to use the pu disposable cat diapers.  have you ever heard of such a thing, diapers for cats?  they even have a hole in them for your cats tail to fit through.  also, they use velcro adjustments so the diapers can be customized for a perfect fit!  pu disposable cat diapers – odor-resistant and ideal for training!
