our mission



    ◤
  


        
     we are committed to inspiring participation and awareness in the preservation of fragile ecosystems by providing opportunities for personal direct action to save the diversity of life on earth.

        

 how we do it 


at savenature.org, we work to conserve biologically diverse ecosystems worldwide through our adoption programs and conservation meters. we also educate and raise awareness for the importance of conservation through our insect discovery lab. by partnering with like-minded organizations like schools, zoos, museums, science centers, businesses, and more, we ensure that fragile ecosystems are conserved for all future generations.
