about

electric sheep is a collaborative abstract artwork founded by scott draves. it's run by thousands of people all over the world, and can be installed on almost anything. when these computers "sleep", the electric sheep comes on and the computers communicate with each other by the internet to share the work of creating morphing abstract animations known as "sheep".
anyone watching one of these computers may vote for their favorite animations using the keyboard. the more popular sheep live longer and reproduce according to a genetic algorithm with mutation and cross-over. hence the flock evolves to please its global audience.
the electric sheep are a free and open source service.  the gold sheep are an hd premium version. learn more and sign up.
you can design your own sheep and submit them to the gene pool.
            the result is a collective "android dream", blending man and machine with code to create an artificial lifeform. learn more about it.
