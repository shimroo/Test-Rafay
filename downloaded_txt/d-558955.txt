serving land buyers since 1987


 
it's easy  to buy land at a        great price.
pick a state, see the photos, call us to help pick a lot!                    
all our parcels were purchased with title insurance 
(no liens), and are warrantied for the life of the 
property. (learn more below).











we use a “warranty deed” to transfer title, the only  deed that warrants the title for the entire life of the property. why is this important? a “special warranty deed”, commonly used by land flip companies, warrants the title only against defects arisingâ afterâ they acquired the property and not against defects arising before that time.
