"i stumbled upon your fun interactive geography games from a link on the massachusetts geographic alliance website. since then, your games have become quite a hit with my competitive colleagues!"
                      --candice gomes, education outreach coordinator, boston public library                    (sheppard software's geography games were featured in the boston public library's 2006 exhibition on mapping)
"terrific online educational games, especially geography."
--dallas children's museum 
first, let me say i love your website! i have students with learning   disabilities that need multiple way to learn math, and your site fills the bill! - darrin, rose park elementary in billings, mt  

 "awesome site... it is the only reason i am passing my world geography class!" --stephen

"our preschool teacher just sent us homework with this new website on   it!  
                        my twins love it - they are 4 1/2 and can't get enough!  the sounds,   the action, so many choices and things to do.  i bookmarked this for them and   have sent the website to numerous friends and best of all it's   free!
                        thank you for such a wonderful learning tool."---cherie   ventola


"let me say that you guys have an awesome website. i stumbled across your site one day, and it has been the easiest, most effective, and really 
                            the most fun method for learning geography that i've 
                            found." --david weaver                            



"i am thrilled to have stumbled upon   your site! as a homeschooling mom, i love to find sites that encourage brain   activity  and reinforce the   facts i teach during learning time! 
  the range of information is   wonderful!!! keep up the fantastic   work!"
-mrs. janell hancock
"your games are amazing!    
your website has so much to offer!
 
this site is exactly what i have been looking for!    i have four children within five years of age and they can all play your games!    i love that you can choose your level of difficulty.  the games are colorful and   simple, not cluttered like some.  the instructions are easy to understand and   they cover basic learning that can be neglected with other "too busy" games.   i   can't believe what a blessing it is to have stumbled upon this site!  i looked   up "kindergarten math games online."  this is the first one that i actually   enjoyed navigating around in and that actually kept the kids' attention without   discouraging them.
 
this site will be a daily part of our learning!    the kids were fighting over who could take the next turn at the learning game!    it is reinforcing everything i am trying to teach.
 
thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!"
jill grell
"it is an amazing tool! my 10 year old granddaughter has learned
  every country on every continent. and so has her 85 year old grandmother! me!"
