 maui
known
as the the valley isle because its
valley was formed
between two volcanoes, maui has been rated
the best island in the world
12 years in a row by the readers of conde
naste magazine. there are
excellent beaches and water activities
including swimming, snorkeling, surfing,
scuba diving, parasailing,
sailing and fishing. maui is home to
lahaina, a historic 18th-century
whaling port. each year from january
through april, humpback whales
return to the warm shallow waters of maui
to give birth and nurse their
young. one of our favorite maui condos is
the mahana
at kaanapali where you can
watch the whales from your private lanai.
the sheraton
maui resort
is located on a section of kaanapali beach
rated the best is the united
states.

oahu
known as "the gathering place" oahu earns
its name as a mecca for
visitors and business people from east and
west. pearl harbor and the
uss arizona; the polynesian cultural
center are must-see historical
highlights. world famous waikiki beach
plays host to the majority of
vacationers; however, the island has much
more to offer than that
hustle and bustle! beautiful golf courses,
spectacular hiking trails,
panoramic vistas, intriguing historical
points of interest, museums,
beautiful white sand beaches and many
other treasures await those who
explore beyond the boundaries of waikiki.
during winter months you can
marvel at surfers riding 30 foot waves at
renowned sunset beach. 
we offer over 65 properties on oahu
including 
aston waikiki beach hotel and hilton
hawaiian
village. our waikiki condos include
the moderate
priced aston waikiki sunset and the deluxe
aston waikiki
beach tower.

kauai
known as "the garden island" kauai
is
considered to be one of the most beautiful
locations in the world. lush
green mountains, hundreds of waterfalls,
and waimea canyon which is
known as the grand canyon of the pacific.
the abundance of forested
environment makes this a nature lovers
paradise. you will find far
fewer visitors than on maui or oahu. kauai
is a serene island with a
multitude of spectacular beaches. however,
many of the beaches are
classified as nonswimming due to large
waves and rip currents. kiahuna
plantation in poipu is the only
condo property located directly on
an excellent swimming beach. next door is
the sheraton
kauai resort.
the grand
hyatt
kauai resort & spa is an
outstanding property with huge
pool, waterslides, salt water lagoon and
anara spa.

big
island
of hawaii
known as "the big island", it is
twice as
large as all of the other major
hawaiian islands combined. at about
800,000 years old it is the
youngest in the chain and is still
growing.
the hawaii volcanos national
park contains one of the world's most
active volcanos which continues
to
pour into the sea adding to the shoreline.
from its snow capped peaks
to its black and white sand beaches the
island is really a study in
contrasts. rocky deserts and lush rain
forests. peaceful bays and
rolling pasture land. luxurious orchids
and waterfalls on the windward
side, and areas on the western slopes
where the world famous kona
coffee is grown. 
our favorite vacation rentals include
oceanfront condos such as kona
by the sea
and waikoloa
colony
villas in the resort area by hilton
waikoloa
village.
