robust us economy may not need trump's big reforms

"success for the trump administration would be to do no harm to the exceptionally performing economy it is inheriting," said mark zandi, chief economist at moody's analytics. on their face, the planned combination of tariffs, deportations, and deficit-funded tax cuts "will do harm. how much ... depends on how aggressively these policies are pursued."


referring to recent u.s. performance that has outstripped that of other developed nations and surprised many economists, dynan said that "if you believe the economic growth in excess of trend is from immigration, it is going to be hard to get numbers as large as we saw in the latter part of the biden administration."

how big oil made it harder to fight the los angeles fires

jacobin: how big oil made it harder to fight the los angeles fires

the new report, released wednesday by the climate center, a think tank focused on california climate solutions, details how oil and gas companies and their allies used campaign donations, lobbying dollars, and legal pressure to establish a tax loophole that allows corporations to reduce their taxable state income by avoiding reporting foreign profits and losses, if the company elects to do so.


this tax loophole, called the âwaterâs edge election,â is californiaâs largest business tax break. the loophole allows corporations to avoid paying more than $4.3 billion in state corporate tax revenue each year and specifically gives oil and gas companies upward of $146 million in annual tax breaks, researchers found.

all new york city hospitals now serve vegan food as default 

november 19, 2022


while meat-based options remain available, the two daily chefâs specials are now always plant-based. so far, the program has been hugely successful, with over half of patients opting for the plant-based dishes and 95% saying they were satisfied with their choice.


initially, the plant-based meals were only offered at lunchtimes, but they have proved so popular that the scheme will be extended to dinner. this is despite the fact that only 1% of patients identify as vegetarian or vegan.

guardian: plant-based meat by far the best climate investment, report finds

the report from the boston consulting group (bcg) found that, for each dollar, investment in improving and scaling up the production of meat and dairy alternatives resulted in three times more greenhouse gas reductions compared with investment in green cement technology, seven times more than green buildings and 11 times more than zero-emission cars.

diet-related greenhouse gas emissions down

anthropocene: a 15-year snapshot of us diets reveals a gradual shift away from beef

by using data from a national dietary survey of us adults between 2003 and 2018, and conducting a life cycle analysis on the reported foods, the researchers found that the diet-related greenhouse gas emissions of us citizens almost halved, falling from 4 kilograms of co2 equivalent to 2.45 kg co2e over the 15 year study period.


the main reason for this decline emerged clearly in the data: over this same period, daily beef consumption plummeted by an average 40% per person, which accounted for nearly half of the diet-related dip in emissions. but it wasnât just beef: the data showed a slow shift away from all animal-based foods, including dairy, eggs, chicken, and porkâall of which us citizens gradually consumed less of in 2018 than 2003.
