diversity, inclusion and belonging
the oeb department denounces all forms of racism, harassment and discrimination. further, we recognize the painful legacy of discrimination in which scientists of color working in all aspects of our field have been traumatized, discouraged, and made to feel unwelcome. the oeb diversity, inclusion and belonging (dib) committee is currently working on several initiatives to enable this change.
