last post at this blog! but, not to despair...





as most of you have seen i have changed the name of the blog recently from "just thinking..." to theo-enthumology. i just found that the name theo-enthumology was a more apt name for the blog.

however, the time has come to close this blog!

but, that does not mean that i am ceasing from my blogging activities! you see, the reason i am closing this blog is simply to stop posting at this old blog, which has my name in the url. i have decided to move my blog to a new url, that coincides with the name of the blog, theo-enthumology!

so, even though this blog is now closed, by exiting from this blog, simply scurry over to the new blog and follow the exit sign below and you will enter the new blog at the new address. please notice that the feed at the new blog is also new, so please update your feed reader.



exit here to go to the new theo-enthumology!

founder of sats debunks brian mclaren heresy







dr. christopher peppler
dr. christopher peppler wrote a very thought provoking, yet straight analysis of brian mclaren's heretical book "a new kind of christianity: ten questions that are transforming the faith."

dr. peppler takes each of the ten questions that mclaren posed in his book and analyses them for truth and clarity. peppler shows that while mclaren may have clarity in certain cases, that clarity has nothing to do with scriptural truth, or at least does not contain the primary nature of the truth of the scriptures and the gospel. in this blog post by dr. peppler, it is also shown how mclaren sets up straw men, just to knock down what does not exist!

in his conclusion, dr. peppler writes:
"it is good to ask questions and to seek  deep and satisfying answers. it is reasonable to agonise over a  christianity that has so often presented itself as harsh, loveless, and  power mad. it is evidence of a tender heart to wonder how a loving god  could consign the bulk of humanity to eternal conscious torment. but, it  is neither good or reasonable to attempt to recast the biblical  narrative, redefine the nature of the bible, and reformulate the  principles of interpretation in order to create answers that the seeker  finds acceptable. this is what i think brian has attempted to do."
to read dr. peppler's accurate assessment of mclaren's book read his blog post here.

tree63 front-man throws in the cross, um, towel





christian entertainment doesn't seem healthy, yet it also does. i know, it seems contradictory, and on the one hand it is, but on the other hand it isn't. there are christian musicians, actors, painters, and others who see their art not only for the art itself, but for the purpose of glorifying god and spreading the gospel message. for them, there is no ceiling to reach because, how do you reach a ceiling in glorifying god?

there are others who experience dissatisfaction when they either cannot make headway in their respectful arts and become the next big thing, or they have made it to the top and found that their dissatisfaction remains, despite having "record deals, [being]  on planes, tour buses, in green vip rooms."

of course, recently we saw jennifer knapp come "out" to reveal that she is a lesbian, and before that ray boltz dropped the bomb that he was gay!

evangelical gullibility fuels the flames of "fairy tales as truth"





it has happened to all of us. some person with a so-called testimony akin to paul's damascus experience visits your church and tells you his story. the story is extremely well told, interspersed with tear-jerking sad stories and side-splitting funny anecdotes, with a smattering of heroics.

the person seems to be so nice that we just can't help ourselves liking and believing this person. if we don't believe him, then our subjective ideas of salvation to christianity will not be confirmed. so, we believe, because it is so great that a satanist or a muslim had come to christ and now have such an awesome testimony for christ! surely, this is the person god had been waiting for to get those amazing in-roads among satanists and muslims!

men and women pastors, or not?





have you ever thought whether women may be pastors in the church or not? most modern christians have.

kevin deyoung, senior pastor at university reformed church in  east lansing, michigan, has written an analysis of chapter 12 (“women, men and god”) of john stott's book, issues  facing christians today (4th edition, zondervan,  2006).

kevin tackles the issue in go big or go home: why complemegalitarian doesn’t work, part 1, part 2 and part 3.

how to find a church





for those who are serious about what they are fed from the pulpit, it becomes a daunting task to find a church where the truth is preached unadulterated. here in south africa there is a proliferation of churches that merely skim the scriptures and never get to the meat. they keep on feeding their people fast-food, and hence their people can no longer handle the true meat of the scriptures.

so, looking for a church is not easy. dan phillips has written a blog post that helps us to search for a church. unfortunately his post is written very much for the american scene, but there is much to gain from his post.

love is perpendicular





love isn't easy. especially love to those that irritate us. one of my pet peeves here in south africa is the way people drive, especially the taxis. they are just plain dangerous. i find this very irritating and i truly find it difficult in those situations to show love to people that drive without following the rules of the road and drive like maniacs.

as christians, we are called to love one another, because this is how the world will know that we are his disciples (jn 13:35).

the question is, what about those that are not christians?

profaning the gospel for the sake of 'contextualization'





wanting to be relevant, the church has become sick beyond repair! that is, repair driven by the church itself.

pastors, wanting to 'contextualize' the gospel have turned to profanity ('swear words') in their sermons. these contextualizers, or relevantizers, simply do not believe that the gospel is "the power of god for salvation to everyone  who believes." (rom 1:16)

phil johnson writes about these types:
"see, i think this whole approach to ministry reflects a fatal lack of  confidence in the power of the gospel itself. if we really believed the  gospel is the power of god unto salvation, why would we  think it necessary to dress the message in such shabby rags?"preachers such as these simply bring disrepute to the gospel of jesus christ and show what they truly put their trust in for the salvation of their hearers!
