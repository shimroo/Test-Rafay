welcome to photography.ca! 
the goal of photography.ca is to teach peo­ple how to become bet­ter pho­tog­ra­phers and pro­duce their own fine art pho­tog­ra­phy. 
 
we do this pri­mar­ily through a free, super-friendly pho­tog­ra­phy forum. we also pub­lish arti­cles on pho­tog­ra­phy as well as a free monthly pho­tog­ra­phy pod­cast with over 100 episodes to date.
 
in order to inspire peo­ple, we also fea­ture the work of tal­ented fine art pho­tog­ra­phers from around the world.
