sefapp is a welcoming home for those who wish to gather together amongst like-minded individuals to share ideas, concerns, and suggestions. in addition to the more formal conferences, there are sunday brunches and movie presentations that allow for time to mingle and get acquainted with colleagues and friends. students of all levels find sefapp a place to learn, as well as to find support in the pursuit of their careers.


 

the southeast florida association for psychoanalytic psychology (sefapp), formed in 1987, is a local chapter of the society for psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic psychology: (division 39) of the american psychological association.
