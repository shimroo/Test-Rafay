rosana eckert 



vocalist, arranger, composer, & educator 















































				"...a world-class artist, fluent in many genres, and absolutely compelling as a vocalist and composer."			

thomas cunniffe, jazz history online








				"...one of the best scatters around..."
			

scott yanow, jazz journalist & historian








				“bright and imaginative… she has a giving and generous musical personality that manifests in her broad format and genre palette…"			

c. michael bailey, allaboutjazz.com








				“… beautiful tone quality, excellent intonation, horn-like phrasing, and an approach to improvising more like than of an instrumentalist than a vocalist… it is a style that is, to me, reminiscent of miles davis.”			

marvin stamm, internationally renowned trumpeter
