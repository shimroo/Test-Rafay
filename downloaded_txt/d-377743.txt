        consulting    








as a jewish art consultant, laurie is available to assist on any upcoming redesigns. bringing in someone with an artistic understanding in the crucial early stages of a project can help limit later worry and heartache. in addition to projecting realistic budgets for the artwork and religious objects that will fill your space, laurie also works closely with project architects to ensure these objects will fit seamlessly into their design plans. thus helping ensure that your needs and wants as a client are fully met and avoiding surprise costs at the conclusion of the project.
