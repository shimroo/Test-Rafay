welcome to alice cook house

build meaningful relationships between residents and faculty.
create opportunities for intellectual exploration that lead to a deeper understanding of one's discipline, exposure to a broad range of knowledge, and a desire to be a lifelong learner.
encourage student engagement in the house system and provide opportunities for the development of student leadership skills.
provide opportunities for students to engage as citizens in the broader community.
help students navigate the opportunities available to them at cornell.
