shared hosting ipower – $3.99/month for the first term; renews at $8.99/month. - shared hosting godaddy – $ 2.99/month for the first term; renews at $7.99/month.- shared hosting bluehost – $3.95/month for the first term; renews at $7.99/month.⌛ reliabilitythe purpose of ipower is to offer the customers a great experience when accessing their website. however, there is no mention of uptime guarantee on their page. this is a big disadvantage for them, as other top companies mention it. there is already a big competitiveness in the industry regarding uptime guarantees, and no mention just lowers their chances of remaining in the top.🏢 data centeripower has two data centers in boston, ma area. these are equipped with 24x7 security and function on n+1 power.✍️ customer supporttheir customer support is available 24/7. when needed, customers can contact them by phone, live chat or email. besides these, you can access their knowledgebase any time. however, there are many complains coming from customers regarding the speed of the response provided by the team and the quality of it. nevertheless, each experience is different.🔨 control panelunlike other companies that generally use cpanel, ipower uses vdeck control panel. it has a friendly interface and it is generally easy to use.🎯 conclusionipower offers great facilities to future customers and it is very competitive on the market. some prices might seem a little higher than others offered by other top companies, though. their customer support team might not satisfy the customers’ demands, and the time taken for a response is considered way too long. overall, ipower is a great company, coming with efficient plans and good prices.🌏 server locations:   boston📢 special pagescontact us: https://www.ipower.com/support/contact.htmlabout us: http://www.ipower.com/ipower/about/index.bmlterms of service: https://www.ipower.com/legal/service level agreement: https://www.ipower.com/legal/legal-useragreement.htmlprivacy: https://www.endurance.com/privacy/privacy?_ga=2.79693975.1080941213.1592485829-1169783968.1592485827acceptable use policy: https://www.ipower.com/legal/legal-aup.htmlknowledge base: https://www.ipower.com/helpwebsite research for ipower on march 30, 2019 by webhostingtop🎁 ipower promotionsthere is no coupon code or promotion listed.ipower listed plans🔧 shared -

still live and operational after i had cleared out every scrap of data from their servers. they refused to admit any liability, in fact they didn't reply to me at all for weeks, and then cancelled my hosting, refused to give me a refund of eleven months hosting fees, and bilked me on introducers commissions for hosting plans that i had sold through my website.i get no pleasure from saying i told

or any support beyond reboots or complete reinstalls ($50).we had a recent problem with our server, (updated that removed all logins to email plesk) and i had to request a ticket to have them reinstall, once they reinstalled the os, my plesk interface was not added, so i had to request it.  once plesk was added the license was not setup correctly.  two days later and 16 hours of my work time was wasted before the server was running.2/25/07 a maintenance outage caused the server to go down and is still down.the base technical support is not very helpful and they have lousy attitudes.go with another dedicated provider.👍 79 out of 👉 138 users found this review to be helpful!📅 dec 31, 2006tom wu (-no email-) ⏳ time hosted: over 3 yearsglobal ratingfeatures costcustomer

around over four years ago, and ipowerweb easily offered the best deal i could find.  one thing i really liked was the simplicity of the package, no nickle-and-diming over additional "premium" features -- the base package was full-featured and provided as much flexibility and control as possible.  it's like they designed it to be the kind of web host they would want to have themselves.  i haven't had a single bad experience in all this time, not even a small one.  each time i have asked a question to technical support, i have promptly gotten a good answer.  no bad surprises in service or fees (but some good ones).  they have upgraded the services all along, and i think the deal they offer now is way better than what i started with.  i am just very comfortable with the service and
