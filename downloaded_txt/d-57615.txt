“
the most powerful part of nyu journalism has been the human connections and the community that supports me at every step. if i face challenges or big decisions, i know the people at nyu journalism—professors, career services, alumni, and former classmates—will be there to help me and to cheer me on.



yamiche alcindor
ma 2015, washington correspondent at nbc news





“
career services at nyu journalism was absolutely the deciding factor for me in choosing this over other colleges. they were able to give me realistic and specific answers when i asked how they could help me find the kind of job i wanted to build my career.



nidhi prakash
ma class of 2014, reporter with 15 years experience: national politics, natural disasters and climate change, inequities, national news





“
i choose nyu for so many reasons — but also because of its proximity to some of the best stories and internship opportunities in the world. i was born and raised here in new york, and grew up witnessing the truth in the phrase "if you can make it here you can make it anywhere." it seemed like a no-brainer.



sabrina franza
ba class of 2019, reporter with cbs chicago





“
i loved the community feel at nyu journalism. everyone was always eager to help out when it came to career advice, feedback on my reporter reel, or just learning the ropes when it came to storytelling. i also loved how my professors had successful careers in news outside of teaching.



reena roy
ba class of 2013, abc news correspondent
