backyard boxing





two black teenagers box eachother with little skill. the guy in red has height and easy delivers punches on the guy in white. he tries to walk away but the other guy won't let him get away that easy and knocks him down, way to be a friend.

flailing teenagers





classic kid fight: kids grab each other's shirts, lower their heads, and swing wildly without any power at their opponent. kid in black shirt wins with two hits while the guy in the white shirt lands only one shot. the only things damaged in this fight is the guy's white shirt and both their egos.

break dancer vs. kid





i know this isn't a fight but that girl is gonna feel like she got into one when she wakes up tomorrow. way to go parents for focusing all your attention on a break dancer and totally ignoring your kid.
