anna maria island resort & hotel faqs





what is the best anna maria island resort hotel for families?


most of our resorts have heated community pools however we have some special resorts that fill specific needs better than others. for example south beach village is a fantastic resort if you are looking for 3 bedroom vacation resort properties. blue lagoon is fantastic for families if you are looking for a lushly landscaped gigantic pool with large waterfall. vista grande is a direct gulf front luxury resort right on the beach all containing 3 bedrooms. finally, if you are looking for a resort that allows you to leave your vehicle at home and walk to plenty of shops and restaurants then south beach village resort or palm isle village are two great choices.




are there any pet friendly hotels or resorts on anna maria island?


yes, palm isle village, blue lagoon and starfish beach cottages are three great picks. all close to the beaches of anna maria island and all are located in holmes beach.




what are the best beachfront hotel-resort on anna maria island?


hidden cove as well as anna maria island club are two great beach front resorts on anna maria island. hidden cove is located in holmes beach while anna maria island club is in bradenton beach.




which hotels or resorts are the most affordable?


typically affordability relates to number of bedrooms as well as distance to the beach. palm isle village has several one bedroom condos available and seacrest ii and starfish beach cottages are great choices for 2 bedroom affordable places to stay on anna maria island.




what is the difference between a resort and a hotel?


a hotel is geared more towards nightly stays with daily maid service. common areas in hotels are inside and outside and shared by many guests. some hotels have restaurants on site. resorts are much more private, they typically have a community heated pool that is less densely populated without daily maid service although that can easily be arranged if the guest chooses. resorts have full kitchens to allow cooking inside as well as bringing home left overs. the style of our resorts are more friendly to covid concerns and ultimately less guest using common areas than hotels. hotels create standard amenities throughout while resorts are often decorated and owned by individual owners. most resorts offer remote entry so no need to visit an office to gain access while most hotels require a check in process that can be avoided by staying in a resort.
