i soon will be experimenting with and using yahoo! 360’s new platform for blogging and sharing of content. most of that will supplant what is being done on this blog. yahoo! 360 allows me to set certain controls such as “who sees what” on the site.anyone who wants access to my new blog, please send me an email for access: allen_weiner@yahoo.com
