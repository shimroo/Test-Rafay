​saturday, january 25m 8:00pm concert by john flynn!​​ tickets:  app.arts-people.com/index.php?ticketing=folk ​john flynn is a delaware-based singer/songwriter who unapologetically offers up shining songs of hope from a heart that has been sculpted by decades of standing at the margins with "the lost and the lonely, the shackled and scarred".  deana mccloud, a prior executive director of the woody guthrie center in tulsa, oklahoma called john "the real deal," saying, "his work follows in the footsteps of woody guthrie, pete seeger, kris kristofferson, and other social justice troubadours as he speaks the truth and gives a voice to society's disenfranchised.” john is also the founder and executive director of new beginnings-next step, inc., a non-profit that works with incarcerated and returning citizens to help them build the resilience necessary to surmount the challenges of prison and reentry.flynn has received the phil ochs award, and the champion of justice/humanitarian award from the national association of criminal defense lawyers. past winners include stevie wonder, janet reno, julian bond, and sister helen prejean.flynn has recently been named the permanent host of the storied philadelphia folk festival. john has also cowritten a new song with kris kristofferson called "kris's rules". the song is flynn's farewell to his long-time hero and friend and, with the permission of lisa kristofferson, features some previously unrecorded lyrics by kris.“you want a bad ass folk cat who tears off pieces of his soul, rhymes them and lays lyrics that bleed on melodies that even poet angels smoking cigarettes in the alleys of seventh heaven envy and soulful little demons hanging around detroit recording studios all wishing they could sing like him? well then, john flynn is your man.”-- ray wylie hubbard
