about arc


        the austin record convention is the largest sale of recorded music
        in the usa. from the 78's of the 1930s, to cds (and probably even a
        few 8-track tapes!), there are over one million 78s, 45s, lps, cds,
        cassettes, posters, collectibles and music-related memorabilia available
        here than at any one time, anywhere else in the country.
      

        over 300 different dealers from all over the u.s.a. and europe are spread
        out over 40,000 square feet of floor space. the show is so big that to
        see everything takes most of the weekend!
      







            the greatest record store in the known universe for three days only.
