sustainability & health and safety
whilst the design, colour, texture and finish of a wood floor is important, our forests are a precious resource. we feel itâs important to ensure that the timber used to create our bespoke wood flooring is grown and harvested to maintain and where possible enhance, the biodiversity and ecosystem of each forest.
many of our floors are available with fscâ® and pefc certification, to ensure that the floor you select has been sourced with care and consideration for the environment, plus the social and economic well-being of forest workers, in mind.
the well-being of our own teams and those we work with is also important to us, and to this end we are fully accredited within the british assessment bureau iso 9001:2015 and iso 14001:2015 scheme.
