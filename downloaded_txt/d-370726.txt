a message from the nike family



the nike group is a privately owned limited company, now being managed by the “second generation”. from the luxury hotel to facilities for the leisure sports of skiing, supported by everything from manufacturing, builder’s merchandising and a petrol station.
the companies that make up the nike group may be diverse, in both location and business interests, but they do have something in common – they are all actively involved in the communities in which they are situated. whether it be charity work, caring for the environment, or community support, the companies and their staff strive to give something back to the local area.
