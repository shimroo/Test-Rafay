technology

  i build, write, and edit using anything 
  from hand-coded html and css 
  to source-code management systems, 
  static-site generators and 
  github or gitlab with ci/cd workflows.

  i built, wrote, and edited 
  code.kx.com
  for kx and converted the companyâs 
  documentation workflows to markdown under git 
  source control.

  i also design and typeset documents for printing.

tools
  bash, css, docbook, dyalog, git, html, hugo, jekyll, javascript, 
  json, kdb+, latex, markdown, mkdocs, node, q, python, 
  regex, renderx, scss, xml, xslt, xsl-fo, yaml.

communication

  i write clearly, accurately, and with punch.

  besides coding, my writing is supported by
  a degree in philosophy and psychology,
  and years in sales and marketing.

  i am a careful listener, a thoughtful analyst, 
  and a competent negotiator.
  for 
  kx systems
  i agreed with the core team and users 
  revisions to the vocabulary that made the 
  q language reference 
  possible.











freedom from ir35

  you and i define and agree a project.
  i work my own hours on my own premises and equipment,
  sometimes with apprentices.

  we have no contract, you have no obligation 
  to provide me work, and 
  i do not need access to your systems or premises.

  my service cannot be characterised 
  as âdisguised employmentâ,
  and you have no liability under ir35.


  in 1998 i registered lambent technology ltd to provide my services,
  in 2009 i read
  âsome reflections on company law reformâ
  and closed the company.
  i am a sole trader.

i guarantee my work




i guarantee my work

  if my work ever falls short of good value, i need to know.
  right away.

  discount the total on my invoice 
  to the figure you consider correct. (even zero.)
  pay that, and tell me how to improve.

  your explanation will be worth more to me than the discount.
