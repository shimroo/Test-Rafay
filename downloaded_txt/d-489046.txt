local's tip
have you seen all the beautiful white stone around redstone?  you’ll see it in sculptures, as stairs, and raw pieces of it on the lawns of houses. this beautiful stone is marble.  

it’s the same stone used in the tomb of the unknown solider and the lincoln memorial. it’s found deep in the yule mine in marble, co just a few miles south on highway 133. yule marble is unique because it is one of the world's only pure white lines.
