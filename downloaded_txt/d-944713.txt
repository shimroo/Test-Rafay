online business sold

  i can't say enough good things about esvon and their classified ad 
software. i've been working with them for almost three years and i'm on 
my third site. their technical support and response times are fantastic 
and i've used them for all of the core/db mods and enhancements that 
i've made. i couldn't image writing this code from scratch or using some 
other vendors package. btw the first esvon site i launched recently sold 
for a mid 6 figure (us$) amount.

exceptional product and support

  i have recently purchased a copy of esvon classifieds and could not be
happier. not only is this an exceptional product but the service and support
is second to none. i have had several difficult modifications completed by
esvon, each one was completed ahead of schedule and beyond expectation. i
would not hesitate to recommend their products or services and will
definitely continue doing business with them in the future.

unparalleled customization and flexibility

  one night i was surfing the web as i had done for months, looking for something to jump start my project...
and i found the esvon classified ad system.  i tried the demo and "saw some
things" in the system that made me think that i could take it and use it to "build upon" and get what i
wanted.  i was certain after i looked at some sites that they referred me to that were using their system... what i
saw in these sites was a level of customization and flexibility built into the basic system.  the
differences in the sites... from the esvon demo site, to each of the user sites, demonstrated this flexibility!

  i have built three (3) uniquely different web sites using esvon classified ad system. 
each site is related and provides a part of the total project. working together... a client
can participate in any one or all three.  five years ago, i was quoted over $25,000 for custom programming what
i now have accomplished for a fraction of the cost!  support has been fantastic!  i could not have done it without
the esvon classified ad system.  oh, one more thing... my sites have nothing to do with classified ads!

feature-rich program, with great speed and scalability

  superb software! we looked at others, and esvon classifieds is by far the
most robust, feature-rich program, with great speed and scalability.  it is
fully customizable and anything you can't do yourself, esvon can customize
for you. their tech support is excellent. we had a lot of customization and
tech issues -- esvon took care of us promptly and professionally. the
program is incredibly well designed and has made our website a huge success.

cms for large sites

  i have been a very satisfied esvon customer for 6 years now. i run various 
websites and every time i need a reliable solution for a large and dynamic website 
i always turn to esvon. i actually use esvon classifieds as the most fully featured 
and supported cms i have found, with features that most cms programs don't offer. 
in short, the software does what i want it to, it is very flexible, it can be used 
'out of the box', it has great email support and for such a feature rich product 
it is reasonably priced. i highly recommend esvon classifieds not only as classifieds ads 
software but an easy to manage cms for large sites.

robust script in day to day functioning

  i must submit that esvon classifieds script is a very robust script.
i have used a few other scripts earlier and i always had some problem or the other. 
with esvon everything is seamless, right from the installation stage to its day to day functioning.
also, the support provided is very good. there have been a couple of
occasions when i have had to ask them help with regard to some minor
changes to be made in the script. the response was very good.

retention and ad huge functionality, this is the one! support has been great 
and given the option to do it all over again, we would still choose esvon. 
this is a great solution that is well thought out and offers a whole host of features.
