"kaukau" is a pidgin slang word meaning "food" or "to eat."  the hawaiian term for food is `ai. the two theories on the origin of the word "kaukau" are the hawaiian word for table, pâkaukau, and the chinese word for food, chow chow.  in hawaii we say "we go kaukau!", i would say, "i hungry i like kaukau!" or "let's kaukau!"  the cuisine of hawaii is a fusion of foods brought by immigrants to the hawaiian islands, particularly of portuguese, chinese, filipino, japanese, korean, polynesian etc.
