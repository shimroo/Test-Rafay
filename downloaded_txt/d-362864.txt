the smith rock bald eagles (and others) get their cred at long last—celebrate it on january 5, national bird day



jan 4, 2025




you probably thought the bald eagle was already our national bird if you were like us. that's not the case. the great seal of the united states was created in 1782 when our victory over great britain was imminent. even that took an act of congress to happen. well, it took another one to make baldy our national bird and signed into law on december 23, 2024. here at smith rock, we’ve always held them in high esteem, fawning over their mating and nesting rituals for over a decade since they chose a favorite spot where we watch them nourish their young each year until they fledge.
