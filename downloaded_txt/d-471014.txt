mustang gtd the fastest, most powerful production mustang in history


by shnack on monday, september 16, 2024			

 comments (0)







the all-new 2025 mustang gtd – the apex of any mustang ever engineered by ford – sets a new performance bar with 815 horsepower, 664 pound-feet of torque and a top speed of 202 miles per hour, the most of any street-legal mustang ever.
the certified horsepower and torque, along with the mustang gtd’s cutting-edge active aerodynamics, carbon-ceramic brakes, and inboard-rear suspension with semi-active dampers are key elements as mustang gtd prepares to deliver on the promise of an official sub-seven-minute lap of the nürburgring. 
"we’ve been laser focused since day 1 to make mustang gtd the first-ever supercar with world-class performance and the soul of a mustang,” said mustang gtd chief program engineer greg goodall. “gtd's heart is its supercharged 5.2-liter v8, packing more horsepower per liter than the porsche 911 gt3 rs.”

the first-ever ford mustang gtd

dearborn, mich., aug. 17, 2023 – deep inside a metal storage garage hidden behind a wind tunnel building in allen park, mich., a handful of team members gathered in 2021 for a new, after-hours mission that on paper felt like an impossible dream: design a mustang to take on the best of european sports cars.
the result is a limited-edition, ultra high-performance street legal performance car with the soul of a mustang.
debuting today is the all-new 2025 ford mustang® gtd, a technological tour de force inspired by the mustang gt3 slated to race in le mans next year. unapologetic in its heritage, unbelievable in its performance, its sculpted mostly carbon fiber wide body and looming rear wing says everything in just a glance. this is like no mustang ever.
“mustang gtd shatters every preconceived notion of a supercar,” said jim farley, ford president and ceo. “this is a new approach for us. we didn’t engineer a road car for the track, we created a race car for the road. mustang gtd takes racing technology from our mustang gt3 race car, wraps it in a carbon fiber mustang body and unleashes it for the street.”

wind tunnels have long been used to design and test aerodynamic and energy efficient vehicles. now, ford has combined the latest wind tunnel technology with the equivalent of a vehicle-sized treadmill to help create its next-generation of production vehicles, including the all-new mustang dark horse.
capable of simulating wind and road surface speeds of 200 mph, the rolling road wind tunnel (rrwt) supports testing for efficient and performance-driven vehicles across the ford lineup – including the next generation of ford electric, hybrid and gas vehicles.

ford is spreading the holiday cheer this season by giving mustang fans exactly what they had on their wish list: more horses across every engine offering for the all-new, seventh-generation 2024 mustang, including 500 horsepower with the mustang dark horse. 
“mustang has always pushed the envelope. from mustang gt to dark horse, this is our best 5.0-liter v8 yet. it’s naturally aspirated awesomeness,” said ed krenz, mustang chief engineer. “and mustang ecoboost fans are also getting a boost in power to make every mustang more fun and visceral to drive.”

ford introduces mustang dark horse and new family of track-only race ponies

with sinister looks and a specially modified 5.0-liter v8 – the most powerful 5.0-liter v8 ever, projecting 500 horsepower – mustang dark horse expands the lineup and sets a new benchmark for american street and track performance that could only come in a mustang.
a special team of ford engineers, designers and experts worked for more than three years to create mustang dark horse, a street and track-capable performance mustang with striking visual cues and all the capability sports car lovers expect, right down to the available carbon fiber wheels from carbon revolution (late availability). mustang dark horse is the first new performance name for the brand since mustang bullitt was introduced in 2001.
“for decades, mustang has competed against the most premium brands on the greatest world stages and won,” said jim farley, ceo of ford motor company. “we surprised everyone, and we’re going to surprise them again with a track-capable mustang that puts a new level of performance, styling and american engineering in the hands of everyday customers who still want the thrill and excitement of a v8 sports car.”
