the gardenlaw website
your house is more than just bricks and mortar.it is your home,a sanctuary,a
    source of pride,a comfort. everyone tells you so: mortgage lenders, banks,
    estate agents,solicitors,s urveyors, architects, even the government - and
    they all make a living out of you! this does not finish when you have signed
    on the dotted line! then come the removal firms, diy, garden centres, utilities
    etc.
if you are paying for all these and more what rights and obligations do you
    have? gardenlaw was set up to answer some of these. it is the world's premier
    site in the field and has a unique discussion
    forum in which questions are posed and views expressed. each house has
    its own set of problems; its own history almost an ancestry which makes it
    what it is today. the deeds can be like a geneology and be just as fascinating
    as a family's own history.
what kind of topics can you find in gardenlaw? 
they are as varied as you and i but include:

do i own my fence? 
can my neighbour make me pay for the repair of the boundary wall? 
do i need planning permission for decking? 
the neighbours' trees overhang my garden what can i do? 
the roots are causing cracking in my conservatory can i have the tree
      removed? 
a tree preservation order is being broken.
adverse possession of some land - how do i claim it? 
cats dig up my plants, dogs bark all night, neighbours make my life a
      misery with their music.

read on! we hope this site will help you.
