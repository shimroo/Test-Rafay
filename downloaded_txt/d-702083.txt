who we are

the jackson audubon society (jas) is a chapter of the michigan audubon society. the mission of jas is to instill in the people of jackson county an interest, knowledge, and appreciation of birds and other wildlife.

we host monthly wildlife and conservation programs and introduce the public to birds during special walks at local and nearby birding areas. jas has many knowledgeable and recognized birders who are always happy to help someone new. we get together in december for a christmas bird count and we celebrate earth day every year at a public event with the jackson area outdoor coalition.

jas promotes sound conservation methods by helping restore wildlife habitat and by helping prevent pollution through education. we were instrumental in bringing back nesting peregrine falcons to downtown jackson. we encouraged consumers energy to turn its headquarters’ lights out during migration. our volunteers strive to provide a healthy marsh to encourage sandhill crane nesting at the haehnle sanctuary where hundreds of people and thousands of cranes congregate during the fall migration.

we preserve outstanding wildlife areas by actively managing the kate palmer sanctuary & the phyllis haehnle memorial sanctuary and educating the public through tours and events. jas partners with the michigan audubon society and national audubon society and other organizations that are working to conserve our natural resources and protect the environment.
