welcome
      







welcome to canines n ewe!my name is jennifer clark-ewers. here at canines n ewe i teach people and dogs to herd sheep. herding and working border collies has been a major part of my life for the past 25 years. during that time i have gained respect throughout the united states as a handler, trainer and judge of sheepdog trials. i have a systematic, direct, and supportive teaching approach to working with people and their dogs. i believe in developing individualized programs that match the strengths of the dog with the style of the owner. together with my husband, ron, we have developed a multifaceted sheepdog training facility that we hope will address the needs of the border collies and their handlers. i've put together this site to help you learn more about us, our facility, the dogs and people i work with.  please feel free to contact me for more specific information. i hope you'll come to visit us in beautiful plainview, arkansas!   






























thank ewe for visiting..
