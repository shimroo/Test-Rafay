the country’s most respected training program for environmental organizing












we're the field school for environmental organizing
green corps is named with intention. weâre green corps (not equality corps, not health care corps or some other corps) because the environment is the most important challenge the world faces today. with more than 400 graduates, green corps has been the countryâs most respected training program for environmental organizers for over 30 years. are you passionate about the environment? are you looking to learn how you can make a difference? if so, our yearlong program is the best place to start.

top-notch training. a ton of responsibility.
green corps offers two different opportunities for those looking to launch their careers in environmental organizing.
the organizer program is the core one-year paid training program that will prepare you for a career in environmental organizing and the broader social change movement. after eight weeks of intensive classroom training, organizers then gain hands-on experience working on at least three campaigns in different locations and learning how to organize a wide range of communities — from students and young people, to broader communities. to cap the year, you will learn how to oversee a fundraising office, where you will recruit and direct staff, raise grassroots funds, build a membership base, and more.
green corps also offers the campaigner program. this is a four-month crash course, combining classroom training and work on an environmental campaign, that serves as a great introduction to environmental advocacy and organizing. this experience will position you well to tackle a problem in your own community or be an asset to any environmental organization. at the end of the program, we will help top candidates pursue opportunities for advancement and additional training in the yearlong green corps organizer program or the broader social change movement.

why organizing
we train you to organize because organizing is what's necessary to save the planet.
there are plenty of ideas out there for solving environmental problems, from renewable energy to wilderness protection. however, there are not enough people out there who can transform these ideas into reality. that's what organizers do. we build people-powered organizations and run grassroots campaigns to change public policies and corporate practices. with green corps, you learn how to transform ideas into impact.

join the ranks of more than 400 green corps graduates who are tackling today's environmental challenges
our graduates use the skills and approach they learned at green corps in their careers every day to rise up and meet the most important challenges of our time: transitioning to clean, renewable energy; conserving our public lands to protect wilderness and wildlife rather than offering them up for fossil fuel extraction; and more.

"if thereâs anything iâve learned over the past 25 years, it is that we need more people who are trained in the art and science of organizing public support to effect change. there are many opportunities to learn but the best, in my opinion, is green corps."

"without green corps, i wouldn't have this behind-the-scenes insight into how you win a campaign — from media to fundraising to political strategy and everything in between. green corps gave me the foundation that i needed to go on to lead an organization like greenpeace."
