view collectionabout the collection
fine african artit all started as a passion and evolved into a business.  collecting african art is very much part of our life and selling these items has always been a tough process to endure.  after years of sourcing unique items directly from the continent of origin, our business developed into one where we now offer a service of assisting existing collections be liquidated and passed on to others that appreciate and love the art as we do, as the collectors do.
all too often, collectors find themselves in the predicament where the family does not necessarily have the same love for african art as they do and the longevity of the collection they have spent years assembling is now in question.  this dilemma becomes an opportunity for existing collections to acquire older, truly love items and have them now enhance their artcollections.
