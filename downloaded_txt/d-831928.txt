stories that illuminate and elevate the art of living
photo by robert brodey. gambia, 2008.
this website is
dedicated to presenting positive stories about the undying human spirit, which
overcomes adversity and nurtures a more positive and creative approach to
living. we believe these stories should be celebrated as a way of illuminating
the power of hope and imagination within all of us.
on december 18, 2020, human spirit celebrated its 17th year online. in the coming months, we hope to bring more stories that inspire the best in all of us.
we encourage you to
submit stories and/or links to be posted. contact: robert@cloudgazer.com.
