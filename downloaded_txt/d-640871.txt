datsun sports was started in 1981 when mike young, a seasoned san francisco master mechanic, set out to answer his true calling in life: to help others enjoy
datsun sports cars. for mike, this calling became a very deep obsession.
today mike's obsession grows unabated. fortunately for datsun roadster and
z car enthusiasts, this obsession has produced a gold mine.
thanks for stopping by! more cars available for sale than are shown here,

the datsun roadster has become a bit of an "invisible classic" in the world sports car scene. it appeared at a time when the japanese auto industry was not well respected, and few observers took much notice...

mike young’s datsun wins best of show at 2011 solvang car show
mike has a little trivia as well: richard klimmert, from the netherlands! is the long distance visitor!
solvang datsun show and vintage race report 5/1/11
(excerpted from z-car blog)
this year’s show brought datsun owners from all over the country and even the netherlands! there were 68 cars including roadsters, 510s, zs and others from showroom-stock examples to wildly modified beasts. here are a few show highlights from a roadster-ownerâs point of view; itâs not hard to see that we love our cars and there is a dedicated following to keep them on the road!
mike young is known as a top datsun restoration specialist and he won best in show with his fully restored and concourse-correct 1967.5 2000. this is the most coveted model of all datsun roadsters with less than 1000 cars produced and even fewer still in existence. mike has great attention to detail and it shows throughout the car even in the engine bay:
