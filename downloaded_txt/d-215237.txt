what people are saying...“whether or not you always agree with him, you will see in this book why michael novak is considered one of our most profound thinkers on the relationship between democracy, capitalism, and freedom. this memoir of his intellectual odyssey is both a compelling personal narrative and a provocative intellectual history of our times.”walter isaacsonpresident of the aspen institute, former chairman of cnn, former managing editor of time, and author of einstein and steve jobs



“anyone interested in the moral, personal, and intellectual journey of the last half century should read this memoir of the most important theologically inspired citizen i have ever worked with.”newt gingrich



“one of america’s greatest moral philosophers – the theologian of democratic capitalism – relives not only his own intellectual journey, but that of america: from the turbulent 1960s and ‘70s, through renewal in the 1980s and into an uncertain future in which his wisdom can be our guide. an enriching experience to read.”morton kondrackeroll call
