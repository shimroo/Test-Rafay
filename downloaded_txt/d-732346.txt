   how does your program work?

   




  under the 504 program, qualifying businesses can receive second mortgage financing for up to 40 percent of a project's cost or a maximum loan amount of $5,000,000. small manufacturers (primary naics code in sections 31, 32, and 33 and all production facilities located in the us) are now eligible to receive a maximum 504 loan of $5,500,000.a traditional loan package features 40 percent financing through the sba 504 program, 50 percent financing through a private lender, and an investment of 10 percent from the small business itself. [the small business investment may increase to 15-20 percent for start-ups, single-purpose real estate, or higher-risk industries]. this blended loan featuring joint private sector financing and sba 504 financing offers several advantages. first, up to 40 percent of the total loan is fixed at a rate typically near or below the market rate for a term of 10 or 20 years. additionally, madco takes a second mortgage position. therefore, private lenders are often more willing to provide financing since their 50 percent investment is secured by 100 percent of the assets. through the sba 504 program, the borrower is offered a long-term, fixed rate, and private lenders are offered greater collateral for their investment/risk.sba 504 loans may be used to finance the cost of fixed assets such as land, buildings, new construction, machinery and equipment, renovations, leasehold improvements, and associated soft costs such as title insurance, legal, appraisal, environmental, and bridge loan fees. sba 504 loan closing costs may be financed.

  the maturity on any 504 loan is either 10, 20, or 25 years, depending on the useful life of the assets. if a 504 loan has a maturity of 20 years, the participating lender's portion of the debt is required to have a maturity of at least 10 years. if the 504 loan has a maturity of 10 years, the participating lender's portion of the debt must have a maturity of at least 7 years.the rate on the sba portion is set when the cdc sells the bond (debenture) to fund your loan. the rate is then fixed for the term of the loan. 504 loans are amortized securities. for a historical reference on debenture pricing, you may contact the madco office. when the loan closes, your monthly payment will include servicing fees based on the declining balance of the sba 504 loan: 0.625% to cdc; 0.368% to sba; and 0.100% to the central servicing agent.the fees on the sba 504 loan portion are approximately 2.75 percent. all of the fees on the 504 loan are added to the loan amount so that you can amortize their cost over the term of the loan.special notesthere is a prepayment penalty for the first half of the loan term on the sba 504 loan. payments on the sba 504 loan are made by ach debit to the borrowers designated checking account on the first of each month after the loan closes. payments on the 504 loan are separate from your payments on the 50 percent first mortgage loan.

  low down payment. in most cases, just 10 percent. let's preserve your cash for your working capital. .fixed rate on the sba 504 portion. 
 you don't have to worry about the prime lending rate going up. you can plan because you know the amount of your mortgage payments for the next 20 years.long term. 
 sba 504 loans are for 10 or 20 years. because the cdc/sba is in a second lien position, the bank or other lender doing the 50 percent first mortgage loan is willing to lend over the long term. longer terms make your monthly payments lower.low interest rate. 
 even with all the fees and closing costs included in the rate, it is still a low rate for a subordinate mortgage loan, particularly for small businesses. the blended rate between the bank portion and the sba 504 portion makes the project affordable to the borrower.the 504 program encourages banks and other lenders to make loans in the first position on reasonable terms, helps them retain growing customers, and provides community redevelopment act credit.



   how do i start the application process?

   




  although the loan process is neither lengthy nor complicated, the borrower or small business concern (sbc) will be required to provide documentation to enable the madco board of directors to evaluate the credit worthiness of the loan applicationthe sba 504 program may be the financing solution you're looking for. all required forms are available at the office of metro area development corporation, 1144 nw 50th street, oklahoma city, ok 73118.
