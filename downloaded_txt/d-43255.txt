this web site is devoted to those who love to crochet. my name is lisa hamblin and i have tried many different crafts (cross stitch, knitting, & plastic canvas to name a few) but i always end up returning to my first love, crocheting. 
i started crocheting when i was in the 7th grade. of course at that time i had to be shown stitches over and over before i could complete a project. a couple of people in my family crocheted when i was younger. i guess they were my inspiration. anyhow, i kept crocheting even when they didn't. it took me a very long time to figure out how to read patterns on my own. but with hard work and determination i finally learned how.
a special thank you to my husband, tim, who urged me to pursue my dream... having a website devoted to crocheting.

have entertained angels without knowing it."
