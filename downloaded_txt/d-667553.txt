i'm
                                        happy you are here!

for
                                        years i maintained a full time job,
                                        while supplementing my income with a p/t
                                        home-based word processing business;
                                        simply known as evelyn's typing service (dba
                                        emprints - named by using my
                                        initials).
my
                                        clientele list included authors,
                                        business executives, college students,
                                        engineers, lawyers, professors,
                                        restaurants...  i had keys to
                                        businesses located in the city to let
                                        myself in to pick up work in the evening
                                        and to drop it off when done along with
                                        an invoice.  others would have an
                                        appointment and come to my home. 
                                        living in the state capital and having
                                        my own word processing equipment were
                                        definite assets back then.




one
                                              notable event took place late in
                                              the evening after i received a
                                              call from my office supply sales
                                              rep requesting me to do some work
                                              for the city.  he said that
                                              there was a situation at the power
                                              plant, it was urgent and at that
                                              late hour they didn't know whom to
                                              call when my name came to mind. 
                                              reluctantly, i agreed.
on
                                              our local television late night
                                              news a reporter stated that the
                                              city was working on a solution
                                              proposal and would have it ready
                                              by morning.  what she didn't
                                              say was that the work was taking
                                              place in my house as she spoke.



april
                                        21, 1987 at the annual john
                                        george nicolay secretary
                                        appreciation seminar held in
                                        springfield, illinois, i received a
                                        scholarship from the
                                        greater springfield chamber of commerce
                                        as recognition. (a prestigious award
                                        in our community at the time)
that
                                        was the good old days!
all
                                        that changed on easter sunday 1994 when
                                        my husband rick experienced a severe
                                        base of the brain stroke at
                                        the age of 44. it left his entire
                                        right side along with his
                                        concentration, memory, cognitive skills
                                        and personality traits impaired. 
due
                                        to therapy, exercise and medications he
                                        has shown significant improvement along
                                        with his ability to walk. however, our
                                        lives changed dramatically!
i
                                        gave up my personal business to be with
                                        him.  he needed physical therapy,
                                        occupational therapy and speech therapy. 
                                        in rehab he was given children's
                                        computer games to play.   as
                                        he progressed, with the help of others i
                                        created the csc
                                        website for him to copy and paste emails
                                        sent to us by friends.
on
                                        aug. 17, 2008 he experienced a severe
                                        heart attack with 99.5% blockage. 
                                        several months later he fell breaking
                                        his nose and almost bled to death
                                        possibly due to his heart stopping and
                                        being on multiple blood thinners. 
                                        he was diagnosed with an irregular heart
                                        beat that may be causing him to pass
                                        out.
it's
                                        been quite a ride!

this
                                        website was created on jan 26, 2000 as
                                        my home business dba.  since then it
                                        has evolved into something entirely
                                        different.  emprints.com is
                                        now the flagship domain that i use for helping
                                        my husband rick
                                        since his injury.
i
                                        have gained a considerable amount of
                                        knowledge concerning mental and physical
                                        health issues including heart problems,
                                        strokes, diet, exercise, therapy,
                                        rehabilitation, anxiety, depression, attitude,
                                        faith, god, hope, patience...
if
                                        there's anything that i've learned, it's
                                        to never
                                        give up, god
                                        works in strange ways
                                        and that, he
                                        helps those that help themselves!



                                        i later revised the website christiansoldierscross
                                        to use as a therapy tool for rick to
                                        exercise his brain and fingers from
                                        home. 

i
                                        wrote the short, easy, fun to read book quiet
                                        angels,
                                        in
                                        an effort to do my part in giving hope
                                        to others living with severe depression. 
                                        it's a true story about
                                        my husband rick's
                                        near death experience, our dog that
                                        saved his life and years of recovery
                                        that is humorous and inspirational.
