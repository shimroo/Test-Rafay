google-plus gives me puss!



hello!! how are you?

i am fine.
i just spend too much time on facebook and not nearly enough time tending this garden!

 

today's rant: i hate google nagging me about google-plus. trying to get my cell phone number. trying to link my accounts. trying to mess with my youtube accounts. trying to tuck me in at night and burp me!!  i'm a grown woman, if an option is presented and i choose to ignore it, why must i be hounded? what is this? comply or die? they don't know me, if they did know me, they'd know i'm more stubborn than they will ever even think about being!

rant off.


join the nra. carry on!

facebook ruined for me now





wow. i can't believe it's been so long since i've been here to write anything!
 
i've been on facebook all this time. i enjoyed being on it too despite many, many annoying aspects....such as every time i turned around i had to go and check on my privacy setting and make sure what i wanted visible was visibile and what i wanted private remained private.
 
i had tons of friends and almost all my family members. it was a quick, painless way to see photos and jokes and risque posts as well as clean out my own political spleen when it got to me to see what a clown we have for a prez.
 
i know that facebook is free and as such we should be grateful for any little social crumb they scatter our way, but no one i know likes the timeline look. it is as amateurish and sophomoric as myspace ever thought about being. my daughter elaine says they don't want adults on it, they want kids. i guess kids are easier to deal with that mad as hell old ladies like me.
 
omg, i've completely forgotten how to write html. thank goodness for the free online html editors!
 
anyway, i'm most upset with facebook because i'm genetically programed to resist change on every level and once i've made up my mind it's a done deal. i can't begin to tell you how many mistakes i've made along the way, but if you can't stand up for your own personal code of standards and practices, then what good are they?
 
i'm going to miss mafia wars and my “family” both in the game and in real life. mafia wars basically sucks, but i'm so darn competitive that i took to it like a duck to a pond.

you, me & the aarp



pretty much everyone on the planet over the age of 50 has heard from the aarp telling them how they need to join to band together and go old in a group. yeah, yeah, yeah, and if you believe that you'll believe anything coming out of washington, d.c.!i've been real low key since the election. trying to keep my b.p. under control. doing the tea party thing, not so much in person as my energy wans as i do indeed grow older, but sending a few bucks from time to time.i got the below in email today and it is sooooo goooood, i felt compelled to come out from under my rock and let it fly!---------aarp's fall from gracesnopes: correctly attributed i find this very interesting reading, so let's keep it going if you agree.   it only takes a few days on the internet and this will have reached 75% of the public in the u.s.a.    seniors need to stand up for what is right, not what the politicians want or big corporations want.  this letter was sent to mr. rand who is the executive director of aarp. this lady not only has a grasp of 'the situation' but an incredible command of the english language!  dear mr. rand,              recently you sent us a letter encouraging us to renew our lapsed membership in aarp by the requested date. i know it is not what you were looking for, but this is the most honest response i can give you. our gap in coverage is merely a microscopic symptom of the real problem, a deepening lack of faith.            while we have proudly maintained our membership for several years and have long admired the aarp goals and principles, regrettably, we can no longer endorse it's abdication of our values. your letter specifically stated that we can count on aarp to speak up for our rights, yet the voice we hear is not ours. your offer of being kept up to date on important issues through divided we fail presents neither an impartial view nor the one we have come to embrace. we do believe that when two parties agree all the time on everything presented to them, one is probably not necessary. but, when the opinions and long term goals are diametrically opposed, the divorce is imminent.  this is the philosophy which spawned our 200 years of government.                  once upon a time, we looked forward to being part of the senior demographic. we also looked to aarp to provide certain benefits and give our voice a power we could not possibly hope to achieve on our own. aarp gave us a sense of belonging which we no longer enjoy. the socialist politics practiced by the obama regime and empowered by aarp serves only to raise the blood pressure my medical insurance strives to contain. clearly a conflict of interest there!             we do not understand the aarp posture, feel greatly betrayed by the guiding forces that we expected to map out our senior years and leave your ranks with a great sense of regret. we mitigate that disappointment with the relief of knowing that we are not contributing to the problem anymore by renewing our membership. there are numerous other organizations which offer discounts without threatening our way of life or offending our sensibilities.                 this obama regime scares the living daylights out of us. not just for ourselves, but for our proud and bloodstained heritage. but even more importantly for our children and grandchildren. washington has rendered soylent green a prophetic cautionary tale rather than a nonfiction scare tactic. i have never in my life endorsed any militant or radical groups, yet now i find myself listening to them. i don’t have to agree with them to appreciate the fear which birthed their existence. their borderline insanity presents little more than a balance to the voice of the socialist mindset in power. perhaps i became american by a great stroke of luck in some cosmic uterine lottery, but in my adulthood i choose to embrace it and nurture the freedoms it represents as well as the responsibilities it requires.                 your website generously offers us the opportunity to receive all communication in spanish. are you kidding???  the illegal perpetrators have broken into our 'house', invaded our home without our invitation or consent. the president has insisted we keep these illegal perpetrators in comfort and learn the perpetrator’s language so we can communicate our reluctant welcome to them.          i  don't choose to welcome them.       i don’t choose to support them.             i  don't choose to educate them.             i  don't choose to medicate them, pay for their food or clothing.          american home invaders get arrested.             please explain to me why foreign lawbreakers can enjoy privileges on american soil that americans do not get?             why do some immigrants have to play the game to be welcomed and others only have to break & enter to be welcomed?          we travel for a living. walt hauls horses all over this great country, averaging over 10,000 miles a month when he is out there. he meets more people than a politician on caffeine overdose. of all the many good folks he enjoyed on this last 10,000 miles, this trip yielded only one supporter of the current regime. one of us is out of touch with mainstream america. since our poll is conducted without funding, i have more faith in it than ones that are driven by a need to yield amnesty.  (aka -  make voters out of the foreign lawbreakers so they can vote to continue the government’s free handouts).   this addition of 10 to 20 million voters who then will vote to continue socialism will overwhelm our votes to control the government’s free handouts.  it is a “slippery slope” we must not embark on!   as margret thatcher (former prime minister of great britain) once said “socialism is great - until you run out of other people’s money!”      we have decided to forward this to everyone on our mailing list, and will encourage them to do the same... with several hundred in my address book, i have every faith that the eventual exponential factor will make a credible statement to you.             i am disappointed as hell.                i am scared as hell.    i am angry !!           i am mad as hell, and i'm not gonna take it anymore!                    walt & cyndy                      miller farms equine transport   please keep this moving forward.(in internet lingo: if enough people pass this on it will “go viral”). ps. the end of an error – november 09,2010-------------amen.

ranting about teevee



howdy, y'all!yep, i live and breathe.  long time no post, but there's a good reason for it. i've been up to my ears in facebook. well, okay, to be honest, i've been up to my ass in mafia wars *on* facebook.  i'm having fun. two of my three daughter with mafia wars accounts have quit playing for various reasons, most of which is that zynga's programmers have messed it up so much it can be more frustration than elation when playing. since i don't work outside the home (thank you god and john!), i have more time to mess with the game and i'm just stubborn enough to put up with a lot of the game's bullcorn as a way of beating it before it beats me!but that's not what i want to rant about. the most glaring failing of facebook is that it's not easy writing anything with any substance or length and anyone who's ever read me knows i can go on and on about pert near nothing! therefore i had to come here to express myself!today i'm unhappy with tv and can't just sit there and stifle the rage a minute longer. (i do so love the cathartic aspect of bloglines!)i watch tv while i'm playing mafia wars. don't really have to think when doing either one. i've said before that i watch everything with 'crime', 'forensics', 'cops', and cop related in the title. i'm a huge fan of mysteries and i'm alternately horrified and fascinated with true crime and i like seeing how the good guys catch the bad guys.  i know that real life isn't like tv and that solving crimes doesn't happen in 30 or 60 minutes, but i'd rather watch those kinds of show than the caca i'm going to slam.case in point: the bad girls club, prison wives, i (almost) got away with it, little miss perfect, i didn't know i was pregnant (that worked for the virgin mary maybe, but get real people!), operation repo, etc., etc., etc.  i'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer by any means, but how anyone with any brains at all can watch any of the shows i've specified much less the dozens of others that pander to idiots is beyond me. you couldn't pay me to watch any of them!prison wives: i've never liked anything that glorifies criminals and i'm sure i'm not alone in my thinking that anyone who hooks up with someone in prison is beyond pathetic. it's one thing, i guess, to have your spouse carted away, but to go out of your way to communicate with people that are tried and convicted of a crime is just goofy. who on god's green earth needs a prison penpal? i'm not going to debate the merits of those that might be innocent of the crime(s) they were convicted of...i'm sure that happens, since the criminal justice system is not infallible, but to hear them tell it they are all innocent victims of the system and that's just not possible imho.as for those on the outside that seek those on the inside, fine, do what you want with your life, fool yourself, but don't try and fool me via tv. who cares if you fell in love with a convict? the one commercial for prison wives that makes me laugh out loud is when i gal says "his face just lights up when he sees me"....frankly the lady speaking is a bow-wow complete with wagging tail! hell yes he lights up, he's got someone to give him money and commiserate with him about how unfair life is to separate true love, etc. and she's never going to get a clue. he has it made! my momma used to call it having "a bird's nest on the ground".the show little miss perfect makes me sick. i've never watched any of the shows i'm writing about....all i watch is the commercials for them that i'm force fed during the breaks. i dvr a bunch of the stuff i watch and can fast forward, but a good portion of the time i'll just sit and bear it. little miss perfect brings back images of jonbenet ramsey. it's just wrong to dress up and make up a child into a 30 year old hooker! shame on the mothers especially when they claim the children are the ones insisting they want to participate. whatever happened to just saying no? you know, if those little girls play their cards right they could grow up to hook up with some loser in prison and generate another tv show...i was a child beauty queen who grew up too fast and too dumb to know better.the dumbing down of america is alive and well and living in every aspect of our lives. pants on the ground. brains on hold. the right blames the left and the left blames bush. how can one educate when it's so much easier to just sit back and infiltrate instead? the saddest part is that the ignorant don't even know they are ignorant. i don't have any answers. i'm not sure anyone else does either. turn off the tv, that would be a good place to begin.

i got kicked off of facebook!!



it's true.i was having such a good time on facebook doing the social thing. hooking up. hanging out. having funny as only us old gals can. had me a superpoke pet named elvis and a rockyou pet named precious. had just attained level 218 and earned a golden throne in mafia wars. beginning to get really bored with my farm, but still visiting it every day and giving gifts to folks.i went to louisiana to gamble and took my laptop so i could bank my over 20k hourly earnings in mafia wars and keep up with all the other things that need daily attention. first night i fired up via the inroom hookup and got the message that my account had been disabled.they say i violated the terms of service. they don't offer any real explanation of what crime i allegedly committed, but they did offer a link to their tos and supposedly a way to appeal my "conviction".i sent them email right away and said i was pretty sure i hadn't done anything wrong. actually i wrote nicely twice, and i'm still waiting to be reinstated or at least an explanation for my crime(s).i've done a lot of pondering during the past 7 days of forced facebook inactivity trying to figure out what happened.i've come up with a couple of possibilities and one is that i was getting too good in mafia wars. i had 3737 family members and didn't see nearly as many red notations on my player stats as i had in the beginning. i was dumping ineffective weapons on my sil's account as he never used it anyway. since i'd earned the golden throne i was generating energy faster and would of been able to complete jobs quicker to level up.i also got crosswise with one of the "groups" of pompous little pissants that cling together ostensibly to help one another from attacks by "bullies", when they in fact become bullies in their own right. when it dawned on me what i was involved in and the constant barrage of unsolicited emails advising us to attack so-and-so, i bowed out of the group. i thought they'd have no hard feelings about my choice, but now i'm not so sure. let me be clear, i have no proof, but all a person has to do is accuse someone of something and you can get kicked off!there was also the matter of the photo. my daughter thinks the photo(s) of myself with guns (oh, the horror of it all!) might of been what had me tossed. if that is the case with "face", i'm beyond stunned. you'd of thought they'd give me a warning on something like that, but then again, it's their game, their rules and their power. might makes right just about any where on the planet.i'm probably going to end up rejoining under another email address. i'll have to start over in mafia wars and i'm not happy about that, but at least this time i'll know what not to do in order to advance quickly and painlessly through the ranks.  i'll never trust them though to not just pull the plug when and if they see fit. i'll never buy anything ever again to improve my character and that goes double for my farm and any of the pets or other applications. i'm hanging my head in shame to admit that i ever did spend money on this crap. what was i thinking!!mafia wars is fun. it's a great stress buster too. i'm going back in just to keep playing.facebook is two faced. on the one face they say they are a social network and they encourage you to invite everyone you know to join you there. the truer face though says you can't send out email to people you don't know, you can't send out more email than xx, you can't write too much on your wall or anyone else's. you don't know you are in "trouble" until a pink box pops up and then they don't tell you that you should cease and desist for days if not weeks in order to appease the godnobs.i'm too old for this shit.for awhile there i thought i'd have a t-shirt made. it would be, of course, red and on the front would be:i'm 66 years old and i got kicked off of facebook!and on the back.......and i don't even know why!i decided it was foolish to spend the money for the shirt. so i've appeased my hurt feelings by blogging about it here instead.i feel better now after regurgitating it all in the blog too. at least here i've never had a worry about getting in trouble for being myself.

how true!

those easiest to disarm are the responsible and law abiding citizens whose guns represent no meaningful social problem. irresponsible and criminal owners, whose gun possession creates or exacerbates so many social ills, are the ones most difficult to disarm.
