odihr legislative support
osce office for democratic institutions and human rights (odihr) supports participating states by reviewing their law-making systems and relevant draft and existing legislation









law-making assessments
odihr provides, upon request, assessments of the legislative processes within individual participating states. these assessments look at a country’s procedures and mechanisms for preparing, drafting and adopting legislation, as well as for monitoring of its implementation. both the legislative framework and the actual law-making practice are examined and analyzed, through a combination of desk research and other methods, such as country visits, interviews and surveys.
