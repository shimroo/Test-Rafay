national missing persons coordination centre stakeholder forum
the national missing persons coordination centre (nmpcc) hosted its first stakeholder engagement forum in recent years which provided non-government organisations (ngos) and families of missing persons the opportunity to share their views and perspectives on improving our collective efforts to respond to missing persons. the event, held on 20 september 2024, was attended both in person in canberra and virtually by interested parties from around the country. ‘engaging with stakeholders provides us with the victim survivor voice which is critically important to ensure we're building something relevant to the community,’ said commander joanne cameron, who chaired the event. powerful and emotive roundtable discussions highlighted the importance of the continued communication between law enforcement and the families of the long-term missing, through periodic updates and social media.stakeholders provided valuable insights and suggestions to improve the language and cultural awareness in educational campaigns and tools which support families navigating the process of reporting a loved one missing.the program commenced with a presentation by commander helen schneider from the australian centre to counter child exploitation on their successful strategies to achieve greater community outcomes through partnerships with stakeholders and ngos.commander cameron concluded the event with an update on project restore, a forensics command initiated project to continue to provide specialist forensic capabilities to support policing partners in missing persons and unidentified remains, and related complex criminal investigations. this project will combine the specialist capabilities and consolidate them alongside nmpcc and disaster victim identification to continue to generate investigative leads and resolve enduring long term missing persons cases.this forum, which will be the first in a series conducted as part of the consultation phase of project restore, was a powerful step in supporting those most affected by someone missing. this embeds the nmpcc mission to continue to reduce the incidence and impact of missing persons in australia.

nmpcc x act dog team 





nmpcc x act dog team 
the national missing persons coordination centre (nmpcc) interviewed canine handler, leading senior constable peter hockings and his canine rogue, to learn about how the act dog team/afp general purpose team assists in the search and rescue of missing persons.when a member of the public is reported as missing, members from the afp general purpose team will respond. “in the event that we're required to use a dog to locate and track a person who is missing, we are one of the first teams to respond to such an event, especially if it's a young child or an older elderly member of the community”. the afp general purpose team currently has 5 general purpose dogs that are deployed in the act region as well as nationally and internationally to help bring loved ones home.leading senior constable hockings explained how their canine partners assist in search and rescue missions and how environmental factors, such as high winds, can influence a canine's ability to track scents. wind can disperse odours, making it more challenging for dogs to follow a direct trail. “our dogs may not necessarily track and locate odour where the person walked, but the wind may have pushed the odour off to one side. so that's where the dog will be working when the odour pool is the strongest”.the nmpcc and the afp general purpose team are dedicated to continuing to assist in the search and location efforts for those who are missing.please see the full interview below:

why do people go missing?





why do people go missing?
recently we ran a social media series exploring the reasons people went missing and what they were feeling and experiencing at the time. anyone, regardless of gender, age, ethnicity or educational background may become a missing person. the reasons for going missing are many and varied and can include mental illness, miscommunication, misadventure, domestic violence, and being a victim of crime.  the unique reasons featured in the series offer some perspective into the different reasons people go missing, but also serve as a reminder that we never know what someone is going through and to consider how we could support someone at risk of going missing. if you know someone who is struggling or at risk of going missing, find information about how you can support them here: www.missingpersons.gov.au search @afpnmpcc on facebook, instagram and x (twitter) to see the full series.

national missing persons week 2023: can you solve the case?





national missing persons week 2023: can you solve the case?
the afp is calling for australians to put on their detective hats and assist forensic investigators unpick clues that could help crack some of the nation’s longest unsolved missing persons cases.launched today for national missing persons week, which runs through 5 august, the can you solve this case? campaign is focused on eight cases involving unidentified human remains.while forensic experts continue to examine the remains, police hope the public can piece together other clues that could help match them with one of the more than 2500 long-term missing persons cases on file in australia.the afp’s national missing persons coordination centre, working with state and territory law enforcement agencies, has created an online “investigative board” to provide amateur sleuths with a detailed detective’s overview of the cases.vital clues such as clothing and objects found at the scene of the human remains and craniofacial reconstructions can be viewed in 3d animation.the craniofacial reconstruction highlights how the afp uses cutting-edge technology to continue investigating old cases.as part of its national dna program for unidentified and missing persons (program) capabilities, afp forensic specialists are able to use new tools to estimate an unidentified individual’s year of birth and death, ancestral origin, hair and eye colour, facial appearance and genetic relatives.the reconstruction used this year is from remains found in the northern territory with forensic testing conducted by the program determining the remains belonged to an aboriginal female who was older than 18, however, dna testing has revealed no database links to relatives.afp assistant commissioner hans koenderink said community members were law enforcement’s most important partners and this campaign provided them an insider’s view of the afp’s work and forensic capabilities.“this campaign capitalises on the increasing popularity of the “true crime” genre and, challenges the community to delve into the case files just like our afp forensic officers do everyday,” he said.“the afp and state and territory police forces are this year focusing on unidentified human remains cases – as they are not just case numbers but are unknown individuals who have names, families and stories that deserve to be told.“for these loved ones, living with the uncertainty about the whereabouts and safety of a loved one can be a traumatic experience that can last for weeks, months or, sadly, years.“in australia, there are 750 unidentified human remains and 2500 long-term missing persons cases.“the community plays a critical role in helping police with information that can help to solve a missing persons case.the eight unidentified persons nominated by the afp’s state and territory counterparts to be featured in this year’s campaign are located at pyrmont (nsw), leanyer (nt), the stretton wetlands (qld), king’s beach (sa), mt osmond (sa), pardoe beach (tas), the dandenong ranges (vic) and , chidlow (wa).in australia, a missing person is defined as anyone who is reported missing to police, whose whereabouts are unknown, and where there are fears for the safety or concern for the welfare of that person. a long-term missing person is someone who has been missing for more than three months.in 2022, there were over 55,000 missing persons reports made to police in australia. this is nearly 150 missing reports per day.link to all caseshttps://www.missingpersons.gov.au/national-missing-persons-week-2023national missing persons weekmembers of the community sharing their stories and support throughout nmpw 2023 are encouraged to use the hashtag #nmpw2023.media is encouraged to read the counselling framework for guidance when working with families of missing people.anyone with information relating to a missing person should contact crime stoppers on 1800 333 000.about the nmpccthe afp’s national missing persons coordination centre plays an active
