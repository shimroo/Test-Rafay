nacd’s neurodevelopmental approach





not a homeschool as you know it
nacd does not have a curriculum or a “program”, nacd draws from it’s huge toolbox to create therapeutic and education programs unique and targeted to each child and family.
because our programs are individually designed and holistic, we are able to work with newborns to adults, children who are homeschooled, formally schooled to college students, trade school students and life-long learners.
who we help

each program is based on the needs of the specific individual, not a “one size fits all” approach.

tri-annual followup assessments
we meet with you three times a year to see how you are doing & to make adjustments.

3 easy steps for successful nacd program
the nacd model of designing comprehensive individualized programs that are implemented by family and caregivers makes it possible for any family anywhere to take advantage of the latest and most advanced techniques currently available.
in addition to providing comprehensive intervention, nacd also coaches and supports families in their implementation of the nacd program. we also help oversee and coordinate all services and interventions that the family is using in order to develop a cohesive treatment and educational plan.
nacd recognizes that educational and therapeutic services in many countries are seriously lacking or even nonexistent.
nacd believes in the unlimited potential of every child and the power of daily intervention provided by those who know the child best and who really care—the family.

frequently asked questions
here are some of the questions that most people have when starting our program:

is your program the same for everyone?
no, every individual that comes in for an assessment is treated as a unique individual with their own specific needs. our program is not a “one size fits all” approach like most others.

where do i go for my evaluations?
we have many chapters around the world where we meet with families in person. if you are not able to travel to one of the physical chapters, we can work with you anywhere in the world via teleconference (zoom).

how much work does this require?
we require parents to make a significant commitment to their child’s program in order to get the best results possible. how much time depends on the needs of the specific child or individual.

how much does it cost?
the cost is different depending on where you are in the world or your set of circumstances. if you fill out our application, you will see the associated costs laid out to you and will receive a free interview where you can discuss all your specific needs. there is no cost until after your interview.

does nacd help adults too?
yes! we have helping many hundreds of adults, regardless of the situation, whether they have special needs or just want to get back on track with their goals.
