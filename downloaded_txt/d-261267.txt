(…not the “windows” one!) select the “skip iso boot” option on the following screen. this will bypass the expectation that you'll install a new operating system. once created, edit the virtual machine before booting it. import your previous virtualbox *.vdi disk image file as a new drive, which should automatically clone and convert it to the required format within utm/qemu without modifying the original source image. you may also need to uncheck the “uefi boot” option under “qemu” settings for this virtual machine in order for it to start windows.  … hopefully, after starting and an automatic subsequent reboot by windows (after detecting the environment's massive hardware configuration change from when it ran under virtualbox), you should see your windows desktop once again and then be able to migrate data via your host system to its new arm-targeted virtual machine counterpart! after migrating and verifying everything, i personally just shut down and deleted my x86 windows virtual machine, because the arm version runs so much faster natively by comparison.  🐌    tags:  #apple #mac #windows #software  comment  have something to say? inbox me:   inbox+virtualbox-to-m1-mac-utm-arm-qemu-2022-07-02@benguild.com select conversation bits may be published below for other readers.       next post ►   regarding perception and dreaming… excerpt from the four agreements by don miguel ruiz: what you are seeing and hearing right now is nothing but a dream. you are dreaming right now in this moment. you are dreaming with the brain awake. dreaming is the main function...          inbox (1) — write a new comment…? ⚑       '24/355 17:57 utc darren lloyd wrote:    i just wanted to say thanks. the how to boot virtualbox x86 images stepsworked perfectly and now i can boot my copy of volvo diagnostics tools forwhen i need to look up how to fix something on my car in a pinch!    reply         popular posts — view more past posts…? ★  ⋯      ／ copyright © '02-2025  ben guild ／ privacy policy ／
