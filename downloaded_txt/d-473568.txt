i am currently head over heels in preparing my very first art portfolio and because of ios way of cataloguing the camera roll – (i work with 3 devices each with its own directory) – i collated new work in individual folders as back up..

from 55k down to 10k just for my ipad pro. still got 7k+ from iphone + ipad mini to sort after the 10k are done. view my art feed.
so for now – i am minimizing my editorial activities to a strict minimum.
netdiver mag is on hiatus.
