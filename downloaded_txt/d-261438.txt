voices from our congregation
















































































 



who we areecmccs has a 51-year history of being seattle’s queerest spiritual home. thousands of folx have come into community with us over these five decades in search of a place where they can be fully themselves and seek the sacred without judgment. we are fully progressive in our spiritual journeys, following the teachings of jesus of nazareth, as found in the canonical gospels of the bible, as well as in other sources outside of the canon. we do not affirm any bible as inerrant or infallible. we take historical-critical biblical scholarship seriously, meaning that we read all scriptures in the context in which they were written.we find deep meaning in allegorical readings of the scriptures. we also read the scriptures through the lenses of queer, womanist, poc liberation, post-colonial, and like theologies. our understanding of the divine is also informed by new thought / metaphysical teachings. ecmccs is a place to heal from religious trauma caused by congregations and denominations that deny the truth, humanity, and dignity of lgbtq+ folx and other marginalized peoples. we recognize the difficult process of deconstructing harmful religion, and we seek to help one another through it. if you are actively deconstructing or seeking to deconstruct, ecmccs is a safe space to do so without judgment- really! we have no hidden agenda to make you adhere to any dogma. our only aim is to help remove blocks to the awareness of love’s presence. check out our deconstruction/reconstruction program here.if there is any salvation, it is in being saved from loneliness, degradation, and despair. if there is any meaning in christ, it is in the way he lived, his solidarity with us in our sufferings, and in our hope for a more just and peaceful world. come ‘try us on for size’ in-person and online. you are truly and fully welcome just as you are, no strings attached!
