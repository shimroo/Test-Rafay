papa smurf
papa smurf is the wisest, oldest, and bravest smurf of all, the big cheese, the one the others all look up to. he is 542 years old, and he can change tacks and find a solution to every situation, even as the smurfs are continually challenging and testing the rules. papa smurf can do magic, and he keeps a laboratory where he creates potions for a variety of uses.









smurfette
smurfette is smart, curious, brave, and enterprising, always ready to take part in new adventures. originally, smurfette was crafted by gargamel as a plan to destroy the smurfs just by being a girl. then papa smurf worked his magic and turned smurfette into a lovely, loving smurf and an important member of the clan.









brainy
brainy smurf thinks he’s smarter than he really is, and he is certain that he’s smarter than everyone else. this is a smurf who does not suffer from self-doubt. brainy considers himself the most responsible member of the band and has proclaimed himself the right-hand man to papa smurf. he loves to talk, and he is often repeating phrases such as, like papa smurf always says… or papa smurf is always right, and when he says that… the other smurfs just roll their eyes and find inventive ways to shut him up.









hefty
hefty is naturally extra strong, and he believes that with great power comes great responsibility. his bulging muscles make him feel protective of and responsible for his fellow band of smurfs, even if they don’t believe they need protecting. he’s the straight guy. also, he has a quick temper and can be a hothead, jumping into action without thinking things through and creating his own brand of chaos.









jokey
for jokey, every day is april fool’s day—and why shouldn’t it be? “who doesn’t like a good joke?” is his motto. like the class clown who is always on, jokey is continually trying out gags and pratfalls. jokey’s all-time favorite gag is a gift box that explodes in the recipient’s face. he can’t get enough of playing that trick. and even though the other smurfs know what he’s up to, they still can’t avoid it. that infernal box always ends up in someone’s hands!









handy
the smurfs’ very own leonardo da vinci or elon musk, handy is a builder and extremely creative inventor. this is the guy you call to fix anything—his ears are always alert to the sound of a dripping faucet, which he’ll repair in a flash. an original thinker, he’s continually mulling over new inventions. he’s an optimist, believing that every problem has a solution, and that he can build it.









storm
the fiercest female smurf, storm is an expert markswoman, an outstanding athlete, brave as can be, and as tough as nails. she loves to challenge hefty and show off how strong and agile she is. storm is not the least bit touchy-feely and has no patience for the mushy stuff – except when it comes to kittens. at times, she can be rather abrasive. that said, she is extremely loyal and protective of her friends.









gargamel
gargamel is a conniving, evil human wizard, driven by a desire for riches and power as well as a bottomless thirst to capture smurfs. this fixation started long ago when he dreamed of putting a smurf into his cauldron to make a philosopher’s stone, which turns lead into gold. after being repeatedly frustrated and humiliated by the smurfs, his preoccupation has hardened into an obsession. he is the greatest threat to the smurfs’ existence, but they are also lucky in that gargamel is sloppy and tends to overreach in his ambition, creating super-complicated traps and outrageous strategies for catching them.









azrael
azrael the cat is gargamel’s sole companion and confidant. he has been stuck with him ever since he was a kitten. he understands what is said to him, and is very, very smart—maybe even more so than his master. but like any cat, he doesn’t listen to his master, because he knows better. gargamel can be very talkative, but it’s all just white noise to him. azrael’s greatest loyalty is to himself, and his goals are always selfish, so we can never really guess how he will act or where his interests will lie.









willow
the girls’ leader and the female equivalent of papa smurf.  she’s the matriarch, someone the girls trust and look up to. and for good reason. she’s wise, strong, brave, and funny. she knows the secrets of nature and the properties of every kind of plant. she can even communicate with them! unlike papa smurf, willow is more like a shaman than an alchemist.she has a lighter side too and she loves to tease papa smurf. without a doubt, her favorite pastime is playing dominoes. and nobody dares challenge her because she’s just too good !









blossom
blossom is the cheerleader, overflowing with positive energy. she’s incredibly talkative, energetic, even exhausting. blossom gets excited about everything and shows it, bouncing around and talking a mile a minute. she says whatever crosses her mind without thinking first, which can be inappropriate, but also very funny. she is a great friend and adores meeting new people.









lily
lily is very smart and rational, never acts without thinking something through, and has little time for silliness. lily is quieter than the other girls, but when she speaks, she means it. she tells it like it is and pulls no punches. she’s one of the few girls who can calm storm down when something – or someone – has gotten her riled up.









grouchy
long ago —so long ago that nobody can remember— grouchy smurf was a more-orless normal smurf. but he never got over the incident when a bzz fly attacked the smurfs. every single day since then, grouchy wakes up on the wrong side of the bed and mutters to himself about all the things he hates. but who knows what else goes on in his mind? because occasionally, when nobody is looking, he exhibits a secret love for something, like flowers.









farmer
it’s thanks to farmer smurf that chef’s meals are so good. how delicious can a cake be if the ingredients aren’t the best? he’s in charge of growing and harvesting all the food the smurfs eat, and he takes his job very seriously, always talking to his crops to help them grow. pumpkin, you’re perfectly round! no matter whom he’s talking to, he does it in a fun, “farming flavored” language.









clumsy & dimwitty
clumsy can’t cross a room without falling flat on his face. he is constantly dropping things and tripping over his own feet. despite the chaos he’s creating, it’s impossible to be angry with clumsy for long. he might be the most sensitive, kind, and empathetic smurf of all.
dimwitty is so dumb, he’s too dim to realize how dumb he actually is. but when it comes to doing chores, dimwitty is tireless! he’s full of goodwill and would be the most useful smurf in the land if only he weren’t so darned stupid.
the two heroes are forming an “explosive” firemen team. to the rescue!









and many more …
blue and small, standing only three apples high, the smurfs might be hard to tell apart at first. however, each smurf is a distinct individual with his or her own personality —their names say it all.
let’s smurf!
