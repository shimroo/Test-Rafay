faq's


can i try a class before committing?
definitely. before you start a course, we highly recommend you purchase our 8 class intro offer which will give you 5 classes for $49 to use over 14 days. it's a great way to get a taste of what our classes are like and what's involved. for more information about our intro offer visit our new divas page.



do i need to book a class beforehand?
yes you do. we operate on a one person per apparatus policy, so please ensure that you book your class prior to arriving.



do i have to wear heels?
nope! heels are 100% optional. all of our classes can be done barefoot! we wear hells in pole classes for a few reasons. they look amazing, they help with dance technique and more importantly , they actually make tricks like climbing the pole easier as they are made from a sticky material that helps you grip the pole! but most of our beginners start barefoot so there is no need to bring heels unless you want to.



what do i wear to classes?
for pole classes we recommend shorts, crop top, singlet or t-shirt.
for aerial classes we suggest leggins, socks, crop to, singlet or t-shirt.



can i come to classes if i have an existing injury?
give our friendly desk divas a call at your local studio and have a chat with us to discuss.
we do recommend speaking to our staff first depending on the seriousness of the injury.



can i do classes as a beginner?
of course you can! there is no pre-requisite to give pole or aerial classes a go. just a willingness to try something new and fun! many people think they need to be strong to start classes but i'll let you in on a littel secret, our students get strong from doing classes ;)
