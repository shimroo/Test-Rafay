accidentally amy





this is an absolutely delightful read!  there are so many occasions that rom-coms go south by becoming too silly but this hits a perfect tone between lust and play.  the banter is delightful and i was totally in by page 3.  no having to slog through the first chapter or two waiting for a meet cute after some angsty brain burn by the first character. i definitely have put this book on the recommend pile and buy a copy for your bestie list. going to look through this author's back catalogue immediately. #lynnpainterbooks #accidentallyamy #netgalley @berkleyromance #berkley

summer and fall reads for 2024





 a few really good reads have made their way to my desk in the last few months.  i'm excited to say that some publishing houses have started sending out physical copies of review books again, that really went away during the initial covid shutdowns and many have remained firmly in the earc arena, which is not really my happy place. so i'm sharing below some great physical arcs i've received and then one earc.  two of these are not coming out until november, but both would be holiday gifts, so keep that in mind!  the first picture is the most adorable book i've received in a while. i really didn't want to undo the ribbon to get to the really fabulous and fun sounding story - a bit of a cozy mystery set in a scottish castle!  (ribbon and sheep now set aside as a christmas tree ornament!)so the rundown here is: willig, williams and white - the trio with 4 previous books to their name comes out with the author's guide to murder - out in novemberthe bone keeper by luca vesta - out this summer.  scary stories told to youths perhaps coming true in the woods!not in love by ali hazelwood - out now.  note - while many have said her books resemble each other quite a bit, this is different and she describes is as more of an erotic book then rom-com. storm warning by david bell - out this summer. one island, one hurricane, one murderer!a very bad thing by j.t. ellison - out in november.  we all like to think we know the authors we love to read......but do we really?day-dreamer by susie tate - out now.  susie writes real characters, which means sometimes you don't like them very much, but trust me - they all grow on you!enjoy your summer/fall reading!!!  :)willig, williams and white - the author's guide to murderveste, hazelwood, bell and ellisonsusie tate - day-dreamer

christa comes out of her shell - spotlight





christa
 comes out of her shell
by abbi waxmani loved the smart and snarky conversations in this novel.  it was an interestingly different novel that caught my attention from the first chapter and kept it all the way through.  i do recommend this book!

after the chaos of her 
adolescence, christa liddle is content to stay isolated, both 
figuratively and literally. she has the job of her dreams studying sea 
snails in the middle of the indian ocean, a profession
 that keeps her far away from people and her past. but with one fateful 
phone call, her tranquil existence is thrown into chaos. her once-famous
 father—long thought dead after a plane crash—is alive, and he wants to 
make amends. christa is forced to abandon
 her snails (for now), and head home.
the unexpected reunion 
not only puts christa’s life into a frenzy, but it catches the attention
 of the world, putting her and her entire family under the spotlight. as
 if that weren’t enough, christa meets up with
 an old childhood friend and sparks fly. maybe they can be together… 
after all the buzz surrounding her father dies down. but when her 
father’s story starts to form cracks, things start to feel much too 
complicated for a woman who’s been trying for years to
 avoid losing control. 

with everything falling 
apart around her, christa fears she will lose herself, her potential 
relationship, and—most importantly—her beloved sea snails. (berkley trade paperback original; april 16, 2024)

nowhere like home - out today!





 come on......... join us........... it'll be fun..._________________________________________in nowhere like
 home (out february
 20, 2024) everyone has secrets to keep buried...and a child to protect them from. set
 on a 'mommune'—a unique community for single mothers in search of sisterhood—this thriller brings the old phrase "it takes a village" to a whole new, terrifying level. 



fans of laura hankin, carola lovering, and caroline kepnes will enjoy nowhere
 like home's pulsing psychological suspense and edge-of-your-seat thrills.  a
 sharp examination of complex female friendships, the pressures of 
motherhood, and trauma—this book scratches every itch and will keep you 
guessing up until the very last pages. nowhere
 like home is such well-woven mystery that as soon as one thread is revealed, readers can’t help but chase them all down.

 
years
 ago, rhiannon disappeared without a trace. apparently, now she's living
 in a mothers-only community called halycon in middle-of-nowhere
 arizona. when lenna gets a call from rhiannon out of the blue with an 
exclusive invitation to halycon, lenna decides to go (new baby in-tow) 
and hopefully repair her relationship with rhiannon. but as her cell 
service grows weaker and the arizona heat swells,
 lenna starts second-guessing her plan. plus, she has to contend with 
the many halycon rules: no outside phone calls, no questions about 
people’s past, and frustratingly, no disposable diapers. not to mention 
the padlock on the gate... #sarashepard #nowherelikehome #commune #dutton

no road home





a wild ride!  definitely an "outside the box" story.  this story has a 
full house of quirky - and rather frightening  - characters.  toby is a 
completely different type of mc, you're never quiet sure if he's vacant 
eye candy or someone with very high intelligence.  he certainly has 
enough "locked doors" in his mind to keep you wondering what goes on 
behind those eyes!july 2024 #atriabooks #netgalley #noroadhome #johnfram
