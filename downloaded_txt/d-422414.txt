welcome to nightguide san francisco! your guide to nightlife for the greater san francisco area.

from ballet and opera to irish pubs, piano bars, hipster hangouts, and died-in-the-wool dives, san francisco boasts a phenomenal assortment of after-dark entertainment, often on the colorful side. after all, san francisco is the home of bimbo's 365 club, launched in 1931 on market street pouring gin into coffee cups (while patrons gazed at girls swimming nude in a fish tank behind the bar), and holding forth since 1951 on columbus avenue, now drawing crowds with rock and jazz. overall, the range stretches from avant-garde and expensive to basic budget.

neighborhoods often provide a key: nob hill translates to upscale hotel bars and high-rise lounges with eye-popping views, whereas north beach is known more for strip clubs and historic beatnik bars. union square and the financial district boast harry denton's starlight room on the sir frances drake hotel's 21st floor, the bubble room for champagne, chocolate and caviar by candlelight, and biscuits and blues, for live bluesy music. soma, otherwise known as the south of market area, hosts stylish restaurants, theaters, galleries and hot clubs.  the castro district and polk street attract gays and lesbians with some of the city's most popular eateries and watering holes, while alternative youth congregate at mission district and on haight street, despite increasing gentrification. fisherman's wharf is a favorite nocturnal hangout, with places like the buena vista, dating to 1916 when it was a boardinghouse, and knuckles historical sports bar and grill, a vibrant spot in the hyatt for aficionados of memorabilia. of course, there's no need to be on dry land to revel in san francisco at night, since the city by the bay offers plenty of waterborne fun including dinner-dance cruises under the stars.

dress, for the most part, is casual in san francisco nightspots, although it's never out of place to be stylish, even with jeans and jackets. saloons tend to close between midnight and 2 a.m., although after-work bars in the financial district often stop serving earlier.
