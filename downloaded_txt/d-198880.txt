salisbury steak with onion gravy #sundaysupper
by anne papina on march 8, 2015



do you find this weird? is it strange that one day, out of no where, a recipe lands in your inbox again? embedded in a post that plows ahead as if there had been no lapse at all? happy sunday, because that’s where we are!â  when i found out my peeps over at the #sundaysupper movement were hosting a retro event, i decided to jump right back in. heather over at hezzid’s cooks and books is hosting, and i’m bringing the ultimate retro comfort food–salisbury steak with onion gravy–along with a tale that begins with the civil war, detours through richard simmons’ anatomy asylum, and ends with the recipe right here on this page. ok, maybe things are getting a little weird. 😉

breakfast sausages with apples & riesling #sundaysupper
by anne papina on august 22, 2014



where oh where has summer gone? weekends at the lake (or lounging around the pool), soaking in the rays, cycling about with no particular place to go, grilling anything and everything that comes your way, sipping on a chilled glass of wine surrounded by tiki torches–this is summer. with labor day fast approaching, we scramble to seek out that one last hurrah before summer ends. fortunately, the sunday supper movement and gallo family vineyards have collaborated to bring you an array of tempting wine-infused dishes to end your summer on a sweet, fruity note. for this party, i’m whipping up these savory breakfast sausages with caramelized apples and a splash of riesling.

refrigerator pickles #sundaysupper
by anne papina on august 10, 2014



when i was a young cook, i fancied myself mastering things such as yeast breads, summer preserves, and berry pies, delicacies that required time and patience to prepare. i envisioned a kitchen lined with blue ribbons from county fairs, living in a place where my preserves were recognized at least three towns over. silly dreams of a city girl, and the truth is time constraints lead me to shortcuts every day, especially in the kitchen. for this week’s #sundaysupper, we’re going to slow things down and preserve the bounty this season brings. stacy from food lust people love and tara over at noshing with the nolands are hosting this week’s event, and i’ve got a quick and easy pickle recipe that you’re going to love.

nona’s potato salad #sundaysupper
by anne papina on may 17, 2014



when it comes to food, nothing epitomizes comfort more so than the potato. whether mashed, hashed, home fried, deep fried, baked with or without obscene amounts of cheesy, creamy goodness, the potato reigns supreme. with picnic and barbecue season just around the corner, potato salads are prime to take center stage. so, when the sunday supper movement teamed up with the idaho potato commission for a potato salad extravaganza, i was all over it. i’m bringing my nona mary’s garlicky good potato salad, and when you scroll down below, you’ll find a total of 20 variations of that dish we all adore.
