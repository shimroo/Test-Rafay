caladiums are a tropical plant grown from bulbs (tubers) that originated in the amazon basin.  as caladiums are becoming better known to the pot producers and landscapers they are discovering that they are easy to grow and maintain.  caladiums do require regular watering and grow well in the same environment as impatiens.
