welcome to my colorful world of fiber art and quilts!i'm debbie jones, from albuquerque, new mexico.my lifelong passion for fabric has evolved from fashion design into art quilts, fabric collage and now ... fiber fusion. wisps of unspun fibers (silk, wool, bamboo and more) are bonded together to create lustrous fiber fusion "fabric" that is stitched into many of my art quilts ... or i shape it while wet to make 3-d vessels. recently, i've been painting fibers and unique fabrics directly on upcycled glass vases. fairy lights inside give a beautiful glow at night.â these days, my studio is a colorful explosion of fiber and fabric, dyes and supplies, all in the joyful creation of fiber vessels, art quilts and more. always breaking the rules by asking "what if?", i'm a fiber art rebel with more ideas than time!please take a look around to see examples of this distinctive art form and let me know if you're interested in purchasing my work or commissioning me for a custom design. your comments would be most welcome.thanks for stopping by my website -- i hope you enjoy your visit!debbie1homeabout debbieartclasses/lecturesschedulefabricstorestudent gallerycontact me"consider the lilies" â  â  â  â  â  fabric landscape collage â  â  â  â  â  25"x31"â "enchanted ocean" â  â  â  â  â  â  fabric seascape collage â  â  â  â  â  â 19"x30"â all content and images on this website areâ copyrighted by debbie jones, 2005-2024.all rights reserved.please do not copy any content or use these images in any way unless you haveâ in any way, unless you have first obtainedâ written permission from debbie. â thank you.~~~ for the latest news, please scroll down. ~~~debbie jonesalbuquerque, nmphone: 505-362-2675email: debbie@debbiejones.comnews:happy to announce that i've been selected as a guest artist with the sandia heights studio art tour here in albuquerque, september 7th and 8th. preview shows are held in august at gallery abq and at the albuquerque support, along with a display at the tramway event center ongoingly, visitâ www.sandiaheightsartists.comâ for details.stay tuned, iâm working on some new things to share and i'll post them here. thank you so much for your interest my my art and techniques!facebooki'm on facebook, and would enjoy being friends with you there! it's a great way to keep in touch and get the very latest up-to-the-minute news. just click the link at the top of this page, or here:http://www.facebook.com/debbiejonesart.newsletterif you would like to receive my occasional email newsletter, pleaseâ email meâ your name, email address, and city/state.â (i'll never share or sell this info to anyone, ever, promise!â you can opt out of the newsletters anytime, confidentially.)lots of fun things are in the planning stages! please check back soon for the latest updates.contact mefiber fusion landscapefiber fusion landscape, made with silk and bamboo fibers on glass.close-uptechnique: the 5"x7" glass was removed from the frame and cleaned. then i painted loose fibers (silk and bamboo) directly to the glass in very thin layers using a fine art varnish, allowing time to dry between layers. up close, you can see the individual fibers which remain soft and textured but firmly attached. love the rich colors! i'm experimenting further with this idea and made one of these with fibers on both sides of the glass, a reversible landscape that can easily be turned around in the frame. it's like two landscapes in one! more photos coming soon.website designed at homestead™ list your business for free
