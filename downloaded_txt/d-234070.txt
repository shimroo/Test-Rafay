testimonials





my husband and i went on a white water rafting trip down the lower gorge this summer! we had the time of our lives! i’m scared to go on roller coasters, yet i loved every bit of this trip. the guides were funny and enthusiastic! i just knew we had to come back again in the fall!

we went for a bachelorette party (on dam release weekend!!) it was wonderful. super fun, knowledgeable staff & management! definitely going again. after the trip they had a camp fire w/smores & a bar! i’ve gone with other companies in the past but will absolutely go w/pocono whitewater again!
