about
         this book
         nearly all of the survivors of a traumatic head injury and
         their families with whom i have worked have had one
         complaint: there is nothing written that explains head
         injury in clear, easy to understand language. most say the
         available material is too medical or too difficult to read.
         the goal of this online book is to better prepare the head
         injured person and family for the long road ahead. see our
         table of
         contents
         below.
publication
         history
         this online book came from materials that i wrote for my
         patients and their family members. i basically used a copy
         machine and gave copies away for free. this book became very
         popular and over a thousand copies have been given out. it
         costs about $6 to copy the book another $3 to $4 to mail to
         people. the costs and time to send the books got out of
         hand. i decided not to publish the book. few people would
         have access to the material and i would not be able to
         "update" or improve the material easily. using the internet,
         anyone with a computer could access this information. it is
         my sincere hope that the internet version of my book would
         help the greatest number of people. go to each chapter
         heading and click on it. use your web browser to print any
         information that you find helpful. there is no charge for
         the information you copy.
internet
         publishing costs
         i need your help. if any of this information is helpful to
         you, i am asking for a small donation. developing this site
         (i have to pay someone to design the web page), monthly
         charges, and adding new information is costly. if you have
         $5 (cash or check in us currency), send it to me at the
         above address. don’t have $5, even $2 would help. if a
         miracle happens and this online book becomes a success, it
         will encourage other professionals to provide similar
         services. it’s up to you to encourage or discourage
         this type of service for people with a head injury. if you
         don’t have money to send, no problem. i just hope this
         book helps you.
lectures
         if time permits, i do lecture to head injury groups. if this
         web site generates addition money beyond my costs, i would
         be willing to use additional funds to cover my travel
         expenses for lectures. e-mail me at debglen@yahoo.com
         if you are interested.
