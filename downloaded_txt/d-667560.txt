national poetry month 2023


april 01, 2023
       in art/literature/poetry, poetry





“if poetry represents, as ezra pound maintained, ‘the most concentrated form of verbal expression,’ it achieves its characteristic concision and intensity by acknowledging how words have been used before. poems do not exist in isolation but share and exploit the history and literature of the language in which they are written. although each new poem seeks to create a kind of temporary perfection in and of itself, it accomplishes its goal by recognizing the reader’s lifelong experience with words, images, symbols, stories, sounds, and ideas outside of its own text. by successfully employing the word or image that triggers a particular set of associations, the poem can condense immense amounts of intellectual, sensual, and emotional meaning into a single line or phrase.”dana gioia in can poetry matter?, “the poet in the age of prose”, p 221.

       in music, video





dude, this video. watch it through. it's not just an amazing song. lyrics below the video if you want to follow along. 



are we the ones left behindby those who weave cords that bindthey draw the marrow from our very bonesand we in-turn turn on our ownstood in line in horse-hair shirtswe cued up to eat the dirtwe traded lumps on narrow streetsand bite the hand when you've no teethand it's a standing ovation for the shadow of a stoneas we dig into the soil beneath our homesthe future's further day by day, as our father's turn awayand he was clinging to a mother who eats her ownthe granite gaze upon us nowa skulking mass recalling howto plant a secret and tell no liesfor now we own those same-stone eyesand it's the last gasp of wonder for a cretin on a throneas our daughters sneak away across the phonethe future's just a thing we say to keep the sordid past at bayand still we cling onto the mother who eats her ownwe are the ones left behindin swaddling bound with baling twinethey stole the marrow from our very bonesand we in-turn turn on our own

misterwives - "reflections"


july 25, 2017
       in music





i'm testing the idea that listening to a song too much makes you eventually get sick of it. so far, i'm failing.my daughter discovered misterwives recently and said i might like them. as a snobby audiophile i clucked my tongue, listened with arms crossed, and then listened again and again and again. now i'm almost dancing in my seat at my coworking office and avoiding eye contact.check out misterwives - "reflections." they have a newer album, but this song from a couple of years ago is my jam right now...

christian wiman has been through a lot. and good poetry often stems from what tastes like poisoned ground. from every riven thing, enjoy "small prayer in a hard wind."

"cold little heart" - michael kiwanuka


march 13, 2017
       in music





there are a few times every year that i hear of a good music review and check out an album and become entranced. michael kiwanuka has done that to me with his album love & hate. only $5 to download, or enjoy on a streaming service you use. here's the song i can't stop playing, "cold little heart." the opening is 6 1/2 minutes long and then it gets into the song and i never want the opening to end, and then it does, and i'm so glad because it's this whole other thing. what an epic this is. hope you enjoy it.

best albums of 2016

       in music















i've been pretty busy this year, so i have a long list i could give but i don't feel like i've listened deeply enough to do 30 albums justice. but i can give you five that i think are the bees' knees. my lists all the way back to 2006 are below. enjoy! and please let me know your favorites!5. pinegrove - cardinal4. frank ocean - blonde3. slow dakota - the ascension of slow dakotachrist-haunted. literary. curious. playful. mindful.try: "i am held together"2. car seat headrest - teens of denialpunky. can rock hard, but driven by lyrics. wonderfully honest and provoking lyrics.try: "drunk drivers/killer whales"1. bon iver - 22, a millionhands down, the bestest of the bestest. yeah, i know, it's quirky and weird and whatever. it's almost perfect as work of art depicting the messy clamor through darkness and struggle in the search for something more. it's longing and wanting and waiting and a whole bunch of things that should make the thoughtful listener think and seek alongside vernon. it's the kind of spiritual pursuit that i want from art. it's not easy. but it's really good.try: 33 "god" | full concert previous years -- best albums2015 | 2014 | 2013 | 2012 | 2011 | 2010 | 2009 | 2008 | 2007 | 2006

how my family wishes me happy birthday


november 10, 2016
       in family





when my kids or my wife have a birthday, i stay up the night before until they are in bed and then i hang up streamers and sometimes other decorations in the kitchen and living room. i've been doing it for years because my wife tells me to and because i'm tall enough to do it without any help. it's a neat tradition, to awaken on your birthday and have a festive house just for you. today is my birthday and this is what i got...and it proves how much my family understands my sense of humor and how much they love me. i couldn't have smiled any wider!

       in music





bon iver's new album, 22, a million, is frontrunner for album of the year for me. this lyric video for one of my favorite tracks, "8 (circle)," is all it needs to be. provoking and confounding and grappling for something. will he find it?

after 12+ years pastoring at doxa fellowship in woodstock, illinois, i've accepted a new job working for ed stetzer and his mission group. i'll be doing work as a content strategist for mission group to help develop resources to equip the church for the mission. molly and i, along with our four kids, are very excited about this new chapter of life and ministry.our plan, god-willing, is to stay in woodstock for jack's senior year and to move near wheaton, illinois soon after that. my last sunday at doxa is this sunday, october 2nd.thanks for your prayers during our time at doxa and we ask that you might ask god to help us through this transition, for our needs as we hope to stay local for a while longer for the good of our kids, and for our church as we leave.

music discovery of 2016: slow dakota


august 04, 2016
       in music





this hasn't been a great year of music for me. maybe i'm wrong, maybe i'm getting old, maybe i'm out of touch. or maybe i haven't been looking in the right places because the new album (and last album?) by slow dakota has moved me.pj sauerteig (slow dakota) is headed to nyu law school but not before giving us a thoughtful and christ-haunted album called the ascension of slow dakota (or spotify). check out "the lilac bush" with the lyrics also posted below. wonderfully done.  



one day i came closeto giving up my ghost:i put my chin insidea mouth of knotted rope!but instead of stopping,my heart began to fly.a dove perched on my shoulderand whispered in my ear:“each day god comes homewith lilacs from his bush;he picks them all for you,his chosen darkling thrush!”

ohh ali

around 1992 the african nobel prize winning poet, wole soyinka, spoke at southern illinois university campus and i got to attend my first poetry reading as a budding poet and undergrad. after hearing of the death of muhammad ali the memory of that reading and the refrain "ohh ali, ali" from his poem "muhammad ali at the ringside, 1985" has been ringing in my ears in soyinka's remarkable voice. i want to introduce it to you. i believe this is only a part of the poem (i can't find the text online), but it's wonderful. audio download: muhammad ali at the ringsideupdate: nick roark posted the text in the comments so i added them here. thanks nick!the arena is darkened. a feast of bloodwill follow duly; the spotlights have been borrowedfor a while. these ringside prancesmerely serve to whet the appetite. gladiators,clad tonight in formal mufti, customised, milk recognition, savour the night-off, show-offrites. ill-fitted in this voyeur company,the desperate arm-wrap of the tiring heartgives place to social hugs, the slow-countone to ten to a snappy "give-me-five!"toothpaste grins replace the death-maskrubber gumshield grimaces. promiscuous peck-a-cheek supplants the maestro's peek-a-boo.the roped arena waits; an umpire tests the floor,tests whiplash boundaries of the rope.the gallants' exhibition rounds possessthese foreplay moments. gloves in silk-white sheenrout lint and leather. pack rabane rules the air.a tight-arsed soubrette checks her placard smileto sign the rounds for blood and gore.eased from the navel of bitch-mother famea microphone, neck-ruffed silver-filigree,as one who would usurp the victor's garland-- stabs the airfor instant prophesies. in cosy insulation, bathedin tele-glow, the distant homes have builttheir own vicarious rings-- the forecast claimedfour million viewers on the cable deal alone;much "bread" was loaded on the scalesat weighing hour-- till scores are settled. one will leave the fickle womb tonightsmeared in combat fluids, a broken foetus.the other, toned in fire, a dogged phoenixoblivious of the slow countdown of inner hurtswill thrust his leaden fists in airnight prince of the world of dreams.one sits still. his silence is a dying count.at last the lens acknowledges the testedhulk that dominates, even in reposethe giddy rounds of furs and diamond pins.a brief salute-- the camera is kind,discreetly pans, and masks the double-talkof medicine-men-- "has the syndromebut not the consequence." promoters, handlersit's time to throw in the towel-- parkinson's polysyllables have failed to tease a rhymefrom the once nimble louisville lips.the camera flees, distressed. but not beforethe fire of battle flashes in those eyesre-kindled by the moment's urge to centre-stage.he rules the night-space even now, bestridesthe treacherous domain with thighs of bronze,a dancing mural of delights. oh ali! ale-e-e...what music hurts the massive head tonight, ali!the drums, the tin-cans, the guitars and mbira of zaire?aa-lee! aa-lee! aa-lee bomaye! ali bomaye!the rumble in the jungle? beauty and the beast?roll-call of bum-a-month. the rope-a-dope?the thrilla in manila?-- ah-lee! ah-lee!"the closest thing to death" you said. was thatthe greatest, saddest prophesy of all? oh, ali!black tarantula whose antics hypnotise the foe!butterfly side-slipping death from rocket probesbee whose sting, unsheathed, picks the teethof the raging hippopotamus, then fansthe jaws' convergence with its flighty wings.needle that threads the snappy fangsof crocodiles, knots the tusks of elephantson rampage. cricket that claps and chirrupsround the flailing horn of the rhinoceros,then shuffles, does a bugle, tap-dances on its tip.esu with faces turned to all four compass points,astride a weather-vane; they sought to trap him,slapped the wine each time. he brings a message--all know the messenger, the neighborhood is roused--yet no one sees his face, he waits for no reply,only that combination three-four calling-card,the wasp-tail legend: i've been there and gone.mortar that goads the pestle: do you call thatpounding? the yam is not yet smooth--pound, dope, pound! when i have eaten the yam,i'll chew the fibre that once called itselfa pestle! warrior who said, i will not fight,yet proved a prophet's call-to-arms against a war.cassius marcellus, warrior, muhammad prophet,flesh is clay, all, all too brittle mould.the bout is over. frayed and split and autographed,the gloves are hung up in the hall of fame--still loaded, even from that first blaze of goldand glory. awed multitudes will gaze,new questers feast on these mementoesand from their shell-shocked remnantsre-invoke the spell. but the sorcerer is gone,the lion withdrawn to a lair of time and spaceinaccessible as the sacred lining of a crownwhen kings were kings, and lords of rhyme and pace.the enchantments is over, but the spell remains.-wole soyinka, "muhammad ali at the ringside, 1985" in the muhammad ali read, ed. gerald early (new york: harper, 1998), 227-229.
