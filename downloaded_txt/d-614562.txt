emotional blockades
emotional blockades are obstacles that prevent individuals from experiencing and expressing their emotions in a healthy and constructive way. these blockades can be caused by a variety of factors, such as past trauma, cultural or societal conditioning, negative self-talk, or a lack of emotional awareness or skills.

diamond gold rings

let’s assume you decide to get a gold ring, you must know the different colors of gold. there are three colors of gold, which are yellow gold, white gold, and rose gold. yellow gold is a warm, classic color, and goes great with a traditional, white diamond. yellow gold is usually pure or close to pure gold. white gold is only slightly warmer than platinum, and pairs well with gems of every color. rose gold is a beautiful, nontraditional option. rose gold gets its color from copper mixed with the gold. rose gold also looks great with a traditional white diamond. if you want to learn more about the best color for engagement rings in general click here.

diamonds can come in almost all colors. diamonds are classified through a scale from d to z. d diamonds are the closest to colorless of all types. the closer to z on the scale, the more the diamond will look yellow or even brown. after h, there is a noticeable yellow or brown tone to the diamond. the letters around h are both affordable and beautifully clear. diamond types around d are the most expensive, and diamonds around z are the least expensive.

the warmer gold types, like rose gold and yellow gold, can help save money when choosing which letter of diamond to choose. this is because the warmer tones can disguise some of the yellow and brownish hues. if you prefer the white gold for an engagement ring, you’ll want a diamond that is fairly close to letter d to achieve the colorless, white look.

in conclusion, the best type of rings and diamonds depend on the couples. if you do want to get a yellow gold or rose gold ring, it is recommended that you also get a diamond around h on the diamond scale. however, if you get a ring made out of white gold, you should get a diamond that is closer to d on the scale. good luck in finding your ideal engagement ring!

great lipstick tips

have you ever feel annoyed that your lipstick has worn off? or that it’s on your teeth? want to know how to get the greatest out of your lipstick? what about the kind of color to wear?  these questions will be answered below.

the primary thing to consider is the type and color of lipstick to choose. lipstick color depends on your taste such as the matte lipstick colors that would last much longer and are drier. cream lipsticks contain moisturizers and give you excellent coverage. hydrating lipsticks give you fabulous moisture and a beautiful shine. lip stains are great if you want a subtle more long-lasting color. lip glosses are shiny and fluid and usually contain the most amount of moisturizers. womens lipstick from mac is something you might want to consider.
the key to using lipstick well is using a lipstick brush. with the use of a lipstick brush, use your lipstick evenly across your lips. to load up the brush sweep the bristle gently over the top of your lipstick too. be careful not to press too hard. when it comes to applying the lipstick, simply move the brush gently across your lips, pressing gently. then fill in the corners and the beautiful lines, to make sure your full lips are covered evenly.

the great thing about using a lipstick brush is that you can control the amount of lipstick applied, give a thinner coat, and make sure that your lipstick is applied evenly. the thinner the lipstick’s coat, the longer it will last.
how to make lipstick last longer on the lips:
the trick in making your lipstick last longer is through applying a light dusting of transparent makeup powder over your lipstick. this places the lipstick and stops it from rubbing off easily. be careful to use very gentle sweeps when you are using the powder unless you can accidentally remove some of the lipstick.

how to care for your lips:
it is necessary to protect your lips from hurting from the sun. make use of a lip balm that has a right amount of spf especially if you are planning to be out in the sun. make your lips relax and speed up the skin’s renewal process using a lip exfoliate. use it every two to three weeks to maintain your lips soften and get rid of dead skin cells. minimize the application of lip liners; they bring moisture from the skin. always wear a lip balm, lipstick or lip gloss in keeping the lips moist.

stop lipstick from going on your teeth:
wrap your finger in a clean tissue once you are done applying your lipstick. insert the tissue between your lips and close your lips around the fabric. pull the wrapped finger gently from between your lips. this picks up the excess lipstick that could otherwise get blemished on your teeth.

stop the lipstick from bleeding into the lines around the lips:
you need to use a lip liner in keeping your lipstick from bleeding into the lines around the lips. so, line your entire lips with the lip liner, making sure it closely matches the color of lipstick that you are using. not only with this prevent your lipstick bleeding, but it will also allow your lipstick to last longer.
